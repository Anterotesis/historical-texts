            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am got ſafe to <hi>Dort</hi> after rough Paſſage, and have taken the firſt
Opportunity, after the compoſure of my Spirits, and a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with my intelligent Friends, to return you the moſt impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Account I can to thoſe Enquiries you gave me in Charge at
my departure; wiſhing they may be as much to your Satisfaction, as
the moſt obliging Treatment I received from you, and your other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Friends in <hi>London,</hi> and your later Correſpondences challenge
from me.</p>
            <p>At this time I ſhall endeavor to reſolve Three of your Enquiries, as
thoſe which more immediately concern you as a Member of Parliament,
leaving the Remainder to a farther Opportunity. The firſt, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
was to know what the Succeſſes of the <hi>French</hi> King's Arms
have been this Campaign. Secondly, what I have obſerved of the ſtate
of both our Countries in relation to the preſent War. And laſtly, what
Meaſures are taken by the Confederate Princes towards a Peace, or
Preparation for a more vigorous War.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, it is true the intemperate Spring, and thereby the
late opening of the Campaign, on the part of the <hi>French,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that King's ſurprizing return to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and his detaching from
hence ſo great a part of his Troops to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> put us in great hopes
that we ſhould have been able to have at leaſt made a good Defence
this Summer; yea, our States expected ſome conſiderable Victory, and
the regaining ſome Frontier Town from the <hi>French.</hi> But we have had
a fatal Diſappointment; our Statholder had very commodiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
himſelf at <hi>Park,</hi> where he could want no ſort of Supplies; we
had with great diligence fortified <hi>Huy,</hi> a Place of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
conſidering it was the only Place of ſtrength upon the <hi>Maize,</hi>
betwixt <hi>Namure</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> yet it was loſt without our being able to
make any Advances towards its relief, when our Army was in its ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52930:2"/>
Vigor and Heart; ſo that now <hi>Liege,</hi> and all that fertile Country,
and all the Circuit to <hi>Bois le Duc,</hi> lies open to the <hi>French</hi> for Forrage
and Contribution, out of which they infinitely ſtore their Magazines of
Proviſions for the next Campaign: We aſcribe it to want of Courage,
or Conduct, that we attaqued not the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> while he
was poſting himſelf to cover that Siege.</p>
            <p>But we have much more reaſon to exclaim againſt the Conduct of
detaching the Duke of <hi>Wirtenburgh</hi> to make ſo inſignificant a forcing of
the Lines, and ſending ſuch a part of our Army to <hi>Liege,</hi> at a time when
the only excuſe we make for the Loſs at <hi>Landen</hi> was the <hi>French</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering
ns in Numbers.</p>
            <p>But ſurely all wiſe Men will conſider, That as our Army was intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and our Artillery planted, we had the Advantage of Three to
One, the French having no Coverture, but were to ſtorm a Fortified
Camp with at leaſt 40, or as they own 45000 Souldiers in it; an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Succeſs ſcarce to be paralled in Hiſtory; in which Action the
World muſt own it ſelf convinced that the <hi>French</hi> conquer by Courage,
Manhood and Valour, and not by Treachery or Surprize, or inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Forces: And if our Loſſes muſt be aſcribed to the <hi>French</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbering
of the Confederates in all Places, when muſt we expect
better Succeſs? For to what Number ſoever we may vainly hope to
encreaſe our Troops, he is able to augment his proportionably; ſo that
let us ſwell to what degree ſoever our windy Imagination may ſtretch
us, we ſhall be but like the Frog to the Oxe in the Fable.</p>
            <p>But it muſt nauſeate all thinking Men to conſider, what pitiful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
both your and our Prints make to cover the Loſs we ſuſtained at
<hi>Nere Winden:</hi> They tell us, That the French were ſlain in whole Brigades
by the advantagious diſpoſal of our Cannon, and the ſmall damage we
ſuſtained by theirs, our Infantry being commanded to lie upon their
Bellies while their Cannon played; and that in fine they loſt above
20000 Men killed, or mortally wounded; yea, ſome advance the Loſs
to be double to ours, and when by Authority they publiſh theſe things,
to buoy up the Spirits of the People, they with deſign to have made us
hope for ſome after Succeſs told us, That when the Detachments
to <hi>Liege,</hi> and with the Duke of <hi>Wirtenburgh</hi> were rejoyned, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
would be ſtronger than before the Battle. From which we
may learn the truth of the old Proverb, That Lyars ought to have
good Memories; for it is well known that thoſe Detachments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52930:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to 27000 Men, as the Remarks upon the <hi>London Gazette</hi>
plainly proves.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is plain though involuntary Confeſſion, that we loſt
ſo many, and we aſcribe all this Loſs to our Statholder's Obſtinacy,
which with you is called his great Courage; that he would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to the Councel of withdrawing his Army over the River <hi>Geete</hi> in
the night: whereby all thoſe Mens Lives might have been preſerved
for future Events, as his was by a timely Retreat to ſecure his own
Perſon; which Conduct Marſhal <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> moderately cenſured, by
ſaying he now found Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> was dead. Another convincing
Argument of our Loſs, as great as I have mentioned, is eaſily gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Reſolution of our States to raiſe 25000 Men more, which
I believe they would willingly enough do, to recruit the Loſſes of the
laſt Campaign; and yet no ways increaſe their Numbers; but without
they be ſupply'd from you with Mony, I know our Paper Treaſury is
ſo low, that we are no ways able to accompliſh our Deſigns. I own
the <hi>German</hi> Princes and <hi>Switzerland</hi> might ſupply us, but we muſt pay
at leaſt 20 Dollars a Head, and they muſt be punctually paid while in
Service, or we can get no Men; for the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> raiſe no
Forces but what they ſell, as a great Branch of their Revenues, and
the Arbitrament of War and Peace depends upon the Gelt, which made
our Statholder and States to buy off the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> from the
Siege of <hi>Ratisburg,</hi> with <hi>100000l.</hi> in hand, and as much more promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be paid after. But we that know the uſage of this State know,
That that King may ſtay long enough for the latter Payment, now
that the Storm is over.</p>
            <p>But while I am mentioning thoſe Recruits, you are to conſider
what raw undiſciplined Men they will be, more fit to make Faſcines
with, than to conquer the well diſciplined Army of the <hi>French,</hi> fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſo many Victories.</p>
            <p>However the hopes of our State is, that the Rumor of ſuch a Vote
of raiſing Supplies will obtain from you proportionable Recruits, if
you be either able or willing to ſend more of your fellow-Subjects to
the Common Shambles.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, it was rational to think that after ſuch a ſucceſs
<hi>Luxemburgh</hi> would attempt either <hi>Liege</hi> or <hi>Charleroy;</hi> and if our Army
had been in ſo good a condition as our and your <hi>Gazettes</hi> would have
perſwaded the World, we had opportunity enough to have poſted our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52930:3"/>
ſelves ſo, as to have prevented the Siege; while the general Diſcourſe
even at our Statholder's Table was, as ſeveral Officers aſſure me,
that the <hi>French</hi> Army was ſo ſo haraſs'd, and weakened by the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their Men at <hi>Nere Winden,</hi> and 8000 of their wounded Men
couped up in Hoſpitals that they were able to do no more this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</p>
            <p>But to the eternal Shame of our Statholder as <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> we have
ſuffered <hi>Charleroy</hi> to be taken without once eſſaying a Relief, for we
want the Skill or Manhood to attacque an Enemy in their Trenches.
But it may be you know not what an Excuſe we make for ſuch a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
for the States had ſent a new Train of Artillery to ſupply the Loſs
at <hi>Landen,</hi> as fair Braſs Cannon as any was to be ſeen; but it ſeems, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo credulous that the Statholder had ſaved his Wagons and draught-Horſes
by his giving out he had ſent them away with his Baggage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the late Battel, they ſent no ſupply of them; ſo that too late it
was owned how great a part of thoſe were loſt. So that now we
have no manner of Excuſe why we relieved not <hi>Charleroy,</hi> but that
we wanted Wagons and draught-Horſes to furniſh a marching Army
with a ſufficient Train, and Proviſions for a few days; and ſo were
forced to ſtand in our Camp with our Arms acroſs for 20 days, till we
had notice of the Surrender of it. So that now as <hi>Huy</hi> opened a free
Paſſage to <hi>Liege;</hi> ſo this to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and the remainder of <hi>Brabant,</hi> even
to our Faſtneſſes of the united Provinces; and it is not forgot among
us how 20 years ſince in one Spring this ſo victorious King took 60
of our ſtrongeſt Towns and Forts in one Month, when he had neither
<hi>Huy Namur,</hi> or <hi>Mons,</hi> and advanced within a few Leagues of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi>
So that we have great reaſon to be apprehenſive of our eminent
Danger the next Spring, if no Peace be made this Winter; when we
are expoſed ſo naked of any Barrier in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and
conſider how untenable the ſtrongeſt places have hitherto been againſt
the force of his Aſſaults, when to conceal or cover our Impotence,
we aſcribe the Succeſſes to Treachery. Thus I have given you a ſhort
touch of this King's Succeſſes in our Parts.</p>
            <p>I paſs now to the <hi>Rhine;</hi> where 'tis notoriouſly known, how vaſt a
Magazine of Arms, Ammunition, and all ſorts of Stores were taken
at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> and though Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> had ſo ſtrongly intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
himſelf, that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> and <hi>Marſhal de Lorge</hi> thought it not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable
to attacque him, yet the <hi>French</hi> have had the honour to have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52930:3"/>
couped him up all this Summer, and the Advantage to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their whole Army in an Enemies Country, and raiſed immenſe
Contributions, which, by reaſon of the Hoſtages they have in Cuſtody,
muſt be paid, even when their Army are withdrawn into their Winter-Quarters.</p>
            <p>Of how great importance the taking of <hi>Roſes</hi> in <hi>Catalonia</hi> is, may be
ſeen even in the Monthly Account, which induſtriouſly leſſens all Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
of the <hi>French;</hi> it is not only a Port Town and Harbor towards
the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> but hath a very great Trade into <hi>Catalonia:</hi> So as
it is a Key both to Trade inward and outward; and gives not only an
Harbor to <hi>French</hi> Merchants, and Galleys, but extends likewiſe its Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
to a large part of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where it ſeems the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
ſo weak, that his Forces have not been able to take any Advantage
over the Duke of <hi>Noalles,</hi> although he detached ſome part of his Forces
to Marſhal <hi>Catinat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This leads me to give you a ſhort Account of that wiſe and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
General Marſhal <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Succeſſes, who, after he had quietly
ſuſtained all the contemptible things from all the Confederates <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zetters,</hi>
as if he were neither able to Succor <hi>Pignerol,</hi> or Relieve <hi>Cazal;</hi>
at laſt, like another <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> deſcended from the cloudy Hills
into the open Plains, and by fine Force obtained as compleat a Victory
over the unfortunate and obſtinate Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> as any hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in this War. Since which he marcheth as Conqueror where he
pleaſeth through the Country, conſtraining that Duke's Subjects to
furniſh him with all ſorts of Proviſions, and moſt large Contributions;
and the <hi>French</hi> King reſolving to puſh the War, on that ſide, either to a
Peace upon his own Conditions, or an entire Conqueſt of the Country,
hath ordered an addition of 50000 Men to the Marſhals Army,
which will much facilitate the Conqueſt of that Country, or force a
Peace.</p>
            <p>As I have given you this Account of the Succeſſes of the <hi>French</hi> King's
Arms, ſo you cannot but with me obſerve the unproſperous Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Emperour's Troops this year in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where the wily
Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> as much contemned as <hi>Catinat</hi> was, ſuffered the Duke
<hi>de Croy</hi> to lay Siege to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> the Reduction of which in one Month
our <hi>Gazettes</hi> aſſured us off: But after the Duke had loſt by Aſſaults,
Sickneſs and Death, in his march almoſt as many Thouſands of his
Men as he had been Days before it (for ſome Prints compute them at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52930:4"/>
15000 Men) the <hi>Viſier</hi> made a ſhort turn upon him, and made him
ingloriouſly quit the Siege. For excuſe of which no other than the
common one is made, That the Enemy out-numbered ours, who by
the Prints was, from 10000 Men a few days before were multiplied
to 50000. at the raiſing the Siege.</p>
            <p>You may, if you pleaſe, add to theſe the Conſideration, That ſince
this preſent War the Confederates have neither gained one Town or
Fort from the <hi>French,</hi> or preſerved any one, which his Troops attaqued
(except <hi>Rhinefield</hi>) nor been able, though that King is ſurrounded on
every ſide with an entire Circle of Enemies, to hinder him from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
his Conqueſts on every ſide; and is ſo provident that every
year he hath ſufficient Magazines before hand of all things neceſſary
for one or two years ſucceeding, and all his Money for two or three
years ordered in readineſs; and this year can increaſe his new Levies
proportionable to what ever he finds the Confederates are able to
do. This I ſuppoſe is ſufficient to Anſwer the firſt of your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond Head, it may be branched into ſeveral Particulars,
as relating both to you and us; which I will not perſue in an exact
Method, but as Matters of Enquiry hath occurred to my mind ſince I
was with you, or the later Letters of you, or your Friends, have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to my thoughts.</p>
            <p>And firſt, as to the propenſity of our Country to embrace a Peace
with <hi>France;</hi> you may remember that in our Town, which hath the
firſt Vote, the P. of O. was firſt made Statholder, though all the States
and Magiſtrates of the Seven Provinces had taken Solemn Oaths never
to admit a Statholder, and particularly not the P. of O. nor any of
his Houſe; and the Prince himſelf had taken an Oath not to accept of
the Office though tendered to him: So that the breach of all their
Oaths upon that Election was by ſome ſtyled abſolute Perjury, but we
found a ſofter Word for it, in ſtyling it, the mortifying the former
Edict. You know how our Senior Burger-maſter <hi>Cornelius de Witt,</hi> and
his Brother the Pentitioner, were moſt barbarouſly Murthered, becauſe
they did not ſo readily comply. Now in this very Town the Senior
Burger-maſter <hi>Halewin,</hi> as you know by his Sentence printed with
you, was ſettling ſome Correſpondence with Monſieur <hi>Amelet,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to know what terms the <hi>French</hi> King would inſiſt upon; and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you this was not a perſonal Caprice of his, who is a ſolid, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52930:4"/>
Perſon, and of a great Intereſt and Popular; who acted nothing
in that but with the good Liking and underhand Approbation of many
other great Men and Magiſtrates, which you may eaſily perceive by
the boldneſs of his Expreſſions, as you have it printed in your Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Sentence in theſe Word; <hi>viz.</hi> Pag. 12. <hi>That it is agreed on all
hands, that to endeavour to procure a Peace is not at all prejudicial to the State,
but is ſo far from that, that thoſe that imploy themſelves about ſome honest
way of obtaining it, ſhould not be looked on as Criminals, but rather to have
a Statue erected them, and that he was willing to do it with the peril of his
Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo in the 13. Pag. it is ſaid, <hi>That being before the high Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of his Country, he had a great mind to convince them, that it was none of
his Fault that Lives and Eſtates was Sacrificed to Men, and that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dye than that it ſhould be longer continued, and to play on Dobb, Dobb, Dobb,
Fanfare for the King of</hi> England; by whom he means not King <hi>James</hi>
but our Statholder, for whoſe ſake he neither would have Lives or
Eſtates Sacrified nor War continued. And in the next Pag. it is added
further, <hi>That in caſe ſome ſolid and reaſonable Propoſals of Peace ſhould be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it being a thing ſo neceſſary, and ſalutary for the State; that every true
Patriot would readily, and without any other reaſon, have embraced them:
withal aſſuring the Judges that what ſteps ever he had made in this affair,
they were occaſioned by nothing elſe but a ſincere intention to promote the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of this State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I aſſure you he ſpoke theſe things with great boldneſs, and wanted
not the majority of the Suffrages of many Magiſtrates of Cities, if not
thoſe of the Judges themſelves; and if the Princes Authority had been
as great now, as when he was firſt made Statholder, he had been <hi>de
Witted</hi> rather than had ſo eaſy a Sentence. I verily believe that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
know many Scores of our chiefeſt Magiſtrates, who are of the
ſame Opinion with Monſieur <hi>Halewin;</hi> and by the Converſation I had
with very many of your Parliament Men, I think there are a majority
of you, who, if they might give their Vote by Balloting, would put
an end to the War, by returning to the Condition our Countries were
in before the War; and if they would conſider their Strength, as well
as Intereſt, they would value the Saving of their Country from ruin,
before the private concern of any Prince whatſoever. And to me it is
an unaccountable thing to find leading Gentlemen in Governments,
both at home and abroad, ſo forward and outragiouſly zealous to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52930:5"/>
Supplant and Abdicate their lawful Kings, Supream Governors or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
upon ſmall Pretences; who yet can ſee their Country fleeced,
yea, gnawed to the Bones, with Taxes to ſupport ſuch, as have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
been Sovereigns of their own Creation, or Uſurpers; as I have
known ſome Servants who were audatious and refractory to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and yet were ſlaviſhly Cowards and abjectedly ſuffered the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
and Inſolencies of their fellow Servants. I am ſure this is an
odious Diſpoſition in Magiſtrates or Repreſentatives of the People, as
you are ſtiled.</p>
            <p>But to return to the head of this your Second Enquiry; I can aſſure
you we are ſo ſolicitous for our own Preſervation, and ſuſpicious of our
Statholder, that when ever we ſhall ſurmiſe that he ſhall prefer the
Preſervation of any Intereſt before ours, we ſhall with great precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
entertain any reaſonable Propoſals from <hi>France,</hi> and though
Monſieur <hi>Halewin</hi> ſays, That unleſs <hi>France</hi> would deliver up to the
<hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> ſome conſiderable place, there is no Dutchman who
would not rather Sacrifice the laſt Stiver he had then think of a Peace;
yet I am well ſatisfied if we might have <hi>Maſtricht</hi> in our own right, as
it now properly belongs to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they would that moment
quit the Intereſt, not only of the Statholder but of all our Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and leave them all in the lurch, as you know we have conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done in all the ſeperate Treaties we have had, and are well known,
even to a Scandal upon us, in thoſe of 48 and 74. And I muſt here
note to you, we are in no condition to continue the War, for though
Monſieur <hi>Halewin,</hi> in his Diſcourſe to Monſieur <hi>Amelet,</hi> ſaith, That it
was true that the moſt conſiderable Families of our Country ſuffered
very much by heavy Taxes, as having great Eſtates in Land which
carry the greateſt burthen, yet the Merchants were gently treated
for the benefit of Trade, yet he owns that thoſe Arguments he uſed,
in Page the Third and Fourth, were only to magnify the Power of
the States; being deſirous, like a Lover of his Country, to let the
<hi>French</hi> know the utmoſt of our Abilities that we might obtain better
Terms; but the <hi>French</hi> King knows too well our inſufficiency to
carry on the War, for the Taxes are here ſo heavy that I know ſeveral
ſubſtantial Citizens, in our City of <hi>Dort,</hi> who pay as much for Taxes
as the yearly Rent of their Houſes yield them.</p>
            <p>And though Monſieur <hi>Halewin</hi> ſaith, That the Taxes on real Eſtates
could cauſe at the worſt but a change of Maſters, which did not at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52930:5"/>
all concern the States in general and in abſtracto; yet ſurely the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing
of the landed Men to that degree, That they muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſell their Eſtates for nothing, to others that were able to pay
the Taxes, muſt in a little time effect the States in general; who can't
ſubſiſt without the ſupply of the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> no more than the Heart,
Brain, or Arms and Legs, without ſupply from the Stomach; for, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is unregarded, all other Taxes, upon what ſort of Commodities
ſoever, either of Ware or Tare, in the laſt reſort, fall upon the Land
and its Occupiers; and to let you ſee how our States, not only at this
preſent ſqueeze the People, but oppreſs them to the higheſt degree,
there was a Gentleman who had as fertil a Plat of Ground as any in
the Country, which being judged Commodious to build a Fort upon,
the States offered a Sum of Mony for it, but the Owner being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with his Inheritance, they laid heavier Impoſitions upon it,
till the Taxes amounted very near the yearly profit he made of the
Land, ſo that at laſt he was forced to part with it; yet, as Monſieur
<hi>Halewin</hi> ſaith, the States were no Looſers, for he was Taxed according
to the old rate; it being alledged he had received Mony for it, which
was to be Taxed: I remember I heard, when with you, that this <hi>Story</hi>
was related at an Entertainment, when ſome made complaint of the
heavineſs of your Taxes; it was replied, Then, and not till then, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
would have reaſon to complain, when you were driven to ſuch
Extremities: you know how great a Man he was that related this, and
Major <hi>Aſhton</hi> can name him if he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Halewin,</hi> pag. 3, in his Communication with Monſieur
<hi>Amelot,</hi> to aggrandire our power, told him, Though there were ſome
loſſes of Trade on one hand, yet they were repaid on the other by a
conſiderable Sale of the Manufactures, and thoſe that ſtood in need of
the Goods were to pay a greater price; and that the Merchants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
enſured: But I muſt tell you this was ſaid, to put our beſt foot
forward, for though our Merchants, of whom our very States conſiſt,
deviſe all the ways they can to promote or preſerve Traffick, yet our
common People, what by the burthen of Taxes, and the Obſtruction
of the old courſe of Trade, are reduced to ſuch a poor Eſtate that
they are upon the very Tipto of riſing in mutiny againſt our Magiſtrates
and States, for their ſo obſtinate perſiſting in the War; and generally
exclaim that our Statholder never yet had any ſucceſs ar all againſt the
French, ſo that if this Winter, or in the Spring, the French King ſhould
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52930:6"/>
have any one ſignal Succeſs in theſe parts, it would be impoſſible to
reſtrain the Mobile any longer.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Merchants have many Contrivances you want, becauſe
our States being all ſuch, contrive or connive at the Frauds; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we read weekly in your <hi>Gazetts</hi> of French Prizes, taken by ſome
of our Privateers, they are generally ſuch as by Aſſignation are to be
brought to our Ports, and by theſe meaſures we ſupply you and other
Countries with French Commodities, beſides we are glad to be excuſed
with ſo ſmall a quota of our Men of War, while you make a great
noiſe with encreaſing the number of your grand Fleet, by which
means we ſpare more for Convoys; and it is an admiration to our
People, that you ſhould not diſcover our Arts and Induſtry to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs
all the Trade into our hands. We have, without your being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to cenſure us for it, utterly defeated all your Laws of Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
we bring you in our own Bottoms, at leaſt under ſome of your
own Peoples names, the far greateſt part of all your imported Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
which may be diſcovered every day, by the number of our
Dutch built Veſſels in your River, and all your Ports: We have had
good Lading back of Corn, Butter, and Cheeſe, and there is one
Fraught we bring of our Country-men, French Refuges, and other
Foreigners, for what uſes your Maſter and ours deſigns them, it
becomes you to look to it; we have got one advantage ſince your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
beſides many other colatcral ones, that we know the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of all your Ports, the ſtrength of your Fortifications, the Stores
of your Arms and Amunition you had, which have been Tranſported
hither or to <hi>Flanders,</hi> the ſmall Stock you have left, the Secrets of
your Revenue, and what is above all the diſpoſition of your People,
and the eaſineſs of managing your Parliaments to our advantage,
whereby we and the Confederates have gained many Millions, ſince
we found you ſo ready to give us <hi>600000l.</hi> for our aſſiſting our own
Statholder, for which benefits we have reaped ſince in any other Reign
we would have given Millions.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all theſe Emoluments, if you once withdraw
your giving hands, we ſhall be forced to make Peace; and when
you have given to the laſt Doit, and are ſufficiently exhauſted, we ſhall
be able to make our Terms, and then enjoy the ſole Trade, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
which only, we uſe all our Arts to engage you ſtill in the
War, from which we expect no other advantage. And our Statholders
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52930:6"/>
intereſt will never fail within our conſideration, for that he uſeth his
deſpotick Power in nominating or approving only ſuch Magiſtrates
as are his Creatures, which hath highly diſobliged this Town, <hi>Roter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
Pregow,</hi> and many others of our moſt opulent Cities, and by his
preferring to the Supream Command of our Armies, The Dukes of
<hi>Halſton Ploen,</hi> and <hi>Wirtenburgh,</hi> General <hi>Ginckle</hi> and others, he hath
ſo diſobliged the Prince of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> Statholder of <hi>Frieſland</hi> and other
Princes of his own Blood, as well as deſerving Men of our Country,
that he hath loſt very much of his intereſt in <hi>Frieſland, Groninghen,</hi> and,
other Provinces lying moſt obnoxious to the <hi>French,</hi> which is no
inconſiderable weakning of our Country; and I doubt not but by our
Statholders diſobliging many leading and popular Men in our Country
as well as in yours, he muſt have cooled the Affections of many to
his Perſon, as well as his advancing ſeveral among us, who are not
very greatful to the People: as I remember I heard many wonder
with you, that one <hi>Coningsby,</hi> who was much blackened by Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt him in Parliament, and yet, as if done it in diſpight to the
Houſes, he made him a Lord, and took him into his Secret Council.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration leads me to tell you, what Reſentments he uſed
of the Conducts of the Admirals this Year, as he had formerly done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Admiral <hi>Torrington,</hi> and Admiral <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> which we look upon as
a perfect Deſign to convince our States that he hath an heartier good
will to promote our Intereſt than yours. I muſt confeſs it was a
great overſight in your Council, and Commiſſioners of the Admiralty,
that they did not Order the Grand <hi>Fleet</hi> to attend the Merchants under
the Care of Admiral <hi>Rook,</hi> till they had certain Notice where the <hi>French
Fleet</hi> was; but ſince they had no ſuch Orders, I know not wherein
the Admirals are to blame; for I hear that Admiral <hi>Almond</hi> owns that
Sir <hi>Ralph Dalaval,</hi> and I think the other two Admirals, at a Council
of Flag Officers, moved that the Grand <hi>Fleet</hi> might attend Admiral
<hi>Rook</hi> till they knew where the <hi>French Fleet</hi> was; which being utterly
denied by our Flags, and ſuch of yours as joyn'd with us, he then mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that at leaſt they might go a hundred Leagues further; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewiſe denied, by reaſon I preſume of the poſitive Orders to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
ſo far only, without any Latitude in their Inſtructions, I cannot
ſee why our Statholder ſhould not remove ſome of the Commiſſioners
of your Admiralty, if he be ſatisfied there have been no Miſcarriages of
the Council. As to the Loſs ſuſtained there, I think we and the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52930:7"/>
had the greateſt Share; yet when I conſider the Charge your
Merchants had been at, in lying Fraught Nine, Ten, or Twelve Months
in expectance of Convoys, the Charge of buoying up the ſunk Ships,
and damage to their Goods; the abſolute Loſs of their Market, the
Money which muſt be payed for their Conducting home, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
while they ſtay for a ſtronger Convoy, and the real Loſs you
ſuſtained, as appears by the Remarcks on the <hi>London Gazette,</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
muſt have loſt a pretty round Sum. And I learnt, before I
came from <hi>London,</hi> that upon the firſt Alarum of that Loſs, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of Workmen at the Clothworkers Trade had been diſmiſſed; ſo
that in one Pariſh. <hi>viz. Leeds</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> Five hundred Workmen had
been diſcharged in one day. And the hazard of Adventuring hath ſo
diſcouraged the Merchants to buy, that they are ſtill out of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and we have the like Effects with us.</p>
            <p>However the matter fell out that you ſuffered no more, yet the
<hi>French</hi> at that time in Ships, and Goods, got as much (beſides the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſo many Ships) as will deſray the greateſt part of the Charge
of their <hi>Fleet</hi> this Summer; whereas you have been at a vaſt Charge,
and yet ſcarcely have preſerved one inward or outward bound Ship,
which was diſcovered by a <hi>French</hi> Privateer.</p>
            <p>Neither can we apprehend the true reaſon of your late Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning your Sea-men, that they ſhall have no pay till their
next going to Sea, and then only a promiſe to be paid to <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
laſt. The Pay they uſed to have at the laying up of their Ships was a
great Support to their Families in Winter, and by ſhort Voyages till
the <hi>Fleet</hi> went out, they got ſomething towards the Summer following:
I know not how you can think that near 100000 Perſons, including
their Wives and Children, can have any poſſibility of ſubſiſting without
Stealing, Begging, or Starving, if they be not paid now.</p>
            <p>This kind of way of Proceeding our Sea-men would not ſuffer; and
ſuch Proclamations have that fatal Conſequence, beſides the Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Sea-men (which you may be ſure pleaſeth us here)
that it diſcovers either the real want of Money the Governmeet is in,
or elſe the Squandering what is given to unwarrantable Uſes. Such
as the magnificent Buildings here at the <hi>Loo,</hi> where our Statholder is
building a Palace to equal <hi>Verſailles,</hi> or the Pleaſure-houſe of the Duke
of <hi>Savoy;</hi> to furniſh which, beſides the Curioſities and ſplendid Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he hath provided, as an Onyx Table and Stands from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52930:7"/>
he hath tranſported the richeſt Hangings, and other Furniture
of the Palaces of your Kings, and ſeveral rich Silver Tables and Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and he hath demoliſhed a great part of <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and ſo
magnificently rebuilt it, that I was told when I went to ſee it, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
he had Expended above 100000 <hi>l.</hi> upon it, it would Coſt
400000 <hi>l.</hi> more ere finiſhed and furniſhed, while <hi>Whitehall</hi> lyes ſtill in
Rubbiſh; and one of your Commiſſioners for taking the Publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
told me, that as much was Expended upon that Building, and
at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> and for Jewels and other needleſs Matters, as would have
built Fourſcore Men of War. And I remember an Extract of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
was ſhown me, whereby it appeared that ſince our Statholder's
Adminiſtration in <hi>England,</hi> he had received into the Exchequer 25 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions;
of which, according to a full diſcharge of all Money to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed
according to the Eſtabliſhments, he muſt have Expended no
more than 20 Millions, and yet there was a Debt owing of 5 Millions
ſtill; and that he expects for carrying on a Vigorous War no leſs than
7 or 8 Millions more, and an encreaſe of 20 or 30000 Men, without
which he can hope for no better Succeſs than he hath had formerly;
whereas it is our Opinion you neither can provide ſuch Supplies, nor if
he had them he would be able to effect greater Matters than he hath
hitherto atchieved. I own there are many ſecret Sluces by which great
Sums of your Money have paſſed, which whether they be publickly
owned I know not: The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> beſides 100000 <hi>l.</hi> Preſt-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
hath received 20, 30, 40, or 50000 <hi>l. per</hi> Month. The King of
<hi>Denmark</hi> had a large Sum for the hiring the Troops under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Duke of <hi>Wirtenburg,</hi> though Prince <hi>George</hi> his Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath had ill Uſage by your Court. The Duk of <hi>Hannouer,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other <hi>German</hi> Princes, proportionable Sums: Above 100000 <hi>l.</hi>
ſpent upon the <hi>Swiſs Cantons</hi> and <hi>Vaudois,</hi> beſides what we and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Neatherlands</hi> have received. So that your Money hath plentifully
Circulated through the whole Confederacy.</p>
            <p>How much hath been ſquandred away upon other Accounts I know
not; but I preſume upon giving liberty to due Informations you may
eaſily learn. And I cannot think it needful to deſcend to many Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
but one Inſtance I cannot omit, a Maſter of one of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Ships related to me in preſence of ſeveral, not as any Secret, but
as the Caſe of many other ſuch Maſters; That upon his firſt Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he had 70 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Hay a board, and was retained
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52930:8"/>
at 50 <hi>l.</hi> a Month, and ordered with his Hay to lye at one Port after
another, till his Wages amounted to 1300 <hi>l.</hi> and when he related this
he ſaid he had the like Lading on Board upon the other years preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Deſcent, whièh he had kept on Bonrd till his Pay had run up to
750 <hi>l.</hi> He adds further, That a year ſince there was 500000 <hi>l.</hi> owing
to tranſport Ships, which he durſt Undertake to prove, was more by
400000 <hi>l.</hi> than all their Cargo was worth.</p>
            <p>I think you may caſt into the Scale of the laviſh Expence 300000 <hi>l.</hi>
at leaſt ſquandered away upon your noiſed Deſcents, by which you
mightily raiſed the Expectation of all <hi>Europe,</hi> to have ſeen ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece
of Stratagem, which by their Abortiveneſs have redounded
to your eternal Diſgrace; and if your preſent Undertaking, with your
Squadron under Capt. <hi>Bombo,</hi> with his Well-boats and Bomb Veſſels,
ſhoul end in an empty Burſt, you will forfeit for ever your Reputation
in Policy, and Conduct.</p>
            <p>I remember, when I was with you, I heard ſeveral of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
liberally cenſuring ſome of theſe Matters, as alſo bitterly inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the Numbers of civil and military Officers and Pentioners
in the Houſe; for whom it was reported that 150000 <hi>l.</hi> was lodged,
not to be touched for other Uſes, that it might be ready for Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
agoinſt the Sitting of the Houſe. Beſides the quarterly Payments
of 30000 <hi>l.</hi> which I doubt not but our States, if required, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
pay a ſhare of, rather than ſuch uſeful Perſons ſhould want their
Wages; for the more Liberal ſuch Men are of the publick Money, the
more comes to ours and all the Confederates Treaſury, as well as
yours. And I think you may eaſily judge in whom this <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi>
works moſt effectually; for they will ſeem, at the firſt Sitting, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as any to redreſs publick Grievances, yea, to enquire into ſome
Miſcarriages, and ſeem unwilling that any Money ſhould be given till
publick Accounts be ſtated; but when they have gotten the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Patriots by that Art, they then know when to follow their File<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders,
to ſuperſede all further Enquiries, by diverting the Houſe by
ſome new Matters, or ſuggeſting Dangers from abroad, or Plots at
home, and then watching an Opportunity when their Party is ſtrongeſt
in the Houſe, they gain ſome fundamental Vote for a Supply, and as
ſoon as that is obtained, they purſue that Quarry only, letting all other
publick Bills ſink, inſinuating that they had found no ſuch grounds of
Complaints, or Miſmanagements, as at firſt appeared to them. This
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52930:8"/>
Diſcovery I gained by diſcourſe from a Member of our States General,
who hath a great influence in your Councils, as well as ours; ſo that
you may be confident that till you remove ſuch mercinary Members
out of the Houſe, as Monopoliſts, and other obnoxious Perſons, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers
of their publick Truſt, have been in other Parliaments, you
will never be able to obtain a true Account how your Money hath
been Expended, and what vaſt Arrears are owing to the Fleet and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
Providores of Stores, of Victuals, Ammunition, tranſport Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
It pleaſeth us infinitely that ſo great Sums are brought over hither for
pay of the Army, and the Confederates in Specie, and the beſt Money,
and I cannot learn that our Statholder brought any great Sum back
in Silver, heſides 1500 <hi>l.</hi> in waſht and clipt Money. I am ſure you
cannot forget how a very credible Perſon of Quality told you and me,
That if a ſtrict Enquiry were made, there would appear that <hi>1900000l.</hi>
had been given by you ſince the Adminiſtration of our Statholder with
you, for your Fleet more than ever had been paid to the Sea men, or
expended upon it, and he believed ſuch like Defalcations would be
found in what was given to the Army, and for other Occaſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
placing more to Accounts than really had been paid: I ſhall long
to know, whether in this Seſſions you make any Enquiry into ſuch
Matters; for it is believed, if you trace theſe Matters up the Stream,
(which if you do not, you will be notorious Breakers of the Truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon you) you will pinch ſome great Miniſters, who muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have an unuſual <hi>Decian</hi> Courage, to devote their Lives to excuſe
ſome above them, which will be a rare Gallantry in this Age, or you
will at the Fountain head find the ſource of Miſcarriages you are to
Enquire after, of which we here talk more openly than you do. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus diſpatched the ſecond of your Enquiries in theſe ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
I how proceed to the laſt.</p>
            <p>It is more difficult I muſt confeſs to give an Anſwer to this than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the former; becauſe the Conſultations of the Confederate
Princes are kept, as they ought to be, very Secret; only I can tell
you in the general, That neither the Emperor, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> Duke
of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> or the other <hi>German</hi> Princes, are ſo devoted to our Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder
as formerly; ſince they ſee he can work no Miracles. And all
the deference they have for him now, is becauſe he hath been ſo well
credited, and befriended by you, as to be ſupplied with Men and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
hitherto, according to his deſire, without rendering any Account;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52930:9"/>
which, though it be to the infinite damage of your ſelves, who reap
no ſort of Bleſſings, or Benefits thereby, yet is the only Cement which
prevents the Crumbling of the Confederacy.</p>
            <p>For I aſſure you we are ſufficiently tired; out and exhauſted by the
War, and would be very thankful to ſuch unengaged Princes as would
uneergo the Office of Mediators; for which purpoſe we have late
Advice that the Emperor hath ſent to the Pope, to acquaint him, that
he is not averſe to Peace, provided he may have honourable Terms
and for that purpoſe deſires a Copy of the <hi>French</hi> King's Terms. The
King of <hi>Poland</hi> likewiſe hath repreſented his Inability to ſuſtain the
Loſſes his Subjects receive by incurſions and preſſures of the Tartars:
What Applications have been made by the Emperor to the Northern
Crowns, and the Willingneſs of the <hi>French</hi> King to accept of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
is much diſcourſed of; and how inſtant the Pope, the State of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, are to perſuade the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to
accept of the Overtures of the King of <hi>France,</hi> you cannot be ignorant,
though it may be it is concealed from you into what ſtrates the Duke is
reduced; for we have it from ſure hands, That in the late Battle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a perfect numbring of the Duke's Souldiers ſlain, they amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to 9000 and 600 Men, and that 3000 Priſoners were taken, and
117 Standards and Colours, and beſides all the Cannon and Baggage,
a vaſt number of Bombs and Carcaſſes were taken, with which the
Duke intended to Bombard <hi>Pignerol.</hi> That ſince this Victory the whole
Army under Marſhal <hi>Catinal</hi> hath quartered in that rich Country, and
hath drawn ſuch vaſt Proviſions from thence, that he hath ſtored <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol</hi>
for two years, ſhall do the like for <hi>Cazal,</hi> beſides putting ſo large
a Garriſon into it, as ſhall enable them to make Excurſions all this Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and the <hi>French</hi> King hath ſent a Meſſage to the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, that
if they admit any of the <hi>Germans</hi> to quarter in their Territories, he will
ſend his. Troops among them, otherwiſe he will inviolably preſerve the
Peace of <hi>Italy;</hi> and our very laſt Advices are, that the Duke hath at
laſt ſent to the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> to medeats a Peace; upon which the
<hi>French</hi> King diſpatched a Courier with his Anſwer in five hours; and
if a Peace be once made in that Quarter; it will be a great ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the like with the Emperor.</p>
            <p>You muſt, in the next place, conſider the <hi>French</hi> King is ſo much
above his Work, that he may continue the Wars many years yet lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
without impoveriſhing his Subjects in 12 years more, as much as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52930:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ours and yours have been in theſe Four or Five years laſt; for that he
maintains a great part of his Troops, by Quarterings, Forrage, and
Contributions out of the Confederate Countries, and his Sea Force by
Prizes, while his own Kingdom enjoys a profound Tranquility, as if
no War was in their Borders. And all the World knows with what eaſe
out of his large and populous Dominions he can raiſe what Men be
pleaſeth by Warrants only from Lieutenants of Provinces, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Cities and Towns, who at a day prefixed bring to the Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz,
a double Number of Men, out of which the Officers pick out
the Number needed of the ableſt Men, without beat of Drum, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
his Officers ſo much <hi>per</hi> Head, as the Confederates are forced
to advance for theirs. And his Subjects have ſuch a perfect Love to
him, even to a Veneration, and ſuch a Senſe of the Honour which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds
to the <hi>French</hi> Nation by his glorious Succeſſes, that with great
Alacrity they ſubmit to what-ever he requires; beſides that, all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
after mature Conſultations, are ordered by himſelf ſolely, ſo
that his Purpoſes and Determinations are never betrayed, or embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
or retarded, by ſtaying for the Conſent of others, as the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
are yearly <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any Age, to put all his Commands in Execution; and his Fund of
Money is inexhauſtable, for that in times of Peace the whole Revenue
of his Kingdom paſſeth through his Exchequer once in Five or Six years,
ſome affirm it in Four. And if he chance ever to be put to a Streight,
a few of his rich Allies will ſupply him.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you not only my own Judgment, but that
of very juditious Men I have converſed with: Yet, leaſt my Letter

if this be of any uſe to you, may be ſupplied in my next; and with
profound Reſpects I remain,</p>
