            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VIth a gratefull acknowledgement of your manifold favours, &amp;c. I cannot upon any occaſion, but ſhew my prompt obedience to doe you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and as part of it to continue my Intelligence. Truly, Sir, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the face of things hath not beene more diſtracted ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this impious war, then it is at this preſent. Were <hi>Tymanthous</hi> to draw it, we might well allow him a veyle, leſt it too far orecome his art, and contriſtate the ſpectator. Jealouſies dayly heighten, new parties appeare, and new intereſts are diſcovered, that we ſeeme to oreact ſome wel contrived Romance. In which, every page begets a new and handſome impoſſibility. Such ſickneſſes have now ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the body politicke, that is nothing but crampes, convulſions, and fearefull dreames. But to come neerer an account, give me leave to repreſent unto you the preſent being of things, not gathered from any whiſpers, or rumors, which like broken glaſſes, offer a viſage ſcattered into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peeces, and not to be collected into one. But out of the ground and maxims of the parties themſelves, which give us the beſt light, both of what wee may thinke of the preſent, and thinke for the future. The Kings party, which before theſe times was viſibly overſpread the face of the Kingdome, and ſince the tumults were ſo formidable, that occaſioned that unfortunate and coſtly counſell of calling in the Scots, (who nevertheleſſe were of very ſmall action, ſaving that their reputation plucked up the ſpirits of the Parliamentarians, and ſtopped <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> progreſſe ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) and brought over that profitable peece of Tyranny,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114432:2"/>
the Exciſe. But the Parliament fed by the City of London, (which was unexhauſtible, and contribution moneys fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King, and the Countreys though exceſſively poll'd, not able to ſupply him) the former party began to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh, and with their many victories confirmed theſe two ſage maxims, <hi>That it is the ſafeſt way in a civill war to be ſeized of the Metropolis:</hi> and the other, <hi>That people are never ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nor ſo daring, as to preſerve or regaine their Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This party being quelled, (and in it the braveſt of the Nobility and Gentry brought on their knees) the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdome removed from White-hall to Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, and from the Privy Counſell to the great Counſell. Now began the whole frame of State to bee taken in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but it is eaſie for a childe to diſcompoſe a Watch, but <hi>tantu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s non</hi> impoſſible to ſet it right againe. Thoſe Offices which had meere dependance upon the Prerogative, to be either deaded or layd aſleepe, and all ſuch as might advance popular liberty and eaſe revived, the ancient and happy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Juſtices of Peace in their ſeverall Counties in a manner forgotten, and Committees raiſed of men of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible condition, and till that time ſcarcely knowne. For the flower of the Gentry having engaged in the other party, which was now ſo ſhattered, the Parliament preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there was not much ſecurity in their truſt, who with Sequeſtrators (a vermine which might well make an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth plague in Aegypt) ſo handſomely behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that under the pretence of the publicke, more ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together viſible eſtates, to the ruine of many fine fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, it cannot be denied, but the ſufferings of ſome of them before for the cauſe had beene high and exemplary. But when they were once to weile ſome power, their armes were too weake, and they ſtrucke at randome, many times point blanke againſt Law. For having beene men for the moſt part nuzzeled up under ſome non-conformiſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and by them a little enſlaved in their conſciences, they made little ſcruple of any thing that was in purſuance of ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114432:2"/>
good a worke, eſpecially back't with an Ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, though flat againſt the reaſon and letter of the Law. Nay with ſuch violence proceeded they, that ſome men out of bare ſuſpicion, were outed of their livelihoods, and put to compound. But why doe I talke to you whoſe perſon and family have ſuffered ſo much by them, that I fear me 'twill be a worke of difficulty to make you heare that which rationally might be ſaid in their excuſe.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt alteration of all was, that though in the State we had ſome proviſion, yet for the Church wee did like that fooliſh Gentleman, who pull'd downe his houſe with an intent to repayre it, before he had another to put his head in, and this was that which left us open to ſo many ſtormes: For the Parliament had ſome months before, firſt taking away the Lordſhips, and then the dignities of Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, with all their &amp;c. called a Synod, which being not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally choſen, but onely named by particuler Members, was made up of a great many of none of the wiſeſt Clerks: men they were, who by their conſtant preaching in the dayes of the Biſhops, and withall ſome petty ſuffering, had gained the high eſteeme of their Electours, (who never conſidered how weake and unfit they were for controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the chiefe end that brought them together.) Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once warme ſet, and creeping into the fatteſt places that were left, moſt unhappily began a new modell of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall policy, which hath been a ſecond cauſe of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our differences. A government it was which rather neceſſity then ſerious cauſe has brought upon ſome ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Churches abroad, who by reaſon of their diſperſedneſſe and poverty, were never ſo wiſe as to know how incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible it is with civill government. Publique toleration it had only gotten in Scotland; but with what ſtirre it was attended in that Kingdome, is not the preſent talke of this pen to declare; but ſurely from the Scotch coppy wee wrought out ours, the Authors of it ſome doing out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, ſome out of a deſire of the thing it ſelfe, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114432:3"/>
ſome out of novelty. The Houſes ſeemed to countenance it, rather to ſettle mens mindes for the preſent, then any way leave ſuch a burthen to Poſterity. But the King utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured it, and there wanted not Miniſters of his party that were ready to ſhew the novelty and baſefulneſſe of that government to the full. Nay to parallell it with Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, taken in the worſt ſenſe, and to ſhew that a few years would render it more odious than the other had been in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Centuries. But this rather confirmed thoſe whom it found averſe from it, then made any ſo. That which gave it the greateſt ſtreake was this; five of the Aſſembly who out of a panicke feare of the Prelacy had ſlipped beyond ſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, had gathered together private congregations, and out of their liberality lived in ſuch a height of pride and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, that that of the Poet might be applied to them.</p>
            <q>Exul ab octava Marius bibit &amp; fruitur Diis Iratis.</q>
            <p>Theſe refuſing to be caſt in that mould, publiſhed a little booke called the Apology, which was licenced by <hi>Herle</hi> the Chaireman, who by this juſtly incurred the <hi>Odium</hi> of ſome of his hotter Brethren, who diſdained that hee ſhould be ſucceſſor to Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> in that place. The booke was modeſtly penned, (though <hi>Herle</hi> himſelfe confeſſed to me he modified many expreſſions) and ſhewed what courſe they had taken in their tranſmarine Churches, and from thence they rather wiſhed a congregationall then parochiall way. This congregationall way never thought on till within a few yeeres, being free and leaving a ſcope to mens conſciences, was much entertained by many Sectaries; nay ſome who carried only the characters of pious and orthodox, and ſome under the colour of it broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched opinions which were as new as the government. This occaſioned the deteſtable Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> with a great deale of waſpiſh and violent rancour to write his Gangrena; queſtionleſſe this booke did a great deale of harme, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114432:3"/>
full of falſities, and almoſt monkiſh forgeries did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage many to a juſtification, who it may be would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe after the firſt eventitation of their fancies have ſate ſtill. Sir <hi>Thomas Fairefax</hi> his Army was much compoſed of people, who were of the Independent (as they call it) way, Theſe muttered at this booke, and ſome proceedings of the ſame nature, inſomuch, that the Presbyterian Party, which by ſome countenance of the State grew haughty, ſought to oppoſe them, and in purſuance of it, wrought ſo farre upon the conſciences of the Aldermen and Common-Counſell (men verſt in little elſe but their trades, and utterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of State affaires) though the greatneſſe of their City ſometimes engaged them, that they petitioned the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to disband the Army, and to ſend the Voluntiers out of it into Ireland, under Field-Marſhall <hi>Skippon.</hi> The Army repined at this, alledging that they who had ſerved the State, with ſuch fidelity and ſucceſſe, ought not now to be ſlighted: This delaid their disbanding, and in the end cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them utterly to refuſe it. Now had the Independents a viſible party, and the beſt way to make it good, was either to cloſe with the Royalliſts, or elſe carry it by Votes. To the former purpoſe, they ſeized of the King at <hi>Holdenby</hi> by Cornet <hi>Joyce,</hi> who had beene Taylor to Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him with a great deale of freedome, and gave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and hope to his party: To carry on the latter, they impeached Eleaven Members, of the choiſeſt and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of the other party, the rather to take away their Votes, then for any guilt of the men. Others of the ſame party in the Houſe ſeeing things ſo carryed, deſerted it, and left the dominion of votes to them that ſtaied. But the diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced Parties were not idle all this while, but wrought ſo upon the City, that there was of a ſuddaine a great party petitioned the Houſe for the recalling of the King, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in league for the purſuance, the Houſe voted theſe mutinies Treaſon. But they aſſuming courage, came in a rout to the Houſe, and denyed egreſſe, till that the diſpoſall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114432:4"/>
of the Militia was revoked, which the Houſe puſillanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed.</p>
            <p>The King all the while carryed himſelfe with patience, and his party are reſolved to ſuffer as well as they have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Maſter.</p>
            <p>Thus you have it Hiſtorically, take politically theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall maxims.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a great argument of weakneſſe in a State, when parties ſubdivide into ſuch fractions, and every ſmall party able to uphold it ſelfe and become terrible, while the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt party is unable to move.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Violent alterations, and taking away of one govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before they be certaine of another, are extreame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as alſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſuffer Clergy-men to gaine upon the conſcience too much in matters indifferent, for they are a race of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who though they leaſt ought, have ever the baſeſt ends of their owne: And this their offending againſt knowledge is queſtionleſſe the juſtice of Providence, that they ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis dangerous to let the head City of a Kingdome to grow ſo potent, for it will inſenſibly bring the reſt under the ſlavery of a few Prentiſes or Mechanickes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the government of one comming into the hands of many, who are unskilfull Pilots, is to be wiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, though accompanied with ſome inconveniences.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Men in a new government, had need be carefull who they employ, for the <hi>Odium</hi> of their government falls upon them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They neede to preſſe the People as little as they can, but if extremity force it, to ſatisfie them by faire accounts, and not laviſh it upon one another by Largeſſes.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Not to bring themſelves into contemptible want, nor bring their thumbes under the girdles of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.</p>
            <p n="9">9 It is no great policy to give heterodox opinions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114432:4"/>
life by oppoſition, nor to draw on the hate of a victorious Army.</p>
            <p>For particular maxims:</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is not conceivable the King will favour any party, but that which cometh homeſt to his principles.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That party that does it, is not only ſure of immunity, but reward.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That Sir <hi>Thomas Fairefax</hi> hath miſſed a good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to doe it, and the diſtruſt of the Royaliſts will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth render him uncapable.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If he had not gaind the major number of Votes, he had queſtionleſſe done it.</p>
            <p n="5">5 This new party of London, its to be feared, have too much of the Presbytery to be true to the Prerogative.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That if things had beene carried by the Parliaments party with moderation, things had beene in a calmer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then now.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The Kings party have had ſome faylings, and ſo have the Parliaments, but this is the firſt of the City, if it bee not favoured with ſucceſſe, which cannot in much reaſon bee promiſed it.</p>
            <p n="8">8 That <hi>Edwards</hi> and <hi>Burges</hi> and ſome of the hotter ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited men deſerve puniſhment as Incendiaries.</p>
            <p n="9">9 That the Presbyteriall government is incompatible with our civill government.</p>
            <p n="10">10 That regard to tender conſciences, is as neceſſary as a generall conſideration would be inconvenient.</p>
            <p n="11">11 That moſt of the Kingdome ſeeme to breath after a moderate Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p n="12">12 That the King ſeemes to have this advantage by all his troubles, that he hath ſhewed to the world the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable excellencies that are in him, and extorted a confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on even from his enemies.</p>
            <p n="13">13 That the Queene taking her at the worſt morally, as faithfull to her husband, and induſtrious in carrying on her deſignes, is the beſt in all the catalogue.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114432:5"/>14. That learning hath incomparably ſufferred by theſe times, and twere good to cheriſh it leſt the next age feele a decay.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That it were a good way to mollifie peoples minds to ſuffer Play-houſes againe, and that it would be a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable addition to the education of the Gentry.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That it is a brave and a gallant way to peace, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the names of parties, and not to diſcountenance Malignants. That all branches may at laſt be recollected in the ſame boate.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir have I with as much faith and ſimplicity as I can opened unto you my thoughts. I am the leaſt of men, and man indeed can ſee little, what he ſees behinde is from Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and theſe either maimed or falſe; what for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, either by his owne obſervation, or partial intelligence, but for the future he hath no helpe, but the compariſon of what is paſt; 'tis Gods great Prerogative, and fit for only ſuch buſie pieces of ignorance as <hi>Lily</hi> to prie into. Things may as ſoone alter, as you can burne this paper, which kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes your hands from,</p>
