         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HEalth</hi> is the greatest temporal
Blessing we can enjoy in this
Mortal state: Without it the choicest
<hi>Beauty</hi> vanishes in a Moment, like
a withered Flower; the stoutest
<hi>Strength</hi> dwindles into a <hi>childish
Weakness,</hi> scarce able to support the
tottering Carkass; <hi>Riches</hi> become
insignificant Lumber; <hi>Honour</hi> an
empty Bubble, or extrinsick Shadow,
yielding no delight; Nay <hi>Wit</hi> and
<hi>Parts</hi> grow Vseless, and <hi>Life</hi> it self
but an unwelcome load and continual
Torture. For how often may we see
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> the <hi>Rich</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:43077:3"/>
the <hi>Great,</hi> swell'd with <hi>Dropsies,</hi> or
wasted with <hi>Consumptions,</hi> or
rack't with the <hi>Stone,</hi> or laid up
with the <hi>Gout,</hi> or crippled with <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atica's,</hi>
and the like, heartily envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those <hi>Jolley Swains,</hi> who feed
only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cheese,</hi> and
trotting up to the Knees in <hi>Dirt,</hi> do
yet with <hi>lusty Limbs,</hi> and <hi>vigorous
Stomachs,</hi> and <hi>merry Hearts,</hi> and
<hi>undisturbed Heads, whistle</hi> out
more <hi>sollid Joys</hi> than the <hi>others,</hi>
with all their Wealth and State can
purchase.</p>
            <p>So that 'tis undeniably one of the
most important Businesses of this
Life, to preserve our selves in
Health. And this all People, when
they are actually groaning under the
smart of <hi>Sickness,</hi> will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.
Oh! then they would
give all they have in the World for
Ease and Remedy, though it be but
an <hi>Ague,</hi> or a fit of the <hi>Tooth-Ach!</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:43077:3"/>
but as soon as the Pain is over, and
whilst Nature is yet pretty sturdy,
and as long as ever she can bear up,
they care not how they use her, and
seem to value this precious Iewel
<hi>[Health]</hi> no more than the silly <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
of old did their <hi>Wealth,</hi> when
they contentedly parted with <hi>Gold</hi>
and <hi>Pearl,</hi> for <hi>Toys,</hi> and <hi>Baubles,</hi>
and <hi>Knives,</hi> and <hi>Beaugles,</hi> and
<hi>Looking-Glasses.</hi> Most men will
moil and toil like Horses, and rise
early and lie down late, and eat the
Bread of Carefulness, to get <hi>Money</hi>
and <hi>Land,</hi> though they neither make
good use thereof themselves whilst
they live, nor know who shall enjoy it
after they are dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And how dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
are others by fawning and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
and courting those whom in
their hearts they hate and scorn, and
by servile Offices and irksome At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendances,
and a thousand other
pittiful Arts, to acquire a <hi>Rattle</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:43077:4"/>
their Name, and get a <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
or some Place of <hi>Preferment</hi>
that may give them an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to domineer over their Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
but there is scarce one Man
or Woman of a thousand that does in
earnest consider and pursue the means
of preserving their <hi>Health,</hi> but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lives at Random, or at least
takes up with the pernicious Notions
of <hi>Custom, Tradition</hi> and <hi>Blind
Guides,</hi> whose <hi>Prescriptions</hi> of <hi>Diet</hi>

The Meats and Drinks commonly

to those that are already <hi>sick</hi>

For if the same <hi>Intemperances, bad Airs</hi>
and <hi>ill regulated Exercises,</hi> which were
the first original of the Disease, (or

does actually change the whole Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

the nature and simpathy of the Food,
for the better or worse: And this not

but also in Beasts; for if the <hi>Food,

               <p>And if this good state of Body hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

                  <p>The best way for weak sickly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
People to eat <hi>Milk Raw,</hi> as
they call it, or not altered, is after this
manner, Take a Pint (or what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
you please) of New-Milk from the
Cow, let it stand open to the Air two
hours, and then skim the thick or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43077:20"/>
my substance off the top thereof, and
put it by, but the rest of the thin
Milk that remains, eat with well bak'd
Bread; but remember you neither
Toast your Bread nor warm your Milk,
except the season be cold, and then
you may warm your Milk as hot as
your Blood, but do not then toast your
Bread, for it does it much harm; or
if you please, you may eat <hi>Bisquet</hi> with
your Milk, but be sure you do not eat
too great aquantity at once; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it will do well to mix a little
Water with your Milk, and then you
may sweeten it with good <hi>White Sugar;</hi>
if you make this your whole Food, you
may eat thereof three times a day;
for 'tis a brave sort of Diet, and will
gallantly support Nature, and recover
lost Strength, but then you ought to
continue it for 6, 8, or 12 Months, or
else you cannot prove it; for Diseases
that have been several Months or Years

Milk <hi>ready</hi> to boyl, but <hi>before</hi> it does
actually boyl, put in your thickning, and
stir it a litttle while, and when it is
again <hi>just ready to boyl</hi> take it off, and
add <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> to it, as much as
you please, and remember to let it
stand in the Dish or Platter you put it

                  <p>A good <hi>Spoonful</hi> of <hi>Flower</hi> is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to thicken a full <hi>Pint</hi> of <hi>Milk</hi> and

may make it either thicker or thinner,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43077:21"/>
as you like it, but it is best about the
thickness of ordinary <hi>Milk-Pottage,</hi> and
will eat sweetest, and be easiest of
Concoction. This sort of Food affords
a Nourishment of a firm Substance,
does neither bind nor loosen the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but keeps it in good order, and
breeds good Blood and fine Spirits,
whence brisk and lively Dispositions
proceed; this way of Preparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>So when you would add <hi>Eggs</hi> to

Water into your Sawce-pan, then take
one spoonful of good Oatmeal newly

                  <p>There is yet another Preparation of

This may be true at first; for Nature

it be for the better, but a little custom

it not only familiar, but most pleasant
to the Stomach and Palate; and he

nor wisdom to admit of a little
inconveniency, shall never have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to know the true intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
Vertue of any thing, nor its nature
or Operation. We know no Reason
in Nature why people should dislike

it in one degree or other, more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
such as have disordered Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
and weak Heats? for the help
whereof <hi>Viniger, Verjuice,</hi> the Juice of
<hi>Lemmones, Oringes,</hi> and many the like
sharp keen Juices have been invented &amp;
mixed with Food, and no doubt to good
advantage, if order be observed therein
because all such things have some affinity
with the ferment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:43077:26"/>
therefore Food, eaten, in which a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
quantity of such Juices are mixed
will be easier, and digest sooner than
a like quantity of food will do, in
which there is none. But still, this
sowred Milk hath a far nearer affinity
both to the ferment, separative and
digestive Faculties of the Stomach,
than any of the sharp Juices last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
for in this Milk, as is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there is a real ferment and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
Quality arises and proceeds
out of its own body, and from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Spirits therein contain'd, which
hath much agreement with the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and above half the Work is
done to Natures hand. And before
People do envigh against this innocent
simple Food, they should consider, that
the Stomach and natural Heat cannot
make any separation or digestion of any
Food before there is a sowring or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation?
This is most manifest in
all <hi>Chymical</hi> Operations and Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the spirituous parts will not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

somewhat keen or sower, but then it
must not be too keen or sharp, for the

than forced by the continual heat of the
Fire, wherefore of their own accord
they hastily fly away. Besides, it is to
be noted, that <hi>continual Motion</hi> in all
Liquid Bodies destroys and causes to
evaporate the essential Spirits and
good Vertues thereof. An Example
of this we have in that Milk Women
carry about two or three Miles in their
Pails, shaking and measuring of it out
by degrees, causing thereby, as it were,
a continual Motion, which makes the
<hi>Volatile Spirits</hi> to evaporate, and then
presently the sweet Body and oyly
Quality is thereby wounded, and the
Milk becomes thin and Wheyish, and
it will not afford half the quantity of
Cream, as Milk will do that is set to
cream as soon as 'tis milk't; for that
skinny substance that all Milk covers
it self with, does keep in the pure es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
evaporates the volatile Spirits,
and causes the sweet Body to sower, as
the cold condenses the spirituous parts,
whereby they become less volatile,
which hinders separation, so that the
oyly fat Quality in the Milk cannot rise
to the top in such quantity as in warm
moderate Seasons.</p>
               <p>For this cause all <hi>Dairy-Women</hi> ought
to have such Milk-Houses as are <hi>Warm
in the Winter</hi> and <hi>Cold in the Summer;</hi>
for in cold Weather most Women are
forced to let their Milk stand a long
time, <hi>viz.</hi> several days, or else they
will have a very small quantity of
Cream; which long standing of Milk
to get the more Cream, does awaken
the <hi>original Fires,</hi> viz. the <hi>astringent</hi> and
<hi>bitter Qualities;</hi> for which reason most
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43077:28"/>
of the <hi>Butter</hi> made in the Winter has
a kind of <hi>sower bitter Taste,</hi> which does
not proceed from the <hi>Hay</hi> or <hi>Grass,</hi> as
some suppose, but from the <hi>long stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the Milk, as aforesaid. For <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
made in Winter, if the Milk stand
no longer than in Summer, will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good and sweet: And if the <hi>Hay</hi>
had any such nature to cause a <hi>sower bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Taste,</hi> how comes it to pase, that
the <hi>Flesh</hi> of all Beasts fatted in the Stall
in the Winter with Hay, is not only
more firm, but also far sweeter, and
fuller of brisk lively Spirits than in
Summer, and therefore will take Salt
much better, and afford a firmer
Nourishment, and also continue sound
and good much longer.</p>
               <p>Note also, That <hi>Boyl'd Milk</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so good as either <hi>raw</hi> or <hi>scalded;</hi>
for the boyling it does not only fix it,
and thereby render it more stopping
and harder of Concoction, but also the
violent Motion of boyling does, as it
were totally destroy the volatile spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
so that if boyled never so little,
it will not afterwards afford any Cream
but only a thin skin; for the <hi>volatile
Spirit</hi> is so pure and subtle that it will
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43077:29"/>
not endure any harsh or violent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so soon as that delicate Spirit
is wounded, the sweet Quality of fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nsensible to the Preparers; and
this is the true cause why boyled Milk
will not cream; whereas if you take
Milk and scald it (but it must be done to
a point, not too hot) and then take it
off the Fire and let it stand in the same
Vessel, and there will arise a brave
thick clouted Cream, which way ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
use in the West parts of <hi>England,</hi>
and therewith make very good <hi>Butter;</hi>
but if you let your Milk be too hot,
it will not cream to such advantage as
otherwise. And this I hope may be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
demonstration to the <hi>good Dame</hi>
and <hi>provident Housewife,</hi> that the boyling
of Milk entire, or by it self, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

Persons, or Children, but that it is
much better for Health, and to prevent
Windy Diseases, and breed good Blood

And if Women were so wise and kind
to themselves and their Children, as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43077:29"/>

and let it stand and cool without your

is the next Food to <hi>Breast-Milk</hi> for

better, by reason of the many Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

two or three glasses of clear well brew'd

clean hard Beds, and moderate Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
But remember that you do
not add any other Ingredients to this
sort of Food, as <hi>Sugar, Spices, Fruits,</hi>
or the like, for then it will become of
another nature and operation, and that
for the worse, as I have demonstrated
in the Chapter of <hi>Mixtures of Foods,</hi> in
my Book intituled, <hi>The way to Health,
long Life and Happiness, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is further to be noted, that this
sort of <hi>Spoon-meat,</hi> and also all others,
ought to be made rather thin than
thick; for in such Foods the Liquid
Element ought to predominate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be <hi>Milk</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi> else the pure
spirituous parts being in a degree suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated,
they will become dull on the
Palate and heavy on the Stomach;
therefore all Pottages and Spoon-meats
that are made thin, and quick prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
are sweeter and brisker on the
Palate, and easier of Digestion, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more spirituous than those that
are thick and long a doing. And as
all Foods that are properly mixt, and
a due order observed in the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43077:31"/>
will have no manifest Taste or
strong <hi>Hugo,</hi> as all others have, but on
the contrary, will yield a pleasant
friendly Taste, and Smell most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
so you may observe of all Meats
and Drinks, whose Taste and Smell
are innocent and fine, they never cause
any loathing in Nature, because there
is no manifest Quality that does too
violently predominate, but all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
or Tastes seem to be united,
or stand in equal weight and measure;
for where any doth bear sway, it will
quickly awaken its Likeness, whence
Discord, and an unequal motion ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and thence a loathing follows;
for in Sickness, all such Meats and
Drinks as were the original of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
the very sight and smell thereof
is offensive, and for that reason Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
People eating much Flesh and
strong Drink in Health, do for the
most part perfectly loath and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
such things in Sickness, desiring
Water and more simple Foods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

out the proper Diet in such cases, if

<hi>Flesh,</hi> which in my opinion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so proper to recover lost Health
and Strength, as more simple innocent
Foods, for several Reasons; As, <hi>1st.</hi>
Because it is that which most, both
Young and Old at all other times
make their chief Food, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from thence their Distempers most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceed. <hi>2dly,</hi> 'Tis of a <hi>gross Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi>
nature and operation, of a moist
oily Quality, therefore harder of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
than many other sorts of Food,
whereby it generates gross Humours
and thick Blood. <hi>3dly,</hi> The Beasts
are often distempered, sometimes for
want of care and skill in their Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
at other times by hot Weather
and much driving they are surfeited,
and yet killed before they have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
those Disorders. <hi>4thly,</hi> By be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
killed in <hi>improper Seasons, viz.</hi> in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43077:32"/>
the declining part of the year, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,
September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> at which
time the central heat in all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays,
and the Flesh of all Beasts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more gross, their fat soft, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
and full of Phlegm and corrupt
Juices; and therefore Flesh will
not take Salt nor keep so well then as
at other times, and also, 'tis then
their time of Generation and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which renders it still more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and pernicious. However, the
common eating of almost all sorts of
Flesh, both clean and unclean, hath
gotten such a dominion in Man, that
all that I can say is little likely to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
those furious Inclinations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the Sick will still follow <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi>
aud gratifie his Humour, and
must needs have his <hi>Flesh-Pots</hi> and <hi>Flesh-Broths,</hi>
we shall give some directions
for the best ordering thereof, which
is done after this manner, <hi>VIZ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let your <hi>Flesh</hi> be fresh killed, and
otherways good, whether <hi>Fowls, Beef</hi>
or <hi>Mutton;</hi> First, make your Water
boyl, then have your Flesh ready to
put in, and encrease your Fire that it
may not lie long in the Water before
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43077:32"/>
it boyls again; and let your Pot or
Vessel be large that it may hold a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
quantity of Water, that the
flesh may swim freely; and when it
boyls take your Pot-lid off, that the
sulpherous fiery Fumes may pass free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
away, and the Air have its free In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
upon it; for that Element is
the true Life of the Spirit, and by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
plenty of Water, the flesh is
cleansed from its gross Impurities,
which the best of Flesh is subject to;
likewise you ought to keep a brisk
clear Fire, that there be no intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the boyling, which would dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
or flatten the spirituous parts, so
that the Meat will become dull and of
an heavy operation, and grosser nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment;
nor ought you to let it boyl
too long; for Flesh over-prepared is
of an heavy dull nature, and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Palate and Stomach.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Broths</hi> made of Flesh ought to be
thin, brisk and full of Spirits, which
render them easie of Concoction, and
breed thin pure Blood. Many People
imagine <hi>Flesh</hi> not only the most Nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishing,
but also the Substantialst Food;
but this must be numbered amongst

amiss; but in my judgment those that
have regard to their Healths, Strength,
and brisk lively Dispositions, or such
as eat it to open, cleanse, and help
the digestive Faculty, and to remove
offensive Matter from the Stomach,
ought to eat this sort of sower Gruel
only with Bread; for thereby it more
powerfully removes the Obstructions
of the Breast, helps the natural Heat,
strengthens the Stomach, cools th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
whole Body, openeth the Passages,
and makes the Body lightsome and airy.
This is a most commendable Gruel to
be eaten for a Breakfast in all hot Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Clymates; for the sowerness,
or the fermentation doth so aptly fit
it to the Stomach, and has, as it were,
digested all tough or slimy matter, so
that it becomes easily separated, and
so passes away more quick and free,
leaving no Dregs behing it that doth
either fur or obstruct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and to such whose Breast and Passages

               <p>There is also another way of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and let it stand a day, more or less,
as they think fit, then they pour off
that Water and put on fresh; some
will do this four, five, six, seven, eight

each Water remain on the Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal
a certain time, then they take it
and boyl it up, and mix it with Milk,
Cream and the like: But this way is
nothing so brisk, lightsome and lively
as the former; for Oatmeal hath passed
through, in its Preparation, a certain
fermentation or digestion, by which
the gross body in the Oats is opened,
and the more internal or central Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
become thereby volatile, so that
it readily gives forth its vertue when
it is committed to the great Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum,
<hi>viz.</hi> Water, even as <hi>Malt</hi>

the digestion or fermentation is

stupid and destitute of all its good
Qualities; nay, the very Air will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale
and draw forth the more spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
parts of all <hi>Flower,</hi> if exposed to
it; though the Grain have never pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
through any fermentation or dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
as the <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Wheat,</hi> which
is the strongest, and of the best sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of any others; for this cause,
Flower that hath been grown'd five
or six Weeks, or more, though it be
kept close in Sacks, will not make so
sweet nor so moist pleasant Bread as
that which is newly grown'd; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all <hi>Bread</hi> in <hi>London</hi> does eat drier

any Grain is bruised or broken into a

and liable to evaporation; for
they are so subtle, quick and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that nothing can hold or continue
them, but of necessity they either eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate

neither is it so profitable for those
that make a Trade of selling Meal;
for Meal new grown'd will not so
freely separate from the Branny sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
nor yield so much Flower;
but lying a while after it is grown'd,
makes a kind of Distillation, or giving

by reason of the Essential Spirits and

will remain sound and good a long
time; and if the essential Spirits and

could be preserved intire from

it be smooth and pliable; but the more
pains you take in kneading it, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and smoother the Bread will cut,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43077:39"/>
and eat much softer and pleasanter in
the Mouth, and be easier of digestion;
and when you have well kneaded it,
let it lie warm by some fire about two
hours, until your <hi>Oven</hi> be ready, then
make it into small Loaves as you think
convenient, and let them be Baked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with the Ovens mouth not close stopt,
that the Air may have more or less
Egress and Regress; but the better
way is to make it into <hi>thin Cakes,</hi> like
<hi>Oat-Cakes,</hi> and bake them on a <hi>Stone,</hi>
which many in the North of <hi>England</hi>
use for that purpose, making a Wood
Fire under it. This sort of Bread is
<hi>sweeter,</hi> of a more innocent Taste, and
far easier of Concoction than any Bread
bak'd the common way in <hi>Ovens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the same manner you may
make Cakes of any sort of Grain, viz.
<hi>Rye, Oats,</hi> or <hi>Barl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y,</hi> and you will find
it a brave wholsome hearty Bread, and
every way more profitable to Nature,
than such as are made in the usual
manner.</p>
               <p>Note also, that the putting of <hi>Salt</hi>
into Bread is injurious; for <hi>Salt</hi> is an
unseparated body, in which the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Qualities do too violently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43077:39"/>
being of a keen tart hot Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Operation, and therefore if
it be joyned with any Body or thing
that is not subject to Putrifaction, or
full of Phlegmy gross Humours, then
it presently preys on the good Vertues
and essential Spirits; For this cause
<hi>Salt</hi> does cause all forts of <hi>Bread</hi> to
corrupt; for in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it finds no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
matter of Putrifaction to work on,
and therefore seizes the good Vertues,
and by its keen fierce hot property
destroys and corrupts it. Therefore
such <hi>Bread</hi> as is intended to be kept a
considerable time, no <hi>Salt</hi> is wont to
be put into it, as <hi>Biskets</hi> that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Sea,</hi> and the like: But for such
as make <hi>Flesh</hi> most of their Food, <hi>Salt</hi>
is an excellent Ingredient, and for
some other sorts of Food, that is for
present eating, For <hi>Salt</hi> naturally
sharpens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>n, being gratefull to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and resisting Putrifaction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it be not used in too great a
Quantity, for then it spoils all or,
when it hath lain in any Flesh or Fish
too long, by which the good Vertues
are Evaporated or Distempered; for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43077:40"/>
then such Flesh and Fish proves very
Injurious to the Health, and corrupts
the Blood, as is most manifest by such
as feed on such over-kept salt Meats
at Sea, for they are at the very next
door to Putrifaction. And as <hi>Salt</hi> is
endued with the firce Original fire, so
on the other side, it hath a most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
lively spirituous Quality, but the
firce harsh fires do predominate;
Therefore 'tis fit to eat <hi>Salt</hi> with all
fresh Flesh, or to have the Flesh salted
three or four weeks before you eat it;
but Bacon of all other is best when
longer <hi>salted</hi> and smoak't. Likewise
many Innocent Foods will admit of
<hi>Salt,</hi> but then they must be eaten pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
as Pottages, Salads, and the
like; so likewise in <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheese,
Salt</hi> preserves them a considerable
time.</p>
               <p>By the way, I would have the
<hi>House-wife</hi> take notice, that <hi>Bread</hi> or
<hi>Cakes</hi> baked on <hi>Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es</hi> in <hi>Chimnies,</hi> or at
the <hi>Ovens Mouth,</hi> will be much <hi>whiter</hi>
than if the same were baked in an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
close stopt up;</hi> for the former having
the free Influences of the Air, the
pure Spirits are thereby kept living,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43077:40"/>
and their pleasant white colour does
not only shew its clean Innocent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but it proceeds from and is a
true <hi>Gleam</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> arising from the
Tincture and Volatile Spirits, which
are destroyed when the heat is intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
and the egress and regress of
that Friendly Element, the Air, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.
And therefore <hi>Bread</hi> baked
in close stopt Ovens is of a duller
dusky Colour, more <hi>Saturnine</hi> and
<hi>Martial,</hi> according to the degree of
Heat, and time of standing in the Oven.
The good <hi>House-Wife</hi> may also remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that Bread is not of so strong a
substance and nourishment as Flower,
when it is mixed with <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Milk,</hi>
for that potent glewy tough substance
that naturally Flower is endewed with,
is lost and destroyed in Bread by the
intolerable heat of Ovens, and some
other Circumstances that belong to the
making of Bread; therefore it will
not thicken either <hi>Water, Milk</hi> or any
other liquid Body, nor be so strong,
tough and glewy; and therefore all
such Foods as are made with Flower
are more strong and substantial than
Bread mixed with such things. Also

I shall give him my Reason for it,
which is this, Because <hi>Butter</hi> having

through due <hi>Fermentation,</hi> the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
properties thereof, are thereby
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43077:41"/>
unbounded or set at liberty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Volatile,</hi> the truth whereof you
may perceive by this Experiment, If
<hi>Butter</hi> be but exposed four or five days
to the open common Air, it will lose
a great part of its pure <hi>smell</hi> and <hi>taste;</hi>
but much more if it be committed to
the <hi>Fire;</hi> therefore <hi>all melted Butter,</hi>
and such Foods wherein <hi>Butter</hi> is mixt,
that are baked or fiyed, are not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for Health, but become heavy of
Concoction, and strong upon the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
and the common eating thereof
doth generate evil Juices, thick Blood
and dull heavy Spirits, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
scorbutick Humours and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Diseases in the Blood, But <hi>Butter</hi>
in its own Nature is an excellent thing,
and very profitable, if mixed with
proper Food, as <hi>Bread, Herbs, Roots,</hi>
and the like; but if not properly mixt
and eaten, then it Oyls and Furs the
Vessels of the Stomach and Passages,
hinders Digestion, and generates evil
Juices and many Diseases.</p>
               <p>The best <hi>Butter</hi> for the Stomach is
that which is made <hi>from the beginning of

much finer and more wholsom, and
free from phlegm, and easier of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction

Rowings or <hi>Leather-Math</hi> (as they call
it) though this latter sort is oft times
much sweeter to the Pallate at first eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but it quickly <hi>cloyes,</hi> by Greasing
the Stomach; for it is endued with
much gross phlegmy matter, like the
Grass at that season; For Hay made
thereof is of little strength or Vertue,
as all Husband-men do know. And as

But as this is made near the <hi>Winter,</hi> so
it is new, and that is the cause why it

and disagrees with many; and those
that find it best are more beholding to
use, which has familiariz'd it to their
Bodies: Besides, most that have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
do put too great quantities of
Sugar amongst their Apples and Pears,
whereby it becomes more like a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
than Food; therefore such Pyes,
if a man makes a Meal of them, will
not give his Stomach that satisfaction
as all proper Foods will; and also the
eating of much Sugar in our Food does
extraordinarily foul the Stomach and
fur the Passages, is injurious to the
natural Heat, and breeds bad Blood,
and fills the Body full of the Scurvey,
taking off the edge of Appetite, and
generates evil Nourishment; for this

                  </gap>ceed in any Food, and
far more, because sweetness is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing
to most sorts of People, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to Children and Youth; whereas
the other Quality is not so, but the
contrary, and no Person need so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to arm himself against those Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perances
that his natural Inclinations
do not lead to, but the greatest danger
of his being misled or overcome, is by
those Intemperances that are most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his temper, for by such
Evils he is overcome, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly:
For sweetness is an inticing
Quality, and though in it self the best,
yet proves of dangerous consequence
where it exceeds in Food, in which too
much Sugar is mixed; for indeed every
sort of proper Food has sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Sugar, I mean sweetness in its
self, to moderate the other Qualities,
<hi>viz.</hi> the bitter, sour and astringent,
so that when People mix such quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Sugar in their common Food,
they destroy the Equality and Harmony
of that thing, so that it becomes an
extream, and causes the like disharmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43077:50"/>
in the Elements of the Body; for
the best Quality in Nature is as great
an evil when it too violently predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
if not greater than those we
least esteem of, as the Bitter, Sour or
Astringent; for these last carry their
corrector with them, as having no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing
property. But these things are
seldom consulted either by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or by good House-Wives, but they
go on in the Road, and every day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
hurtful Extravagances, perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves that the more cost they
bestow, the more rich things they
jumble together, the better and more
nourishing their Food must be; and
more nourshing indeed it is, but of
Diseases and evil Juices; whereas plain,
course cheap, simple Foods are much
more fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more strengthning and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.
And therefore in former Ages,
when Sugar, <hi>Spanish</hi> Fruits, Spices,
Sweet-Meats, and the like, were not
known in these Northen Climates, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

'Tis a sort of Fruit that ought not by

such things in which any Quality of

so being any wayes altered, then
they will not keep three dayes good:

               <p>Yet it must be acknowledged, that

               <p>But waving this not unseasonable

Fruits, and smell, as it were, of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
and the great and good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
is as much to be admired in them
as any other <hi>Vegetations,</hi> for though
they are not so useful for common
Food, yet they have their excellent
uses: Their chief Vertues reside in
their most pleasant Scent, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
refreshing and chearing to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
also, they are endued with a
warming Quality, very profitable in
<hi>Physical Operations,</hi> especially for some
sort of <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Phlegmatick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions.</hi>
The same is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in <hi>Brandy,</hi> and other distilled
Spirits, which often prove profitable
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43077:62"/>
being taken when there is just occasion,
in a <hi>Physical way;</hi> but of fatal conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to such as accustom themselves
to the drinking of it at every turn;
for then it quickly wounds the Healt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by destroying the natural Heat; the
like is to be understood of all Extreams,
in Drinks and Food, which are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmonious
in their parts. Therefore
it is no ways safe to mix unequal Fruits
with those that are equal; for then
the Harmony of the whole will be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
As to use our familiar Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Take the <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Wheat, Milk</hi>
and <hi>Water,</hi> mix them and heat them to
a Pap, these three things are equal and
agreeable in their peculiar parts each
with other, and make a brave wholsom
Food either for young or old, on which
alone you may live healthy and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
for divers years; but if you mix
with them <hi>Sugar</hi> and <hi>Spice,</hi> or either of
them, then the company of this Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
puts them out of Tune, and breaks
the Consort, so that if any one should
be confined to this last sort but for
one Month or two, their Palates and
Stomachs will grow weary and loath
it; And so it is with <hi>Cakes,</hi> in which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43077:63"/>
eight or ten Ingredients are mixed;
how long could those that love them
best, eat them, and not be weary?
Not sixteen days together: But take
<hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> and make Cakes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and on them you may live several
years and never be tired.</p>
               <p>In like manner <hi>Flesh, Bread</hi> and <hi>Herbs</hi>
harmonive, and a man may eat of them
every day, but mixt <hi>Spanish Fruits, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and the like, with <hi>fat Flesh</hi> and
<hi>Butter,</hi> and prepare them as well as
you can, you shall not eat them every
day for one Month without loathing
and weariness; the very same is to be
understood of all other Foods and
Drinks, and if People would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Custom, and what is cried up by
the Multitude before the simple inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
ways of <hi>Nature,</hi> it would be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
for every one to chuse and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what is most proper and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Stomach. For if they would
set <hi>Gustom</hi> aside, then most would be
led to Meats and Drinks that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and proper by meer instinct, as
most of the inferiour Creatures are,
except some unclean Savages, as <hi>Swine,
Bears, Lyons,</hi> and the like: And in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43077:63"/>
truth the greater part of <hi>Beasts</hi> have
more understanding in <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi>
than many <hi>Men;</hi> for Man crys, <hi>What
were those things made for?</hi> As if God
intended that all, right or wrong, must
be cram'd into his Paunch, and that
there could be no other use for them,
but for him to devour them; as if to
be Ornaments to the Universe, to set
forth the Power and the Wisdom of
God, in the making, and feeding, and
preserving so many innumerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and invite Man thereby to praise,
magnifie and adore his Maker, were
not more Noble ends than to eat them
to his own Prejudice. But so greatly
precipitated is he into <hi>Wrath, Viol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nce</hi>
and <hi>Oppression,</hi> that he is not willing
any thing should escape his luxurious
Throat, though the use of it be to the
destruction both of his Body and Mind.
For the source of all Evils to Man hath
been his suffering his Imaginations and
unclean Desires to wander after those
things that are neither needful nor any
way benificial; for faslly imagining
that all things were made meerly for
his use, he entred with the power of
his free depraved Will, with a rapid
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43077:64"/>
Motion, into all <hi>Beastiality,</hi> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
himself of the <hi>divine Vision</hi> which
he was made in and for, and not to
live in the Power of the <hi>dark Magick</hi>
and <hi>Brutality,</hi> to domineer, and rend,
and tear each other to pieces, far worse
than the <hi>Savages of the Desart.</hi> For
<hi>Man</hi> was created in the <hi>Image of God,</hi>
and ordained to live under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the divine Principle, and if
he had continu'd under its dominion,
then every sort of innocent Food would
have satisfied him, according to that
Commission, <hi>Every green Herb and Tree
bringing forth Fruit shall be to thee for
Meat.</hi> Nor was he clothed with the
Skins of Beasts before his Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and they are still the Spoils and
Reliques of Violence; for he was made
<hi>Naked,</hi> that is, in Innocency, and his
Clothing himself with the Excrements
of Beasts, does truly intimate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
state, especially when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
proud thereof; than which
there cannot be a greater Vanity in
the World.</p>

that it agrees not with some, is for
want of use when they are Young; 'tis
endued with Equality and Concord, as
being distilled by Nature's choicest
Limbeck, and It would be much for
the Health of our <hi>English People</hi> if they
did eat more of it, and less <hi>Fruits</hi> and
<hi>Spices,</hi> though we have no necessity for
either; but since our Desires do so itch
after Novelties, it were much more
commendable for us to chuse those
things that have the nearest affinity
with our Natures; and of all sorts of
fat things, <hi>Oyl</hi> is the most innocent, as
proceeding from the cleanest Radix,
and being the product of Vegetation,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43077:65"/>
and therefore is very proper and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to humane Nature, being joyn'd
unto and eaten with <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being eaten with <hi>Bread</hi> or <hi>Herbs,</hi> is to
an undepraved Palate, not only more
delightful, and to the Stomach easier
of Concoction, affording a finer and
cleaner Nourishment, better Blood and
purer Spirits, than either <hi>fat of Flesh</hi> or
<hi>Butter,</hi> though the last of them is very
wholsom, <hi>Cream</hi> and <hi>Butter</hi> being our
<hi>Oyl,</hi> and eaten with proper or cleaner
things, as <hi>Bread, Herbs,</hi> and the like,
does make a proper Mixture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
good Food.</p>
               <p>The Reason why <hi>Oyl</hi> is with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

and <hi>Bread,</hi> is, because all Mixtures of
Food are most agreeable to the Human
Nature that bear the nearest affinity
in their Basis; and as <hi>Oyl</hi> is the true fat
of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> so it suits and agrees bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with them, than with any sort of
<hi>Flesh,</hi> or other Food proceeding from
Flesh; but with <hi>Fish</hi> it is very good and
wholsom, especially <hi>Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

keen Property of the <hi>Salt,</hi> and swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens

               </p>
               <p>But it is to be noted, That <hi>Oyl</hi> ought
not to come near the heat of the Fire,
for that will presently destroy the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer

then it will become strong and fulsom;
the same is to be understood if it be

               <p>THe Antients have attributed some

hardly perform half that which is said

to the Nature of the Herbs and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
out of which this King of Flies
extracts it; for cause, some <hi>Honey</hi> is
of a more unpleasing Taste than other,
as being harsh, and with a kind of
bitterish farewell, apt to gripe the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and Bowels when it is tinged
with <hi>Martia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when the <hi>Bees</hi> gather it from the Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms

the Disease call'd the <hi>Green-Sickness,</hi>
Medicines made with this sort of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
are very powerful to remove
those Evils: But for general use that
<hi>Honey</hi> is best which is extracted or
drawn from the most pleasant fragrant
Flowers that grow in <hi>Meadows</hi> and
<hi>sweet Downs,</hi> where <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:43077:67"/>
But there is yet a more subtle and
almost nnknown difference in Honey,
which ought to be noted; for as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
being drawn from a vast variety of
innocent delicate <hi>Herbs,</hi> and most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
sweet smelling <hi>Flowers,</hi> (the

Heaven) may justly, in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be stil'd, <hi>The most Transparent and

the finest and most pleasant Sweet of
all others; so the same is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not so much of our vulgar Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
as in its original Preparation and
Perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> if it could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
whilst it remains intire, as it is
extracted out of the <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi>
into a little Bag or thin Skin, which
lies in the very center of the <hi>Bee,</hi> as
may be manifest to sense, if you can
be so cruel, when you catch one of
them, to sever it in two, for then, if
you are quick, you may take out the

               <p>From what hath been said, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,

gross Phlegmatick Body, since the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is so apt to be violated, if great
Prudence be not used; And if once this
<hi>benigne Quality</hi> be wounded, such Foods
or Medicines become fulsome, fierce
and nauseous to Nature, far worse and
of more dangerous consequence than
they were whilst they remain'd crude,
as being hotter and more fierce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Moderator</hi> is gone; so that it
would prove much safer if the diseased
took the <hi>crude Herbs, &amp;c.</hi> for then they
would have the innate Vertues, as well
as the Vice; but after the common
Preparations, which most <hi>Physitians</hi>
and <hi>Apothecaries</hi> use, you must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with a meer <hi>Nauseate</hi> or
<hi>Loathsome Medicine,</hi> in which the pure
Essential Vertues are all, or for the
most part, destroyed; for all Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and other things, in which the
Properties and Qualities of Nature are
unequal, either by Nature, or rendred
so by <hi>Artless Art,</hi> will be strong, and
of a fulsome Taste, dull and heavy on
the Palate and Stomach, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And whatsoever is said here of the
improper Preparation of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and
the Evils that come thereby, will in a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43077:72"/>
more especial manner take place in the
Spagyrical or Chymical Art, when it
drives into the <hi>Mineral Kingdom;</hi> for
all or most of the benigne Vertues or
good Properties of <hi>Minerals</hi> are lockt
up and captivated in the harsh Poysons
and gross crude Bodies of <hi>Saturn</hi> and
<hi>Mars,</hi> and their Birth and Generation
is in the deep Bowels of the <hi>Saturnine
cold Earth,</hi> where the Sun and Elements
have not so free Influences and Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through them, as they have on
all <hi>Vegetations</hi> and <hi>Fruits;</hi> therefore
they are far more harsh, hard and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous,
than those things that grow in
the open Elements; neither are they
in any degree so friendly and familiar
to our Natures, as <hi>Herbs, Fruits, Grains</hi>
and <hi>Seeds;</hi> therefore <hi>Mineral Medicines</hi>
are of much more dangerous and fatal
consequence than the others, if they be
not prepared as they ought to be, that
is, so as that the good Vertues be not
destroy'd; for in <hi>Vegetable Preparations</hi>
there does at best remain only a dull
gross flatulent Body, which indeed has
no power to cure, nor very much to
hurt. But nothing is more dangerous
and poysonous than ill prepared Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43077:72"/>
of <hi>Minerals:</hi> Therefore in Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I had rather fall into the hands of
an unskilful <hi>Gallenist,</hi> than of a rash
and ignorant <hi>Chymist,</hi> the last being
much more to be dreaded than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
though both are bad. And it is
common with some that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
great in the <hi>Chymical Art,</hi> to
take <hi>Antimony</hi> and other <hi>Minerals,</hi> and
prepare them, and make Medicines,
which are tenfold worse than when it
was in its natural crude Body, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by its fierce poysonous operation;
for before its Preparation a man might
take forty, sixty or an hundred Grains
without any manifest prejudice, but
when it has passed the strong sulphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Fires and Calcinings of the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
then ten or twelve Grains will
do the business, that is, purge and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
as if it would rend and tear Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to pieces; and if any should take
but half the quantity that might safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been taken whilst it remained
crude in all its parts, it would prove
an infallible Cure for all Diseases, by
putting a period to Life.</p>

                  </gap>undeniably appears, that
the <hi>Chymist</hi> has not, as many falsly

boast, by his Art digested or meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the terrible fierce Wrath and strong
Poysons of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the blessed and most aimable
Properties of <hi>Venus, Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Sol,</hi>
which last endue all things, in which
they carry the upper Dominion, with
a gentle mild friendly Nature and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration;
but on the contrary, they
render the poysonous Qualities more
violent and intense; and the <hi>benign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
in most <hi>Mineral</hi> Preparations are
destroyed, suffocated and wounded by
their fierce and improper Fires, and
for want of Understanding in the time,
so that the venomous Wrath becomes
tenfold more fierce than it was before;
and the chiefest matter they can boast
of, is, <hi>That with much Art and Industry
they have destroyed the good healing balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
Vertues, and so enraged the poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Wrathful Nature, that a less quantity
will do their business.</hi> But let them know,
that all the Healing and Medicinal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de in the friendly Principle,
and in whatsoever Food or Medicine
the amiable Vertue or balsamick Oyl
is wounded, that thing thenceforth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
abominable, so far from deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43077:73"/>
the Name of an Help or Remedy,
that it is a meer Nauseat to Nature.</p>
               <p>It is further to be noted, that all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
that are fierce, wrathful, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous,
and unequal, in which the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign
Properties</hi> are impotent, and the
<hi>fierce original dark Powers</hi> so predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that ten, twenty or thirty Grains
or a few Drops will affright Nature,
and put her into an Agonious fit, as for
the most part destructive to the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
and Health both of the Body and
Mind; for they do incorporate with
their Similes, and excite the lurking
Poysons in the Body, and put a further
Dismayment on the weak Oyl and pure
Vertues, the strengthning of which
would be the right Cure. And it is a very
great chance if any such rough chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Medicines do any Cure, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the contrary. 'Tis true, many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may recover after such <hi>Physick,</hi>
but that is no Argument of their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
or safety. If a <hi>Physitian</hi> should
have at any time three hundred Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
one might safely pass ones words,
That if not one of them took any of
his Medicines, yet two hundred and
fifty of them would recover; and ye
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43077:74"/>
should the <hi>Physitian</hi> in this case have the
glory of Curing them all, when in truth
they owe the benefit solely to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, and goodness of his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
Nature.</p>
               <p>It is also to be considered, That
there are some <hi>Chymical Preparations,</hi> as
<hi>Powders,</hi> and the like, that have no
Purgative or Vomiting Quality, nor
any other manifest way of working or
altering of Nature, being no more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
felt than a crum of Bread after it
is in the Belly. And these have been
and are much cry'd up for the wonders
they do: And in truth they are much
to be preferr'd before the former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrected
Poysons, which rend and
tear the Body to pieces; for these, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
do not hurt, and what do they
do, I am not able to say; but most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that as many as happen to be
well after the taking them, do attribute
their Cure to these silent Medicines.
However, this I will be bold to tell
you, That in <hi>Chymical,</hi> and especially
<hi>Mineral Preparations,</hi> it is a very difficult
point, and I think, more than any
mortal man can certainly undertake to
perform, To correct, allay and destroy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43077:74"/>
the Venoms of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and
at the same time preserve the more
<hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>friendly Vertues,</hi> which are
in their own Nature so very subtle,
tender and fine, that every little Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
or Violence wounds them;
and the difficulty is hereby further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
for that in what Medicine so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the original Fires of <hi>Saturn</hi> and
<hi>Mars</hi> are destroyed or wholly annihil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
the <hi>benign Properties</hi> can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
subsist; <hi>For where there is no Fire
there is no Light;</hi> for the <hi>Fire</hi> is the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of the <hi>Light,</hi> and all Life and Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
stands in the <hi>Poysonous Root;</hi>
therefore the Artist must not annihil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
those <hi>poysonous Principles in Nature,</hi>
for they are the very Original of every
Life, but his work is to correct them,
that the <hi>benign Principle</hi> and <hi>healing Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
may arise and tincture, or shine
through them, that so their Strife may
cease, and all the Properties incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and embrace each other, and so
attain the <hi>Vnity,</hi> and then such a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
will have power and vertue to
tune the Discords of Nature into an
Harmony, and allay the irritated Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the Body, and so awaken and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43077:75"/>
strengthen the dismay'd Oyl and fading
Vertues, and so the Cure will be soon
effected.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that to take a crude
poysonous <hi>Mineral</hi> or <hi>Vegetable,</hi> and
open its gross Body, and correct the
Venoms, and awaken the good Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
Vertues, that so they may predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
and tinge the whole, is one of
the highest and most difficult Points in
the <hi>Spagyrical Science:</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
'tis no great matter to make a
<hi>Devil,</hi> being half made already, that
is, 'tis easie to make a thing worse, but
hard to render it better; for its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
cannot appear till the Poysons be
moderated, which must be done by the
Artists helping hand, which to do, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
as great Understanding as to
obtain that wonderful Thing, so much
talk't of, but rarely, if at all known
or understood, viz. <hi>The Grand Elixir</hi>
or <hi>Philosophers Stone;</hi> whereas indeed
neither this nor the other can be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any humane Study, Learning,
or Industry, but only by the divine
Bounty and favourable Mercy of the
God of Peace and true Love. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it often comes to pass, that though
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43077:75"/>
the Medicines be not prepared in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's

and <hi>Intemperance;</hi> but the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Creator did never command man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to encrease and make vast Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>viz.</hi> a thousand times as much
more as is needful of any sort of eatable
or drinkable things, and then oblige
them to swallow them down their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43077:78"/>
Throats for fear (forsooth) they should
be spilt, or be counted useless, as if
there could be any greater Spoil than
that which spoils both the <hi>thing</hi> and the
<hi>receiver,</hi> or as if it were not better to
let a thing remain seemingly useless,
than to abuse it to my own Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
the truth is, the original of most
superfluous and pernicious Inventions,
and also of such a prodigious encrease
of <hi>Sugars, Spanish Fruits, Wines and
Spices,</hi> have chiefly sprang from the
hellish Root of COVETOUSNESS,
being promoted for the sake of Gain,
and to raise great Estates, and to live
a rich easie superfluous Life, and not
for any private or publick good; and
as their ends were bad, so the effects
prove no better. Some also will say,
<hi>We have need of them, and why should we
debar our selves of those things?</hi> And thus
if there were an hundred Toys and
needless Novelties brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
more than there is, they would
quickly find footing, and the People

               <p>Touching Sugar-Candy and Pan-Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
I shall first discribe to you how it
is made, and then shall the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make it appear how improperly it
is used commonly amongst us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sugar-Candy</hi> is made thus, First it
is boyled as high as other Sugars, then
they take this Syrup out of the Pans,
and put it into an earthen Pot, and
set it in an hot Stove, there to stand
eight or ten days, in which time the
fierceness of the sulpherous heat does
<hi>Candy</hi> or coagulate it into an hard
tough substance, and then you take it
out from the Syrup, and put this Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or the hard lumps into the Stove
again, but made two or three degrees
hotter, where it must remain ten or
twelve days longer, and then it is
done.</p>
               <p>There are two sorts of it, <hi>White</hi>
and <hi>Brown,</hi> but they are both of one
Nature and Operation, and the chief
use that is made of either, besides
spoiling of Childrens Teeth, is to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43077:80"/>
sorts of People as a Medicine,
when they are troubled with <hi>Coughs,
Colds</hi> and <hi>inward Stoppages</hi> of the <hi>Breast.</hi>
Now <hi>Sugar-Candy,</hi> as to its Nature
and Operation, is the same in the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix
as <hi>Sugar,</hi> from whence it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
only it is nothing so good, nor
of so cleansing and opening a Quality
as <hi>Common-Sugar,</hi> though the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is generally believed, but any Man
that wears Eyes in his Head, may from
the before cited method of its prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
easily perceive my Opinion to
be true, for by that tedious unnatural
preparation, and being made stronger
of the Lime, that thereby it may more
easily harden and coagulate. This <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Sugar</hi> must needs become of an hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Nature, and tougher Substance
than the <hi>common Sugar,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not so wholsom especially for those
People that are troubled with <hi>Colds</hi> or
<hi>Stoppages,</hi> for being by that way of
preparing dryed, hardened, and
brought into an hard glewy tough
Substance, of a slimy ropy Nature,
when it comes to dissolve, it naturally
heats and stops the Passages, instead
of opening them, causing <hi>Drought, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:43077:80"/>
there being nothing more contrary
and burdensom to Nature in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
than this very thing which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
almost as an universal Medicine to
both Young and Old; and therefore
ought by all wise People to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd;
for all things in which the
<hi>Sweet Quality</hi> is extream (in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
Sugar is chief) do <hi>dull the Palate,
clog</hi> and <hi>obstruct the Stomaeh, stop the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
destroy Concoction, spoil the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Heat, making it weak and feeble, heats
the Blood, and renders it thick,</hi> whence
proceed <hi>dull and impure Spirits.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all such things ought to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               </p>
               <p>It is further to be noted, That all
sorts of <hi>sweet Fruits,</hi> as <hi>Raisins, Figgs,</hi>
and the like, being frequently eaten
by such People as are subject to <hi>Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages</hi>
and <hi>Colds,</hi> does encrease those
Distempers, by <hi>heating the Blood</hi> and
<hi>weakning the digestive faculty</hi> and <hi>natural
Heat,</hi> and generating <hi>evil Iuices,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
such Fruits are eaten sparingly
and with <hi>Bread,</hi> which with such Fruits
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43077:81"/>
is to be preferred before any other
things mixt or eaten with them what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
Likewise there are various
sorts of Drinks made by boiling Fruits
in <hi>Beer, Ale, Wine,</hi> and the like, with
various sorts of <hi>Herbs, Roots, Seeds,</hi>
and <hi>Druggs</hi> of disagreeing Natures,
and stoutly sweetned with <hi>Sugar</hi> or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
such Liquors for the most part
prove of very evil consequence to
Health; For no sweet Fruits ought to
be boyled, neither for <hi>Food</hi> nor Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick;
for boyling does naturally eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
and destroy the pleasing friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opening Qualites, and sends pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the purer Spirits, as appears both
by the Fruits after they are so boyled,
and also the Liquor that they are boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in, and the nauseous unpleasing
Taste which remains in both, which is
the Reason that all that use this way
of Preparation, are forced to sweeten
such Drinks with <hi>Sugar</hi> or <hi>Honey,</hi> or
else they will not be drinkable; but if
you take any of the before-mentioned
Fruits raw, and bruise or stone them,
and then infuse them in any of the said
Liquors, especially in common Water,
it will become sweet and pleasant, and far
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43077:82"/>
more opening and cleansing, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way wholsomer: The same advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
you have when you infuse <hi>Herbs</hi>
properly gathered, dryed and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and also <hi>Seeds, Drugs</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi>
and all such Drinks will have a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Taste, and be welcome to the
Stomach; but if the same be boyled,
it will be altogether the contrary, as
having lost their essential Vertues by
the Violence of Fire; for the pure
volatile Spirits in all sweet lucious
Fruits, are not only very powerful,
but stand, as it were external, and on
the surface, and therefore will not
endure the fierce motion of the Fire,
as <hi>Flesh,</hi> and several sorts of <hi>Martial</hi>
and <hi>Saturnine Fruits, Grains</hi> and <hi>Seeds</hi>
will; for in them the pure sweet ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and spirits, are (as it were) lockt
up under the harsh Forms and earthly
Properties of the <hi>Original Poysons,</hi> and
therefore cannot be brought out to
manifestation, but only by the heat of

evils that happen through <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>thick
Clothing,</hi> and by <hi>Heats, Sweatings,</hi> and

their Clothes often. As for Example;
such as stay in the House in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to put on one sort of Clothes,
and when they go out to put off their
Coats and Wastcoats to their Shirt,
and put on fresh cold Clothes; and
then again in the After-noon or at
Night, when they stay at home, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43077:83"/>
have no occasion to go forth, to put
off their Clothes they went forth in,
and put on the others; which a little
custom will make so easie, familiar and
delightsome, and so refresh them, that
such as use themselves to such change
of Habits, will not be satisfied if they
omit it: And for others who are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to <hi>Sweat</hi> by their Labours, if it
be Extream, and more than is usual,
then let them at all such times put off
all their Clothes, Shirts and all, and
put on fresh Shirts and cold Clothing;
And for such as <hi>Over-Travel</hi> themselves,
and are sweaty and weary, let them
also put off all their Cloathing, and
put on fresh; but let both one and
the other observe to sit still a little
while before they either eat or drink.
Also, when you change your Clothes,
as to put on thinner or thicker, or
when you put on New-Clothes, which
generally are warmer than old, you
ought not to wear the thick or the
thin, the new nor the old constantly,
but to wear the new one day, and then
on the Morrow to wear the old or
thinner again, and so by degrees you
may wear either without danger to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43077:83"/>
your Health; for Nature, especially
when weak will not admit of suddain
alterations or changes, either inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or outwardly, without injury.</p>
               <p>But some will be ready to say, <hi>That
it is not only troublesom to change a Mans
Clothes so often, but also the ready way to
procure great Hurts by putting on old
Clothes when they are hot.</hi> And 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
this may at first seem very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper;
but if the matter be better
considered, our Directions will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
either unreasonable or unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
for does not every one, even
the most tenderest People, and such
as do often sweat a Nights, and lie,
ten, twelve or fourteen hours soaking
themselves as in an hot Bath, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Morning rise out of those close hot
Beds, and put on cold Clothes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any prejudice to Nature or catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cold? And if so, why then should
putting on <hi>cold Clothes,</hi> when they are
up in the cold open Air (which is far
more tolerable than the former) do
them any prejudice? Besides, the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on cold Clothes, provided they
be not wetor damp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is so far from
being an injury, that it is altogether
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43077:84"/>
the contrary; for this fresh cold Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shuts and closes up the Pores, and
drives the natural Heat more central,
which is the greatest security that may
be to Nature, causing a lively brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
through the whole Body, shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
the Appetite, and helps Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
enabling the Natural Heat to
withstand the attaques of outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences:
Is not this further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
in <hi>Swimming, Wading,</hi> and the
like? Do not such Exercises wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
beget Appetite? Which is for
no other Reason but by the <hi>Coldness</hi> of
the Water, which shuts the Pores,
and forces the Natural Heat more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
which does in a moments time
digest Crudities and cleanse the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
from all slimy superfluous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which did dull and fur the Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

the <hi>Sweet Quality</hi> I shall here
take leave to inform the Reader more
particularly of the Nature of the four
principal <hi>Tastes</hi> or <hi>Qualities,</hi> since the
knowledge thereof will be very useful
to all discreet Lovers of Health.</p>
               <p>The <hi>BITTER Taste</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> is
the Radix or central Fire in every
Life, whether in <hi>Animals, Vegetables</hi>
or <hi>Minerals,</hi> it hath the strong might
of the Fire, whence ariseth the <hi>Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Quality,</hi> which draweth together
the Water in the Air, and again dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateth
it, by which it becomes sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
distilling it self in drops and

be dignified with this Quality,
then have they strong Attractive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and great Heats, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
eat much, and are subject to
<hi>Wra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h</hi> and <hi>Fierceness,</hi> especially if the
Male Aspects and Configurations of
the Stars and Elements be awakened;
for then presently this bitter harsh fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Fire breaks forth, whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<hi>Thunder, Lightnings</hi> and <hi>terrible
fierce Storms of Hail, Rain, Wind,</hi> and
the like; and if it gets dominion in
the Hearts of Men, then follows <hi>War,
D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>solation of Countries, Burning of Cities,
Devastation of Towns, &amp;c.</hi> Also, this
Quality being incorporated with the
pure spirituous parts or vapours of
the Air, Clothes all <hi>Vegetables</hi> with a
pleasant lovely <hi>Green,</hi> but it does dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
some deeper, some more light,
all according to the strength of the
<hi>Salnitral Vertue</hi> in each Herb or Tree.</p>
               <p>If this <hi>Bitter Quality</hi> be temperate,
and dwell meekly in either Men, Beasts,
or other thing, then it is a most
friendly chearing Life thereunto; for
by its central and pleasant Heat, it
dissipateth all Malignity and Evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43077:86"/>
is the cause of all <hi>Ioy</hi> and the
<hi>Root of Motion:</hi> Therefore Men and
all other Creatures in whom this Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Quality is strong, are brisk, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
active and nimble; so <hi>Vegetatives</hi>
wherein the same doth bear sway, are
powerful Openers of all <hi>Obstructions</hi> in
the Body, of which the Antients seems
to have been sensible, by their attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
opening cleansing Vertues and
Qualities to <hi>Bitter Martial Herbs, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eds,
Fruits</hi> and <hi>Grains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is most true, that this is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Quality, and when it is temperate
in any Creature, causeth a pleasant
<hi>Noise</hi> or <hi>Emotion,</hi> which in Men we call
<hi>Laughter,</hi> in other things an <hi>Elevation
of Spirits;</hi> and when the <hi>Astringent,
Sour</hi> and <hi>Sweet Qualities</hi> do equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate,
gives the brisk lively <hi>Taste</hi>
to all Food, which renders it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasant and delightful to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and Stomach, but affords a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Nourishmennt that will never
tire the Eaters thereof, being soberly
used; For Equality and Concord main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their like Properties, both in the
Body and Mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:43077:87"/>
But this <hi>Bitter Spirit</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> hath
likewise in it another Species, <hi>viz.</hi> a
<hi>Fierceness</hi> and <hi>Wrath,</hi> which is a terrible
furious Spirit, and the House of Death,
a Corruption of all good, and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Life in Body; for if it be
too much elevated in Man or Beast,
then it presently enflames the central
Fires, whence proceed cruel <hi>Burning
Feavers,</hi> and other accute <hi>Mortal Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
for this Quality is the principal
Mother and kindler of the hot poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Fire in all Elements; and when it
too violently predominates in any
<hi>Herb, Fruit, Grain</hi> or <hi>Seed,</hi> they are
strong, fulsom, hot and bitter, not fit
for Food, nor indeed for Physick,
without skilful Correction; but if a
wise Artist takes them in hand, that
knows how to ally their fierce <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Poysons</hi> and <hi>hot bitter Fires,</hi> then they
prove excellent <hi>Medicines;</hi> and if any
shall mix such <hi>Herbs</hi> with their Drinks
or Foods, as some do unadvisedly, by
infusing of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> or the like, in
Beer or Ale, letting it lie too long, till
it becomes almost Rotten, by which
means the volatile Spirits become suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated,
then such Liquours will be apt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43077:87"/>
to awaken the bitter hot fulsom Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and prove hot and unpleasant,
and send dulling Fumes and Vapours
into the Head, prejudicing both the
<hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Brain.</hi> Nor can the wisest
<hi>Cook</hi> make proper and agreeable Foods
or Drinks of any thing in which either
of the four Qualities are extream; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they may by various mixtures
palliate and hide the Excess, and for
the present render them pleasant to
the Palate, but when the natural Heat
of the Stomach comes to separate
them, there still remains a <hi>Touch of
the old Relish,</hi> and they afford neither
a firm nor good Nourishment; and
should any Person be confined but a
Month to live only on them, he would
perfectly loath them, which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
that they are not natural
and wholsom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>SAITISH</hi> or <hi>ASTRINGENT
Quality</hi> is the very original matter of
every Creature in the four Worlds,
it attracteth or naileth all things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
'tis the Vestment of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the true Cloathing of Life
in all things, whether <hi>Animal, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:43077:88"/>
or <hi>Mineral,</hi> an harsh drawing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
which encompasseth and enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Life, Spirit and Power of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
material Being, whence proceeds
the Shell or Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which serves to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the more essential parts from
being evaporated, suffocated, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
violated: Thus if the Skin, Shell
or Body of any thing be any ways hurt,
then presently the most essential parts
are disturbed, and the Spirit of Life
suffers, and becomes wounded, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first and the last in all things;
and when this coagulating or saltish
Quality is temperate in any Creature
or Vegetation, being equally incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
or mixed with the Bitter,
Sour and Sweet Properties, it renders
it benign and pleasant, and operates
in number, weight and measure; for
'tis this sharp Quality that gives that
delightful pleasurable Taste in all
Meats and Drinks.</p>
               <p>But if this <hi>Astringent Quality</hi> be too
highly exalted, if it be in humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
It becomes a terrible Fiercess,
and inflames the bitter Root or Fire,
whence are engendred in the Body Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
of a tearing stoney Wrathful
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43077:88"/>
Nature, as the <hi>Gravel, Stone, Gout,
Palsies, Agues, &amp;c.</hi> or if it happen to
be inflamed in the <hi>Water,</hi> then it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders
<hi>Scabs, tedious Sores, Small Pox,
Leprosies, Dropsies,</hi> and the like; but if
it be violently enkindled in the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Quality,</hi> then follows <hi>Consump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>stings of the Radical Moisture,
Plague Sores</hi> and <hi>great Pox;</hi> or if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
in the <hi>Sour Property,</hi> then the
<hi>Palate</hi> forfeits its <hi>Taste</hi> and <hi>good Relish,</hi>
thence arises <hi>Loss of Appetite, Stoppages,
sour Belchings</hi> and <hi>Vapours, Windy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,</hi>
and cruel <hi>Obstructions of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi>
and <hi>Passages:</hi> And when this Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
happens in any sorts of Foods
or Drinks, then they are <hi>astringent,
harsh, sour, sharp</hi> and <hi>unpleasant</hi> both to
the Palate and Stomach, binding the
Body, and generating the <hi>Gravel</hi> and
<hi>Stone,</hi> and various other Diseases, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it finds matter in each Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
And though <hi>Cooks</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do by their divers Ingredients
and improper Compositions hide or
captivate this harsh Saturnine Fire, so
that it cannot be felt, or very little
tasted on the Palate; nevertheless
when the natural Heat of the Stomach
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43077:89"/>
has made separation, then the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
ill Juices become manifested and
exert their harmful Operations and
Effects, as all may know, if they will
but give themselves the leisure and
heed to observe it. For Example,
Take any kind of harsh astringent
Fruits, and allay them with <hi>Sugar, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
Spanish Fruits, Flower, Butter, Milk,</hi>
or any other Balsamick pleasant things,
and make it up together for Food, as
in <hi>Pyes, Tarts,</hi> and the like, then make
your whole Meals thereof for several
days together, and you shall certainly
find an unpleasant sour keeking or qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
gnawing or griping at your Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
as if it were always unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>The <hi>SOVR Quality,</hi> when it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
opposeth in any Creature, or
other thing, then it opposeth all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
both of the <hi>Bitter, Sweet</hi> and
<hi>Astringent Properties,</hi> being of a cooling
refreshing nature and operation, it
makes an excellent temperature, giving
a most pleasant Taste to all sorts of
Food, causing them easily to ferment
and digest, so that they become, as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43077:89"/>
well the most pleasant as the wholso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
of Foods, being a quick lively
powerful Quality, the true Habitation
and delight of the pure Spirit; but if
this Quality be too weak in any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then they are dull, sottish and
heavy; if in Foods, unpleasant, and
apt to cloy both Stomach and Palate;
but when it is too highly elevated, it
engenders Sadness or Melancholy, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a stink, or Putrifaction and Rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in all <hi>Animals</hi> ane <hi>Vegetables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>SWEET Quality</hi> opposes the
other three, being an amiable, blessed
and pleasant Property, comforting and
refreshing every thing; 'tis an <hi>Asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
of <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Fierceness,</hi> a <hi>Calmer</hi>
of <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Tempests,</hi> and gives all
things their pleasant and friendly Look,
affords the pure spirituous fragrant
Taste in <hi>Vegetables,</hi> whose fair, yellow,
white and ruddy Colours do all from
hence proceed; 'tis a Glimps of the
<hi>divine Ray,</hi> a Qualification of <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Mercy,</hi> the sweet <hi>Solace</hi> and <hi>Ioy</hi> of every
created being; and when it is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and moderate in any thing, bearing
a gentle sway over the <hi>Martial</hi> and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43077:90"/>
                  <hi>Saturnine Properties,</hi> then such Creatures
are Sanguine, of Friendly Dispositions
and Temperatures, of tractable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Inclinations, and all Meats and
Drinks in which it does a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate,
are endued with Concord
and Equality, as <hi>Bread, Milk, mild Ale,
Beer well Brew'd and fermented, Cyder,
Wine sufficiently allay'd with Water, &amp;c.</hi>
such <hi>Foods</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi> do by consent
administer a proportionable Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by equal Portions to all parts
of the Body; for this good Quality
does sweeten and allay the bitter hot
Fires of <hi>Mars,</hi> and opens all the doors
of the Melancholy Astringent Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of <hi>Saturn,</hi> by its friendly Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>But still this amiable Property doth
contain a fierce <hi>wrathful Poyson,</hi> which
is the <hi>Root and very Center of every Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
for if there were no harsh nor
fierce wrathful <hi>Fire,</hi> there could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be any <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> and when
this lurking Poyson is too violently
kindled in the <hi>bitter</hi> Quality in the
Element of Water, then it engender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
many Disorders, as <hi>botchy S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es</hi> and
<hi>Leprosics,</hi> which quickly corrupt the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43077:90"/>
Flesh; but if it be kindled by the <hi>heats
of Mars,</hi> then it infecteth the Element
of <hi>Air,</hi> and occasions a suddain and
spreading <hi>Plague,</hi> that corrupts all in
a moment. So when this Quality shall
too violently bear sway in Foods and
Drinks, they thereby become <hi>heavy</hi> and
<hi>dull,</hi> apt to <hi>clog</hi> both the <hi>Appetite</hi> and
the <hi>Stomach,</hi> hot in operation, making
the <hi>Blood thick</hi> and <hi>sharp,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Spirits impure, the Senses
stupified, the Understanding clouded,
the Joynts loaded with pernicious
Juices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which it appears, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
any one of the <hi>four Qualities</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned,
does too violently
predominate, or is inflamed, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
kindles or awakens the hot <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
astringent Poysons,</hi> whether it be in
<hi>Animals</hi> or <hi>Vegitables,</hi> so that the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Fires</hi> which lay hid or captivated
in the <hi>sweet Oyl</hi> begin to burn fierce,
and appear in their own Form. Most
People that enjoy Riches and Plenty
may know this by their daily <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
as when they have drank freely
of Wine or strong Drink, doth it not
first too violently burn up and waste
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43077:91"/>
the sweet Oyl and pure volatile
Spirits? Its either by Evaporation or
Suffocation, and thence follows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Heat, so that all the Body burns
with a burthensom and unnatural
Flame; whereas before the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
drinking of such unequal Liquors,
all the Body and Members were cool,
brisk, and full of Life and Pleasure;
yet the same fierce <hi>wrathful central Fires</hi>
were then <hi>as strong and powerful,</hi> only
they lay hid or captivated in the <hi>sweet
Oyl,</hi> and pure <hi>spirituous parts,</hi> which
is the <hi>Moderator</hi> of those <hi>central Fires,</hi>
but when by Inequality or disorder
that <hi>sweet Oyl</hi> or <hi>Humor Radicalis</hi> is
wounded, then these original Poysons
appear, and manifest themselves in
their fierce Forms and Natures, which
so long as the good Vertues were
strong, they could not do; for these
<hi>four Qualities</hi> are set in opposition to
each other, that thereby the fierceness
of each may be temper'd and mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that so all Creatures, <hi>Animals,
Minerals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables</hi> might be
brought to a fit temperature, by the
embracing and incorporating of the
said Qualities each with other; for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43077:91"/>
the <hi>sweet</hi> Quality opposeth and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
the <hi>fierce</hi> Elevation of the <hi>Bitter,
Astringent</hi> and <hi>Sour,</hi> and maketh an
Harmony, resulting from them all;
and the sour Quality opposeth the
fierceness of the bitter, sweet and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringent,
being their cooling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
Life; So again the saltish or
astringent Quality makes an excellent
Temperature in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tter, sweet and
sour, as the bitter Quality opposing
the excess of the other three, reduces
them to Equality, making them more
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>easant and gentle in their operation.
Therefore all sorts of Food and Drinks,
in which any one of those Qualities
are too highly exalted, become unequal,
and the predominate quality presently
incorporates with its <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> in the
Body, and thereby discompose it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the Health and Harmony of
the parts. But on the other side, all
mean simple Meats and Drinks, in
which the Properties are near equality,
and have no manifest Taste that does
too violently predominate, do by Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
embrace and incorporate with
their Likenesses in the Body, equally
distributing proper Nourishment to all
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43077:92"/>
parts and Members, which makes the
whole Lightsome, full of Joy and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
if this were understood, a little
practice of Temperance would make
many loath themselves for their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
and their continual affronting of
Nature, causing her to lose that simple
innocent Way, wherein she delights to
walk to Health and Felicity.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Drinks, and particularly of

               <p>I Now proceed to speak of the most
usual Drinks at this day used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, especially such as are esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
most Cordial, and prescribed many
times in a kind of Physical way for
Diet, or in order to the preventing
or remidying of Diseases; and because
the Richest of our Drinks is <hi>Canary,</hi> I
shall begin with that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CANARY</hi> (commonly call'd <hi>Sack</hi>)
is a brave noble Juice or Cordial, one
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43077:92"/>
of the most excellent Drinks in the
World, far transcending any <hi>Cordials</hi>
prepared by the Apothecaries, or any
Juice which the best of Flesh affords;
the same being enriched with the <hi>choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
Vertues of Nature,</hi> being too rich for
common Drink, but nothing more
cherishing and reviving, if taken on
special occasions, when Nature doth
require a Recruit; and indeed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of those that first brought it into
<hi>England,</hi> was for no other use: And
therefore the first Ingrossers and Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thereof were <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> who
sold it again to their Patients in small
quantities, as by the Advice of <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
which then was of good use for
the comforting and chearing sick weak
decay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d People, it being endued with a
brave <hi>Balsamick Body,</hi> yielding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of pure subtle Spirits; its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
Quality stands in the Sweet
Body, therefore ought not to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
drank in times of Health, its
Vertues being too great for common
use; for that which is extraordinary
good in season, may prove of ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
when used unseasonably; for
the common use thereof dulls the edge
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43077:93"/>
of the Appetite, weaknes the natural
Heat of the Stomach, and spoils the
Concoction, and for that reason a very
little will satisfie those that drink
much of this Cordial Liquor; besides,
it replenishes the whole Body with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
Humours and evil Juices; for
all sorts of Wine are Extreams, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

                  </gap>ceed in
the best Property of Nature, yet the
frequent use of such high graduated
Drinks may prove as prejudicial to the
Health and Strength both of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Spirits, as things of meaner
Vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, nay, much more harmful;
for all Extreams, or things in which
any Property of Nature is too highly
advanced, ought to be taken very
sparingly, and as Physick rather than
Food.</p>
               <p>'Tis a dangerous Error to imagin (as
most People do) <hi>That the sweeter and
richer Drinks and Foods are, whether
simple or compound, so much the better or
stronger Nourishment they shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fford.</hi>
Whereas the clean contrary is true;
for nothing can maintain the Body
and Spirits in good Health and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
but such Meats and Drinks as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43077:93"/>
are simple, and nearest the Equality.
For Drinks wherein the Spirit is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant,
if not taken very seldom
and sparingly, are apt to destroy the
action of the Stomach, and to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
with their <hi>similes, viz.</hi> with
the pure natural Spirits, and balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
Vertues in the Body, causing them
to burn too violently, so that an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
or suffocation of them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
therefore although whilst such
spirituous Drinks are in operation, all
the Spirits of him that hath drank, are
in an hot Rage or Tumult, and he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
all Sorrow, Modesty and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and by the awakening an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Motion of the Spirit, skips like a
Wild Asses Colt, and Sings and Rants,
and becomes brisk and Jolley, and in
his own floating Imagination <hi>as Great
as a KING;</hi> yet when a little Sleep
has quell'd this Tumult and dissolv'd
these Fumes, you shall find the poor
Creature with much fewer Spirits and

the strong spirituous Liquor has
made upon his natural Spirits; and this
is a sure Demonstration, which all

                     </gap>ue Topers</hi> cannot but subscribe to and
confirm from their own wretched
Experience.</p>
               <p>Moreover, all <hi>Rich sweet Wines</hi> and
<hi>Cordial Liquors,</hi> if frequently drank,
though not the degree of disturbing
the Brain, do yet heat the Blood, and
put it into a kind of disorderly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and set the <hi>Gate of Venus</hi> open,
and makes <hi>Men</hi> too <hi>Effemenate</hi> and <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>

agreeable to our Northen Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
therefore if healthy People will
drink <hi>Wine,</hi> they ought to allay it with
<hi>Water,</hi> and then it makes a Drink
more equal and more wholesom, <hi>viz.</hi>
two thirds Water and one Wine. And
for such as are weak, sick and fainty,
if they would have <hi>stronger Cordials</hi>
than our own Country affords, let
them drink some <hi>Wine,</hi> which is the
choicest of <hi>Cordials,</hi> and higher gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated
in Nature than any other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
that can be made by Art; but if
Men and Women addict themselves in

health to guzzle down the Richest
Wines daily, as many Thousands do
now a days, what must they have for
Cordials in their Sickness? for their
Bodies being so habituated to <hi>Wine,</hi>
that will have no operation to help
them. Shall they take <hi>Brandy</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
Spirit of Wine?</hi> Alas! this too
they have already made their common
Drink, and <hi>Wine</hi> is long since become
too <hi>cold</hi> for their destroy'd Stomachs,
even when they are in the best Health
they are capable of; and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Vsquebath</hi> are scarce able to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
out so much warmth and activity
to the natural Heat, as to digest a small
Dinner: Now when such People come
to be sick, (and to be sure long they
cannot continue well) what <hi>Cordial</hi>
shall be prescribed for them? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the learnedst Doctor in <hi>Europe</hi>
cannot tell, unless he should make
them swallow two or three Ladles full
of <hi>scalding Lead, boyling Pitch</hi> or <hi>flaming
Brimstone:</hi> They are at the end of
Nature, and therefore cannot arrive
any higher; for those that drink <hi>strong
Ale</hi> and <hi>Beer</hi> in <hi>Childhood,</hi> their Nature
shall require <hi>Wine</hi> in their <hi>Middle Years,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:43077:95"/>
and <hi>Brandy</hi> in <hi>Old Age;</hi> for Nature as
it grows old, becomes weaker and
colder, and so requires more hot spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
Drinks; and therefore Wine
and such strong Liquors are drank with
most advantage by the Aged.</p>
               <p>And if Children and Young People
be used commonly to drink <hi>Water</hi>
(which will be most for their Healths)
then <hi>Small</hi> or <hi>middle Beer</hi> or <hi>Ale</hi> will be
as cordial to them, and warm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them as much in their <hi>middle Age,</hi>
as <hi>Wine</hi> will, that drank <hi>strong Ale</hi> or
<hi>Beer</hi> in <hi>Youth.</hi> And to speak truth, no
sort of Drink does maintain the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and natural Heat in such vigour and
strength as mean Liquors, <hi>viz.</hi> such as
are of the middle Nature, or nearest
the Temperature, <hi>viz. good Water,</hi> or
<hi>well-brew'd Ale</hi> or <hi>Beer</hi> of a middling
strength, or <hi>Wine</hi> allay'd with <hi>Water,</hi>
as aforesaid. But now, most are grown

                  </gap>aunches
satisfaction, but such Drinks as are
strong, hot and unequal in their Parts,
which indeed is like themselves; for
ever since man hath suffered his desiers
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43077:95"/>
to enter into <hi>Discord,</hi> he cannot but
desire such disagreeing <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks,</hi>
for <hi>every Like desires its Likeness,</hi> and is
its highest Joy; <hi>Inequality</hi> begets <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
and <hi>Concords Peace.</hi> Therefore
all plain simple Meats and Drinks, are
for certain of the greatest strength and
vertue, and the only maintainers and
continuers of Heal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And English People have need of no
other or better Drinks and Cordials
than may be made of our own <hi>Seeds,
Grains</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> as <hi>Ale, Beer and

               </p>
               <p>But if too frequently drank alone,
as the custom of most is, then it heats
the Blood and fumes into the Head,
and after a little custom of drinking,
is so far from being a <hi>Whet,</hi> (as our
Tavern-haunters, to excuse their
Morning-Debauches, call it) that it
dulls the edge of Appetite, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Concoction, and breeds the <hi>Stone</hi>
or <hi>Gravel</hi> by its sharpness and heat,
and yet at the same time purges power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
by Urine, by reason of its pure
thin spirituous and Balsamick Vertues,
but notwithstanding that Torrent of
Urine, it leaves behind it an hot harsh
or gretty Substance, which in some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or Complexions doth generate an
hard stoney substance; and indeed all
sorts of Drinks or Foods in which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hear or sharpness doth predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
are not proper nor Healthy to
be frequently drank or eaten; for all
such things do by degrees awaken and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43077:98"/>
strengthen their like Properties in the
Body, stealing on them, as it were,
insensibly, till such matter hath gotten
strength, then presently they put Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into an unequal Motion; for which
cause all <hi>Old Wines,</hi> (which some so
much love and commend) are injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
for the longer any Wines are
kept after they are fit to drink, the
clearer, sharper, brisker and hotter
they become; for length of time does,
as it were, digest or waste the sweet
Balsamick Vertues, by which they
become more sharp, harder and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the strong original Spirit: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all <hi>Old Wines</hi> and <hi>Stale Drinks</hi> do
more heat the Body, and sooner irritate
and awake the natural Heat, than
New; it being a grand Error for any
to imagine that <hi>New Wine</hi> or <hi>Ale</hi> is not
so good or wholsome, or does not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
so proper a Nourishment as <hi>Old
Wine</hi> and <hi>Stale Beer;</hi> for indeed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is far to be preferr'd before the
latter; for the milder, sweet and
friendly any Drink is, the more true
Nourishment it affords both to the Body
and the Spirit; and the Reason why
such Liquors do not so soon and so
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43077:98"/>
much heat the Body and irritate the
Spirits, is because <hi>New Mild</hi> or <hi>Sweet
Liquor</hi> contains more of the balsamick
Body, which does qualifie, and as it
were captivate the fierce original Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
so that it can hardly be tasted or
perceived. Not but that in all New
or Balsamick Drinks, whether <hi>Wine</hi> or
<hi>Ale,</hi> there is contained a far greater
quantity of Spirits than in <hi>Old Wine</hi> or
<hi>stale Beer;</hi> for the more gentle and the
sweeter any Liquor is, the more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
it contains, as all that are versed in
Distillations well know; for such as
make Spirits of <hi>Mault-Drink</hi> do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
distil <hi>Ale,</hi> not <hi>stale Beer.</hi> And so
in boyling strong sweet <hi>Wort,</hi> it shall
waste more in quantity in one hour,
than <hi>small Wort</hi> will in three; And
wherefore is this? Only because the
strong sweet Wort has a greater Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
mild, friendly and Balsamick, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a larger quantity of pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that will not endure the Violence
of Boyling without Evaporation.</p>
               <p>Likewise, the older any sort of
Drink is, the leaner it becomes; for
as the sweetness digests by length of
time, so the original hot fierce Spirits
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43077:99"/>
seem not only to be more in quantity;
but stronger too, but it is not so, only
the sweet pure Body or friendly Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is weakned or digested by long
keeping, which was the Allayer or
Moderator of this hot Spirit; for a
quart of <hi>New Ale</hi> contains more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
than a quart of <hi>stale Beer</hi> that was
<hi>originally</hi> of like strength and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the same is to be understood of
<hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old Wine,</hi> and other Drinks.
For which Reasons we conclude <hi>New
Wine</hi> is far more wholsome, healthy
and agreeable to Nature than <hi>Old;</hi> And
<hi>Ale,</hi> when well-brew'd, and according
to the Rules set down in our <hi>Way to
H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>alth, &amp;c.</hi> is to be preferred before
much boyled or stale Beer, and so of
other Drinks, especially by all such
People as are subject to the <hi>Stone</hi> or
<hi>Gravel,</hi> who must observe to drink
mild gentle friendly Liquors, that are
neither sharp, keen nor hot in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as <hi>middle Ale, Water</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and
<hi>Water.</hi> The same Rule they ought to
follow in their Food; for some sort of
Victuals are altogether as apt to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Gravel</hi> as any sorts
of Drinks, if not more; Therefore
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43077:99"/>
all such Foods and Drinks as are of a
middle Nature, and nearest the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is endued with an hot sharp

for such as by their Complexions are
any thing subject to the <hi>Stone,</hi> it will
help forward the generation thereof;
for though this <hi>Wine</hi> doth naturally
purge by <hi>Vrine,</hi> yet there is in it an
hot or harsh Quality, that heats the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43077:100"/>
Blood and congeals the Humours with
a <hi>Saturnine</hi> or gretty Substance; for all
sorts of Drinks and Foods in which
the hot sharp Quality does predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
are friends to the generation of
the <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Gravel:</hi> But as every

if wisely handled; so if this sort
of <hi>Wine</hi> be discreetly mixed with <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

of the best sorts of Drink, not only to

               <head type="sub">Of Claret, its Nature and Operation.</head>
               <p>CLARET is a good Stomach-Wine,
of a brisk chearing Operation, the
moderate use thereof helps Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and begets Appetite, but it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
not so much by Urine as White-Wine,
being of a rough or harsher
Nature, but of the two more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>English</hi>-men's Stomachs; if
healthy strong People drink frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of this Wine, 'tis apt to make
them fat, phlegmatick, especially such
as therewith use little Exercise, as
Gentlemen, Citizens, and the like;
for no Creature, Man or Beast, will
be fat, except they be given up to Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Superfluity; 'tis true, some
People, and some Beasts will with the
same Meats and Drinks be more full
and fleshier than others, but not
fat: Others that use Exercises, and
but ordinary Food, seem to be fat, but
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43077:101"/>
for the most part the same is a Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as watry dropsical Humors, which
in some puff up the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>embers and swell
the Body; but the chief reason Claret-Wine
makes Gentlemen, Citizens, and
the like, fat, is for want of Exercise,
and by its agreeableness with the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
which sharpens the Appetite,
and opens the Vessels by its rough harsh
quality, whereby they are inticed to
eat great quantities of fat rich Foods
and so passing their time without due
labour, they become over-grown with
Fat, like cram'd Capons (their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Dish) or Swine in a Stye.</p>
               <p>Yet it must be acknowledgeded, that
Claret is the best of Wines, for those
that eat abundance of fat Flesh and
succulent Foods, for by its rough keen
quality, it digests and separates such
oyly Foods, as many of our <hi>English</hi>
Epicures too frequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly gormandize,
which milder sweeter Liquors cannot
do, as <hi>Canary, Ale,</hi> or the like; for
this cause many that eat such fat Foods
and Sawces made with Butter, do so
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:43077:102"/>
But yet they are to know, that the
frequent use of such Drinks will wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the natural Heat, so that by degrees
the Appetite of such People grows
dull, and the Vessells of the Stomach
are contracted, and then their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
will desire still more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quanties, and to drink them oftner,
till at length Health is utterly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and Nature debilitated; for
(I cannot say it too oft) the frequent
use of all spirituous strong Liquors,
being unequal in their parts, do in a
little time beget the like Inequality in
the Elements of the Body, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of preserving Health destroy it;
for there cannot be a better thing than
a glass of Claret, or a dram of Brandy,
or the like, now and then when Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have eat too much in Quantity, or
Foods too fat or gross in Quality;
but I know no necessity for those Spurs
and Helps, except to such as lead idle
gluttonous Lives, but for others who
feed on plain simple Foods and middle
Drinks, and use proper Exercises, and
keep within the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Claret before Dinner as a Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43077:102"/>
nor a dram of Brandy after for
a Restorative of their natural heat, to
help it concoct their simple natural
Foods; for such innocent natural Diet
will maintain the natural Heat in great
Vigour, especially if the friendship and
advice of <hi>Temperance</hi> be observed; but
if Temperance be wanting, then the
necessity which men do thereby bring
upon themselves by drinking of <hi>Claret,</hi>
does sufficiently revenge it self upon
their <hi>Bodies</hi> as well as <hi>Purses;</hi> for it
<hi>heats the Blood, sends Fumes up into the
Crown, destroys the vigour of the Natural
Heat, awakens the central Fires, makes
the Stomach</hi> (by its continual use) <hi>flat
and dull;</hi> by which means, Drinkers of
this Wine can fast long, neither can
they eat heartily with Appetite, except
they do fast a considerable time, which
gives a further occasion to a <hi>phlegmy
Fatness,</hi> which many of its common
Drinkers are subject unto; for those
Persons that are of the <hi>Phlegmatick-Melancholly,

               <p>Note further, that those that would

Cyder than ordinary, ought in
some degree to observe the Rules as
are usual in Brewing, <hi>viz.</hi> not to press
your Apples too hard, as commonly is
done, but to half press them, and then
put them by for a <hi>smaller Cyder;</hi> for
the first that runs off, when you do
but gently squeze your Apples, (as
flowing almost of its own accord) is
much sweeter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more balsamick
than that which is pressed forth with
violence from the harsh centre of the
Fruit, and consequently is stronger
and more Spirituous, as from the
Mault, that liquor or Wort which
runs off first is many degrees better
than the latter; for though it must be
confessed, the case is not altogether
the same, because the Mault has passed
through several Digestions, which have
open'd the <hi>Closset of Saturn,</hi> and set
the <hi>sweet spirituous Quality</hi> at liberty,
just upon the Wing, by which it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
gives forth its good Vertues, yet
the Analogy holds in Apples and other
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43077:105"/>
Fruits (<hi>for Nature's Operations are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hend the whole Chain</hi>)
for if you observe, you shall find, that
any sort of Fruits will, when any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
is offered to them, first give
forth their more sweet Vertues and
pure spirituous Qualities, as if you
bite a piece of Apple, will not the
sweeter and more pleasant Juices be
extracted first? And so by degrees
yield that which is harsher and more
unpleasant? The astringent Properties
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and the hot bitter harsh Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of <hi>Mars</hi> are the first and last in
all Vegetations: The same we find in
the Stomach (<hi>Nature's Laboratory</hi>)
does not she separate and extract all
the Balsamick and good Vertues first,
to the supply of Nutriment for all
parts of the Body? As you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
if you give your Stomach any
occasion of <hi>Casting,</hi> if it be within an
hour or two after you received your
Food or Drink, then it will be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
sweet, very tollerable, and come
up easie, but if this Puking happen long
after, as sever, eight or ten hours,
then it will be very nauseous, bitter,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43077:106"/>
sour, and of various Colours, as <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
Green,</hi> and the like, whereby 'tis
evident that the bitter parts are drawn
away first.</p>
               <p>So if <hi>Apples</hi> be pressed hard, there is
forced out an hard, harsh, astringent,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our Property, which may cause such
<hi>Cyder</hi> to ripen sooner, and be thereby
fit to drink in a shorter time, but it
will also cause it to fret, or become
of a keen sharp Nature, and often cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it to <hi>sour,</hi> more especially if such
<hi>Cyder</hi> shall be put on a fresh ferment
by Carriage; either by Land or Sea.</p>
               <p>Now to know when you have drawn
enough from your first gentle pressing,
the best way will be to taste your Juice
as it comes from the Press, and when
it begins to taste any thing harsh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
or bitterish, then hold your
hand as to that, and keep the Juice of
the latter pressing by it self, as Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Housewives do their latter
Wort.</p>
               <p>If this course be duly observed, your
first running from the Press will make
a <hi>Noble Balsamick Cyder,</hi> altogether as
good as <hi>White-Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

better than either of them for
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43077:106"/>
our <hi>English Bodies,</hi> If drank tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.
And as it will be thus much
better than your <hi>common Cyder,</hi> so it
will keep longer from being sour,
sharp or eager, and consequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
more friendly to Nature.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Another, or new way to make Cyder.</head>
                  <p>Take the first or second Juice you
press out of your Apples, and put it
into a Kettle or Copper, and make
it ready to boyl, or boyling-hot, but
not boyl, then put it into Coolers for
that purpose, as you do in Brewing
Ale or Beer, and when it is at the
degree of coolness, as is usual for
Wort, when set a working, then put
a convenient quantity of Yeast of Barm
to it, and let it work, observing the
very same Method as is done in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and tunning up <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Ale,</hi> and
when it hath done working stop it
close up.</p>
                  <p>This will be a brave full-bodied
wholesom <hi>Cyder,</hi> keep very well, and
drink pleasant and mellow; for this
heating and fermentation does digest
that crude phlegmy Quality which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43077:107"/>
makes <hi>Cyder</hi> drink lean and sharp,
from which also it often gets a sour
Quality.</p>
                  <p>But if you would have your <hi>Cyder</hi>
to keep long, or draw as <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Ale</hi>
does, and not grow flat for a Month,
two or three, then when you have
heat your Juice or Liquor, as aforesaid,
so that it begins to be hot, put in
what quantity of good <hi>Hops</hi> you think
fit, and let them infuse a full half hour,
but let it not boyl, and then strain it
as you do Wort, and put it into your
Coolers, and when cool set it a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as before directed; But therein
observe two things, 1. That you do
not let it stand too thick in your Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
2. Nor put it in to working be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be sufficiently cold; for if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it is not so good as that which is

pleasing to the Palate of many People,
especially such as have dull flat crasie
cold Stomachs, but as I have told you
already, no stale Drinks, whether <hi>Wine,
Cyder, Beer</hi> or <hi>Ale,</hi> are so homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and profitable to Nature as those
that are Newer, provided they be first
sufficiently fermented; for the longer
any fermented Liquors are kept after
they have obtain'd to proper ripeness
and clearness, the harder, keener and
sharper they grow; and therefore are
not so agreeable and friendly to Nature
as milder, fatter, or full-bodied
Drinks; for every thing being come
to its mature Age, does by degrees
tend towards the centre, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline;
for there is no standing still
in the operations of Nature. Thus
in all Drinks the keeping them a
proper time after they are made does
digest a gross phlegmy Quality, which
would make it drink fulsom or nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Palate and Stomach, which
a little Age consumes, even as it comes
to pass in all Herbage, as <hi>Hay,</hi> which
when new cut down is sweet and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43077:108"/>
in comparison of what it will be
when it has lain half a year or more
in the Rick or Mow, but if such Hay
lie too long, <hi>viz.</hi> three, four or seven
years, then it becomes dry, harsh, and
of less Vertue and Substance, and in
no respect so good, as in its proper
time: So when fermented Drinks have
reached to a proper degree of Age,
or digestion of the more unpleasing
and phlegmatick Juices, then if it be
continued much longer, it goes as fast
backwards towards its Original, and
the sweet Body or Balsamick Vertues
are by degrees wasted, and as it were,
eaten up by the fierce hungers and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
properties of the dark original
Forms, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Saturnine</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

fierce Qualities of Nature are always
and in every thing the first and the

               <p>One of the chiefest Reasons why the

caused by the common eating of <hi>Opium,</hi>
which ill custom most of them art sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

the Eaters thereof by awakning

found out this way to Debauch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with eating of <hi>Opium,</hi> whose
Poyson by custom and frequent use
they have rendred easie and familiar
to them, as also they and most of our

the stupifying fumes</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> which
<hi>Opium</hi> and <hi>Tobacco</hi> send up into the

for the Invention of this Liquor was
not for any pleasure, as most other
Drinks have been, as <hi>Wine, Ale, Beer,
Cyder,</hi> and many others, which do not
only exhilerate the Spirits, but are of
a most pleasant Taste; whereas <hi>Coffee</hi>
altogether on the contrary, is very
distateful to the Palate.</p>
               <p>Would Men but be so kind and

Some there be that will make Sallads of
hard Cabbage, but they are but very
indifferent ones. Nor do I know any
way of Preparation that can make an
hard white Cabbage wholsome: Many
People admire it for its whiteness;
but though the pure <hi>White</hi> colour in
some things is of excellent Vertues,
it is not so in this, because it is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for it to be so, but it comes to
pass by Accident, that is, because the
friendly Element, the Air, hath not its
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43077:118"/>
free Circulation and Influence in and
through it which causeth it to be so
<hi>white;</hi> whereas its natural genuine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is <hi>Green.</hi> And therefore, if you
please to observe it, all white hard Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages
are more fulsome, and of a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
nature and operation, either raw
or boyled, than your open hollow
greenish Cabbages, and harder of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
and the Liquor in which they
are boyled is more nauseous, and will
sooner putrifie and stink than that in

young green Colworts and Cabbage-Colwots,

makes the whole body lightsom. The
same method you ought to follow in
making all sorts of <hi>Gruels</hi> and <hi>Herb-Pottages,</hi>
be the Herbs of what Nature
they will; for the <hi>boyling</hi> of <hi>Herbs,</hi>
not only in Pottage, but for any other
use of Food, was not invented by wise
Seers into the <hi>Arcana</hi> of Nature; for
it does, as it were, totally destroy the
pure volatile Spirits and balsamick
Vertues, as also the strong warming
Properties thereof. For this cause,
<hi>Raw Herbs</hi> are much better, affording
a firmer Nourishment, better Blood
and purer Spirits, and feel more warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Stomach than boyled; nor
are they so apt to loosen the Bowels.
But if any shall make <hi>boyled Herbs</hi> their
Food, though they prepare them by
dressing them with <hi>Butter,</hi> and the like,
they will prove phlegmatick, cold and
windy, with other evil Properties,
and not afford half so good a Nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment
as if they were Raw; nor are
Raw Herbs more Windy than boyled,
as some People, not for want of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
suppose, but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;

Herbs does naturally resist all crude

assisting the natural Heat and helping
Concoction; they give Life to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,

by such as have dull flat Appetites;
for when such shall come to a good

revive a Stomach and good Taste,
whereas before they could relish no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
Also, they help to digest and
carry off all heavy fat or gross Food,
and make it less hurtful, insomuch that
some have been thereby cured of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Phlegmatick Humours that offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Stomach, and consequently sent
Fumes up to the Head, causing it to
ake. Therefore this was the way the
wise healthy long-lived Antients pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
their Herbs, who made them
one of their principal Foods; but now-a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
days People do scarce eat them but
as Sawce. And as boyling of Herbs
does destroy the purer Vertues and
firmer Substance of them, so that they
become phlegmy, cold and windy;
The same is to be understood in all
sorts of <hi>Herb-Pottage,</hi> whether for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43077:123"/>
Food or Physick; for boyling any sorts
of Herbs does in a Moments time ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffocate or evaporate the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Spirits of them, and then all the
sweet pleasant opening cleansing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are gone, and they become like
<hi>Beer, Ale</hi> or <hi>Wine,</hi> that has lost its
pure Spirits, which is further eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by that strong nauseous or fulsom
Taste, ill Smell and dull Colour, all
such boyled Pottages have, so that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few care for eating them, unless
they are forced to it, as they are to
Physick that is against their Stomachs.
For the pure sweet pleasant Taste and
lively briskness of all things resides in
the power of the Spirits; which all
Housewives and Preparers of Food
ought to consider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and understand, as
also the degrees of the Fire, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Water, and that the Water be
in sufficient quantity, and that the Air
have its free circulation, and to give
it true time, or else none can prepare
any kind of Food without prejudice;
for in the sweet and spirituous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
stand the healing nourishing
Vertues, which will not endure any
violent Heat or unequal Motion.</p>

               <p>THe best, proper and most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

seasons, as we have taught in our <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to Health, &amp;c.</hi> Then dry them in the
<hi>Sun,</hi> and put them into close <hi>Paper-Baggs;</hi>
and when you would use them,
take such a quantity as you think fit,
and put them into a Linnen Bag, and
hang the same in your Bear or Ale
when it is a working or fermenting,
for two, three, four, five, six, seven
or eight hours, and then take it out.
(But if you would make <hi>Wormwood-Drink,</hi>
then you ought not to let it lie
so long, for of that 3 or 4 hours will
be sufficient.) And thus if your Herbs
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43077:125"/>
be rightly gathered and ordered as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>foresaid,
all their good, pure and
Balsamick Vertues will as easily and
readily give themselves forth into the
<hi>Beer, Ale, Wine,</hi> or other Liquor,
whatever it be, as the pure sweet spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
Quality in Mault does into the
warm Liquor when you Brew, which
is performed in one hour to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But as in this Example, if after
you have put in your Mault you should
let the Water or Liquor remain six,
eight or ten hours before you draw it
off, then the pure sweet spirituous
Quality will become suffocated, and
such over long continuance thereof
will awake or irritate the phlegmy
gross nauseous Properties, which
would, as it were, totally destroy all
the good Virtues, as every one that
can but Brew a peck of Mault, may
know by experience. So the very
same is to be understood in infusing
any sort of well prepared Herbs; for
in such dryed fermented Bodies or
things, the purer Vertues do stand as
it were external, and when they are
put or infused in any proper Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum
or Liquor, they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43077:125"/>
forth, first with all readiness,
because the Essential Vertues of every
thing consists in the volatile Spirit,
and balsamick or sweet Body, which
is an hidden flying Vertue, whence
the true Colour, Smell and Taste do
proceed: And therefore great care
ought to be taken in all Preparations,
that this benign Vertue be neither eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
nor suffocated; for then the
thing will presently tend to Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and become a Nauseate and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Nature. The Learned are
Men of Tongues, and so they may
talk at their pleasure, but I do assure

               <p>Yet still, our common <hi>Salt</hi> is a

as the World goes, for those that eat
<hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish;</hi> for it contains several

lively, but the first exceeds and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all sorts of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish</hi> that do
lie or are kept long after salted, do
prove pernicious to such as eat them;
for by length of time the corrupt parts
of such <hi>Flesh</hi> does with a greedy hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
eat up and destroy both the pure

<hi>Salt,</hi> and also of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and then
such <hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>Fish</hi> cannot be call'd back
or recovered by a fresh salting, or any
other Art, to its former state; and
the reason is, because in such <hi>corrupt
Flesh</hi> there is no simile for the second

it will proceed to Putrifaction in
de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Body and Blood, and is one great
cause of the SCURVEY; It also spoils
and loosens the <hi>Teeth</hi> and eats away
the <hi>Gums:</hi> But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ef</hi>) may be salted two, three
or four weeks, and if smoaked, it will
continue good longer, and therefore
the order used in <hi>Bacon</hi> is very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
for <hi>Salt,</hi> where it is moderate in
food, doth quicken the Appetite, and
makes the Stomach brisk and lively,
especially for those who by some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
or Intemperances have woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their Health and hurt the Essential
<hi>Salts,</hi> which makes the Palate dull, and
the Stomach flat and unrelishing, and
then People cry,—<hi>My Stomach goes
against both Food and Drinks;</hi> more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
they are averse to all such
Meats or Drinks as are compounded
or made by Art: But others, as for
Example, <hi>fair Water,</hi> they can best
take, it being more simple. The like
is to be understood of <hi>Foods;</hi> but there
is hardly any Food so simple in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
as <hi>Water;</hi> indeed <hi>Bread</hi> is a
brave, mild, simple, friendly Food,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43077:130"/>
but the mixtures in making, and the
manner of common Baking does alter
the case, and make it nothing so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as <hi>Water;</hi> therefore <hi>Water</hi> in all
states, both <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Sickness</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and delightful to the <hi>Palate, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi>
and all the <hi>Senses.</hi> For it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that if you eat sweet things
<hi>Water</hi> is grateful after them, or any
other Foods of extream Tastes, but
other compounded or fermented
Drinks are not; which does commend
<hi>Water</hi> to be the cleanest and complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
drink of all others, and that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may and can drink it with delight
in Sickness, and when the Essential
<hi>Saits</hi> have lost their savour, and also
shews that the disease did not proceed
from any of its Qualities; for when
such Loathing and Distempers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from Meats or Drinks, as most
commonly it does, then the Stomach
and Palate do perfectly abominate all
such things. Thus in all or most sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
People chuse <hi>Water</hi> before <hi>Beer,
Ale, Cyder</hi> or <hi>Wine,</hi> and for Foods
had rather eat Bread, Fruits, and the
like, than <hi>Flesh, Butter, Cheese, Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
&amp;c. and most had rather eat
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43077:130"/>
                  <hi>Fish</hi> than <hi>Flesh,</hi> the reason is, because
in Health they seldom eat <hi>Fish,</hi> and
so the Disease did not proceed from
thence.</p>
               <p>Likewise Salt is a brave addition to
<hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheese,</hi> to preserve and keep
it from putrifaction for a convenient
season, but all sorts of <hi>Vegetations</hi> are
highly to be esteemed, for that they
have in themselves the <hi>Essential Salt,</hi>
sufficient to preserve them a long time
from falling into corruption; but that
which is most to be admired is <hi>Oyl,</hi>
which tho' it be of an unctious fat
Nature, is yet so pure, and void of
offensive matter, that it may be kept
good several years, nor can the best
salting preserve <hi>Butter</hi> half so long.</p>
               <p>Here you are to understand, that all
sorts of Food that quickly tend and
turn to putrifaction are not to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so good as those that by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Vertue and <hi>Essent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are far more strong, firm and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

or rather greater, but the gross phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Body overcomes it, and as soon
as the Sensitive Life is destroyed, the
good Vertues are in a moments time
dissipated and tend to corruption, and
though it be <hi>sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed,</hi> yet the <hi>Salt</hi> doth
not, nor hath any power to extinguish
or purge forth this gross Body of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
but the Spirituous parts of
the <hi>Salt</hi> do incorporate and joyn with
the Essential parts of the Flesh, and
captivate the gross body for a season,
that it cannot proceed to putrifaction,
but in length of time, viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> two, three,
four, five, six, seven or eight months,
the gross body continuing so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and the more pure parts or Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sial
<hi>Salts</hi> both in the Flesh and <hi>Salt</hi> do
by degrees waste, suffocate or evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and then the Original fierce Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
forms of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> grow
strong and powerful, and with a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hunger quickly destroy all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
good Vertues, and then all
falls into Corruption, from which
there is no recovery. And indeed so
powerful in <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish</hi> is the gross
Phlegmy Corruptive part, that there
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43077:131"/>
is no way found that can continue it
very long from Putrifaction; the best
course to preserve it sweet, sound and
wholsome is to dry <hi>Fish</hi> very well,
and the same may be done with <hi>Flesh,</hi>
but with more difficulty, and this is
far the healthiest way. But I know
no reason why People should be so
fond of this sort of morose Food, or
sustain any such difficulty to preserve
it so extraordinary long, since the
Lord our Bountiful Creator has in a
superabundant manner supplied and
furnisht us with varieties of brave,
noble, friendly and most fragrant sorts
of sound healthy Foods, easily provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
and which may in all particulars

Nature.</p>
               <p>To conclude this matter—<hi>Salt</hi>

Inclination. Thus the wise and
wonderful Creator, has endued every
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43077:146"/>
thing with an attractive and influential
Vertue; it is not therefore the gross
Body of your Poultice, that will do
your Business, that is full of corrupt
and poysonous humours, which are
awakned by the long continuation
thereof, for these Reasons, the long
lying of Poultices and Plaisters, on
Wounds and Sores, have no better Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
then the long continuation or
standing of the Liquor on the Mault
in your <hi>Mash-Tub,</hi> which if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
more then two, three or four
Hours, it will spoil and corrupt the
whole, for First, (as I said before)
the fine sweet Volatile Spirituous Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
imbibes or incorporates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the hot Liquor, and then
if there be not a separation made in
two, three or four Hours, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it off, but the applycation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
then there will soon awaken
another Quality of a gross harsh sour
keen Nature, which with a rapid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tinges or transmutes all the fine
sweet healing Vertues into their own
Qualities, which all Brewers and good
House-Wifes are sensible of; the like
is to be understood in the applycati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:43077:146"/>
of Poultices and Plaisters, do not
their long lying of them on the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or sore part, cause them to
smell sour and stink, when they have
been continued on for twelve or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four Hours, which do not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the part, and prolongs the
Cure, but it puts the Patient to great
pain and Torment, and often the
Limb is cut off, and sometimes the
Life too, which by this forementioned
method might have been prevented;
for if Physitians and Chyrurgeons do
not understand Nature, then there
can be no certainty in their Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Cures.</p>
                  <p>Also Note, that during the time
your Poultices, Plaisters, Ointments,
or Salves, are making on the Fire,
that you keep them stirring, by which
you keep the fine Spirits and Qualities
Living, for by this stirring, the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
powers and thin Spirits of the Air
do penitrate the whole Mass or Body,
which incorporate and assist the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and good Vertues, and keep them
from being Stagnated or Suffocated,
the Air being the Life of all things,
and where its friendly influences and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:43077:147"/>
circulations are prevented, the Life
and Spirits becomes heavy, dull and
gross; for these Reasons, all Spoon-Meats
made thin, are sweeter and of
a more quick penetrating Operation
and Digestion, then those made thick,
therefore despise not our method,
nor our plain home-bred Poultices, I
could produce many living Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of its Success, but it is needless,
since every Man's Experience that

of what is here delivered, nor I am

and when they have done, let them
alone, take and use them too if they
please.</p>
               <p>2. Those that shall observe the
<hi>Rules</hi> herein laid down, of <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Choice of Diet, due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

very confident) have little or no need
of that which is commonly called
<hi>Physick.</hi> And for others, if I had
set down never so many excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
for the cure of Diseases, 'tis
like they would have regarded them
no more than these Directions for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding

the same. He that scorns to
prevent a Mischief fore-told, scarce
deserves a Remedy when he is fallen
into it. But,</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>discreet Reader</hi> will here
find such things recommended to his
use, both in <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Sickness,</hi>
which though they are more plain,
pleasant, easie to be had, and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
are not less effectual both to
preserve and restore Health than
those administred by the learned;
and in vain he <hi>goes about,</hi> that
may go to rights; or gapes for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
to be brought him by another
from the <hi>Indies,</hi> when he may make
himself as good an one (and better)
at home.</p>
               <p>What I have here candidly, and
in a plain familiar manner deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I leave to <hi>God's Blessing,</hi> and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43077:149"/>
the Practice of all <hi>prudent Lovers</hi>
of their <hi>Health,</hi> and humble followers
of <hi>Nature,</hi> in her easie and innocent
Methods. Farwell.</p>
