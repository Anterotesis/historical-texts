            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Commonwealth of Rome; and whether she could be better ordered
in Civil affairs, having Armed people on foot.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many, who reflecting upon the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> wonder
at her so many prosperities, by which she
flourished a long time, and at last obtained the
mastery of all other Monarchies: And think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it is enough to admire her feats of
Arms, and management in Peace, do not care
for enquiring into the reason thereof; so as
ballancing thereby every of her several ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
they may know what they were that
were truly worth praise and imitation, and
what blame-worthy and to be avoided. But
certainly these men seem not to know, to how
many and how great and various accidents all humane works are subject, and what
the true rule and measure is whereby the perfection of States is comprehended: For
that is not simply the greatness of an Empire, to which she at the beginning riseth
by Fortune, and which is increased by Injustice; but that may well be said to be
the true Form of Government, by which people living in peace and union, may
work righteously, and obtain Civil felicity. He therefore who will judge aright of
the actions of that Commonwealth, without suffering his eyes to be dazeled wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h
the splendor of the Roman greatness, let him consider them nakedly, as void of that
reputation which Antiquity and the power of Empire purchased them, and he will
find some things peradventure amongst the many for which she worthily deserved
to be cryed up by all men, which are more to be observed for the amendment of
present Governments by their example, then for imitation, out of hopes of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59987:11"/>
any true praise or apparent good. But as there is nothing of greater importance
in a City, then the Form of Government, by which, as by the soul thereof, every
good act is produced; so of all other observations which may be had of the City
of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is not any more worthy, or of more use, then to examine what was
the truest Form of her Government, that we may afterwards see whether she might
have been be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter ordered in Civil affairs then she was, without disordering her <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia;</hi>
and whether she could keep together the People armed, and obedient to the
Laws. To know then what the condition of her Government was, and thence to
comprehend whether that supreme excellencie were in it, as hath been thought by
some men; following the Rule which Philosophy teacheth us, which says, that every
Form of Republick is not convenient for every City, but that they must be varied
according to the divers natures of the people, and according to other accidents;
we must examine what that State was in it self, and then what proportion it held
with that City. But because it would be too difficult a business to assign any certain
condition unto her, which may equally correspond to all times, she not having so
punctually observed one and the same Form continually, but varied it somewhat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
as it inclined more or less to a Popular State; we must have our eys most
fixt upon that Age, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ein the glory of that Commonwealth did most flourish;
not so bearing notwithstanding to touch upon such things in other times, as may
conduce to our purpose.</p>
               <p>He who would diligently consider all the parts of the Republick, will find not
only so much diversity, but even contrariety in them, as he will not be able easily
to resolve which was her properest Form of Government: For if respect be had to
the great Authority of Consuls, especially in Armies, we may, not without reason,
believe, that that City under the name of a Commonwealth, was governed with
Laws befitting a Kingdom; since that Form of Magistracie did use such Autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity
in managing of Arms, in concluding Peace, and in agreeing differences between
potent Kings, as one onely Prince could hardly have treated of those thing with
more absolute power: differing from Monarchy only in this, that they kept this
Authority but for a short time, and did acknowledg it to proceed from the will and
favor of the People. But he who will consider what a share of the most important
resolutions of the Commonwealth the Senate had, as that which governed the
publick Treasury, the chief foundation of a State, and to which the priviledg did
belong first to treat of, and then to resolve of such things as were to be propounded
to the people, will be of opinion, that such a Commonwealth did lean more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Aristocracie, then any other Government. Yet passing on to further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
and finding the Authority of Consuls, Senate and Tribunes to be so
often baffled and nullified, and the Supreme Magistracies oftentimes contaminated
by the meanness of popular men who have had the exercise thereof, will vote other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and think the Government to have been meerly Popular. Wherefore <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
being willing, in the sixth Book of his Histories, to assign some certain Form
of Government to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> would not restrain it under any one particular
Form, but called it a mixt Republick, as was that of <hi>Sparta.</hi> Which opinion is
sithence followed by some modern Writers, who treating of the differing Forms of
Commonwealths, and particularly of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> do punctually agree with <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi>
And certainly they were thus far all in the right, to wit, That the divers
manners of Rule by which that City was governed, could not be expressed by any
one name. For what gives the true Form to a City, but the communication of
Government? which as it is participated by Citizens, makes such alteration or
mutation in a State, as the Philosopher was of opinion, that though the City did
totally remain the same, the variation of this only was able so to metamorphose it,
as it cannot be said to be what it was before: For it is not the Walls, nor the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59987:11"/>
but the Form of Government which makes it be so. Therefore he who will
determine the Form of a City, must have respect to whatsoever doth therein help
to the attaining of Magistracie, that he may infold all parts that belong to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of a Commonwealth. So as since men of all conditions, according to the
divers respects either of Liberty, Nobility, Wealth or Worth, were admitted into
Government, these divers communications will not admit the ascription of any
peculiar or particular form.</p>
               <p>Agreeing therefore herein with <hi>Polybius,</hi> we will now endeavour to find out
what is more hard to know, and is better worth knowledg, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what sort of
mixture this was. For though a mixt Commonwealth may be perfect, it follows
not, that all mixtures may make her so; nay rather where several differing parts
are wound up together, so as a third kind of nature is produced by their connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
such a composition will rather increase the imperfection of the State, and be
the reason why it cannot long continue under such a disproportionate mixture.
And as it falls out in our bodies, which being compounded of four Elements, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
so long in life, as that proportion is maintained, which when it is destroyed,
they are likewise wasted and corrupted; (For that part which becomes too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
changeth the rest into its self, and dissolves the form which they made when
all together:) So that Commonwealth which is composed of divers parts, may
continue in one and the same State, as long as the Authority of Government is
proportioned with equal temperament, as it ought to be, to each part. But as soon
as any one part begins to domineer too much, it is apparent that she grows towards
corruption: For the prevalent part by consuming the rest, doth by little and little
reduce them all into its self, and alters the aspect of the City. Therefore such a
disposition is required to this Form of Government, as no disorder may be therein
found whereby that mixture may be broken or confused. Wherefore as divers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
concur together to the forming of Man, but are notwithstanding so well
ordered in that union, as all of them partaking of some office or other, they have
their several degrees of dignity; so divers Citizens reduced to live together in one
City, though all of them may in some sort participate of Government, yet the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mployments must be diversly disposed of, so as some of them may hold the first
place, and as certain primary Causes, must give motion to other things which are
done in the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>These considerations being applied to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> will make it appear
clearly that there was no such equality nor order in her, as is to be desired in a mixt
Commonwealth to render it excellent, and long lived. For the immoderate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which was by the Laws granted to divers Magistrates, but much more
the extraordinary power which was intrusted in many Citizens, shews how ill
that so necessary proportion was observed in her: And on the other side, the
Peoples power, and the admittance thereof without any difference to all manner
of Negotiations, gives manifest tokens of a confused disposition, all Orders being
mixt together without distinction either of Office or Degree, and the baser sort being
oftentimes exalted above the more worthy. Hence it was, that amongst such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
many customs might be introduced, which were not onely corrupt, but
even contrary one to another; as was that of prolonging the time of Magistrates,
which was repugnant to the great Authority which was reserved to the people;
and that other of suffering the wealth of private men to increase to such a height
in a City, where there was no prefixt boundeur of wealth appointed by the Laws
for being a Citizen: Which Laws or Customs do some of them tend to the
power of a few, and other some of them are proper for a Popular State. But if we
proceed further, we shall find their disorders so far advanced, as not being able
to consist together in one subject, they were the occasion of that Commonwealths
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59987:12"/>
dissolution. The confirming of their Authority, whose Magistracy was by the
usual time appointed by the Laws exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was introduced at first with some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of advantage, but with very bad example, for that having begun im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
affairs in Countries far off, they might finish them, and weaken the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
before their return home. Thus was the charge of the Province lest to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Fulvius,</hi> who fought in <hi>Asia</hi> against <hi>Antiochus,</hi> after he was out of the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
the which was done likewise to <hi>Gneus Manlius</hi> to bridle the daring <hi>Aetolians,</hi>
and to appease the affairs in <hi>Greece,</hi> and the like upon many occasions was done to
divers others, and very long in ensuing times, with very pernicious example, but
the disorder ceased not here, for, without need, the City Magistrates were so far
prolonged, as the same were seen to return ten times to be the peoples Tribunes.
Which made the Citizens infinitely ambitious, and afforded them occasion by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so long in Power, of plotting many things, and of molesting the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
divers waies by the peoples Insurrections. Nor was it less prejudicial to
permit private men to grow to such immoderate riches, as equalling therein the
most Potent Kings; there was a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> who arrived to such greatness,
as he said, He ought not to be esteemed rich who could not out of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
maintain an Army: Whence it arose that the Nobility, being much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
and suspected by the people, the way was opened to the <hi>Gracchi</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
those hemous disorders which ended not but with the utter ruin of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p>Provision was long before hand by the Law against such disorders, <hi>Licineus</hi>
the Tribune having instituted, so to curb the Avarice and Ambition of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that no Citizen should possess above Five hundred Acres of Land; But these
Orders in Civil Affairs were so weak and imperfect, as one Law might easily be
broken, by introducing a contrary custom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Nobles therefore little esteeming
the Licinean Law, did very much increase their wealth, and fraudulently usurping
the publick Territories, which were wont to be kept for the benefit of the people,
brought in Forainers to manure them; so as the people being become very poor,
and seeing the Nobility injoy all the fruits of the common labor of the Militia, did
very unwillingly suffer such an injury, and did very willingly listen and adhere unto
any one who would feed them with hopes of bringing things to a just equality;
wherefore such as were seditious took occasion to try Novelties, so as at last in
the times of the Gracchi, recourse must be had unto Arms, and civil Differences
must be thereby decided: which (as shall by and by be more clearly shewn) might
have been long before foreseen; for such Customs did much disorder the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
not onely in that they partook not of civil modesty, but by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clean contrary to the Laws of that City, which lent most towards a Popular
State, all Authority being given by them to the People in their suffrages, and also
in the most important State-resolutions. So as it seemed respect was only had to
the liberty of dividing the Government amongst Citizens: All places of Magistracie
were equally common to all, and small means kept not any one far from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
they might marry togeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, Foreiners were easily made Free Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;
the Tribunes had power to nominate all Magistrates; the manner of living
was not free, but very licentious: And the supreme Authority of the Tribunes doth
of all other things most cleerly shew what that Government was, who being greatly
respected and reverenced by all men, and called by the superstitious title of <hi>Sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sancti,</hi>
they were so insolent in their office, as a Tyrant could hardly have used more
severity in his commands. See how boldly a Tribune of the People made <hi>Marius
Viola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

head-long down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock, for no other reason, but that in a Speech which
he had made, he used some harsh words against the People. But the Tribune <hi>Sulpitius</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59987:12"/>
using more violence, came one morning into the <hi>Piatza</hi> with many armed men
and driving away the Consuls who would have opposed such an action, made <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

went against the Laws, which not being in any thing observed, all good Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were made in vain, whilst the Laws were violated and destroyed by the Tribunes
too great power. He then who shall consider these things, will not say that they
tended not to the making of a Commonwealth totally Popular; yet many things
were contrary to these, as hath been considered in perpetuating the Government
of the Armies, and in the excessive Riches of some Citizens. Some Popular
Commonwealths, as that of <hi>Athens,</hi> used by a quite contrary advice, to ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh
such Citizens ten years from the City, who did for some excellent quality far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the rest; In some others, because they did in some sort partake of populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the equallity of means, or levelling was introduced, so to content, and please
the people, as in <hi>Sparta;</hi> and certainly to grant but a limited power, and but for a
short time, to Magistrates are excellent precepts of such Legislators as will consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
a free City; For so all the Citizens may have their share of Government, but
none freely dispose thereof, to his own proper use, and then indeavour to bring
things to an equality, or at least provide so, as they may not increase so immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
as any one Citizen may be envied or suspected by the rest, for his too great
Power.</p>
               <p>It is then no wonder, if <hi>Rome</hi> were much divided, since these things were not
observed in her; for by such a diversity of Orders she became a Body with two
Heads, and of two several shapes, which occasioned continual domestick disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in her. For the Nobility glorying in the dignity of Consulship, wherein they
used great Authority, and which they for the most part kept amongst themselves,
and being also proud of their wealth, would usurp all the Government to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
And on the other side, the people, bearing so great a sway in all things,
and relying much upon the Magistracy of the Tribunes were so insolent, as they
would acknowledge no obedience, nor bear any respect to the Laws, or to the
Magistrates thereof; but would resolve all things according to their own fancy,
and as made most for their advantage; which made that City, which was so
potent in Military and Foraign Affairs, very weak in such as were Civil and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick;
for such a division of power in men of contrary minds, keeps the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the City, with much prejudice divided; whilst the one of them contest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the other, they hinder the resolutions and executions of important
Affairs, as it often fell out in <hi>Rome,</hi> for necessity urging to list Forces to
march against the Enemy, the Tribunes were presently ready to incense the
people, so as there was none that would give a name to the Militia, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies
were increased by the peoples being able to do it safely. For, the
Tribunes minding nothing else but how to make their Faction powerful, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of the Appeals of every popular man, though in unjust causes, to the end
that the people might be the more respected by the Nobility, and more ready and
bold to raise seditions, whereby they did always increase their power, and had by
these means obtained many things from the Senate. The Nobles likewise, no less
sollicitous to increase their authority, that they might keep back the Peoples inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
sought always to keep them low, and did with like endeavours maintain those
of their own Order in all Judgments. So as in punishing or in absolving of faults,
it was oftentimes a thing of greater consideration, whether the party concerned
were a Nobleman or a Plebeian, then whether he were guilty or innocent: And
hence great prejudice arose unto the Commonwealth; for all Justice was soon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
without which no good Order can be kept; and each Party, valuing the
publick welfare but a little out of a desire of their own greatness, the City was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59987:13"/>
oftentimes into eminent dangers. Thus the Roman Plebeians, thinking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
that they had not a common Country, but that it did only belong unto the
Nobility, forsook it, and retired into the <hi>Aventine;</hi> valuing more the increase of
their own power, by necessitating the Senate to yield to their desires, then their
putting the City into such a disorder. The Nobles likewise more sollicitous to abase
the People, and to increase their own fortunes, then to preserve peace and union in
the City, did nourish Civil discord by usurpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g the Common goods, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the People to great Poverty through Usury.</p>
               <p>By this discourse it may be comprehended, how badly proportioned the Orders
were in that mixt Government: But it may be more cleerly seen, by comparing
this Commonwealth with that of <hi>Sparta,</hi> which proved more excellent then any
other in that mixt Government, and preserved it a long time free from all discord,
by vertue of her most excellent Laws. In <hi>Sparta,</hi> the Princes power ended not but
with his life, to the end that he being preferred before all others for making the
Laws be observed, he might the better do it, being detained by no self-respect from
deposing of Magistrates, or from being judged by the People. But his Authority
was notwithstanding so limited, as he was rather a <hi>Custos</hi> of the Common Liberty,
then a true Prince in the City. The People had as great a share in Government, as
their condition required: For it being they who were to make use of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
it seemed they might better know their abilities; as we see it falls out in
other Trades, that the excellencie of the work is better known by him that is to use
it, then by the maker thereof. The People had the power given them of choosing
and of correcting Magistrates; but greater authority was granted to the Senate,
which was placed as in the midst to defend the Commonwealth from the Princes
power, and from the peoples insolencie, to the end that thereby it might the better
temper the one and the other. Now let us see how in the joint union of these three
Governments, certain Conditions were appropriated unto every of them; but
neither so many, nor yet such as made them of clean contrary qualities, but so as
they might very well be united in one and the same person. The Prince had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity
of power; but this stood so corrected by the Laws, as it might easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with the other States. The Senate, which was made up of Forty eight of the
prime Citizens, represented a true Aristocratical Commonwealth; but because they
acknowledged their Dignity from the People, their power was not such as bereft
others of their Liberty. But the Peoples authority in ordering rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as it was not dangerous, so it afforded place for a modest Popular State, and
rendred that Government more perfect, by mixture of all the three best. But above
all things else, there was a miraculous proportion observed in <hi>Sparta,</hi> in sharing out
those things, which use to cause Civil dissentions amongst Citizens: For the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had the greatest part in Honors, but the People were equal to them in Wealth,
all the Revenues being in common; so as the ambition of the one, and the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of the other were satisfied, and all of them being content, they enjoyed much
Peace and Tranquility, so as that Commonwealth may endure longer then any of
the antient Reipublicks. And if at the first she had been a little more large in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
her Government, by encreasing the number of her Senators, so as there
had been no occasion in <hi>Theopompus</hi> his time, for the better regulating their too
great Authority, of introducing the Magistracy of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> whereby the City
began to be a little too popular, and leaving <hi>Licurgus</hi> his antient Institutions, gave
it self over to licentiousness, nothing could have been desired in that City to have
reduced her to the highest p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tch of perfection. Therefore as far as the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
differed from this, it must be confest it fell so far short of true excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
The Consuls of <hi>Rome</hi> had great Authority, and it may be more free then
became any Magistracy in a Commonwealth, but the little durance thereof made
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59987:13"/>
it less beneficial to the the Republick: For their Power being soon to be given
over, made them less diligent, and less bold in undertaking Publick Affairs: For
Consulship being laid aside, the way was opened of revenging private <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

by the Tribunes. So <hi>Cicer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> who freed his Country from <hi>Catalius</hi> Conspiracy,
when he was out of Place, was banished. But the Senate, because it had not any
Ordinary Magistracy, from whence no Appeal might be made, by which is might
curb the Peoples Insolency, had not that respect given to it, by which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
common people is Governed: So as the people, not being held back by this
Bridle, ran into such l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>centiousness, as they dared to commit divers Indignities
even against the chief Magistracy of Counsulship; as they did when they plucked
the Consul <hi>Camillus Hestare</hi> from the Tribunal, that they might by force ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
to that Supream Magistracy. The weakness of the Senate was likewise the
occasion of the increase of the power of some Citizens, for the peoples resolutions
prevailing over the like of the Senate, the way of ariving at great power by the
favour of the people, in despite of the Senate, was opened to such as were ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.
Thus did <hi>Marius</hi> cause himself to be declared Consul, contrary to the
Laws, and <hi>Caesar</hi> to be confirmed in his Province: And to suppress these mens
immoderate greatness, which tended towards Tyranny, it was requisite (since
the Commonwealth had no usual means to do it) to prefer other Citizens of the
Nobilities side, whose greatness proved afterwards no less pernic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ous, then that of
those whom they thought through their Authority to suppress, wherefore the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
became wholly divided; so that private injuries were with horrid cruelties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
by <hi>Sylla,</hi> though he professed to vindicate the Common welfare: And
<hi>Pompey,</hi> to maintain his Greatness put rubs in the Treaty of Agreement with
<hi>Caesar:</hi> Wherefore betaking themselves to Arms, the Commonwealth could
not at last but fall.</p>
               <p>These disorders were occasioned through the weakness of the Senate: But
the people, possessing themselves of other mens Places, usurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
would without any respect to other things purtake equally of Government.
So the right disposure of the Honors and Orders of the City were confused, which
require Geometrical, and not Arithmetical proportion, in such sort, as the same
things be not granted to all men, but to every one that which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for him. And certainly to constitute a City of that form, as all her
Citizens should be equal, would be no better then to make a Consort of Musick
consisting all of the same voyces; for as the latter produceth no true Harmony, so
doth no good concord result from the former. Therefore care must be had, that
every Order may keep its own state, and be neither too much exalted, nor too
much abased, lest the too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

seen to fall out in <hi>Rome,</hi> where this just proportion was but badly kept, people of
unequal condition and worth, being oft times made equal in Dignity, which caused
a Government full of confusion and disorder, not bounded in any one Form, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to receive all Forms.</p>
               <p>But if we will assign any particular State to the mixt body of this City, as
predominate over the rest, there can be none more properly given her then
popularity. Which though it may be already comprehended, yet it will be
better known by passing to some other more particular considerations.
The state of the Commonwealth is known by observing in whom the chief
command is found, but the majesty thereof appears clearly in the creating of
Magistrates, in making new Laws, or repealing old ones, in making War,
in disposing of Rewards or Punishment: All which things being by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
examples seen to lie in the power of the People, do evidently witness
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59987:14"/>
that the State of this Commonwealth was Popular. The People were they who
gave authority to Magistrates, nay even to the Senate it self, by authenticating and
invigorating the Resolves thereof; and as the soul of that Government, they did
in divers manners move the other parts of the Commonwealth in their operations.
So as her truest and properest Form can only be taken from them; nay, it was seen
that the resolutions of the Republick did bind the Senate, and were of equal force
with the Peoples commands, prolonging Magistrates in their places, and by the
authority thereof putting a period to begun Wars. Wherefore the corruption of
a Popular State may be further seen, by the immoderate power of the meanest
Citizens.</p>
               <p>Let us next view the ultimate end of that Commonwealth, which by a certain
ordinary, and as it were natural change of condition, will shew us what her first
Form was. For it being changed into Tyranny, which usually ariseth from a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
State, it appears that that City was formerly governed by the People, and
had by corrupt manners opened the way to Tyranny; so as this Transition was
easily made by the likeness of State: For, that City where the People commands
with licence, may be said to be subject to many Tyrants; nor admits it of any
change, saving that one man becomes the master of those disorders, which a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
were masters of. There were likewise always many popular Pick-thanks in
<hi>Rome,</hi> who, like the Flatterers of Tyrants, tracing the People in their humors, went
a birding after favors, whereby they won credit and preferment. Which, as the
Philosopher says, is a manifest sign, that in such a City the People command, not
the Laws. Which is seen by many experiences, of which <hi>Marius</hi> was an evident
example; who being born of very mean parents, and appl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing himself from the
begining to the Government of the Commonwealth, not guided by the glory of his
Predecessors, or any noble action of his own which might first introduce him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into,
but confiding in a certain greatness of spirit, began to think of acquiring great
power, so as being become Tribune of the People he betook himself wholly to abase
the authority of the Nobles, as he did in publishing the Law of Suffrages, threatening
Consul <hi>Cotta</hi> to imprison him, if he forbare not to oppose him. By which boldness
he won so much favor with the People, as he was able to dispose of them afterwards
as he listed in any affair, how unjust soever, or in working revenge upon his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
(as he did in banishing innocent <hi>Metellus</hi>) or to aggrandise himself; insomuch
as he, contrary to the Laws, was created Consul, against the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and in a contumacious time; and lastly in making the Province be assigned
unto him, which belonged to <hi>Sylla.</hi> By such means the way was opened to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
power of Citizens, which in the height of their prosperity brought that
Commonwealth to its final ruine. For these disorders being long before begun,
were afterwards by the spaciousness of the City so in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eased, as the People being
become powerful by reason of the numerousness of the Citizens, and growing more
free and bold by their so many prosperities, not content to be equal to the Nobility,
would become greater then the Laws. They banish'd many Citizens without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cause; they granted places of Magistracie before the usual time; they
confirm'd the Authority of those that were already out of it, and disposed of all
things, not according to civil equity, but as they liked best. Which things do suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
manifest the imperfections of that Government: For the Philosopher
says, that that State where the People command, and not the Laws, is so corrupt,
as it deserves not the name of a Commonwealth, no sort of Government being to
be thereunto assigned. Which easily happens in Cities which are very great and
powerful, as was that of <hi>Rome.</hi> But i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we shall then consider the Conditions of those
men into whose hands that Government was put, we shall thereby likewise find,
that amongst the several Forms of Popular States, this may be thought the most
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59987:14"/>
corrupt, as that whereinto even Artificers were admitted: which being usually but
ill conditioned, and frequenting Assemblies only that they may talk together, do
constitute an imperfect State, and subject to alterations. And hence it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
that this part being most prevalent in that so corrupt and imperfect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
the others must partake of the same imperfection: For no such union
can be framed out of two good Governments, and one very bad one, as is requisite
to give form to a good Government; neither could they continue together for never
so small a time. Whence it may be likewise inferred, that those other parts of the
Commonwealth, which may seem to resemble Monarchy and Aristocracy, as the
Consuls and Senate, came short of such perfection as is proper to those States, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to the contrary party For many things may be observed to have been done
by Consuls with more authority and boldness, then what became a Commonwealth.
To pass by many other examples, <hi>Caesar</hi> being confirmed in that power which he
had received as Consul, usurped the Liberty of the Commonwealth. There were
likewise many corruptions in the Senate, which shew how subject that part was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to various disorders: For when the Commonwealth was at the very height of
her perfection, Senators were become so mercenary, as <hi>Iugurth</hi> having corrupted
many of them, and purchased his own sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ety by monies, it may well be said, that
the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> would have sold their City, if they could have met with a
Chapman for it. Another Consideration may be added, to wit, That that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
cannot be said to be well ordered even in the very Popular State which
she so much affected: For it is easie to frame any Government for a short time in
any whatsoever Estate; but the sufficiencie of a Law-maker, and the excellencie of
Laws, is found by the long continuance thereof, Therefore those Orders by which
the Peoples authority was too much increased, cannot be said to be truly Popular;
but such may be so esteemed, whereby the State is long preserved. Wherefore
many things being ordered in <hi>Rome</hi> without this temperance, in favor of the People,
they of themselves bereft the State of all solidity. Thus Licentiousness of living,
frequent Meetings, Appeals to the Tribunes. Freedom in accusing, and other such
things as seemed to be done in favor of the People, served for the building up of
Tyranny, and wrought <hi>Romes</hi> final ruine. Which was formerly seen in <hi>Athens;</hi>
which being constituted by <hi>Solon</hi> in a too Popular condition, soon lost her Liberty,
and was possest by a Citizen of hers named <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> who followed the same way
which the Legislator himself had opened unto him, by attributing too much to
the People. So what is intended for good, proves often, fatal, if not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
               <p>But having discoursed sufficiently of the Form of the Government, it will not be
amiss to examine some other more general Conditions, by which the perfection of
every State may be the better known. In ordering a City, respect is to be had to
two things; to what belongs to War, to what belongs to Peace; to the end that
she may not be governed by Chance in either of them, but by certain Laws, and
may be equally preserved from forein plots, and from home discords; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
that as she cannot always enjoy Peace, so she should not be continually
molested with War. But he who will consider the Actions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the
Institutions of their City, will find them so seriously addr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st to Military affairs, as
he may easily judge that they proposed no other things to themselves, then how to
increase Empire, by making one War beget another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore many Armies
were instituted, and many rewards for military valor, to make men bold and valiant
against the Enemy; but not any thing wereby to accustom them to Justice, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and to other civil vertues, whereby the City might be maintained in peace
and unity. 'Tis therefore no wonder if that Commonwealth won so much Empire,
and such Glory in times of War; and in times of Peace, like rusty Iron, lost all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59987:15"/>
her lustre: So as troubles from Enemies abroad were no sooner ceased, but much
greater were excited at home by dissentions amongst the Citizens, which did not
terminate till things were recalled by occasion of War to the same Warlike order
and discipline in which the City was excellently well instituted: Which might for
a while preserve her; but when through the want of occasion of War, she could not
by that means correct her many disorders, nor reduce herself to any setled condition
for any space of time, being still agitated by storms of Civil sedition, she must at
last be miserably lost, when it was time to begin to enjoy her greatness and prosperity.
For this cause <hi>Scipio Nasica,</hi> a very wise man, would not consent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> knowing that that Commonwealth which was ordered
onely for war, could not last long in idleness. How can that Government then
be termed good, which is so ill disposed towards the attainment of a Cities chief
end? And who can doubt but that the true end of a City is to have her Citizens live
vertuously, not the inlarging of her Empire? Therefore the Philosopher said
well; <hi>That true civil Felicity was not to be expected from astions which relate to
things abroad, but from those which are used amongst Citizens.</hi> It argues not then
an excellent Government in that Commonwealth, that she overcame the whole
world, since the perfection of Government lies in making a City vertuous, not
in making her Mistress of many Countries. Nay the increasing of Territories, as
it is commonly coupled with some injustice, so is it remote from the true end of
good Laws, which never part from what is honest. Governments which aim at
Empire are usually short lived; which denotes their imperfection: Which happens
not onely because they were not better accommodated in times of Peace, but that
for the great inlarging of Confines, it is necessary to nourish ambitious thoughts in
Citizens, and such as are too desirous to domineer, which are easily turned to the
prejudice of the Commonwealth its self. For it is not to be affirmed that the
same thing can be good in respect of the publick, and bad in private Affairs. For
the general felicity of the whole City, and the particular good of every Citizen,
is one and the same thing, they onely differ in some certain respects. Then taking
ones argument from these things, the end of this great Commonwealth might
easibly be conjectured, which (as one said well) <hi>was overthrown by the wait of its
own bulk.</hi> But grant, that the lives of such States may be prolonged, it cannot
certainly be done without falling upon many other troubles and dangers. Let
<hi>Marius</hi> his example serve us to see what advantage Citizens got by the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
desire of Glory and Dominion; who being alwaies bred up in Arms, and
having wone Credit and Preferment thereby, finding that his antient Reputation
began to fail by ensuing Peace, raised <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> against the
Commonwealth, to the end, that being to make use of his Vallor, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his former Repute. Thus <hi>Athens</hi> who once in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oyed a peaceful condition,
under <hi>Pericles</hi> his good Government, when she turned her endeavours of Peace
and Quiet, to Arms and Dominion, and would change her manner of life, she
reaped the like Fruits of Ambition, which by such Orders she had sowed in the
minds of her Citizens. For <hi>Alcibiades</hi> out of too immense a desire of Glory, was
he, who of himself did incite the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> against his Country, by whom she
was afterwards robbed of her Liberty and Empire. For all this, you hear me not
say, that the study of Arms ought to be neglected, which are very necessary in
what soever State, to defend ones self against the Injuries of Neighbors, and to
preserve Freedom and Liberty: Nay, <hi>Aristotle</hi> reprehends <hi>Plato,</hi> for that he
thought Cities had no need of Arms at the first; but onely when they began to
have Dominion. But though they may be useful for some other respects, Citizens
ought not to fix their studies so much upon Military Exercises, as not to know nor
value any other praise but that of the Militia, and to place their greatest and chiefest
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59987:15"/>
Good, and the welfare of their City therein; But they must know, that a man
must travel further to find out felicity, which is derived onely from vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
reserved in Peace, as the true fruits of the labours of War. Let us then
conclude, that this part which was very excellent in <hi>Rome,</hi> lost much of that praise,
which otherwise it might have deserved for the exquisiteness of its Orders, because
true use was not made thereof, as a means to obtain the true intent of the City.
For if <hi>Aristotle</hi> laught at those who praised the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Commonwealth,
because she had made her Citizens so valiant in War, by her excellent Military
Discipline, because she exceeded the other Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> in the largeness of her
Confines; What would he have said of the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Military Exercises were studied much more, to the end, that she might van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
the furthest distant Nations: For in <hi>Sparta,</hi> too boot with such Institutions
as appertained to the Militia, there were excellent customs for the breeding of
Citizens in Civil Vertues: And it is seen that <hi>Licurgus</hi> his intention aimed not so
much at Empire, as did that of <hi>Romulus;</hi> the former much more respecting the
peace of the City, and the agreement among Citizens, minding Military Affairs
onely so far forth as they are necessary for the preservation of Liberty against For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Forces. Another consideration to be had, in regard no less then these, is,
that in a well-ordered City, the Laws ought to be confirmed by the Manners and
Educations of the Citizens, the which is of more force to make men honest, then
is the fear of punishment; nay, from hence Actions arise according to true Honesty
and Vertue; for they proceed from a vertuous Habit, which is only acquired by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.
Therefore where good Institutions of life are wanting, the severity of
Magistrates is not sufficient to make Citizens obedient to the Laws. For when
the appetite hath already gotten power, and is accustomed to vice, 'tis too hard a
matter to overcome her by force. Therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> said, <hi>That Laws, though
very useful, do but little good, if men be not endued with such Customs and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
as fits with the state of the City.</hi> Wherefore teaching in the eighth of his
<hi>Politicks,</hi> how Citizens are to be made good and honest, he proposed three things
requireable, joyning Reason and Custom to Nature. But Custom may be thought
so much more necessary then the other two, as that a mans natural inclination to
Vertue, makes him not vertuous, unless he confirm his natural disposition by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
accustoming himself to do well. Nor can Reason force Appetite, but must
first find it well reduced by good Education, if she will make use thereof in vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
operations. As much more then, as this part is necessary, so much more fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will be found in that Commonwealth, where such orders were not taken by a
civil way, for the good Education of Citizens: Whence it arose that their Laws
met not with such due observance, as did them of <hi>Sparta,</hi> not written in paper,
but (as it were) ingraven in the hearts of every one by the force of custom; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she proved truly miraculous, by reason of the excellent customs introduced
by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> to breed up Citizens in a vertuous and civil life. Therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi>
comparing <hi>Lycurgus</hi> with <hi>Numa,</hi> preferred <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> for that his having confirmed
Citizens by good customs in those orders which he had introduced into the City,
was the reason why they were long observed; Whereas <hi>Numa,</hi> contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with bare written Laws, though good, and tending to peace, not taking any
further care for the education of Citizens, could not make them be observed for
so short a time, but that they terminated together with his life. And it is found
by experience, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his Orders were of such force, as they preserved the
Liberty of <hi>Sparta</hi> longer then the like of any other of the antient Commonwealths.
Wherefore <hi>Philopomenes</hi> having overcome the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> yet would he not
totally tame them, and reduce them under the <hi>Achaean</hi> Commonwealth, till he had
cancelled all the antient Institutions of their City, wherein whilst young, they were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59987:16"/>
so bred up to Liberty, as they could by no means be brought to undergo servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>From this discourse it may then be concluded, That the Government of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth was of a mixt Form, but ill proportioned within its self,
too much inclining towards the corruption of a Popular State; and that she came
short of the <hi>Spartans</hi> in three things: In the excellencie of Government, in the
endeavours of Peace, and in good Customs. The other part remains now to be
discussed; Whether the City of <hi>Rome</hi> might have received a better Form of
State? For the good Orders of a City depend not always upon the Legislators
wisdom, but upon many other joint Accidents. The first thing to be had in
respect, is the Nature of the People, with which the Form of Government
ought to have a just proportion. Wherefore Polititians say, that the Legislator
ought not only to consider which is the best Form of Government, but what best
befits every City, and such other Accidents which make so many alterations
in States, as it cannot be denied but that Fortune hath a share therein. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi>
was justly esteemed an excellent Legislator; but many things concurr'd
in him which helped him very much to put his thoughts in effect: He was a King,
and using force at first, as it was fit to do, he might introduce such a Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as would bridle the Peoples insolencie, and increase the au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hority of the
Senate; it made likewise much for his purpose, that wealth of the City lay but in a
few mens hands, so as by bestowing Honors upon them, he could as it were by the
way of bartering the easilier dispose them to content themselves with an equality
of Goods, whereby he satisfied the people of <hi>Sparta's</hi> desire, who were but few
in number, and consequently but weak, and the more easie to be ordered in any
sort of Government. Hence it was that the Legislators of other Cities, though
they were wise men, could not notwithstanding form a Republick throughout so
well ordered as did <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> because they found not a Subject apt to receive such
a Form, and because they wanted that authority and power which was thereunto
needful, or for other such like accidents, which did not correspond well with what
they did. Therefore <hi>Solon,</hi> though he had had the same intents, could not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
such a Government in <hi>Athens;</hi> because he was a private Citizen chosen
by the Nobility, and consent of the People, to reform the City; so as it behoved
him to comply in many things with the one and the other, and his small Authority
took much of that respect and reverence from the Laws ordained by him, which
ought to have been given them. Wherefore many blamed him and his Institutions;
so as at last, to shun such ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation, he was forced to part from his ungrateful Country.
He met also with another difficulty; He found the City divided, the People much
accustomed to enjoy Liberty, and at that time much incensed against the Nobility
by the oppressions of Usury under which they suffered; so as he was compell'd, to
the end that they might rest content with their new Government, to ease them in
their Debts, and give them a share in the Government; which he could not do
without much injury to the Nobility.</p>
               <p>The Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> hath gotten an excellent Government; but
was not at first governed by those Laws which she now is: But diversity of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
have opened the way to the wisdom of many of her Citizens, who adding
new Orders to the old, have brought her to such a height of perfection. Which
might the easilier be done, because that City was free-born, and was from the very
beginning ordered according to the true Civil end, to wit, to Peace and Concord,
and to the Union of her Citizens. But on the contrary, other modern Republicks,
the Cities wherein such Governments were formed, having been formerly long
accustomed to obey Emperors, since they got their Liberty by many Accidents,
they knew not, as not being well acquainted therewith, how to use it, by reason of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59987:16"/>
the Citizens various dispositions of mind: So as wheeling often about with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Form of Government, they in process of time return'd under the command
of one.</p>
               <p>These Considerations being applied to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> will prove that the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of her Citizens, though they were very wise and valiant men, was not sufficient
to reduce her to a perfect Form of Commonwealth; but they might have amended
many great disorders in her, which did much shorten her life. For he who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the conditions of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> will find them to be such, as no Form of
Government could better agree with them then a Popular State; for they were all
warlike men, bred up even from the very first foundation of the City in the exercise
of Arms. And though a Commonwealth may be formed amongst these, which
may have a certain similitude to an Aristocratical State, when the Citizens being
governed by certain Laws, partake every man more or less of that Government
according to their worth; (For, Military discipline hath a certain species of Vertue,
though it be none of those that do immediately serve to purchase the ultimate end
of a City) yet this Government is very seldom met with; and though it want the
true and proper Form, is commonly called by the usual name of a Commonwealth.
So as though at first the City of <hi>Rome</hi> leaned much thereunto, in a short time the
People had a great share therein; who not knowing how to moderate themselves,
made it grow licentious. But he who will look back even to her first beginning, will
find that the Peoples authority did thereby ever increase together with the City:
For the Peoples power and liberty was great not only after the driving out of the
<hi>Tarquins,</hi> but even when it was commanded by Kings; that City seeming even
from that time to be naturally more disposed to the Form of a Commonwealth,
then of a Kingdom. For, after the death of <hi>Romulus,</hi> the People being powerful,
as having the weapons in their hand, and as being the first Founders of that City,
usurped the authority of choosing Kings: who on the contrary side, that they might
the better confirm themselves in their new Kingdom, endeavoured to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
themselves to the nature of the People, and to purchase their love by granting
them many considerable things. So as even under the Kingly government it had
the power of Appeals, as appeared in <hi>Horatius</hi> his case, who being condemned by
the Magistrates for his Sisters death, appealed to the People, and was by them freed.
In favor of them likewise the City was divided into Centuries, with a certain Order
of a very small Tax, according to which the Degrees of the Militia, and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Publick Courts (things which did all of them appertain to a Popular
State) were to be distributed.</p>
               <p>To boot with these Laws, the great number of Citizens, which did even then
arise to One hundred and thirty thousand, made the Peoples party very powerful;
as also their having been so ready and so successful in engaging themselves in so
many enterprises for the Commonwealth, without receiving any pay for their pains.
But the Nobility was a long time very weak, and in but little esteem: For the first
Founders of the City being Shepherds, and all of the same condition, there was
no distinction of degree amongst them, save what was soon after brought in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Romulus;</hi> who choosing the Senate out of all that former number, that they might
be assistant to the King in providing for things requisite for the State, by this order
he divided some of the worthiest of the People in this new City from the rest, who
gave the rise to the Roman Nobility. But even this Order was very weak; for it
was at first instituted by <hi>Romulus</hi> but of a small number of men; and though others
were afterwards added thereunto, yet till such time as the City got her liberty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
never exceeded the number of Two hundred Senators; nay, even these were much
lessened by the cruelty of <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> and their Authority narrowly
bounded by the Counterpoise of Regal power. So as when the City put herself
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59987:17"/>
into Liberty, there were not Noblemen enough to form a State of <hi>Optimati:</hi>
in this case did <hi>Publius Valerius</hi> find the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the driving out of
the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> when he through <hi>Brutus</hi> his death, rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ning sole Consul, was
to constitute Laws, and new mould the Commonwealth. Wherefore desirous
to introduce a State differing from the former, under the name of Liberty, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
him not to lessen, but to encrease the Authority of the People: For else
they would not have indured it; and by fiding with the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
have confounded that Government, and reduced the City again under the
power of Kings. For which reason also, <hi>Brutus,</hi> though he was first created Consul,
not willing to lose the favor and assistance of the people, without which he thought
the new Orders of the City could not be well established, perswaded his Colleague
<hi>Tarquinius Collatinus,</hi> that to give satisfaction to the People, to whom the name
of <hi>Tarquin</hi> was become odious, and suspitious, to lay down his Consulship: By
these Reasons it appears, that <hi>Valerius</hi> was compelled to ordain many things in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the People, as were the Appeals from the Consuls; The order, that upon
pain of death no man should enter into any place of Magistracy without the Peoples
approbation; the petty punishment appointed for them who should not obey
the Consuls commands, which was no more but to pay five Oxen and two Sheep.
Moreover he eased the poor of many grievances, and made many other very Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Laws, whence he purchased the name of <hi>Publicola.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But which 'tis understood, that in ordering of the Commonwealth, respect was
to be had in many things to necessity and to the condition of those times: yet
if we shall consider other Accidents, we shall find them much contrary to such
a necessity; for the new Legislator was not Prince, as was <hi>Licurgus,</hi> but pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
a place of Magistracy for a short time, the Authority whereof was hardly
yet well known, and not much valued: So as he could not use force to withdraw
the people from a Popular State, as it would have been needful, finding
the People so disposed, as hath been said. Therefore the City being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while to be reformed again, the Magistracy of Ten was chosen, with
greater Authority then was that of the Consuls, which took away all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals,
to the end that being more feared and reverenced by all, it might without
any respect constitute new Laws with great firmness. And if <hi>Appius</hi> his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had not ruined the business, that Commonwealth might perhaps have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to some better condition: but yet not to any very perfect one, it being
too hard a thing to order Cities well, which are already much augmented; just
as we see it falls out in every particular man, who in his tender years may be easily
made to undertake any manner of life, but when by practise he is settled in, as
it were, a certain proper nature of his own, he cannot easily be altered from it.
And if there have been any one, who hath been able to order a City already well
grown, yet we shall find that that City was not so great nor potent, as was the
City of <hi>Rome,</hi> at this time of the new Reformation; and therefore the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were much less, it being a very hard thing, and which, as saith the Philosopher,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> almost exceed humane power, to dispose of a great multitude in an excellent
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Government. Then as these things were the reason why this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
was not well ordered at first, so did they in time bring her to great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and seditions, and finally to her destruction. For it is usual, that the further
he advanceth that is once out of the way, so much doth he return backwards, is so
much the more pusled, and the further from the place he intended to go to. So
the Authority of the people being by these new Institutions alwaies to increase
together with the greatness of the City, she swarved the further from the end,
true Liberty, to which she seemed to address her self. And because this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
was born with this infirmity, the worth of none of her Citizens, though it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59987:17"/>
were never so great, was sufficient to cure her thereof, or to prolong her life,
As it happens in our humane bodies, which contracting some ill disposition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
at their first entring into the World, are soon thereby opprest and brought
to death, no natural vertue, though of force for other things, being able to afford
any cure. 'Tis notwithstanding very true, that though such like accidents ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the City uncapable of any excellent Government, by inclining her to a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
State, yet had they not so determinately disposed of her, but that she might
have freed her self of many of her bad qualities, had not the ambition of her Citizens
by increasing these her natural imperfections, made her fall into greater disorders.</p>
               <p>Let us begin to consider what <hi>Publicola's</hi> actions were from the very beginning
of the Commonwealth, and we shall easily discover his ambitious thoughts by
which he was moved to study so over-much how to please the peoples appetite in
every thing. These his intentions were apparently seen, by taking his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
in the Election of the Consuls so heinously, as that he kept a good while
from the Republick, as if he had put his hand to the Government, for his own
Greatness, not for the common Good: But much more for that having compast
that Degree, and finding the People jealous of him, for having built his house in a
high and strong scituation, fearing lest together with the Peoples Love he might
loose his own Authority and Power, he chose so to humble himself, as forgetting the
dignity which belonged to the Supreme Magistrate of so great a City; he made the
Fasces, the ensigns of Consulship, be held in a posture of Homage, whilst he
made his Oration, to shew, (as he himself said) That the Authority of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
was subject to the Authority and Dignity of the People. This his desire of
being esteemed Popular, was the reason why in this new Reformation, he went not
about to what was very necessary; to amend in part those defects which could not
totally be taken away; to wit, to give a just counterpoise to the Authority of the
people, tempering it with that of the Senate, by very much increasing the number
of the Senators, and by apropriating the weightiest affairs of State, to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which how necessary it was, was afterwards seen, but too late put in execution;
to wit, in <hi>Sylla's</hi> time, by whom the first number of Senators was doubled, yet but to
little purpose, the Peoples Authority being already too mightily increased, and many
seeds of corruption being by this means sown abroad in the minds of the people.
But <hi>Valerius</hi> added but one hundred to the uumbea of the Senate, neither did make
any Law in savour of them, both of which he might at that time easily have done.
For being at the time of the new Reformation to chuse new Senators of the
Equestral Order, or of some other of the people, he would not onely have been
content, but would have wone much honour, by exalting many of his Friends to
that Dignity, as it was seen he did by those few that were chosen: And the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would have had sufficient power in the Commonwealth, if without commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
the weightiest Affairs of the Kingdom unto them, the indemptnity of
chusing and of correcting Magistrates had been reserved to them: And then that
Appeals might have been granted them, by which means they would not onely
have had a hand in the City Affairs, but likewise they might have secured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from being injured by the Nobility (a thing much desired by the People)
and from danger of loosing their Liberties. And the Authority and Reputation
of the Senate being by this means augmented, the Peoples Insolency might the
more easily have been moderated in those accidents which afterward happened.
Which though it seemed (as hath been said) more harder to have been done in
that City, for another respect, yet the revolutions of Government in the first birth
of this Republick, did a little lessen ordinary Difficulties. For passing from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
(which in the <hi>Tarquins</hi> time was almost become Tyranny) to a new
condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gislator might have made it an Aristocracie; it being as it were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59987:18"/>
natural in the change of States, that the Government which had wont to be in the
power of a Tyrant, passes into the hands of the Nobility, who are usually the first
who lay hold in pulling down Tyranny, as in <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Tarquin</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> were
the first Founders of Liberty.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the People deserved to be made partaker in the new Government,
for having assisted herein, much more ought the Nobility to have their dignities
and priviledges increased, this common benefit of the City having had its chief
rise from them; nor would the People have had any reason to complain thereof.
But <hi>Publicola,</hi> in stead of increasing the honor of the Senate, introduced by a very
pernicious example, small respect to the Magistracie of Consuls; which occasioned
many disorders, which might easily have been corrected by a just fear, as is cleerly
seen by many examples, but chiefly by this; that the People being in insurrection,
and contumacious against the power of Consulship, the creating of a Dictator, a
Magistracie of supreme authority and reverence, proved a sure remedy to asswage
the Tumult. And what more manifest sign could there be given, that the people
might have been tamed and made obedient by fear and by respect unto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
then that which was given upon the occasion of <hi>Appius</hi> his Decemvirate?
For being so ill dealt with by him and by his Colleagues, as they wanted not reason
to apprehend Tyranny; yet the authority of this Magistracie, from which there
was no Appeal to be made, and the severity wherewith it was administred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did so
bridle the people, as they patiently endured all injuries; nor durst they go about to
shake off that slavery, till the Senate interposed it self, and that <hi>Horatius</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi>
declared themselves Heads of the Insurrection against the <hi>Decemviri.</hi>
There ought therefore either greater respect to have been given to the Consulary
Authority; or else, if the more severe and free power of an ordinary Magistrate
seemed not to be convenient for the state of that Commonwealth, the respect and
reverence due to the person of the Magistrate ought to have been transferred to the
authority of certain Laws, of which the Magistrate should have been chief Guardian,
inflicting severe punishment upon the not observers thereof: For by this means the
People would have had no occasion to be off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nded with the Nobles, when their
insolencie should be punished by vertue of the Laws; this arising amongst many
other be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efits from the Laws, that he who is punished for his faults cannot
complain of any one, being condemned by order of Law, not by the Judge
his will.</p>
               <p>But what hath been noted of <hi>Publicola</hi> in this first beginning, may also be known
at all other times, and in many other of the chief Roman Citizens; who through
ambition siding with the People, were the cause of their pride and insolencie. So
the Consuls <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Horatius,</hi> not being able to obtain Triumph from the
Senate, sought to have it from the People; and the whole Senate (not to multiply
examples) by creating a Dictator to suppress the authority of the Consuls <hi>Titus
Quintus Cincinnatus,</hi> and <hi>Geneus Iulius Mento,</hi> who opposed them therein, had
recourse unto the Tribunes, who by threatening imprisonment forc'd them to give
way to the resolution: And those Noblemen did usually take another course then
what is to be held with the People, with whom grave and severe proceeding doth
avail more then humble and mild demeanor. But they were so blinded by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
as not knowing, or not caring for such errors, they strove who should most
ingratiate themselvs with the the People, by Presents, Shews, and submiss comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And this instruction might be learn'd by the example of the People of <hi>Rome</hi>
themselves: For it was ofttimes seen, that greater respect was given to those few who
had known how to use severity to the People, then to those who carried themselves
submissly unto them. And certainly, amongst other things, the Judgment which
followed upon the cause between <hi>Menimiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and <hi>Spurius Servilius,</hi> was very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59987:18"/>
who being both of them accused of the same fault by the Tribunes, to wit,
that being Consuls they had opposed the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law; <hi>Menimius,</hi> who by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
and submiss carriage endeavoured absolution, was condemned; but <hi>Spurius
Servilius</hi> stoutly withstanding the Tribunes fury, and speaking severely to the
People, was acquitted. And <hi>Furius</hi> and <hi>Manilius,</hi> who had both of them been
Consuls, being not long after accused, the Nobles being willing totally to free them
from such danger, kill'd the Tribune in his own house who had impeached them;
which did so affright his Colleagues, and the People, as none of the Tribunes
would afterwards reassume the same cause: And all the Insurrections which were
then in the City being suddenly appeased, all of them did willingly subscribe the
<hi>Militia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> was always very severe against the People; and amongst other
of his actions, the punishment which he took upon the Armies insolencie was very
observable, for he made them be decimated, very tenth man be put to death;
which was submitted unto without any the least tumult, by reason of the antient
opinion of the Captains severity, and for the fear infused into the Soldiers by the
sentence of death against some Centurions who were accused for having been Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of that Insurrection. Which was sufficient so far to curb them all, as though
they were all of them then in Arms, every of them stood peacefully spectators of
the death of so many Kinsmen and Friends, and of their own doubtful chance; and
(which peradventure is a greater wonder, and doth the better confirm this truth)
<hi>Appius</hi> being accused for this sentence by the Tribunes, after he had laid down the
Consulship, using the same severity in defending himself, he was not held less guilty
for having been formerly Consul: So as the People neither willing to absolve him,
nor daring to condemn him, the cause was put off, and he suffered to depart. And
in the latter times, when the Peoples power was greatest, <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to propound the observance of the <hi>Licinian</hi> Law, the Nobles, changing
their habits, and shewing great humility, labored to win favor from the People;
but since they saw they could do no good by this means, they resolved for their
last refuge to use force, and kill'd the Author of those seditions. Which action of
theirs did so astonish the People, as they suffered the Tribunes death, whom they
had so dearly loved, and who had lost his life in defence of their cause, to go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged.
And soon after, <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> reassuming the cause which his Brother
had in vain endeavoured, the Nobles, using the same cunning, sought first by fair
means to deprive him of Popular favor, making use of another Tribune to this
purpose, by causing other popular Laws to be propounded by consent of the Senate.
But humility avail'd no more at this time, then it had done formerly; so as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoving
them to betake themselves again to Arms, they slew <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> in the
<hi>Aventine,</hi> and after the death of two Brothers, annull'd all the Laws made by
them; nor did the People ever seem to resent it. Which if it might have been
done by an usual way of a Magistrate, as hath been touched upon, doubtless these
ruder remedies, as better suiting with the infirmities of that Commonwealth, might
have freed her from many mischiefs.</p>
               <p>This is likewise confirmed by many other experiences: For as long as the Senate
kept up the authority thereof, threatening to create a Dictator, it kept the <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla</hi>
Law from being made, of creating a Magistracie of five men, who were to
correct the Consuls power. But when it chose to appease the People by giving way
to their importunities, it did only invite them to endeavour more novelties; so as
Humility made them not more quiet, but more insolent. Wherefore having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Appeals, they would have a Magistrate of their own, endowed with supreme
authority; and having gotten the power of the Tribunes, they could not stop
there, but would be admitted into the Consulship, into the Dictatorship, and to all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59987:19"/>
other sort of Dignities; and having obtained all sort of Honors, they began to
aspire to the Estates of the Nobles; who being too late aware of their Error, to
keep themselves from being quite dis-robed of every thing, and not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
themselves by the Laws, or by Magistracy, they were forced to have recourse
to Arms, to moderate the Peoples Insolencie.</p>
               <p>Whence it may be concluded that the <hi>Romans</hi> not having used those means,
neither at the first making of their Laws, nor almost at any other time, in any of
their Actions, which were proper to overcome certain bad qualities, which they
had contracted even from the birth of the Commonwealth, was the reason why,
remaining alwaies, as it were a distempered body, wherein ill humours did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
encrease, she was alwaies sickly, perplext by so many civil Discords, and
and came to a shorter period of life, then she ought to have done for many other
of her most noble conditions. The example of this powerful and famous Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
if we will well obserserve her civil Orders, and what proceeded from thence,
and if they shall be measured by truer and more general Rules, may instruct us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
well, how to discern the perfections and imperfections of Modern States.
And say it will not serve to correct Errors, already too much confirmed by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Customs; it will at least be of use to know what value ought to be put upon

Forces, against those of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who after having conquered <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
and subjugated <hi>Persia,</hi> together with other Nations, did not bethink himself
of turning into <hi>Europe;</hi> and chiefly into <hi>Italy,</hi> rather then into the utmost parts
of the East: Or that from having accomplished so many famous Interprizes in
<hi>Arabia,</hi> and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> being as yet but in his youth, he lived no longer to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59987:19"/>
carry his Victories over the other parts of the world, not as yet concerned in his
Forces, though invaded by his immense desire of Dominion. It will certainly be
worth the consideration, whether if <hi>Alexander</hi> had at first had any such thought,
or that he had had time afterwards to put it in effect, to think what influence he
would have had upon the Affairs of <hi>Rome.</hi> This doubt was put by <hi>Livy,</hi> who
in the Ninth Book of the first Decade of his Histories, betook himself to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of what might have happened, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders had been to
have made War against <hi>Alexander.</hi> But without considering any thing which
might make against his opinion, he bends all his reasons to prove that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Forces would have proved Victorious if they had chanced to have fought against
those of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; which he resolves for as great a certainty, as if the
effect had ensued. Yet many Arguments to the contrary may be taken out of divers
of those things, which <hi>Livy</hi> relates of his <hi>Romans.</hi> We can take no surer way to
know what would have been the success of things not done, then to consider what
hath been done; which may guide us by conjecture to penetrate into what might
have happened in other things, if occasion should have served. Let us then cast
an eye upon what <hi>Alexanders</hi> actions were in those times, and what those of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth; and we shall see what might have been expected from the
worth of Force, and either of them, if trial had been made thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexanders</hi> Enterprizes were sufficiently famous, and known to all men, since the
recounting of them hath wearied so many Writers. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> who writ the Lives
of the valliantest, and most magnanimous men of so many ages; In his Preface to
that of <hi>Alexander,</hi> excuseth himself (with he doth not in relating the lives of
any others) if he be not able sufficiently to write all his actions, by reason of their
number and worth. But the <hi>Romans</hi> Enterprizes in that age, were not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very great, nor very greatly cried up by others. Though those which
they afterwards performed, did for glory out-do, what ever was done by any other
Potentate; So as Reputation and Fame (which bear so great a sway in all our
operations, but chiefly in what belongs to War) was without all doubt greater in
<hi>Alexander,</hi> then in those <hi>Roman</hi> Captains who flourished in his time, when the
greatness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth was but in its rise, and first beginning.
But let us come to some further particular.</p>
               <p>The Commonwealth had not as then inlarged her Confines, further then into
<hi>Latium,</hi> into some parts of <hi>Umbria,</hi> and into <hi>Picenum,</hi> amongst people who
were very near the <hi>Volsci,</hi> and the <hi>Aequi.</hi> Their Armies were not yet marched
out of <hi>Italy;</hi> which they did not till they made War with the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
Whence it is to be gathered, that the Commonwealth was as yet but weak, and
not accustomed to those more weighty and important Actions of War, wherein
in after Ages it must be confest she did great and wonderful things. But at this
time many vertues in the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the customs of the City, not as
yet corrupted, were more to be exalted then their Military valour, which though
their souls might be full of, yet they wanted illustrious occasions to exercise it.
And those so many famous Commanders, which as <hi>Livy</hi> says, may be paralelled
with <hi>Alexander; Fabius Maximus, Valerius Corvinus, Lucius Papyrius, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Manlius, Torquatus,</hi> and others of that Age, what great Fears of Arms did
they? The War was as yet made, as it were, underneath the City Gates; Nor
did these as Consuls, or Dictators lead Armies to fight against any save the <hi>Aequi,
Sanniti, Toscani,</hi> and other neighbouring Nations, which were but weak Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalties,
whose Dominions extended no further then their own Cities, and
the Territories thereof: None of all those Countries being as then reduced under
the power of any one Lord. Yet <hi>Livies</hi> words, and the deed it self, of having had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
so often to the Dictator, and having had War so many years with the same

Nations, shews how much so weak Potentates were feared by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who
cannot notwithstanding be said to have been much superior to them, either for
strength, and worth of their <hi>Militia;</hi> since it behoved to fight so often with them,
and hardly could they after so many dangers, and a long course of time extinguish
them, or rather make them their Companions and Friends.</p>
               <p>Who can then justly compare these things to <hi>Alexanders</hi> great atchievements,
to his so many Victories won over the greatest and most potent Kings of <hi>Asia?</hi>
What though <hi>Darius</hi> his men may be said to have been rude and base? it cannot
be denied but that they were Three hundred thousand armed men, and of that
Nation wherein the Monarchy had long been: And <hi>Alexanders</hi> victorious Forces
overran more Countries in little more then ten years, then did the <hi>Romans</hi> in a
much longer time, when they were at their greatest. The before-named Roman
Commanders are deservedly praised for divers vertues: But what could there be
desired more in <hi>Alexander,</hi> to make him be an excellent Commander? Who had
his share in more Battels then he? Who shewed more boldness in undertaking en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises,
greater constancie in prosecuting them, more hopes in effecting them?
What other Commander was ever more highly esteemed, and dearly beloved by
his Soldiers? Those vertues which divided amongst many men, have made many
Captains worthy to be praised, met all of them abundantly in him. Would <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
peradventure have been afraid to pass into <hi>Italy,</hi> who shewed his undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
in entring into the Desarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> without any other hope of bringing
himself and his Army safe back, save what his courage and his happy Genius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him? But how easily might he have passed into <hi>Italy; Greece,</hi> which was
formerly conquered by his Father King <hi>Philip,</hi> being at his devotion; and to boot
with the abounding commodities which that Country and his own Forces might
have afforded him, might not he have hoped to be received and assisted by so many
people who were express enemies to the Roman Commonwealth? who would not
have refused to have obeyed so great a Prince as was <hi>Alexander,</hi> so to avoid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
themselves to the Dominion of a City like to one of theirs, and with which
they had long and grievous contestations: Nay, the hatred and envy which they
bore to the <hi>Romans</hi> greatness, would have made them all have sided with <hi>Alexander</hi>
against them. Was not <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> invited into <hi>Italy</hi> for this purpose by the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mniti</hi>
and <hi>Tarentini?</hi> and did not many of the Cities which were under the <hi>Romans</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
put themselves for the same reason under the power of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> being
thereunto moved rather out of their hatred to be commanded by the <hi>Romans,</hi> then
their fear of being supprest by the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Forces?</p>
               <p>It now remains, that we consider some things of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Militia, and of that
of the <hi>Romans.</hi> By which it will not be hard for him who will not willingly be
deceived, to know on which side the advantage, and the disadvantage might have
been: Since, if the numher of Combatants be to be valued, who can doubt but
that the Armies of which he was Lord, who was Lord of so many Provinces as was
<hi>Alexander,</hi> were much to exceed those which one only City, though very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and very watlike, as was that of <hi>Rome,</hi> could put together: And if <hi>Alexander</hi>
would do most of his famous Actions with his <hi>Macedonians</hi> only, it was out of his
choice and judgment, not out of any weakness; for he thought an Army of a few
valiant and expert Soldiers fitter to undertake a great enterprise, then a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tude,
which oftentimes bring more confusion then aid. So as having, when he
had overcome <hi>Darius,</hi> made that so memorable Order of his Soldiers of Thirty
thousand young men, chosen out of the Flower of many subjugated Provinces, and
made them be instructed in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Militia, he little regarded his own
<hi>Macedonians;</hi> whom (as it is written) he permitted out of favor, and in reward of
their former service, and at their own requests to follow his Ensigns, and to pass
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59987:21"/>
with him into <hi>India</hi> to new undertakings. But the so many Battels which he so
successfully made, may sufficiently witness the excellencie of his Discipline in the
Militia, as also his taking of so many Cities, his long Voyages, the perpetual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
in military works: By which things it may be conceived, that no more Veteran
Army could be found in those times, which was more expert in all that belonged
to the Militia, more obedient to their Captains, and more observant of all Military
order then then was that of <hi>Alexanders,</hi> The ordering of Soldiers used by <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi>
which was called <hi>Phalanx,</hi> is at this day celebrated; in which the Ranks of
Soldiers standing close, being as it were woven together, and covered over with
great shields, they made a solid and safe body of an Army, able to sustain whatsoever
charge of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Livy</hi> does afterwards consider, that the Counsel of a wise Senate, as was that of
<hi>Rome,</hi> would have prevailed over any one mans Resolves, such as was <hi>Alexander;</hi>
but he considers not on the contrary side, how that in affairs of importancie, and
chiefly in matters of War, the supreme authority and command of one alone is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.
The <hi>Romans</hi> themselves were of this opinion, who in cases of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
had recourse to a Dictator, whose Commissions were not limited, but he was
only charged to take such care as that the Commonwealth might undergo no loss
nor prejudice. Nor for all this is the authority or reverence due to a Dictator, who
is Magistrate but for a short time, and subject to give an account for what he does,
in this to be compared with the majesty of a Kings command, and of so great and
so esteemed a King as was <hi>Alexander.</hi> How often fell it out in <hi>Rome,</hi> that when
supplies were to be sent to an Army, discords were importunately sollicited by the
Tribunes, and the Army hindered from being listed? Was there any such thing in
<hi>Alexander,</hi> in whom supreme Authority and Empire did consist? Nor did he yet
want some more confiding Friends, whose counsels he was accustomed to make use
of, and those but a few, wise, and wholly intent upon the good of that Prince, upon
whom all their greatness did depend; as Counsels ought to be in business of great
weight, to the end that they may be maturely resolved upon, and readily executed.
Which happens not where any command with equal authority, and oft-times with
much differing thoughts and ends.</p>
               <p>But it may yet be more cleerly seen what success the <hi>Romans</hi> would have had
against <hi>Alexander,</hi> by looking a little forward, and considering the affairs of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Age. The first <hi>Carthaginian</hi> war lasted for the space of four and twenty years,
in which time the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> power was weakened by the <hi>Romans;</hi> but not so
quenched, but that it could soon get up again and trouble the very <hi>Romans</hi> that
were Conquerors. And when <hi>Hannibal</hi> passed with his Army into <hi>Italy</hi> four and
forty years afterwards, <hi>Rome</hi> being much increased in power and reputation, was
not the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> not only robb'd of all the State which she possest,
but the very City of <hi>Rome</hi> reduced into great straits? And yet <hi>Hannibal</hi> was not
<hi>Alexander;</hi> he had not the Fortune, the Forces, nor Authority which <hi>Alexander</hi>
had: He led his Army a long way by Land, and the Sea was blockt up by the
possession which the <hi>Romans</hi> had in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and by their powerful Fleets at Sea,
to keep him from receiving succor: Nor were his own Citizens a less impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him, (who envied his glory) then were his Enemies, in keeping out
his Army. But there was no such thing in <hi>Alexander,</hi> who by a short cut at
Sea might have brought his Army to the Italian shores, and have easily
been accommodated with all things necessary. Nor can that be objected to
<hi>Alexander,</hi> which lessened <hi>Hannibals</hi> honor, to wit, That be knew how
to overcome, but not how to make use of Victory: But amongst many
of his singular endowments, he was very ardent and sollicitous in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Victories; so as no difficulty nor danger whatsoever did ever retard him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59987:22"/>
the least of time, from making good use of his prosperous Fortune. Which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Plutarch</hi> occasion to introduce <hi>Alexander,</hi> speaking of himself, in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as he challenged all the Praises which was given unto him, as more due to his
own merit and worth, then to the favour of Fortune.</p>
               <p>For these Reasons then, that which was first said, may be asserted, that is,
that it may be numbered amongst <hi>Romes</hi> greatest good Fortunes, that <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great bethought himself not sooner of coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> or that he lived not
long enough to do it afterwards; For had he done so, that Commonwealth must
either have been oppressed by so much greater a Power, or if we will speak more
mildly, and with more respect to the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness, she must have run great
hazard in her Fortune. And certainly, that happy Genius which guided both
these Empires to such a height of Greatness and Prosperity, kept them at such a
distance, as that their Forces should not meet together, which had they done some
one of their Armies must either have been totally routed, or at least their Fame and
Glory must have been much obscured. The like may be said to have happened in
these latter Times, between Two Great and Fortunate Princes, The Emperor
<hi>Charls the Fift,</hi> and the <hi>Ottaman Sultan Solyman,</hi> who did both of them flourish
in one and the same time, and being both of them (if it be lawful to make this
comparison by reason of their diversity of Faith) endued with great Emulation,
grandeur of Spirit, and Warlike Worth; it seems that either their own Election kept
them from encountring one another, or else that they were alwaies kept far assun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by some certain occult cause, so as they might not hazard that Glory which
with so much labour and danger they had won in the Wars, against other
Princes. But it was particularly observed by all men, and not without great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and it was attributed to the same respect; That the numerous and powerful
Armies of both these Princes being brought into <hi>Austria,</hi> and come very near one
another, with an intention, as it seemed, to try by Battle the force and worth of
themselves and Armies, so great a preparation for War proved altogether vain:
<hi>Solyman</hi> not advancing with his Camp to challenge the <hi>Germans</hi> to joyn Battle,
as he had first professed he would; nor <hi>Caesar</hi> not budging with his men from the
walls of <hi>Vienna,</hi> though before the approach of the Enemy, he had proudly
boasted that he would assault him to revenge the former Injuries done to his
Brother, and to all <hi>Germany.</hi> But because these considerations sute not with
our present purpose, and for that we may peradventure have occasion to treat
thereof hereafter; we will hear end this our present Discourse.</p>

               <p>AMongst many Wars made by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that was of very great
weight and danger, which she had to sustain against <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> King of
<hi>Epire,</hi> when he past with a powerful Army into <hi>Italy</hi> in behalf of the
<hi>Tarentines.</hi> Other Wars were made for the most part by the <hi>Romans</hi>
against others, this was made against them by a King of greater power
then was theirs, and of greater worth in himself, and of better experience in Affairs
of War. Insomuch as he deserved after <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to be e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eemed the prime
Commander of his, and of former Ages. This War was likewise commenced
when the Commonwealth had not so well confirmed her Power as she did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
this being before the first <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War, which brought the <hi>Romans</hi>
first to make war out of <hi>Italy.</hi> But as the <hi>Romans</hi> upon this occasion gave many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of their undoubted worth, so, opportunity of handling some State Affairs,
from whence useful precepts for Civil Government may be drawn, to him who shall
discourse upon their Actions.</p>
               <p>Whilst <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was with an Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> sent their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Mago</hi> with One hundred and twenty Frigats to assist the <hi>Romans;</hi> But the
<hi>Romans,</hi> thanking the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for this their readiness to assist them, sent their
General back, with all the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Forces.</p>
               <p>This being the matter of Fact, it deserves consideration, whether the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
or <hi>Romans</hi> are more to be praised for their Wisdom and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</p>
               <p>To proffer and lend assistance to one who stands in need thereof, especially to
one who hath formerly been very fortunate, is a thing befitting Great and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Princes, and to refuse it, so it be done modestly, and without Arrogancy,
shews no less Generosity, since men do thereby appear to conside in themselves.
So likewise to maintain War in anothers Territories, so to keep it far from ones
self is a wise and useful counsel, and not to value present dangers so much, as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to neglect things of a further distance, is no small sign of discretion. But
let us come to a more particular consideration of these things, that we may the
better see into them, and know what judgement to give of them, either in praising
or dispraising them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were at this time in Amity with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and had often
formerly renewed their Confederacy with them: The Confines of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
being as yet far distant one from another, whereby the occasion of offence
was taken away, did ratifie the Peace and Amity between those two States: So
as it was a thing well-beseeming so great a Principality, as was that of the <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>
not to forgo their friends in time of danger, though they were not bound
by any particular Obligation, to assist them. And as the failing in such a duty
might have cast some blut upon their City, so deserve they no small praise for
their reediness in performing it. But these things are peradventure of less force,
and estimation amongst Princes; Whence it may be worth consideration, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59987:23"/>
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were not perswaded out of other reasons to assist the <hi>Romans</hi>
in this War. Great was the Fame of King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Valor, and Forces at this time;
and no less the report of his Ambition, and of his vast Designs of assaulting <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
<hi>Affrica,</hi> when he should have overcome the <hi>Romans.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
had reason to use all their endeavours not to make trial of their Forces and Fortune
with this Prince: And nothing was more opportune for them, to keep such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
far from them, then to keep <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> who finding himself more
withstood by the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces, thorough the assistance of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
would be necessitated to make the longer abode in <hi>Italy,</hi> and (as it falls out in long
Enterprises) to waste many of his People there, and lessen that Reputation and
Terror which usually accompanies great Armies, in their first and unexpected As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults.
To make war in another mans Country is alwaies good Advice; but best
for those that are farthest off, especially when it may be hoped that such a fire may
be long fed in another mans Country. The Forces of the <hi>Romans</hi> were sufficiently
strong of themselves, but much stronger being joyned with those of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>
and fitter to withstand <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Forces: Who on the other side,
having undertaken this Enterprise, with vaste thoughts, and being resolved to
hazard his whole Fortune, out of a desire of new Glory, and greater Empire,
and being himself a valiant Commander of a valiant Army, it was not easily to
be beleeved that he would quit <hi>Italy,</hi> unless Victorious, or else quite over
come and destroyd. If <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> should have overcome the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they
were abandoned by the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> and being afterwards big with Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Victory, should have passed into <hi>Sicily,</hi> to molest the Affairs of the
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> as his Design was to do when he left his Country, what danger
would they have been in, or what succour could they have expected from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
since they had not been aided by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in their great necessity,
and must have been much weakened by the Defeat given them by <hi>Pyrrhus?</hi> But
if the <hi>Romans</hi> had been assisted by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> weary of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Fortune in <hi>Italy,</hi> should have turned his Forces upon the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
how could the <hi>Romans</hi> have refused to have assisted the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in like
manner as they had done them? Whence it follows, that those men which the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> should have sent into <hi>Italy,</hi> should have fought not onely for the
safety of <hi>Italy,</hi> but for the like of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> and with no less advantage
to <hi>Carthage,</hi> then to <hi>Rome.</hi> But though it had been apparent, that the <hi>Romans</hi>
might of themselves have resisted <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and have got the Victory, it
had made no less for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> to make use of this occasion, thereby to
oblige the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose Power was then very great, and their Worth very
much esteemed, and their intentions of inlarging their Empire, being already
known: So as it became the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for their own safety sake, to have an
eye to the greatness of this new Potentate; and not being able to quell him, they
had all the reason in the world to keep him their Friend, to the end that he might
turn his Forces somewhere else, and not upon them. But what Friendship is more
firm then that which is bound with the Tye of great Benefits? For the receiver,
must by an occult force of Nature incline to love his Benefactor, and the doer,
loves this the noble Product of his good turn in another, and by so doing makes
himself be the better beloved. Great was the <hi>Romans</hi> need at this time, who had
not as yet met with a more formidable Enemy then <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and therefore the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was likewise great, which offered it self to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to contract a near
Friendship and Confederacy with the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this it may be objected, That by succouring the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
would draw anothers War upon themselves; Nor was it so easie a thing
to overcome the <hi>Romans,</hi> as that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> could end that War so suddenly, or with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59987:23"/>
so entire Forces, as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had cause to fear them: Nay, rather the
irritating of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> by Injuries, might provoke him to revenge, and make him
forgo the <hi>Romans,</hi> and fall upon the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> But say that the Affairs of
<hi>Rome,</hi> though assisted by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> should have succeeded amiss (as things
of this nature are alwaies subject to variety of Accidents) what hopes had the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
to defend either what they possessed in <hi>Sicily,</hi> or even the <hi>African</hi> coasts,
when they should have sent the greatest part of their Shipping and Souldiers to
assist the <hi>Romans?</hi> And why should the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> rather fear <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his
Greatness, then that of the <hi>Romans? Pyrrhus</hi> his Dominions lay further off, and
more incommodious to molest the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> then did the <hi>Romans;</hi> he was
but one man, and though valiant, yet his life was subject to various mischances
(as it proved afterwards, he being slain by a stone, thrown by a poor old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
But <hi>Rome</hi> abounded in valiant Commanders, and was come to the pass,
a man may say, of preserving herself still the same: So as all other Princes ought
rather to have had a care to keep the <hi>Romans</hi> from growing stronger, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Potentate: For <hi>Romes</hi> power was more stable, aud therefore like to cause
longer, and greater dangers to others. Wherefore to keep the <hi>Romans</hi> long bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
in the War against <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> by which their Forces must have been weakened,
was the means to preserve other States from that Ambition of Dominion which
was already discovered to be in the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other side; To assist the <hi>Romans</hi> in ridding themselves of the Troubles
of War, especially if this should have happened by their obtaining any signal
Victory, what was it but to increase the Reputation and Courage of others, so
to hasten their own dangers? For being freed of such incumbrances, and aspiring
after greater things (a thing which is always occasioned by good success) it was not
likely the <hi>Romans</hi> would stand idle, but ready to imbrace any Enterpise, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
afterwards. For the first <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War ensued soon after the War
made with <hi>Pyrrhus:</hi> For the <hi>Romans</hi> meeting with no resistance in <hi>Italy,</hi> after
the Honor which they had won in their Victory over <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> they began to march
with their Forces into other Countries; they past into <hi>Sicily,</hi> being invited in
by the <hi>Mamertini,</hi> as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was first called ito <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Tarentini.</hi> And the
weakness of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Forces did not so much occasion the Victories won in the
War, asdid his inconstancy in prosecuting Enterprises once begun, which though it
was a natural defect in him, yet may it be believed, that his sudden departure from
<hi>Italy</hi> might be occasioned by the injury done him by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked
had taken up Arms against him, and were ready to come and find him
out in other mens Countries. But it may be another greater respect might have
moved him to assault the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> State, to wit, That he might onely have to
do onely with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> as he had at first fought onely with the <hi>Romans;</hi>
beginning to suspect, as having already discovered the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> good will,
that if he should tarry longer in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the <hi>Romans</hi> danger should encrease,
that Confederacy might be made between them and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which was
first refused: So that whatsoever he should afterwards undertake against either of
them, might afterwards prove more difficult. This was then the reason why <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>
whilst the business in <hi>Italy</hi> was not yet finished, nor the danger of the <hi>Tarentines</hi>
not well secured, marched to go for <hi>Sicily;</hi> which caused so much trouble and
danger to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Affairs, as if he had known how to make good use of
his Victory, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> might peradventure have been brought then to
those final Extremities which were deferred for another time, more for the
<hi>Romans</hi> Glory, then for their Welfare and good Fortune. Thus what hath
been already said, may suffice for what concerns the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now see what the <hi>Romans</hi> did, and consider whether they did well or no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59987:24"/>
in refusing the help which was voluntarily offered them, nay brought home to them
by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The War which was made by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> against the <hi>Romans,</hi>
must be thought to be both great and difficult, being made by a Warlike Prince,
who brought many many men with him, well trained up in Arms, so as by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Name and Fame of his Forces, he had almost brought many Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> to
his devotion, withdrawing them from the obedience of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and though
he were a stranger, yet having firm footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> whither he was called by the
<hi>Tarentini,</hi> he was not likely to undergo those dis-accommodations, which Armies
use to suffer in another Country; but his Forces appeared the more formidable
by reason of that terror, which things of great Fame, and not formerly known,
use to bring with them. And the Elephants were a great cause of fear, the <hi>Romans</hi>
not being formerly acquainted with that manner of Militia. In so much danger
therefore, when the whole Rest was at Stake, to presume too much upon ones
self, and upon ones proper Forces, and to dream onely of Glory, when they were
to have been more sollicitous of Safety, hath the appearance rather of Rashness,
then of mature and wise Counsel. And why should the <hi>Romans</hi> promise so much
unto themselves against <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> as to despise the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> help, being as
then accustomed to fight with the <hi>Tarentini,</hi> a weak Nation, given over to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
of which they were reprehended by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> himself; and being now to
fight with true Souldiers, expert in all sort of sufferings, and all military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
in the recent Wars made by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And when nothing
else, but even Fortune (which in matter of War is so uncertain) should have
proved averse unto them in any thing, to whom could they afterwards have had
recourse for succour, having despised so great helps, readily sent by so great a
Power, of so great esteem and Authority, as was then the Commonwealth of
<hi>Carthage?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet on the other side, it may seem no ways to agree with the <hi>Romans</hi> Greatness
and Generosity, to confess themselves so terrified by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Forces, as that
they needed Foreign help to defend themselves. The <hi>Romans</hi> might have had
Peace from <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who when he came into <hi>Italy,</hi> sent his Ambassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi>
informing the Senate by them, that he was come to compose the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and the <hi>Tarentini,</hi> with whom, if the <hi>Romans</hi> would have Peace,
he proffered them the like: To which, answer was made, That the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Rome</hi> had not chosen him for their Arbitrator, neither did they fear his
enmity; therefore let him first return to his own Kingdom, and then, as a Friend
to the Commonwealth he might treat of Peace, and should be willingly listened
unto.</p>
               <p>But the City of <hi>Rome</hi> did already begin to envy and emulate the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which she did peradventure more esteem then open enmity
with the Kingdom of <hi>Epire,</hi> wherewith she thought she should not so soon have
to do neither in matter of Peace nor War, though <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his ambition had then
brought him into <hi>Italy.</hi> Therefore if the <hi>Romans</hi> would not accept of Peace
from <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> they oughtless to acknowledg their Safety from the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
They likewise thought they might so much rely upon their own Forces,
having valiant and well disciplined Souldiers of their own, as that there remained
no doubt of Victory in that War, then what does never part from the uncertainty
of Chance in War. They considered that the number of Armies or Fleets might
be increased by Foreigners, and yet the power to resist an Enemy not be made the
greater; whilst either the differing ends of Princes, the little agreement between
Commanders, or the contrary Custom and Discipline of Souldiers, do often
occasion many discords in matter of War; which are not found where one onely
Chieftain commands, and disposeth of all things, and where better obedience
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59987:24"/>
shewn by Souldiers of one and the same Dominion. Therefore was it that the
<hi>Romans</hi> did sundry other times refuse foreign aid; as particularly, in the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Antiochus,</hi> when refusing assistance sent unto them by other Kings of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
they with their own few, but valiant Souldiers, routed <hi>Antiochus</hi> his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Army, made up of many several Nations. Such respects as these might have
been liable to consideration, even when their Faith and Friendship, who were to
have lent assistance, had been for certain to be credited; but who could secure the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who having already extended their Dominions far into <hi>Italy,</hi> could not
grow much greater without injuring Nations further off: from being jealous of
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who were antient and powerful Lords in <hi>Affrica,</hi> and in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and possessed of the greatest part of <hi>Sicily;</hi> and as there were none who could more
hinder the increase of their Greatness then the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> so was it necessary
that they being apprehended for such by the <hi>Romans,</hi> should likewise fear
them for the preservation of their own quiet and security. And what charity is
this, might those wise and ancient Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> say, which hath moved these
<hi>Affricans</hi> to be so careful of us, as without any obligation of Confederacy, and
not sought unto, they should send so prime a Captain as <hi>Mago,</hi> with such a
number of Frigats and Soldiers, to assist us, and to bereave their own State of such
defence, to preserve the States of other men? The greater the appearances seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
outwardly, the more might it be suspected that these things proceeded not
from sincerity of heart: If the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had done this, because they held the
<hi>Romans</hi> to be so unworthy, as that they were to yeeld to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
and so their States might be exposed to the same danger, it was not good to
nourish such an opinion in the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> by which they should no sooner be
quit of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> but the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who were as willing to keep the <hi>Romans</hi>
low, as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was, might come and set upon them. So whilst they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to secure the War which was on foot, and from which, if they were the
same men which they had always used to be against their Enemies, they had great
hopes they might defend themselves, they might have raised another more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and difficult; if the <hi>Roman</hi> generosity had not suffered that by anothers
fraud, whereunto they should, onely have given consent and some small reward,
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> should have been slain (as they were offered by an acquaintance of his, he
should be) though thereby they were freed from all danger; but rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
the Commonwealth from such a blemish, the <hi>Roman</hi> Commander chose to
acquaint the enemy with what was plotted against him; how could they, or ought
they to tolerate that the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had sent aid, not out of any desire
of <hi>Romes</hi> welfare, but as those that envied her glory, should boast themselves of
being the preservers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty? If it should have so faln out by any
adverse accident that <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who came to assault them, should have proved
Conqueror; nothing had been to be blamed but the Fortune of War, since they
themselves should have carried themselves gallantly and advisedly in the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it: But if they should have accepted of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> succour, men
might think, that the <hi>Romans</hi> gave themselves for overcome, before a blow
was given and that they were much inferior to the Enemy, not in Forces, but in
Valor: That <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had not undertaken that enterprise out of necessity, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of a desire of novelty, and hopes of glory: That therefore if his first assaults
should be stoutly sustained, he should have enough of it, and that being invited by
another occasion, which he understood was already brewing against him, by the
<hi>Sicilian</hi> Discords, being naturally of a fickle humour, he might readly turn to
some other undertaking; and that as he had come into <hi>Italy</hi> slightly, and upon no
occasion, to make War against them, so he might easily be perswaded by any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Fortune to give over the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> and fall upon something else;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59987:25"/>
had he been so strong in Men and Forces, as it seems men thought he was, he would
not have sent his Orator <hi>Cineas</hi> to seek friendship with the Senate and people of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and to endeavour that by words which he might easily have obtained by
force, which was, to grant peace to the <hi>Tarentines</hi> his Confederates.</p>
               <p>Something like this we may believe was said by that <hi>Appius,</hi> a Senator of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
wisdom; who was imployed in answering <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Ambassador, and in
readily accepting the intimated War. And whosoever shall duly consider these so
many and so sprightly reasons which they had to dismiss the Carthaginian assistance,
must needs be perswaded that it did agree with the Roman wisdom and generosity.
Yet he who will ground his judgment aright, and justly weigh what the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
did, must reflect upon divers respects, by which such actions are usually govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
If then the advantage of the business be only considered, it will appear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
well with what the Carthaginians did then advise upon: For, to hazard those few
Forces which they sent to assist the Romans, tended towards the preservation of
their own State from <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his incursion; and it appeared rational enough, that
the war made against him by the Roman forces, joined with those of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,
might draw on to a length of time: For it was believed by the resolution
which <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> took when he went from his Kingdom, that he should not have so
soon given over his attempt; and the Carthaginians being with a considerable
strength in the Roman Armies, might at their pleasures, and in divers manners have
so prolonged the War, and spun it out into such a length, as they might have so
weakened both their Forces, as they needed not for a long time to fear either <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi>
or the Romans. But in the Romans resolutions to refuse the Carthaginian
succor, the magnanimity of their minds is chiefly to be praised: For the War was
not slighted by those who refused to make Peace with their Enemies, and to accept
of assistance from their Friends; but full of dangers, which if they should be able
to overcome, they thought it would be an action of great worth, but of greater
difficulty. But this resolution, out of the aforesaid reasons, made not so much for
their advantage for the present, as for the future. And it was known, that <hi>Fabritius</hi>
his generosity in preserving <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his life (though his Enemy) from the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
of other men, made no less for the overcoming of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> then did the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
discipline of <hi>Valerius Corvinus,</hi> and the Roman Armies which fought against
him. Wherefore he sent <hi>Cineas</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to grant liberty to such prisoners as he had
taken, and to desire peace with the Romans, being moved thereunto rather by
that noble act, then by any loss he had received in the conflict. And it may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that it was this which made him resolve to forego <hi>Italy</hi> the sooner, and leave
the Roman affairs quiet.</p>
               <p>Yet such a Consideration may appear to be very weak, being compared to the
advantage which might thereby have been gotten: For it had regard to things of
uncertainty, and to dangers far off; whereas the Carthaginians help might have
made for the good of present affairs. Wherefore the Romans might be herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced;
if it were not to be said, that the desire of Glory was so great in them, as
aiming only and chiefly thereat, they put on their resolutions with such fervor, as
they did not only exceed all others, but even themselves. They thought they
should make their condition the worse by accepting of Forein assistance, whatsoever
should befall them: For if they should overcome <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> assisted with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,
the military valor would be much lessened, which otherwise did belong
to so great an undertaking, and to the so great hazard which they ran; but if they
should be overcome, their shame would be increased; the Roman Forces, though
assisted by so great a strength of Foreiners, not being able to resist <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Army.
They might likewise peradventure doubt, lest by reposing some part of their hopes
upon Forein aid, they might make their own Senators less fervent and sollicitous in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59987:25"/>
providing things fitting for the War, and their Captains and Soldiers less diligent
in their military imployments; as it often falls out in what is recommended to the
care of many, that whilst one to ease himself a little, seeks to lay load upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
the burthen is more weakly sustained by many, then it would have been by
a few: But the truth of these things can but only be discuss'd by probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to delight our selves in the variety of affairs which present themselves in the
ballancing of several reasons which may happen in these great actions: For to give a
determinate sentence therein, we want the ground work of those particulars, which
we cannot take notice of now in things done so long since, and by which all our
works, especially such as are subject to so many alterations as are all Civil and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
affairs, can be only best regulated. It is most certain, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> who
were formerly full of high and glorious thoughts, got so much boldness and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
after having driven <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> out of <hi>Italy</hi> with their own proper Forces, and
overcome him in so many Battels, as they did the easilier undertake any War, and
no Nation in <hi>Italy</hi> durst ever after oppose their designs, whereby they soon opened
the way to a large Empire.</p>

               <head type="sub">Which of the two famous Roman Cammanders, Quintus Fabius
Maximus, or P. Scipio Africanus, brought more of advantage
to the Commonwealth of Rome in managing their War.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FAbius Maximus,</hi> and <hi>P. Scipio Africanus,</hi> descended from noble Roman
Families, and endued with excellent parts, did flourish in the same Age;
which happening to be at the time when the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was
much molested by the Carthaginian Forces, they had occasion to shew
their valor in the behalf of their Country, and to purchase much glory
to themselves. They had alike zeal to the common good; their love to their
Country, their strength of mind, and knowledg of military affairs was alike;
but they differed in opinion concerning the management of the War, and
different was the occasion which they had in exercising it. Great was the service
which the City of <hi>Rome</hi> received from these two; but they differed much in their
ways and ends. <hi>Fabius</hi> led the Armies through <hi>Italy</hi> against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> for the safety
of the City of <hi>Rome: Scipio</hi> fought in <hi>Africa</hi> against the same <hi>Hannibal,</hi> for the
glory and grandezza of <hi>Rome,</hi> being already freed from so many dangers of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian
Forces. The former brought succor and help in a very seasonable time to
the affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> when they were much distressed, and raised up the tottering
fortune of the Commonwealth: The latter, by discomfiting many of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
Commanders, and even <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself, did not only put his Romans in
perpetual safety from the Carthaginian forces and stratagems wherewith they had
been so long molested, but brought whole <hi>Africa</hi> under their obedience. <hi>Fabius</hi>
preserved <hi>Italy</hi> from the slavery of Forein Nations, into which she had certainly
fallen, had it not been for his actions and advices, <hi>Hannibal</hi> having already possest
himself of all the chief Cities: But <hi>Scipio</hi> did much enlarge the Roman Confines,
and made the Africans confess they were overcome by Italian valor, and submit
their necks to the yoke of the Roman Empire. These excellent Commanders
shewed great worth, and great experience in military affairs by these their actions,
each of them using therein their proper qualities and endowments: <hi>Fabius</hi> loved
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59987:26"/>
constancy, gravity, followed late taken resolutions, but such as were secure.
<hi>Scipio,</hi> measuring all things according to the greatness of his conception, did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
imbrace new Enterprises, nothing that was glorious seemed hard to him.
<hi>Fabius</hi> feared <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of wisdom, not out of any cowardly mind; <hi>Scipio</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
him, confiding in himself and in the valor of his Army. Wherefore <hi>Fabius</hi>
thought he had ended the business, if <hi>Hannibal</hi> being reduced to much hardship,
should be forced to forgo <hi>Italy:</hi> But <hi>Scipio</hi> as if he had been sure of Victory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
all offers of Agreement how advantageous soever, made by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
would hazard the day in that famous place of <hi>Zama,</hi> where the height of Empire
was to be decided between two powerful Nations. And truly it seems, that it was
<hi>Romes</hi> good Fortune, which made these two so excellent men be at this time Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etaneans,
though with different thoughts applied to the Safety and Glory of that
Commonwealth: For the one, with much patience overcoming the bitterness of
Fortune, and the Insolency of the Enemy, freed her from so many dangers into
which she was faln: the other, finding the Commonwealth already restored,
and knowing how to make better use of his good fortune then <hi>Hannibal,</hi> did by
his noble daring add greater splendor, and glory to her.</p>
               <p>But here it may be worthy consideration, which of these two may be thought
to have done things which were better, and of more use for the Commonwealth.
<hi>Fabius</hi> his actions tended to the safety of his Country, when she was reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great danger, and put a period to her troubles more by good Counsel, then by
many Forces: But the <hi>Affrican</hi> proposed unto himself the increase of Glory, and
of Empire of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore not satisfied with what he had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfully
done in <hi>Spain,</hi> he resolved to pass into <hi>Affrica,</hi> where refusing all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Peace, he would needs joyn battel with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> wherein his prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
continuing, he won a great and glorious Victory. On the one side then, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
deserts appear to be very great, he having preserved the City when it was in a
desperate condition, so by saving it from the utmost of dangers, he made himself
a sharer of that praise which is given to the first Founders of Cities: And certainly
such was <hi>Hannibals</hi> fortune at that time, the worth and reputation of his Army
such, as all Force indeavoured against him, would have proved not onely vain but
prejudicial; and his being judged by the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
fit to cope with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and onely fit to suppress his Forces, even then
when <hi>Scipio</hi> that valiant and famous Captain, did live and flourish, shews that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
worth was so highly esteemed, as it was not to be exceeded. And this is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
confirmed by the grave testimony of <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> famous among the
most celebrated <hi>Romans;</hi> who being, as Consul, to go into the Camp against <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
highly extolling things formerly done by <hi>Fabius,</hi> whilst he was Dictator,
said that he would rather be praised in matters of War by him alone, then do things
which might differ from his actions, though they pleased all the people of <hi>Rome</hi>
therein. <hi>Fabius</hi> was indeed excellently well advised in all he did; for he was no
less valiant in withstanding the Enemy in Battle, and in correcting the error and
rashness of <hi>Minutius,</hi> Master of the Cavalry, who had importunely, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his opinion begun the Skirmish, then he was formerly wise in foreseeing
the danger, and in endeavouring to keep it off. His constancy of mind in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
witnessed his no want of Courage, but out of abundance of Wisdom he shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the hazard of giving Battel. Wherefore after the discomfeiture at <hi>Cannae,</hi> no
man was more constant, and ready then he to take a resolution. It is therefore
said, that in the dejection of souls, and confusion of all things, the Citizens had
recourse to his Counsel, as to an Oracle: And the comparing the actions of others,
in what concerned the administration of War against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> made <hi>Fabius</hi> his
worth appear the more; for before he took upon him the Dictatorship, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59987:26"/>
                  <hi>Flaminius</hi> was routed at the Lake <hi>Thrasymenus,</hi> and when he laid down the
Dictatorship; <hi>Terentius</hi> taking other courses then did <hi>Fabius,</hi> gave occasion for
that famous and grievous overthrow which the <hi>Romans</hi> received at the Battel of
<hi>Cannae;</hi> whereby it may be known, that wise Commanders (just like under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Physitians when they meet with weak bodies, do oftentimes make use ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prescribe quiet and good government, free from all disorder, then Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick)
when they know the Forces of the Commonwealth to be but weak, as were
those of the <hi>Romans</hi> at that time, ought also to free the State from great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
dangers, by temporizing, and by proceeding leasurely with all advantage, then
by using Force of Arms and hazarding a Battel. Which made <hi>Hannibal</hi> say,
That he feared <hi>Fabius</hi> his fearfulness more, then the daring of the other <hi>Roman</hi>
Captains: And finding all his Designs at other times frustrated by <hi>Fabius,</hi> he
affirmed that the <hi>Romans</hi> had also their <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Nor could his cunning be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
overcome otherwise then by cunning, and by knowing how to make use of fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
occasions, and how to bereave the Enemy of the like, which indeed was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to <hi>Fabius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may moreover be said for <hi>Fabius,</hi> and in praise of his advice, that as no
humane Action is more subject to divers unexpected Accidents, then in Battle,
wherein great Effects are often produced from very small Accidents, so cannot a
Commander attribute at any time so much praise unto himself in Victories, but
that good Fortune will challenge a great share therein: Wherefore it is numbered
amongst the chief qualities which are to be desired in him who would prove a good
Commander, that he be fortunate. Besides, no Victory is ever won by meer
fighting, without much blood, and much loss of ones own men; so as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an enemy by such means as <hi>Fabius</hi> knew how to do, and without exposing
himself to the danger of a set Battle, to overthrow an Enemies Army by reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to great hardships, is a thing of more rare vertue, and which makes the
Commander more praise-worthy. By these cunnings were <hi>Hannibals</hi> cunnings
deluded, by these was his fierceness tamed, and the reputation won from him,
and from his Army, which he had won in Battel, by having so often worsted and
overthrown the <hi>Romans.</hi> So as it may be said, that <hi>Fabius</hi> conquered <hi>Hannibal</hi>
a Conqueror; but that <hi>Scipio</hi> overcame him when he was already conquered.
For <hi>Fabius</hi> had to do with him, when he was in <hi>Italy</hi> with a puissant Army,
and in the height of his greatest prosperity; But <hi>Scipio</hi> made not trial of his
Forces against those of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> till he was returned to <hi>Africa,</hi> with his Army
beaten and wasted by sufferings, and when by the usual change of humane Affairs
the state of things between the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> was sufficiently altered.
Wherefore <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who had formerly endeavoured nothing more then to fight his
Enemies in a pitch'd field, when he was returned to <hi>Africa,</hi> perswaded the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
to Peace, and proposed all conditions of Agreement to <hi>Scipio,</hi> so to
shun joyning Battel with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which, as if he had foretold his own misfortunes,
he lost the remnant of his Army which he had brought from <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore should it not then be thought, that it was harder for <hi>Fabius</hi> to stop
the course of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Victories, then it was for <hi>Scipio</hi> to overcome him in Battel,
when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were at their greatest loss, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>? Nay, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to <hi>Scipio,</hi> when he endeavoured to lead his Army into <hi>Africa,</hi> that he did it
to shun encountring with <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> It is a very common, but a very
true saying,
<q>Non minor est virtus quàm querere, parta tueri.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabius</hi> preserved the Glory, Reputation and state of the Commonwealth, which
his Ancestors had won; <hi>Scipio</hi> increased them. So as had it not been for <hi>Fabius,</hi> the
Name, at least the Fame of <hi>Rome</hi> had been almost lost: But she had onely been less
glorious without <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59987:27"/>
On the contrary, who will consider <hi>Scipio's</hi> great actions, how can he judge him
to come short of any other Roman Commander whatsoever, either for glory or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desert;
since he may be said to have been the first who opened the way unto the
Romans of conquering the whole World, as they did in a short time? For by his
means <hi>Africa</hi> was conquered, and a curb put to the greatest and most powerful
Enemies that ever the Romans had; so as none ever after durst withstand the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
greatness by force, or did disdain to humble and submit themselves to their
worth and fortune, whom the most powerful and fortunate of all other Nations
did already obey? <hi>Scipio</hi> brought all <hi>Spain</hi> under the Roman obedience, driving
away the Carthaginians from thence, whom he overcame in four several battels:
Nor did he make the way easie to greater acquisitions, less by his excellent gifts of
mind, then by force of Arms; making those people affectionate, and faithful to the
Romans. And yet as not much valuing these his great deeds, being returned to
<hi>Rome</hi> full of glory, he endevaoured to return again with his Army into <hi>Africa,</hi>
knowing that the Carthaginians could not keep quiet at home, but must be
troubling and endangering the the Romans: Nor had he less difficulty to overcome
<hi>Fabius</hi> his obstinate opinion in the Senate, who blamed this advice, then in rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Enemies in the Field.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Fabius</hi> be to be esteemed, because he in a short time freed the Romans
from the danger of the Carthaginians; what must we say of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who did for
ever secure them from these their Enemies, bereaving them of their Land-Forces
by taking the Flower of their men away from them in Battel; and the like of their
Maritime strength, having by agreement forced them to burn all their Ships?
Which won him so great respect from all persons, as at his return from <hi>Africa</hi> people
ran from all parts, only that they might see him. To say truth, what can be said of
<hi>Fabius,</hi> save that he did not lose? But in <hi>Scipio's</hi> Victories, what can be desired to
make them greater or more glorious? In the space of forty five days he raised a
powerful Army; and followed by more Voluntiers for the fame of his worth, then
he carried Soldiers with him by Decree of Senate, he marched into <hi>Africa:</hi>
He conquered People and Cities, that were enemies to the name of <hi>Roman;</hi> he
overcame <hi>Asdrubal</hi> and <hi>Hanno,</hi> two famous Carthaginian Commanders; he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited
<hi>Hannibals</hi> Army, and ending the War with the overthrow of the Enemy,
he returned time enough to <hi>Rome</hi> to lay down his Magistracie. <hi>Hannibal</hi> being
withdrawn from the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> and kept at gaze by <hi>Fabius</hi> his cunning, stayed
in <hi>Italy,</hi> expecting succor from <hi>Africa,</hi> to renew the War with greater Force.
<hi>Scipio's</hi> advice and actions were only able to draw him out of <hi>Italy;</hi> so as carrying
the War elswhere, at the same time he freed his own home from the troubles and
danger thereof. He who should have asked <hi>Fabius,</hi> what the signs were, what the
fruits of his Victories; what could he have shewn? No Enemies taken, no Cities
won, no Gold nor Silver brought into the Comon-Exchequer. But many things
prove the glory and deserts of <hi>Scipio:</hi> So many Prisoners taken, amongst which
<hi>Syphax,</hi> the great and famous King of <hi>Numidia;</hi> so many Cities subjugated in
<hi>Africa,</hi> and in <hi>Spain;</hi> the annual Tribute imposed upon the Carthaginians; the
rich Pillage brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <p>What is there then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> like, not to name equal, between these two, which may
make them contend for military glory? But certainly it may be affirmed for truth,
that the one and the other of them are come to the height of glory, though they
took several ways to arrive at it: For each of them shewed wisdom and valor in
their actions, becoming advised Statesmen, and great Commanders. Divers acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
concurred in their several actions, which perswaded them to proceed after a
differing manner: For <hi>Fabius</hi> being to withstand <hi>Hannibals</hi> violence, who being
already advanced into the very bowels of <hi>Italy,</hi> and being drawn veryneer to <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59987:27"/>
herself, had filled all things with fear, did not think it fitting in this confusion of
affairs to hazard all the fortune of the Commonwealth in a day of battel: For the
neerness and power of the Enemy did not allow time to recruit and stop the course
of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Victories, in case that Army wherein the chief hopes of <hi>Romes</hi> wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
did consist, should have been beaten.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Scipio</hi> having to do with the same <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he and his Army
were in <hi>Africa,</hi> and neer the City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> knew that if any thing of ill
should befall him, he should only lose those men that were with him; which loss
might easily be recovered, the condition being considered wherein the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
then was: And it being his fortune to overcome <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he reduced the
affairs of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> (whom he had worsted in divers other battels) to the
utmost of dangers: Wherefore by the victory he got great rewards for himself,
great glory, and increased the Empire of his Commonwealth. <hi>Scipio</hi> had also other
reasons which perswaded him to fight; his being in a forein Country, his keeping
of the Enemy from recruiting after their late losses, and he being shortly to lay
down his command; so as to spin out the War in length, was to deprive him of his
conceived hopes of victory, and to lessen what he had already done. <hi>Scipio</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had as much reason to engage in battel, as <hi>Fabius</hi> formerly had to refuse
fighting.</p>
               <p>This is confirmed by the several ways of proceeding of the same <hi>Hannibal,</hi> an
excellent Commander; who at first, when he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> desired nothing more
then to come to a pitch'd battel, out of the aforesaid reasons; so afterwards being
withdrawn with his Army into <hi>Africa,</hi> shunn'd encountring <hi>Scipio</hi> as much as he
might, the different condition of affairs advising him differently. And it is a general
rule, That those things ought to be avoided which please the Enemy; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
being different, that which makes for the one, must needs be bad for the
other. It must afterwards be considered, that if <hi>Fabius</hi> had pleased, when he was
made Dictator, after the unfortunate Fight at the <hi>Prassemine</hi> Lake, to lead that
Army into <hi>Africa</hi> which was destined for the safety of the very City of <hi>Rome,</hi> it
must have been exposed to apparent dangers of the Enemies victorious Forces,
with uncertain hope of success in <hi>Africa;</hi> nor would this diversion have been then
peradventure a sufficient means to have freed it from danger, as it did afterwards
when <hi>Scipio's</hi> counsel was followed in an opportune time, when after divers bad
successes both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africa, Hannibal</hi> was sent for back to assist the much
weakned affairs of his Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>He therefore who will go about to imitate the actions of these two Captains, if
he will reap good thereby, must first very well consider every particular of those
things which he goes about, and therein accommodate himself, either by hazarding
battel, and hasting on to the end of the enterprise with sudden and resolute Parties,
or else must harass and overcome the Enemy by drawing things out to a length,
and by reducing him to many inconveniencies. He also who will advise wisely
touching the assaulting of another mans Country, to keep his own from danger, or
who will else make good his own affairs only by way of defence, must have divers
respects in consideration, which lead to the knowledg what in his case is fittest to be
done; and by so doing he may hope for the good success which these two famous
Roman Commanders had. But howsoever, though their affairs fall out less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously,
he will win the praise of being either a wise and circumspect, or else a
valiant and bold Commander; as befell <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Fabius,</hi> because each of them
knew how to manage the War so, as the condition of Times, the quality of their
own and of their Enemies Forces, the diversity of the Place, and other respects and
accidents, which in such cases ought to regulate our actions, did advise them
to do.</p>

               <head>The Fifth DISCOURSE.</head>
               <head type="sub">Whether War being to be made against the Romans, Hannibals Counsel
was good to carry it into Italy.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>HAnnibal,</hi> a cried up <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Captain, intending to wage War
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> resolved to lead the Army which he had already
raised in <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> by land, passing first over the <hi>Pyrenean</hi>
Mountains, and then over the Alps, that he might approach as near
as he could to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the Empire. This is
thought by all men to be a bold and generous advice, but it is much doubted
whether it were advantagious for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and for <hi>Hannibals</hi> own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figns.
He thought, that being to quell the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, he must shake it in those
parts where it had taken deepest root: That the <hi>Romans</hi> would be furnished with
Soldiers, Victuals, Moneys, and all things else from <hi>Italy,</hi> wherewith they were wont
to maintain War against several Nations, and to encrease their own Glory and
Empire: that whilst they were Masters of this, they could not be much prejudiced
by any thing that could be attempted against them in other parts: That usually his
advantage was very great who assaulted another at his own door, because he keeps
the perils, and greatest losses of War far from him: He increaseth courage in his own
men, and takes in from the Enemy, and makes the way more easie to Victory,
not onely by Forces but by Reputation, and also by the fear which he infuseth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Enemy: but the farther off the War is catried, and the nearer the Enemy
is assaulted in the Centre and very heart of his State, the more are such advantages
got. If the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were alwaies wont to molest other mens Affairs, should
be forced to fight within their own Confines, and were to wage War, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
their Dominions, but to defend themselves and what they held deerest, they
would prove less then themselves, because their courage would fail them, and the
splendor of the <hi>Roman</hi> name would be obscured, which did so much help to the
atchieving of their Enterprises. Therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> knowing by experience the
disadvantage of making War at home, and open enmity being professed between
them and <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> fearing least the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War being
ended, he would assult <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had done but a little before, would be
the first who should pass with their Army into <hi>Greece,</hi> and carry the greatest
trouble and danger of War into the States of others. But the longer and more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
the way was for <hi>Hannibal</hi> to conduct his <hi>Carthaginians</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> so much
greater Honor would he win when he should have overcome these difficulties:
That without great constancy and worth in the Commander and Soldiers, so
hard an Enterprise could not have been undertaken, such craggy mountainous
feats passed over, and their way be made by the Sword amidst an Enemies
Country.</p>
               <p>To this was added, that there were many in <hi>Italy,</hi> who were not pleased with
the <hi>Romans</hi> Empire, by whose Colonies sent by them into other peoples Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
they were robbed not onely of their Goods but of their Liberty: That the
fame given out that <hi>Hannibal</hi> would free these from the <hi>Roman</hi> slavery, and the
whole world from the fear of their ambition and power, might alienate the minds of
such as were Neighbors to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and reconcile them so much the more to
him. <hi>Hannibal</hi> did likewise consider, as he whose intention it was not to make
In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>odes into the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, to make a sore and long War with them,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59987:28"/>
that there were many in the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Senace who were not well pleased with
this enterprise, some being moved by respect of the contrary Faction, others by
envy to his glory, and others by zeal they bore to their Countries quiet. That if
he should be with his Army in some neighboring Country, and that the <hi>Romans</hi>
should be but weakly invaded, and not soundly set upon, it might in likelihood
fall out he should be sent for home, and Peace be concluded. He feared likewise
lest his Army, which was composed of divers Nations, when his Soldiers should
find themselves near their own houses, they might the more easily disband. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore onely intent to come with his Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> he would shun all
occasions of trying his men against the <hi>Romans</hi> in a pitch'd Field, when <hi>Publius
Scipio</hi> went to encounter him at the Banks of <hi>Rhodanus.</hi> Moreover it would
not satisfie the high and magnanimous end which he had prefixt unto himself, of
freeing <hi>Carthage,</hi> his Country, from the Tribute to the which she was made lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the <hi>Romans,</hi> to molest them in any part further from the State, but he must
march against the very City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the Empire, to allay, or at least
to weaken much their power. Other smaller things might have given some
trouble to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and have retarded their greatness; but in the same dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and uncertainty of War, whereby she had provoked so powerful an enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her, the reward, and the benefit were not equal in both the cases. Very
great and difficult undoubtedly was such an enterprise, but befitting <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
who, as it was said, had through the magnanimity of his spirit, proposed unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to imitate the deeds of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and had taken up arms against the <hi>Romans,</hi>
not out of any hatred he bore them, but for the dignity of Empire. So as what
would have infused fear into another, did set his mind the more on fire. He
thought likewise by force of necessity to infuse into his Soldiers that strength and
constancy of mind, which was as an excellent vertue in himself, whilst fighting should
be enforced, all occasion of flight being taken away, to put all their hopes of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in their Swords. This most expert Commander knew likewise wherein his
Forces did exceed, and therewithal he would make trial of their worth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
passing with his Army safe over the Mountains, he foresaw he should find
large Plains in <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein he might fight the <hi>Romans</hi> upon great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
his Army abounding in Horse, and the Infantry being the <hi>Romans</hi> chiefest
strength.</p>
               <p>Then as this counsel was taken by <hi>Hannibal</hi> with reason, so if this action be
particularly considered, it may be said, that he was very successful therein: for
the first time that he had to do with the Roman Armies in <hi>Italy,</hi> thought the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of two Consuls were joyned together against him, that which was first sent
against him into <hi>France,</hi> and that which was destined to encounter him when he
should have descended the Mountains, he came off with such victory as he put <hi>Rome</hi>
into great terror, both for that the City was not wont before to hear such bad news
from their Captains, as also for having so powerful, and so victorious an enemy so
nigh at hand. But what can be added to the victories gotten at the Lake of <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>symenus</hi>
and at <hi>Cannae,</hi> (places made famous for the calamities which the Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns
suffered there) to make his glory greater? and the good thereof was answerable
to the greatness; for those of the Empire rebelling every where, and flying from
the Romans distressed fortune, to <hi>Hannibals</hi> favor and obedience, he soon made
himself Master of almost all <hi>Italy,</hi> and put the very City of <hi>Rome</hi> to great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and confusions. So as it was either his noble daring which begot such prosperous
effects, or else it was thereby accompanied.</p>
               <p>Yet there wanted not other reasons, and respects, which may make <hi>Hannibals</hi>
advice of leading his Army into <hi>Italy</hi> appear less useful, and less praise worthy;
and it may be said, that if he had passed into <hi>Italy</hi> with almost all the whole Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59987:29"/>
Forces, bringing along with him Veteran Soldiers, and the greatest strength
of the Carthaginian Empire, he ought to have considered, that undertaking to
make War against the <hi>Romans,</hi> a warlike, powerful, and fortunate Nation, the
Carthaginian State was not likely to keep unmolested by their Forces; Reason not
permitting it to be believed, that they who formerly, not provoked by any injuries,
but rather excited by a desire of Government, had happily waged war with the
Commonwealth of <hi>Carthage,</hi> would now stand only spectators of their own misery,
and repulsers of offence, but that they would rather endeavour to carry that fire
which was kindled in their own houses, either into <hi>Africa</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> to keep the
Carthaginian Forces from succouring that part where their own danger was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.
And so did the effect ensue; for the <hi>Romans</hi> having first assaulted <hi>Spain,</hi>
and after <hi>Africa,</hi> and finding them both but badly provided of Garrisons fitting to
withstand so potent an Enemy, they reduced the first under the obedience of their
Commonwealth, driving all the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> from thence, and did put the other
into so great confusion, as little more then the bare name of a Republick remained
to the very City of <hi>Carthage.</hi> But how could <hi>Hannibal</hi> hope to tarry long in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and to be able to receive such succors and supplies as he must of necessity stand in
need of? The way was shut up by Land by the craggy mountains, and by the
Enemy; and the Sea was less open to them, the <hi>Romans</hi> not being only masters of
the Sea, but of Navigation; for their Fleet was greater then that of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians:</hi>
whence it was, that the succor came neither time enough to <hi>Hannibal</hi>
for him to prosecute his Victories; neither when it was sent, could it come safe to
him, his brother <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> who conducted it, being cut in pieces, together with
all his men by the Consul <hi>Claudius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of these respects it may be thought, that it had been better and safer for
<hi>Hannibal</hi> to have commenced the War against the Romans in <hi>Sicily</hi> or <hi>Sardinia.</hi>
The pretence of taking up Arms against the Romans, for the recovery of such things
as were granted out of great necessity to them by his Commonwealth, was more
just. Wherefore he might have bethought himself of not provoking the disfavor
both of God and man against him; as it appeared on the contrary, that his breach
of Articles, and his too bold design of driving the Romans out of <hi>Italy,</hi> their own
proper seat and dominion, made all things prove cross unto him. The business
would likewise have proved more opportune and easie, by reason of the ill satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which the people of those Islands received from the <hi>Romans</hi> power, which
occasioned in them a great mind to rebel, as was afterwards found. The Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Commonwealth was strong enough by Sea; and though Fortune had not
been propitious to them in their Naval conflict with the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet was their
experience in Maritime affairs greater; and the City was then so well provided of
Shipping, as we read that they were above five hundred Ships which they were
forced to burn by command from <hi>Scipio,</hi> after <hi>Hannibals</hi> Rout in <hi>Africa.</hi> If <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
would then have put his Army into these Bottoms, and have turned with
powerful Forces upon <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and being also assisted with the Peoples
inclination, he could not almost have doubted to have reduced them in a small
time under the Carthaginian power. And having won these Islands, what way
would he have made for the enterprise of <hi>Italy?</hi> He might have made use of this
situation, and of his Fleet, to have kept the Sea open to himself, and block'd up to
the <hi>Romans:</hi> whereas doing the contrary, it happened otherwise; for the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
Fleet being very weak, the greater part whereof were imployed in other
places, it was overcome by the <hi>Romans,</hi> their Navigation and Succor was hindred,
and finally all <hi>Hannibals</hi> designs were frustrated. But the advantage which <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
might have reaped by such an enterprise, and by the getting of <hi>Sicily,</hi> may easily
be known by what <hi>Scipio</hi> got, who being to pass with his Army into <hi>Africa,</hi> putting
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59987:29"/>
in at <hi>Sicily,</hi> he thereby got great assistance and accommodation. And the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
themselves were aware, that the War ought to have been handled thus:
For after the death of <hi>Hier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> Lord of <hi>Syracusa,</hi> they sent their Fleet to regain <hi>Sicily;</hi>
but the counsel was too late and unopportunely taken; for Fortune beginning now
again to smile upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the enterprise being undertaken with but weak
Forces, they did little else but raise Tumults, with more of loss to those that had
rebelled against the <hi>Romans,</hi> then any advantage to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> It seems
likewise that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he first endeavoured to joyn in league with <hi>Philip</hi>
King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> whose strength by Sea was very great, and his jealousies of the
<hi>Romans</hi> likewise very great, as also his desire to secure himself therefrom, had laid
a better foundation for his designs, and might have had better success in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
against the <hi>Romans;</hi> which because out of vainglorious ambition he would
accelerate, he overthrew them.</p>
               <p>Let us then bound <hi>Hannibals</hi> praises within straiter precincts, though his fame
sound very gloriously in the memory of all Ages, for the greatness of his attempts,
and his success therein at first; since that advantage ceaseth which might first have
counselled him to the affairs of <hi>Italy:</hi> And let us only see whether he may have
purchased any true glory by his so great daring, and by the readiness wherewith he
buckled to battel. He who will weigh things with reason and experience, will find
that Wisdom ought to be of greater consideration in a worthy Commander, then
force of Arms. Which may be seen in <hi>Hannibal;</hi> for the wisdom of <hi>Quintus
Fabius</hi> did that against him with safety, which the War waged with much loss, and
more danger, by <hi>Flaminius</hi> and by <hi>Sempronius,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Gaius Terentius,</hi>
all of them Consuls, and Commanders of the <hi>Romans</hi> Armies, could not do; who
rashly hazarding the doubtful events of Battel, were overcome by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and
brought the affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> to almost utter despair. The praise then which is given
to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> is great eagerness of mind against dangers: which though of it self it
may make him worthy some admiration, yet such a vertue fals easily into vice, and
in stead of Boldness, may be termed Rashness. But if we will consider <hi>Hannibals</hi>
Actions yet a little more narrowly, we shall the better discover, that <hi>Hannibal</hi>
having undertaken this War unjustly, and violated the Articles made between the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> he cannot deserve to be truly named valiant, the
vertue of Valor not consisting in the maintaining of an unjust Cause. And if <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
ought to glory of his having routed the <hi>Romans,</hi> his glory will prove the less,
since the Captains whom he overcame were not so much cryed up, and were of lesser
experience and worth then many other <hi>Romans,</hi> who never had to do in any great
enterprise; and that it was not his own worth, and the worth of his Soldiers which
made way to his Victories; more then did the ignorance, rashness, and chiefly the
discord of the Roman Commanders; to whom, through some unlucky Star, it
was the misfortune of the Commonwealth at that time to commit the guidance
and command of her Forces. But when he met with <hi>Fabius, Marcellus,</hi> or <hi>Scipio,</hi>
the face of affairs altered. And yet <hi>Hannibal</hi> ought to have believed he should have
met with these, or at least such as these, then with the others, or such as them:
For the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had experienced much to their loss, in the preceding War,
what the worth of the Roman Commanders was. <hi>Hannibal</hi> might likewise have
considered, how hard it would be for him to vanquish so many Cities, so many
Roman Colonies, defended by Citizens who did partake of the Roman name and
vilor. But this was seen afterwards by experience, when he first began to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the taking in of Cities, and when entring into <hi>Umbrid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and being incamped
about <hi>Spoletum,</hi> he spent much time there to little purpose; and finding how
strong defence was made by a little Roman Colony, he saw how vain his designs
would be of stom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And though many of the chief Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> fell into his hands, this happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through the renown of Victories which he had won; which working upon
many people who did accommodate themselves to the Victors fortune, they gave
themselves willingly over to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and rebelled against the vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Romans.</hi> But to besiege Cities required time, and time afforded means to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who were at their own homes, to recruit their Forces, and reduced
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was a stranger, into many inconveniencies and necessities. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rmed by Writers, that when <hi>Hannibal</hi> had the means of fighting
afforded him (which he so much desired, but had little reason to hope for) by
<hi>Terentius</hi> the Consuls rashness, who was afterwards routed and overcome; his
affairs were reduced to so great and desperate straits, as manifest signs of revolting
over to the enemies Camp were discovered, and in himself a mind to save himself
by flying away into <hi>Africa</hi> by Sea.</p>
               <p>But let us take the end of War into consideration, which we will be better able to
judge by, then by its beginning: And though it is usually said, that Event is the
fools Schoolmaster, yet it often falls out, that things are known by the event, which
would never have been formerly thought upon; and the best instruction is that
which is learnt by experience. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after having with various and uncertain
success, but with very great and certain dangers, oftentimes tried the event of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Battels with the Romans, was constrained, not so much out of obedience to
the Carthaginian Senate, as out of necessity to forgo <hi>Italy,</hi> and to lead the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his Army, which was already very much lessened, back into <hi>Africa,</hi> to
relieve the City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which was by <hi>Scipio</hi> reduced into great danger; and
with his like former boldness, though not with the like prosperous success, come
to a day of Battel with his enemy: Wherein his Army being overthrown, and with
that Army, which was the strength of the Empire, all hopes lost of ever being able
to make head against the <hi>Romans,</hi> the War was finally ended upon new conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and by the agreement, but in effect by the ultimate ruine of the Carthaginian
Commonwealth: And together with the loss of her Liberty, she was bereft of
all her maritime Forces; for amongst other grievous conditions, she was injoyned
to burn all her Ships, whereof she had great store; so desirous were the <hi>Romans</hi>
to keep her from attempting any novelty.</p>
               <p>But how can we pass over these great actions, without reflecting upon the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
variation of humane affairs, and without marvelling at the several fortunes of
these two powerful Nations? For the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> having as Conquerors over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
all <hi>Italy,</hi> and bereft the <hi>Romans</hi> of almost all their Forces, when it seemed as
if their Commonwealth, following this her miraculous prosperity, was in a short
time to mount to a supreme greatness of Monarchy, they fell from these high
hopes into the extreme of misery, being bereft not only of the gallantry of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but of Liberty. And on the other side, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who having not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years before her Armies so notably defeated by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as they were glad to
imploy all their care about the safety of the very City of <hi>Rome,</hi> did on such a sudden
rise to such a height of reputation, and power, as driving the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> out of
<hi>Spain</hi> and having put the affairs of <hi>Africa</hi> into great confusion, they forced them
to recieve their Laws from the <hi>Romans.</hi> This victory of the <hi>Romans</hi> was that which
opened them the way to that Monarchy, at which they afterwards did in a few years
arrive; for having quell'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and increased their own Power by
the ruine of the Forces and Dominion of others, there was not any other Potentate
who could long resist them. Other people seemed not to be ashamed to yeeld to
them who had conquered the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and made themselves Masters of
their Commonwealth. No truer, nor better reason can be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for this indeed

                  </gap> two great and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59987:30"/>
powerful Commonwealths, then the excellency of Military Discipline, which was
better ordered, and understood by the <hi>Romans,</hi> then by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> For
hence it rose, that every Citizen being amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> imployed in the
Militia, they had greater store of Commanders and Soldiers. So as though
they were oftentimes worsted by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they could notwithstanding soon
muster other Armies, and get new Forces: Which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> could not
do; who having had a notable rout at <hi>Zama,</hi> were totally opprest, not being ever
able to rally again, because they had no other Soldiers nor Commanders under
whose conduct they might hope for better events. But when the <hi>Romans</hi> were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
they wanted not <hi>Fabius Maximus, Marcellus, Claudius, Scipio,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who behaved themselves more fortunately in that War, and did better service
the Commonwealth; and they could easily send Recruits unto their Armies, and
supply the places of such as were slain in Battel, out of their own Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Which was caused by the committing of the Government of the War to their
Consuls, which place of Magistracy enduring but a year, occasion was offered to
many other Citizens, to get experience in military affairs, and all others were so
obliged to the Militia, as after the Carthaginian War was ended, they who had not
served in the Wars for the space of four years at the least, were by the Censors
noted of Infamy, and blotted out of the publick Muster books. But the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
having through the power of the Barchinian Faction, transferred the
Supreme Authority of administration of Arms, upon some few Citizens, as it
was formerly upon <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the Father to this man, and after him upon this <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
and his brother <hi>Asdrubal;</hi> when <hi>Asdrubal</hi> was slain in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
which he had with <hi>Claudius,</hi> and when <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Son was abandoned by
his former good Fortune, and by the reputation he had formerly gotten; and the
Commonwealth being also wonted to make use of mercinary Souldiers; the Army
of antient Soldiers being lost in the Battel of <hi>Zama,</hi> they could not recruit it with
their own Citizens, nor withstand the blow of so dire a mischance. These, and
such like things may be argued, concerning this great action of <hi>Hannibals,</hi> and
these important successes of War; but rather out of probabilities, then any certain
demonstration. Yet these very considerations, may serve for useful instructions
in hard and difficult resolutions, to foresee what end is likely to befall the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of great Princes.</p>

or troublesom, then that which they made with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
especially when their Commander <hi>Hannibal</hi> did flourish, so from
hence chiefly may noble matter of discourse, and useful Instructions
for matters of State be gathered. Whilst <hi>Hannibal</hi> was in <hi>Italy,</hi> which
was for the space <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Fourteen years, the <hi>Romans</hi> made War notwithstanding
in other Countries <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Sicily, Spain</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> against the same <hi>Carthaginians;</hi>
and against <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> ïn <hi>Greece.</hi> But as War was made against them
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59987:31"/>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> so were they the first Authors of these other Wars; which affords occasion
of no small wonder to him who considers, and doth well weigh this their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
One would think, that the <hi>Romans</hi> being set upon at home by so powerful
Enemies, as it was apparent that their whole Forces were not able to resist, should not
have resolved by dividing the same Forces to make their defence weaker; since the
main of all their affairs depended upon the success of their Armies against <hi>Hannlbal,</hi>
how can it be thought a good advice, to hazard with part of their Forces the whole
Fortune of their Commonwealth? A thing which when forced by necessity, is
thought a great misfortune to the State wherein it happens. And when <hi>Italy</hi>
should be lost, as it was in great danger to be whilst <hi>Hannibal</hi> was there with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant
Army, to what purpose could any acquisition serve which should be made in
<hi>Spain</hi> or elswhere, which must of necessity fall of it self? And with what courage
could the <hi>Romans</hi> fight in Forein parts, when their own Country was wasted
with War, their houses, wealth, and all that they had exposed to utmost danger?
So as whilst fighting against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and all their minds being inflamed, not
only out of a military obligation, and out of charity to their Country, but out of
the natural and powerful love which every man bears to his own affairs, one man
stood for many: So when abroad, the unquietness and doubt of mind keeping them
afflicted and in jealousie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reason of the dubious case wherein they left whatsoever
was most dear unto them, would not permit many to stand in fight for one. Who
can praise the suffering of danger to increase at home, out of hopes of purchasing
abroad? Had the <hi>Romans</hi> Armies been in another Country, and imployed about
other affairs, reason would have advised them to have sent for them back into <hi>Italy,</hi>
when they saw so powerful an Enemy upon their backs. For, <hi>Vis unita fortior;</hi>
Force when united is stronger, and better able to keep what is harmful afar off,
Thus we see it falls out by vertue of mother <hi>Nature,</hi> in our bodies; when the Heart
is ill at ease, all the spirits of the body flock thither to defend it, as the most noble
part, and whereupon life it self depends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> was a powerful Enemy, formidable for his excellent worth and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
discipline, and for the many Forces which he brought with him; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<hi>Italy</hi> was as it wereunarmed at this time, and wanted her valiantest Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and best Soldiers. What could the Carthaginians have more desired for <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals</hi>
prosperity, then to see the two <hi>Scipio's, Gnus</hi> and <hi>Publius,</hi> on whom only
the welfare of the Commonwealth; now so much in danger, did rest, sent into parts
afar off, so as they could not, in her very greatest extremity, return to succor her?
If <hi>Hannibal</hi> had had a mind to have lest <hi>Italy,</hi> was not this parting of the Roman
Forces, and the want of their best Commanders, a powerful reason to make him
stay? And what advice was it to provoke other Princes and People to enmity, as
must needs be done by sending Forces to molest <hi>Spain,</hi> whilst the Commonwealth
was in such trouble and danger, as she ought to have made friends on all sides?
By which they incensed that Nation, and drew other African Princes upon their
backs, who were Friends and Confederates with the Carthaginians. And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
power of the Romans being formerly apprehended by other People and
Princes, the condition of those times should have rather advised them to have
cloaked such thoughts, and not to draw hatred and envy upon them: For every
one must needs hold, that if the Romans, being in such calamity and danger, would
vex other Countries with war, no Province would have been free from their Forces
when they should have been rid of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Which made the Romans cause
worse, and <hi>Hannibals</hi> better, with those in <hi>Italy,</hi> who did not much affect the so
much greatness of the Commonwealth, and much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Wherefore the <hi>French,</hi> who first opposed <hi>Hannibal</hi> whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="5 letters">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59987:31"/>
through their Country; nay, many of them joined with his Camp, and followe
the Carthaginian Colors in <hi>Italy,</hi> to maintain the War with them. If the Romans
did not know themselves to be sufficiently able to withstand <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
where they had all conveniences, and he being a stranger wanted all, and could
only come by them by force; what reason could perswade them to maintain War
in <hi>Spain</hi> at the same time? which War must be as incommodious to them, as it was
advantageous and convenient for their Enemies; both for that that Province was
at their devotion, for the neerness of the City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
the Sea afforded them, in furnishing them with all things necessary to
make War; which certainly may be done better and more commodiously at home.
Thus the Cimb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ians, after having given many defeats to the Romans in <hi>Gallia,</hi>
were by them overcome in <hi>Italy.</hi> War is likewise made at home with less danger,
out of the easiness of recruiting an Army, when Battels prove unfortunate. Thus
the Romans being oft-times worsted by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> did maintain and raise up their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
fortune: And the Venetians being assaulted at their own homes by those of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> by reason of the commodity they had of assembling all their Forces together,
did not only wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

their Washes, and were setled in the City of <hi>Chioggia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we will then consider the particular condition wherein the Romans were
at that time, we shall find all their affairs in great disorder, and such as did advise
them rather to lessen then to increase new Expences, by undertaking new Wars.
The publick Treasury was sufficiently decreased by loss of the usual. Rents of so
many places which <hi>Hannibal</hi> was possest of in <hi>Italy;</hi> for that what they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> was to cease paying usual and great contributions; for that the
people who were subject to the Romans, were so much wearied with continual
Wars, as they were hardly able to maintain those few Soldiers which they had need
of for their own defence, not in a case to furnish other Armies with monies, as
Writers affirm. Others add, that the affairs of the Romans were grown to so great
a strait, by maintaining so many Armies so long a time in several Countries, as that
the <hi>Scipio's</hi> writing to the Senate, that they could no longer maintain their Soldiers
who were grown needful of all things, the Commonwealth was faln to beg aid from
those who had gained much in former times by publick Impositions, so to provide
out of private purses for the paying and victualling of the Army: An example of
much charity to their Country, which was brought to so great a necessity; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of ill advice, and but little wisdom in those who had brought it to that pass.
The Romans affairs were so weakned in <hi>Spain,</hi> as <hi>Gneus Scipio,</hi> contrary to the
custom of the Romans, was forced to make use of many Soldiers of that Nation
to recruit his Army: which though the deceit of those Barbarians, was the
cause why he received a notable Defeat, wherein he himself likewise lost
his life.</p>
               <p>It might at first peradventure be thought an useful advice to assault the Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
States, so to remove <hi>Hannibal</hi> by diversion from <hi>Italy.</hi> But since experience
proved the contrary, how can the increasing of danger at home, to carry it abroad,
be praised? 'Twas already eight years that <hi>Gneus Scipio</hi> had made War in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and <hi>Marcellus</hi> had labored long with various successes in <hi>Sicily,</hi> when <hi>Hannibal</hi>
was notwithstanding still so powerful in <hi>Italy,</hi> as marching with his whole Army
from <hi>Capua,</hi> he went to assault the very City of <hi>Rome,</hi> where all things were full
of tumult and confusion: And had not the Romans had good fortune by the great
store of rain and water, which falling from the skies, retarded the first assault of
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> all the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

the two <hi>Scipio's,</hi> and the rest that were at war in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and in <hi>Spain,</hi> had been
there present, who if the City of <hi>Rome</hi> should be lost, must be made a prey unto
the enemy? The very fame and honor of such a Victory being sufficient to make
all that the Romans in so long process of time had taken from the Carthaginians,
return to their former obedience.</p>
               <p>On the other side, if so many Commanders and Roman Soldiers, wasted in
wars so far off, had been all joyned together in <hi>Italy,</hi> how could <hi>Hannibal</hi> have so long
withstood so great a power? The first onset of the Carthaginian Army was great,
when it advanced so far, as the fortune of the <hi>Romans</hi> began to give back, and the
Romans to confess themselves overcome, having had many great routs. But when
Fortune began to face about, and the worth of the Carthaginian Soldiers began
to flag, who were deboished with the delights of <hi>Capna,</hi> (which was the cause why
<hi>Hannibal</hi> tarried long in <hi>Italy</hi> without doing any thing of note) reason tells us that if
he had been assailed by so many Roman Commanders and Soldiers, he must have
been forced to have left <hi>Italy.</hi> And he being gone, and the danger removed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
distance from home, the <hi>Romans</hi> having a valiant, and an expert Militia, and
having won great reputation by this Victory, the other enterprises which they
should have afterwards have undertaken either against others, or against the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
themselves at their own homes, would have proved more easie, and
more certain: And experience proves clearly, that the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> would
have given the Law to all other proceedings; and that upon the success thereof
the whole War did depend; for the Romans could never drive the Carthaginians
totally out of <hi>Spain,</hi> till the rout given to <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> Brother to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> by the
Consul <hi>Claudius,</hi> by which the power and fortune of the Carthaginians growing less
in <hi>Italy,</hi> they fared alike in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the War undertaken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> against <hi>

be thought a business of greater importance. For <hi>Philip</hi> was a great Prince;
and might easily have troubled the Romans affairs, by reason of the neighborhood
of <hi>Greece,</hi> whose people were his friends and confederates. And though <hi>Philip</hi> had
shewed himself not to be very well affected to the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> since he
had first sent his Ambassadors to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to treat of joyning with him in confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy

brought him into their parts; which it was formerly known he had mind enough
unto of himself; but being put in fear and jealousie of his own affairs by <hi>Hannibals</hi>
so great prosperity, he was diverted from it. And counsels which bring certain
mischiess with them, ought not to be undertaken out of hope of evading another
evil which is further off, and uncertain, when he who useth it is in so weak and
dangerous a condition, as the addition of any new inconvenience how little so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
is sufficient to ruine him: and this was the condition of the affairs of <hi>Rome</hi>
at that time. Yet it may be said that the very Authority of the Romans name
was a thing of great moment, and so much the greater as the event approved of
their counsel. For <hi>Hannibal</hi> could not have been drawn out of <hi>Italy,</hi> but by
troubling the affairs of <hi>Africa,</hi> and by putting the Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>nians into the same
hazard and dangers, as they had endeavored to put the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to. They consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> having shewed such constancy, and worth in leading so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59987:32"/>
an Army, consisting of divers Nations into <hi>Italy,</hi> and having found that
Fortune (according as is usually said) favoured his boldness, their chief hopes of
overcoming him lay in making him be his own ruine, and suffering his Army to
moulder away through harpships. And this manner of warfaring, used by <hi>Fabius
Maximus</hi> had saved, and restored the Commonwealth, which the different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of other Commanders, by hazarding themselves upon the fortune of a Battel,
had almost quite undone. Now to compass this, it was necessary to keep the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian
Forces so imployed abroad by diversion, as they could not relieve <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
in <hi>Italy:</hi> For if so, many of the Carthaginian Armies might have passed safely
into <hi>Italy,</hi> as the <hi>Scipio's</hi> did defeat in <hi>Spain,</hi> they would have so overflown
<hi>Italy,</hi> as there could have been no escape for the affairs of <hi>Rome.</hi> This very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was followed by the Venetians, when they had their Enemies at their own
own homes, and were in the same danger and disorder by reasou of the rout
given them by the <hi>Genuses,</hi> as the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was in, after the defeat
at <hi>Cannae.</hi> For they joyned in confederacy with <hi>Barnaby Vis Coute,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Millan,</hi> and making a great Effort, sent many Soldiers against the City of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua,</hi>
and did so molest their affairs by Land, as they kept off those succours,
which otherwise would have been sent to their men who had taken the City of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oggia,</hi>
who missing of supplies, and being fought withal, and besieged by the Venetian
Forces, of Conquerors became conquered, and fell into the hands of the Venetians.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Romans considered, that in the Wars which they made in <hi>Sicily</hi>
and in <hi>Spain,</hi> they had this great advantage that they fought not with <hi>Honnibal,</hi>
a Captain of singular and unparalleld valor. It was likewise held, that the Roman
Commanders and Armies, might more securely make, trial of their worth and
fortune, in Wars made out of <hi>Italy,</hi> as they had oftentimes done; for when they
had any loss abroad, they lost nothing but those men which the fortune of War
bereft them of; but if they should overcome, they got the Enemies Country;
just as it befel them in <hi>Spain.</hi> Wherefore it being disadvantagious for them to
fight in <hi>Italy,</hi> it proved the better advice to temporize with <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and at the same time to fight with <hi>Mago Asdrubal,</hi> and other Carthaginian
Commanders in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and in <hi>Spain.</hi> So as the losses in <hi>Italy</hi> were recompeased
by acqusitions made in <hi>Spain,</hi> the which of all other Countries, was the first that
was reduced into a Province, and did much inlarge the Confines of the Roman
Empire. But if the Sea had been open for the Carthaginians, as it would have been
if the Romans neglecting their Fleet, had not provided for the affairs of <hi>Sicily, Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
might easily have been furnished with things necessary from the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
wherewith to reinforce his Army: So as no part of <hi>Italy</hi> should have been
free from his forces, who unassisted or succored, could notwithstanding keep
his Army so long together, and attempt so many enterprises; they therefore
thought they had done enough, in entertaining <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> a Captain of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and valor, so as he could not (as they knew his design was) pass with a new
Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> to joyn with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as he did after the <hi>Scipio's</hi> death, and
after the rebellion of many of the Spanish Cities, the Carthaginians being moved
to do their utmost, since they had lost <hi>Syracusa</hi> and <hi>Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a,</hi> which were both of
them faln into the Romans power. So as no assistance being given unto <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
all the labor was lost which he had so many years undergone in <hi>Italy.</hi> On the
contrary, the Romans persevering in their first opinion, when the two <hi>Scipio's</hi>
were dead, sent <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>blius Scipio</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> to keep <hi>Asdrubal</hi> from making his passage,
diverting the Forces which were to pass over with him into <hi>Italy,</hi> by keeping the
Carthaginians molested at home: It follows not therefore by a general rule, that
what was good for one of the enemies, must be hurtful for the other; so as it were
good for the Carthaginians to wage War in <hi>Italy,</hi> far from their own homes, this very
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59987:33"/>
same thing must be harmful for the Romans. But since they could not be the first
Assailant, <hi>Hannibal</hi> having faln upon them with such violence, it was reason, that
the Romans taking the same course, should assault the Carthaginians Territories.
We read also, that the same <hi>Hannibal,</hi> being still of the same opinion which once he
was, being with <hi>Autiochus</hi> in the time of his Exile, whilst he was treating of
making War against the Romans, he perswaded him to pass over as soon as he could,
and with as great a strength as he could put together, into <hi>Italy;</hi> affirming that all
other enterprises would be to no purpose, whilst <hi>Italy</hi> was at peace and quiet, and
that the Romans had means to maintain War abroad.</p>
               <p>This very same thing, for the same respects diversly considered, ought to have
instructed the Roman Commanders and Senators in the Carthaginian war; to wit,
that they were not to suffer their Enemies to rest quiet at home, so as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ree from all
thoughts of defending themselves, they might the better turn all their Forces upon
<hi>Italy,</hi> and the very City of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if they had taken that resolution at first,
which they did afterwards by the advice of <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> (who from the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Africa,</hi> took the name of <hi>African</hi>) to wage War with the Carthaginians
neerer their own home, they might peradventure have freed <hi>Italy</hi> sooner from the
so many troubles and dangers which she underwent by <hi>Hannibals</hi> long abode.
But it may be moreover said, that many other things did force, or at least perswade
the Romans to undertake these Wars. <hi>Sardinia</hi> was first assaulted by the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians
with those very Forces which were destined for <hi>Italy</hi> to relieve <hi>Hannibal;</hi>
so as it behoved the Romans to march with their Armies thither, not only to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and defend that Island, which was of such importance to the Commonwealth,
but for that they therein defended the welfare of <hi>Italy,</hi> by keeping so many Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
afar off, who if they were free, were ready to assault her. And this advice proved
very fortunate; for <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> gave so notable a Rout to the Carthaginians in
<hi>Sardinia,</hi> as they lost about Forty thousand of their Soldiers. The death of <hi>Hiere</hi>
the Tyrant of <hi>Siracusa,</hi> occasioned the War made in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
of that Island, by which it was comprehended, that if these their designs
had not been hindred by the Romans, that great and famous City would have faln
into the power of the Carthaginians, to the great prejudice of the Romans, who for
the same reason (being assisted by the <hi>Mamertines</hi>) undertook the first Carthaginian
War; judging that if the Carthaginians should be absolute Masters of <hi>Sicily,</hi> it would
be a step to pass into <hi>Italy.</hi> But this would have been the more incommodious at
this time, for that by reason of the so many places which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had taken in
<hi>Italy,</hi> they might have had a more easie and secure receptacle there. Moreover, the
Romans were invited to make War with the Carthaginians in <hi>Spain,</hi> and to divert
their Forces, by reason that they understood how that Province was but ill satisfied
with the Carthaginian government, and that it was well inclined to the Romans;
which did much facilitate those enterprises which were boldly undertaken, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
atchieved. The City of <hi>Saguntum</hi> was also the first rise of these Wars in
<hi>Spain;</hi> which they thought it did not become the generosity of <hi>Rome</hi> to leave in
the power of the Carthaginians; so as upon any other good success, they might
seem to have lost the chief cause in this contest: Neither did they notwithstanding
take <hi>Saguntum</hi> till after eight years War in <hi>Spain,</hi> when the other affairs of <hi>Rome</hi>
began to prosper very much; as if the City which was the beginning of so many
Wars, had been reserved to be the end thereof.</p>
               <p>These and other such like reasons may be alleadged for the War undertaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Carthaginians; but that which they made against <hi>Philip</hi> may be said to
be caused rather by necessity then choice: For <hi>Philip,</hi> for his part, being already
resolved to follow <hi>Hannibals</hi> fortune, and expecting large recompence, had sent his
Ambassadors several times formerly to him, to conclude a confederacie with him:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59987:33"/>
wherefore the Romans thinking it better to prevent the Enemy, then to be by
them prevented, fell suddenly upon him with their whole Fleet and Army, hoping
to suppress him, though they did not wholly effect their design. But they continued
their War against him afterwards in <hi>Greece,</hi> incited by the commotions already
raised in that Province by the Italians; knowing that unless they should interpose
themselves, <hi>Greece</hi> must either fall into <hi>Philips</hi> hands, whereby the power of a
People that were Enemies to the Romans, and already very formidable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
would be greatly increased; or else they must have recourse to the assistance
of King <hi>Attalus,</hi> as the Grecians had already protested to the Romans, and so
they must suffer the neighborhood of another King, who was already powerful in
<hi>Asia,</hi> and might at another time trouble the affairs of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the wisdom of
the Romans was always such, as not being cast down by any adversity, they never
seemed so much to apprehend present dangers, but that they had an eye to those
which might ensue, and in time grow greater. And this peradventure was that
which did prove the Romans power and worth more then any thing else; since,
when as they were as yet but masters of a small State, and that their affairs were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into great difficulties, both by their so many bad successes in battel against
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> and by the risings of their Friends and Confederates, yet they resolved
to maintain War at one and the same time in four several Countries, to wit, in
<hi>Italy, Sicily, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Greece;</hi> and they were able to manage them all. And certainly
such advice was no less useful then generous: For he who should overcome the
Romans in any one place, could not hope quite to subdue them, since they had
other Armies and valiant Commanders who might make good their fortune, and
raise it up again.</p>
               <p>So as things formerly alleadged for arguments to asperse this their resolution,
may peradventure be allowed of in such States, and amongst such Princes, where
there is not that worth, discipline, or power as was amongst the Romans; but in
them, or such as they, they are of no force; and very Experience, by the issue of
those Wars, seems to confirm and approve of the Counsels by which they were
undertaken.</p>

but was burnt and destroyed even to the ground. The Carthaginians
were oft times overcome in battel by the Romans; and had severe Laws imposed

their Articles, began to sail upon the Sea with Men of War. These things being
therefore treated of in the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> caused variety of opinions: Some were
for the total ruining of the City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> since otherwise the Commonwealth
of <hi>Rome</hi> could not be free from their injuries and molestations; and <hi>Cato</hi> was very

shewed what dangers they were always subject unto by reason of their Enemies

               <p>But others endeavoring the contrary, sought to prove that totally to extinguish
the Carthaginians was no good advice; and <hi>Scipio Nas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ica,</hi> a man of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
was greatly averse to this resolution, being thereunto moved (as he said)
not through any pitty to the conquered enemy, but for the advantage of his own
Citizens, who when they should be free from the fear of the Carthaginian Forces,
would suffer many evils through Idleness. So as it was the common saying, and
opinion, that the destruction of the Carthaginians would hasten on the ruine of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And <hi>Salust</hi> in the beginning of his History of <hi>Catilines</hi> Conspiracy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the abusive customs of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, seems to be of
opinion, that the overthrow of <hi>Carthage</hi> did more harm to the Commonwealth,
by introducing idleness and pleasure, then the keeping of her flourishing and in
arms, would have done. Yet there were other considerations which did thwart
this opinion, shewing that it was not peace and idleness, but the continually being
verst in Arms and War, which was the true cause of the Civil discords, and change
of Government in <hi>Rome.</hi> This it was which fomented ambition in the Citizens,
this it was that did too immensely increase their power. Finally, it was this that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the City, and through discord brought it to utter ruine. And how can
it be said that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was ruined by Peace since she never tasted thereof?
Insomuch as for the space of Six hundred eighty five years, that famous Temple
dedicated to <hi>Ianus</hi> by <hi>Numa Pompillius,</hi> that it might stand open in time of War,
and shut in time of Peace, was onely twice seen to be shut; once in the Consulship
of <hi>Titus Manlius,</hi> after the end of the first Carthaginian War, and once more in
<hi>Augustus</hi> his time, after the Naval Victory over <hi>Mark Anthony.</hi> Thus were the
Romans, and chiefly the most valiant amongst them, great enemies to Peace; not so
much endeavoring to procure greater strength to the Publick Empire, as to encrease
their own glory and power. Therefore one War was made to beger another, no time
being ever to be found wherein the City was to injoy, honest and civil leasure. And
Provinces, and the authority of administring War, was oft times confirmed to
those who commanded their Armies, who either desired to continue in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
or occasion requiring it to be so, that they might put an end the Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun:
As it fell out in the second Carthaginian War; where the time of tarrying in
that Province, and the continuing of his command was prolonged to the Consul
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who waged War in <hi>Spain,</hi> to the end that he might finish what he had
begun.</p>
               <p>The like was done to <hi>Fabus</hi> in the Wars which he made against <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and upon other occasions; a thing which being done contrary to the rule of Law,
though it made somewhat for the Publick advantage at the present, yet was it
cause of great disorders afterwards. Thus <hi>Marius</hi> whilst he was abroad in the
Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urthan War, was created Consul, and made chief Commander against the
<hi>Cimbrians,</hi> though he ought not in his absence, and in time of contumacy, to have
been chosen to that Magistracy. <hi>Caesar,</hi> after having commanded the Roman Armies
five years, when he was sent to wage War in <hi>France,</hi> had his place of command
cont nued unto him for five years longer; and not herewithal content, but being
accustomed to rule, he asked leave of the Senate to keep abroad, and to continue
in the Army; which when the Senate would not give way unto, they too late op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
his desire, he being grown so powerful, by reason of his continuation in
military command, as he valued not the Senates Authority, nor the being decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
an enemy to the Commonwealth. But if we will consider the beginning of
Civil Discords, how, and where the siding began, which insected the minds of the
Citizens with pestiferous corruption, we shall find that this happened not in time
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59987:34"/>
of Peace in Cities, or by reason of Civil Affairs; but in the Camp amongst
Weapons, and when the Commonwealth was bufied in weighty Wars. For <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
being drunk with the desire of military glory, and not being able to endure
that it should be taken from him, or diminished by <hi>Sylla,</hi> as he imagined it might
happen by reason of <hi>Syllas</hi> happy success in the Jugurthan War, wherein having
taken <hi>Iugu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tha</hi> alive, he had the glory to have put an end to that War; He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to think of establshing yet more greatness in himself, by making many of the
Order of Cavaliers, and of the people partial to him, and impudently corrupting
the Citizens, first with moneys, and afterwards with open force of Arms; making
the Magistracy and command of the war be conferred and resolved upon in him, as
he did in the Consulship, and Proconsulship against <hi>Mithridates.</hi> The Nobility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afrighted at this mans greatness, by reason of his authority and reputation with
the Soldiers, they mightily encreased <hi>Sylla's</hi> power, who was an enemy to <hi>Marius;</hi>
till at last they came to taking up Arms and shedding of civil blood. But who
knows not that <hi>Caesar,</hi> moved thereunto more out of a desire of his own greatness,
then out of his alliance with <hi>Marius,</hi> raised and maintained his Fraction in <hi>Rome;</hi>
and that his power encreased not in Peace, and in the Market-place, but in War, and
in the Camp? So for the same reason for which <hi>Sylla</hi> was advanced a little before, it
behoved the Senate to confer more greatness upon <hi>Pompey</hi> then became the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of civil Government; so as the whole City was divided; and with those arms,
by which, though taken up, and made use of against enemies, the first occasion of
contention among private Citizens was given, the very Commonwealth must be
wounded, which stood in the midst between them, so as her vit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l spirit of liberty
being taken away, her throat was cut by those whom she had most favoured. But
whence did the so many other corruptions of those times arise, save from the so many
prosperous successes of war, by which the Citizens being much enriched and made
proud, could not betake themselves to live parcimoniously, and with civil equality?
And it is said of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he corrupted the people of <hi>Rome</hi> by moneys which he
had got in the War, so to make them confer places of Magistracy as he listed, upon
such as were his friends, and partial to him. Out of these respects the wise Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator,
<hi>Lycurgus,</hi> intending to lay the foundation of a long lasting Government in
<hi>Sparta,</hi> though he introduced Military exercises, to the end that the Citizens
might be able to defend their Country; yet he ordered the City so, as it could not
much increase its power by any Forgein War. But the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi>
not being ordered for peace, could never find out, not enjoy a peaceful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>How is it then given out, that peace and idleness was the ruine of that City?
How should she beleeve that her Arms should remain idle, if she would have the
whole world for her enemy, as <hi>Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> said to <hi>Mithidates;</hi> that who would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve
Law from the Romans, must make themselves more powerful then they?
So as the counsel which <hi>Scipio</hi> gave to his Romans of not utterly destroying
<hi>Carthage,</hi> might be good in another respect, for the preservation thereof might
encrease that glory to their Commonwealth, which many of her valiant Citizens
seemed greatly desirous of, to wit, to have easily pardoned their enemies, when
they should have humbled themselves; as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had then done, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not onely with great humility begged peace of the Senate by their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
but given many of their chief Citizens for hostages to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and great
store of Arms, to secure the Romans that they would keep their Articles. And
truly the destruction of that noble City, did differ from the usual generosity of
the Romans, who had wont, after Victory, to gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59987:35"/>
see no reason at all why they should forbear the rooting out of these the Romans
antient enemies, for fear lest they should be undone with idleness, and that civil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
should thereupon ensue. How many years were there between the second and
third Carthaginian war? and yet when was the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> free from
Foreign war, though these her Enemies did not appear to be so? The last Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
war being hardly ended, did not they wage war in <hi>Spain</hi> with the <hi>Numantines</hi>
for the space of fourteen years? And yet in these times the bounds of the Roman
Empire may be said to have been very narrow, in respect of what they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<hi>France,</hi> which then was Mistress of more Provinces then now she is, was
not as yet subdued; nay, the difficulty and length of that War bringing along with
it the prorogation of Command, since <hi>Caesar</hi> commanded the Armies for ten years
together, did much increase those disorders which did at last prove the ruine of the
Commonwealth. But how much did <hi>Pompey</hi> enlarge the bounds of the Roman
Empire in <hi>Asia?</hi> over how many conquered Kings and Provinces did he triumph?
<hi>Armenia, Cappadocia, Media, Iberia, Syria, Arabia, Phaenicia,</hi> and other Nations
were reduced under the Romans power by this sole Commander. It will seem
strange, and yet it is related by authentical Writers, that nine hundred Cities were
made subject and tributary to the Roman Empire by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and almost as many
more by <hi>Caesar:</hi> And he who will consider it well, shall find that the Roman
Commanders did flourish most, and were most cryed up, after the destruction of
<hi>Carthage. Rome</hi> wanted then neither means nor will to exercise her Arms: not to
mention so many Wars, which were all of them famous, if not for the greatness of
acquisition, at least for other weighty accidents; and if not for their strength, yet
for the wisdom of the Enemy: That of <hi>Tigranes, Mithridates, Iugurth,</hi> and so
many others, where the then almost lost name of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did not concur.</p>
               <p>But if it had proved true, that the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Carthage</hi>
should be destroyed, should have remained in idleness, so harmful to her liberty, if
<hi>Scipio's</hi> counsel had proved successful, and those evils had been taken away which
be feared would befall the Commonwealth, <hi>Carthage</hi> was not only not to have
been undone, but her power should have been suffered to increase; for it is seen by
what hath been said, that War of it self was not able to keep the Citizens united,
but was rather that which did divide them. But this peradventure might have been
done by War wherein their own defence had been only conceined, and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of themselves from danger: And yet it is an absurd thing to say, that an Enemy
must be preserved, and men must be continually in trouble and danger of War, for
the conservation of a City. But say, I beseech you, was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re not forty three years
between the first and second Carthaginian war? And yet though <hi>Rome</hi> was free
from dangers, and from being troubled by the Carthaginians, nay, for some years
every where more quiet then she ever was at any other time, yet fell she not upon
those great mischiefs of civil contentions, which she afterwards incurr'd in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
heat of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orest Wars. This was occasioned, because the City was not as yet
corrupted, as it was afterwards, because it grew old, and because there was not any
that knew by correcting her disorders to return her to her first principles. What
danger can ensue unto, or can harm the common liberty or authority of Citizens
either in War or in Peace, whilst the Laws are observed? And when the Laws are
trampled under foot, what State can be free from the snares of the Enemy? The
Spartan Kings had not supreme authority in War; but War being governed by
good Laws, could never injure them. Power intrusted in Citizens with due measure
and temper, was never prejudicial: And behold an example thereof. On the one
side, <hi>Agesilam</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> being Commander in chief of the Army against <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59987:35"/>
                  <hi>Caesar,</hi> being already returned into <hi>Italy</hi> from the French enterprise, will, contrary
to the will of the Senate, keep the Army together, and despiseth the authority
thereof, <hi>Cato's</hi> counsel of destroying <hi>Carthage</hi> might then have proved good, not
of it self, but when the Romans, being safe for these Enemies, and setled in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of not being to fear any Forein forces, could have ordered unto themselves a
firm and quiet Civil State.</p>
               <p>It was known by experience, that the other agreement made with the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians
had done but little good: For they keeping still the same mind, though not
the same fortune, did not let slip any occasion of throwing off the yoke of slavery
which the Romans had put upon them. So as the only means to rest secure from
their Forces, since their words were not to be trusted, was to put them out of their
antient nest, and to make them live far from the Sea, as they were commanded to
do after that their Country was destroyed, so to bereave them of the opportunity of
the Sea, by means whereof that Commonwealth was grown great and powerful.
But wherein was the quiet of <hi>Rome</hi> bettered by the ruine of <hi>Carthage,</hi> if they
would have to do with more barbarous Nations, and Nations further off, not moved
thereunto through fear, nor provoked by any injury, thinking their Empire was only
to be bounded by the Confines of the Earth? What had the <hi>Parthians</hi> of common
with the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome?</hi> what injury had they then done her, to make
the <hi>Romans</hi> take up arms against them? yet <hi>Crassus</hi> had a mind to find them out
in those far distant parts, whereby to draw upon himself and the Roman Armies so
many great losses and ruines as they were to undergo in that War. The overthrow
of <hi>Carthage</hi> should peradventure have taken from the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> their desire
of continual warfaring, as it took from them the occasion of being in Arms; but it
did not so; for the cause which produced and nourish'd these thoughts, was internal,
not external. So as they were not provoked to Arms, but did rather provoke
others; and when they fought not for the welfare, they fought for the glory of the
Empire: For all the Orders of that City consisted only in the exercise of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.
But how could a City be long preserved, which was wholly bent upon those
things which were the means to bring her to her end? how could she enjoy true
civil felicity, if she knew not what it was, and did not value it, but did abhor that
peace and quiet which begers civil felicity?</p>
               <p>Therefore if that Commonwealth had been well instituted in civil Orders, and
that when <hi>Carthage</hi> was destroyed, she had known (which she did not) how to lay
down Arms, this had been the way to bring her to much good, nay, to the true
and chief good of civil felicity, not to the ruine and perdition thereof. So as if <hi>Scipio</hi>
doubted that the introducing of Idleness into <hi>Rome</hi> might bring with it such notable
disadvantage, it was perhaps, because knowing the imperfections of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he feared not that Idleness which the laying down of Arms is wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
but that which is born, and doth increase with the corrupt customs of Cities,
by which contrary, but wholly pestiferous effects are begot en; as the making of
some Citizens love pleasures, and hate labor and toil; and others strangely proud,
lovers of brawls and novelty. The <hi>Athenians</hi> endeavoring to banish this sort of
Idleness from out their City, committed the care thereof to the chief and most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Magistrate, called <hi>Areopagus.</hi> But that true and vertuous Quiet which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto Toil, and which as a thing to be desired ought to be sought for in a City,
doth not banish, but doth nourish true generosity of mind, which makes men willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enter, when need requires, into the dangers of War, for honesty sake, and for the
defence of their Country, not out of ambition and desire of self-greatness: And to
free the City from the fear of her powerful and bitter enemies, the Carthaginians,
was not contrary to this. So as I may conclude, That it was not the destruction
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but the ill Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> which wrought her ruine.</p>

why I say she could not do the like when <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> had slain <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Casar:</hi> when it appears they ought rather to have done so now; the people
being more numerous and powerful, and the City in such greatness, as the liberty,
nay rather power which the people had in ordering that Commonwealth, ought to
have been more esteemed and held dear. To this may be added, that in the time
of Kings the very name of Liberty was not well known, much less was the good
thereof injoyed; Wherefore a good which they had not known ought to have
been of less power with them: And in the Government of Kings the City had
been so successful, as it seemed she might run a hazard by chusing a new form of
Government, which she had not formerly experienced. And in the time of the
<hi>Decemviri</hi> the affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> were also in a very weak condition; nor ought the
Liberty, or command of that City be reputed a thing of such moment as it became
afterwards by the wonderful felicity by which she marched to the height of all
Glory and Greatness. Besides, the Government of Ten, retained a certain shew of
a Commonwealth; and many being therein interessed, she seemed to have
thereby also a better ground for her subsistance; Whereas in <hi>Caesars</hi> time, he
having reduced the main of all affairs into himself, and begun to accept of the
Title and Honors of a King, all Form of a Commonwealth and of Liberty was
lost; and he having maintained himself in that degree onely by his own Greatness,
and in a City so full of Nobility at that time, and of so many generously minded
men, his Principality must of necessity be the weaker, and easilier to be eradicated;
which when it should fall, it seemed that the former Government of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
must of it self rise up again. These and other such like reasons, afford oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of seeking into the cause why contrary effects were seen to ensue.</p>
               <p>We will herein consider first, what the customs of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> were in
each of these times; and what effects were prevalent in the peoples minds, men
not being accustomed to imbrace such things as are truly useful, but often such as
by the predominate affection are held to be so. Whilst the City was in an humble
condition, and that her Citizens were not begun to be corrupted by an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ambition of Governing, there was no siding nor partaking studied amongst
them, which crept on by little and little, and did so contaminate all orders, as it
reduced the Commonwealth to such weakness, as wanting strength to rule her self,
she must fall, and being once down could not rise up again. This corruption began
amongst the Soldiers, in whom the Commanders did permit such unbridled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness,
to the end that they might dispose of them as they listed to oppres
their particular enemies, and sometimes against the very Commonwealth: As <hi>Sylla</hi>
did to lessen <hi>Marius</hi> his power, and <hi>Marins</hi> no less to counterprize <hi>Sylla</hi> by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59987:36"/>
the same means, things growing into such disorder, as he made the servants of the
Commonwealth to take up arms against his enemies the <hi>Syllania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s;</hi> and this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
did so continue in great Citizens, and in the Commanders of Armies, as
it seemed a wonder, that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, who had exceeded all others in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Power, after his return into <hi>Italy,</hi> having prosperously ended his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> should be content to quit the Army, when every one
feared that he would enter <hi>Rome</hi> therewithal, and do even then with <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Caesar</hi>
did not long after, assume unto himself the chief Government of all publick affairs:
So great was the disorder, and so little was the Authority either of Laws or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
esteemed. But his Design, who plotted tyranny in the succeeding time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered
the better, for that this corruption which was first entred into the Soldiers,
was past into the Nobility, and spread every day abroad amongst the people: For
those who had been Generals of the great Enterprises of War, being grown ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
rich, did several waies purchase the popular votes, turning and winding them
as they liked best, to the end that the places of Magistracy might be conferred on
them, or upon their Friends and Adherents. Neither was the very Senate free
from this contagion, but being long before accustomed not to be at their own
command, but to depend upon the power of those who were of supreme Authority
in the Armies, they fell headlong into the same errors into which the people were
faln, manifestly adhering by way of Faction, not by any civil favor, to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Citizens who headed parties, and the authors of novelties; which was
at first done with some appearance of honesty, to maintain the Commonwealth,
and to defend Liberty against those who had been too immoderately exalted by the
peoples favour, to the injury of other more deserving Citizens, and to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of Liberty. But in the process of time and affairs, those who had taken up
Arms in behalf of the Commonwealth, proved no less burthensom, much power
thereby encreasing in one particular person, then those themselves against whom
Arms were taken up. For an immoderate desire of encreasing in power and wealth,
began to possess the souls of many who were already accustomed to rule longer,
and with greater authority, then was sitting to be done in a Civil Government. So as
all things were put into great confusion; and now, not those who were worthy and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
but those who were most bold, &amp; insolent found places of greatest honor in the
Commonwealth. Hence it was, that it being observed that those who had adhered to
<hi>Sylla's</hi> party (when his Adversary being overcome, he was become almost the sole
Arbitrator of all things) had often gotten great riches, and preferments in reward of
their wicked actions, the wealth of those who were proscribed by <hi>Sylla</hi> being given
to these, and such being easily proscribed at his Favorites pleasure, whom they would
rob of their Palaces or of what they valued most: Many allured by hope of getting
better things, and more easily then they could have done in a well-governed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
loved confusion, and favoured the Government of one alone, thinking
that they might obtain Honors, and many other favors, which are usually bestowed
freely upon such as are partial to them, by those, who will preserve themselves in
height of Power.</p>
               <p>Hence then it arose that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their fact, and the common Liberty, as <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi> and <hi>Virginius</hi> did, when

themselves being contaminated, and more desirous to preserve the chief
command in one onely person, that they might keep the power in themselves, then
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59987:37"/>
to remit the Commonwealth into Liberty, whereby their uncurb'd licentionsness
was to be corrected? Therefore as soon as <hi>Octavius,</hi> the adopted son of <hi>Iulius,</hi>
and who afterwards took upon him the name of <hi>Octavius Caesar,</hi> and of <hi>Augustus,</hi>
returned after <hi>Caesar's</hi> death into <hi>Italy,</hi> he was freely accepted by the Army, he
being well beloved by the Soldiery, out of memory to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and out of
hopes that if he should succeed him in power, they might share in the same favors
and priviledges. But <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> were compell'd to gather together suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Forces to defend themselves, to have recourse for help to Forein Princes,
and with their Soldiers to fill those Armies, which were to defend the Liberty of
<hi>Rome.</hi> So much were the Customs of the City altered in those times, and those
generous Roman spirits extinguished, who for a long time had loved the name of
Liberty more then any other thing, and then any other Nation. And though the
fact committed by <hi>Caesars</hi> Murtherers was approved of by the Senate, yet there
were many chief men, and of great authority, who being <hi>Caesars</hi> friends, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon him, did much de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est it; amongst whom were <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi>
and <hi>Lepidus, Caesars</hi> intimate friends, who did openly and powerfully maintain, that
<hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> were to be pursued by the publick Arms, as Enemies to the
Commonwealth, and that <hi>Caesars</hi> death should be revenged.</p>
               <p>This diversity of inclination in the People, and in the Senate towards the former
and these latter Vindicators of the Liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi> to boot with the diversity of
Customs by which the City was swayed at these several times, were much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by the differing conditions of the persons interessed: For the name of the
<hi>Tarquins</hi> was become hateful to all the common people of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only because
they kept them always busied in laboring their own grounds, but because they were
become hateful to all people by reason of their haughty carriage; so as they had no
Fautors who did desire or endeavour their return to <hi>Rome,</hi> but some few young
Noblemen who were well pleased with that former Government, by reason of their
intimacie with the Kings sons, which secured their insolencies. But these were not
of themselves of any authority to disturb the peace and common liberty; and those
in whom the publick authority did reside, were so well disposed towards the good
of their Country, and so uncontaminable by any other affection, as <hi>Brutus</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
two of his sons to suffer death, because they were of the number of those who
had conspired in favor of the Kings sons. And in the time of the <hi>Decemviri, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
was not held to be proud, but cruel; and yet not so really, but in appearance,
which by the common people is held to be as bad: For he had ordered many Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
to walk always before him and his Colleagues, with many Fasces in their
hands; and having afterwards taken away Appeals, he seemed in all his actions to
aim at Tyranny, which is always injurious to the People. So as it is no wonder if
they did not afterwards resent that such men should be removed from Government
wherein they had behaved themselves so ill, and did desire to return under the
Government of Consuls and other Magistracies.</p>
               <p>To this may be added, that the People had then almost the same authority
which some particular Citizens did afterwards usurp, and did go about to obtain
all unjust things from the Senate by sedition, as these did in the ensuing times by
force of arms. So as no such way being opened in the first State of the City, the
People knew that when the <hi>Decemviri</hi> should be driven away, they might obtain
many things of favor to themselves, as indeed they did. For, Appeals were not
only again allowed of, but much amplified, and the Tribunes of the People were
declared to be <hi>Sacrosancti.</hi> But <hi>Caesar,</hi> using therein either his natural endowments
and worth, or some wonderful cunning, had wrought himself into much favor with
the People, by his humanity, magnificence, liberality, by his familiarity with all
men, by easily pardoning offences, making of noble and frequent Shews, by his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59987:37"/>
sump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uous and costly Feasts, and by his rich Gifts; and by these means secured
his Tyranny upon the sound foundation of universal favor, and upon the favor of
many partial Friends, whom he had made great, and by many singular favors bound
them fast unto him, and interessed them in his own greatness and power. So as he
who will consider these things duly, must confess, that in <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> the
intention was more to be commended then the act; for their danger could bring
no true safety to the Commonwealth, as they themselves were soon aware of, by
flying from that City, which they ought to have summoned to Liberty, and making
themselves the Heads of those who should rise up in their behalf. But the business
being inopportunely undertaken, miss'd of that success which opportunity might
have brought it: For <hi>Caesar</hi> might easily have lost the Peoples favor, either for
that thinking himself sufficiently setled in his Dominion, he might value it so much
in the future; or for that they being naturally given to love change, might grow
weary of his too great power, which was already begun to be much suspected by
his having accepted of the title of King, and of many other Honors which he had
formerly refused: Things which made the People aware of their error, in being
too conformable to the will of one sole Citizen. If such an occasion had been
waited for, he who should have had a mind to have restored the Commonwealth
to her Liberty, might have had some better foundations for the effecting of his
desire. And if it shall be objected, that the City could not throw off the yoke of
servitude after the death of <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> though they were very vicious, and
much detersted by the People; it may be answered, That then the power of the
Emperors, and authority of the Soldiers were too strongly confirmed, who put
<hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> and other of their successors to death, not out of any desire of
restoring the City to liberty, as <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> had done, but for that they were
weary of their Empire, and hoped to be better rewarded by those who were by
them cryed up for Emperors in place of those that were flain.</p>
               <p>The cause of such diversity of success may likewise be known, if we will consider
some things more in general. Whilst the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was in such a condition by
reason of her Laws and Customs, as she was of herself well given to Politick
Government, it was impossible to introduce Tyranny, so as it could be continued
there: For the Body of the City not being organised so as became such a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is the Soul of the City, such a Union could not be setled there, as
might assume vital Form: And as it falls out in natural affairs, every thing is not
made of every thing, but from this or that other assigned matter, such, or such a
thing is particularly generated, answerable to the quality of the said matter, and to
the vertue of the generating cause; so in our civil actions, every State cannot be
fashioned out of every State, but these things are likewise determined by a certain
order; so as from Aristocracie we pass into the power of a few, from thence to a
Popular condition, and at last to Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Yet are these Transitions very hard to be observed in the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> for
that her Government was always mixt with divers species of Regiment: yet it
may be seen how divers Parties prevailed in divers Times, so as they came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
a different Form of Government. At the beginning Vertue was highly
esteemed, the greatest Honors and chiefest Places were conferr'd upon some few
that were the most famous, and most vertuous Citizens, though the People had
always a share therein. But Ambition, and the desire of Rule and Riches, did
afterwards mightily increase in the Nobility; who deceiving the Multitude by
several artifices, they reduced so much of the publick Authority into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to maintain their private greatness, as the Laws having lost their effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and the choice of the Magistrates, and the resolution in all weighty and
important affairs, depending upon the will of some few powerful Citizens,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59987:38"/>
the City wholly lost the resemblance that she had of an Aristocratical State;
and took the form of being governed by a few: And those very Citizens, that
they might preserve the power amongst themselves, were forced to favor the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
by promising and permitting unto them things that were both unworthy,
and unlawful. So these men, that they might domineer over more noble personages,
were forced to obey the hase will of the Soldiers, and of abject and insolent Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
men, which reduced the Commonwealth at last to a base and corrupt Popular
State (though in former times the peoples Authority was always great, but better
moderated notwithstanding by the Laws and certain considerations) from whence
it was more easie afterwards to pass to Tyranny, the Plotters using those very

sole Government of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Such changes have usually been seen in other Cities, and at other times, where
the condition of Government hath given the same occasion. So <hi>Athens</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
subject to frequent alterations of Government, and particularly to Tyranny;
Insomuch as the wise Legislator <hi>Salon,</hi> who had the charge of reforming it, before
his death saw it faln from the state whereinto he had reduced it, and tyranny brought

matter and means to any one who had a mind to possess himself of the Liberty
thereof. And it is likewise seen of Modern Commonwealths, that those wherein
the people have had much authority, or rather licentiousness, they have not been
able to keep in a constant Government, free from Civil Seditions, and have been
but short-lived. As happened is the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> wherein for the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and hard for him who desired to preserve it. So as though the House of
<hi>Medici</hi> hath by various accidents been sundry times driven from thence, and
though <hi>Alexander</hi> the first Duke thereof lost his life; the City, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
noble and magnificent, being much infected with parties, and corrupted by
popularity; all endeavors of preserving it in the form of a Commonwealth, and
in true liberty, proved vain: And on the contrary, the Commonwealth of <hi>Venic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

little in it of Popular Government, and much of the <hi>Optimati,</hi> not having given
way to such corruptions as use to trouble the quiet of civil life, nor afforded means
to any who should goe about to plot against the publick Liberty, hath been able
for a very long space of time to maintain her self in one and the same condition, and
free from those dangers, into which other Commonwealths have faln, for not having
a Government of equal temper with that of hers.</p>

that which was pursued by Caesar.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>JUlius Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Cato,</hi> who was afterwards called <hi>Uticencis,</hi> both
of them very famous, and greatly cried up persons, both for their excellent
indowments of mind, and for the great Authority which they held both
with the Senate, and with the people, did both of them flourish at the same
time in the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome:</hi> But they did so differ in Manners
and Customs, as it may afford occasion of wonder, if we will consider how, stearing
several courses, they happened both of them to arrive almost at one and the same end:
And of doubt in him who shall propound unto himself the example of these two
great Personages, to purchase Fame and Power in a Commonwealth, whether of the
two he ought most to imitate. <hi>Caesar</hi> won much love by his great humanity, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
and magnificence; but <hi>Cato</hi> was reverenced for the austerity of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
by the integrity of his life, and for the zeal he shewed in the managing
of all publick affairs. Those who were opprest either by poverty, or by enemies
had recourse to <hi>Caesar</hi> for protection; and those who hated wicked men, and the
inventers of novelties, trusted that <hi>Cato</hi> would chastise and suppress them. <hi>Caesar</hi>
never spared for any labour by which he might hope to purchase renown and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and <hi>Cato</hi> by despising glory became glorious: <hi>Caesar</hi> desired to shew genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and greatness of spirit in all his actions; and <hi>Cato</hi> delighted in nothing more
then in modesty, and innocency of life: <hi>Caesar</hi> was much given to all acts of Grace;
and <hi>Cato</hi> constant in all acts of Justice: <hi>Caesar</hi> seemed to take delight in Sports,
Feasts, and Banquets; and <hi>Cato</hi> profest openly to scorn all favor, save what the
merit of his own worth brought with it. So as the greatness wherein the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
then was, was said to be most resplendent in <hi>Caesar,</hi> so the preservation
of the antient Form of the Commonwealth, and of the customs of her first age
was held to be preserved in one onely <hi>Cato.</hi> These two so excellent Personages took
these two differing ways, yet each of them acquired great Renown, Fame, and
Authority. Great was <hi>Caesars</hi> glory by the many things he did in War, but <hi>Cato</hi>
was no less celebrated for Civil Affairs. <hi>Caesar</hi> by his great Authority could make
<hi>France</hi> be first assigned unto him, and then confirmed upon him, where he kept
in chief command with his Army for the space of Ten years; He also made use of
the peoples favour, not to aggrandise himself, but to make the greatest honors be
conferred on his Friends, and upon such as depended on him, which was that which
made his faction so potent. And truly, he who will consider it well, will finde
that as long as <hi>Rome</hi> retained any Form of a Commonwealth, <hi>Cato's</hi> power
was no less then was <hi>Caesars,</hi> for he oftentimes bore it even against <hi>Caesar:</hi>
As when the business of those that were Complices with <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

opposed <hi>Metellus,</hi> who moved at the time of <hi>Cataline's</hi> conspiracy, that <hi>Pompey</hi>
should together with his Army be recalled back to <hi>Rome,</hi> he carried the business;
which was the cause why these two prime Citizens endeavored the friendship and
good will of <hi>Cato,</hi> for they doubted of compassing what they desired without his
good will, so great was his Authority. <hi>Caesar,</hi> when <hi>Cato</hi> appeared to be his bitterest
enemy, procured <hi>Cato</hi>'s releasement, when he was imprisoned by order from the
Senate: And <hi>Pompey,</hi> that he might be fastened to him by the bond of Alliance,
endevored to have his Neece for Wife. Whence it is conceived, that <hi>Cato's</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere
behaviour had purchased him more Authority, though unarmed, in the
management of the Commonwealth, then the reputation of having command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Armies, and their so much obsequiousness to the people, had done to <hi>Pompey</hi>
and <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A just occasion then offers it self here of consideration, whether was the better,
and safer course taken to arrive at Glory, and Civil Greatness, or that which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
or that which <hi>Cato</hi> took? <hi>Caesars</hi> comportments seem to have been more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and better defitting a Civil life, as also more easie to be imitated; and what
indeed is of more importance for the happiness of a City, then quietness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
amongst Citizens? What more proper to produce and preserve this, then
Magnificence, Grace and Affability? all which vertues were proper to <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and which by a straight and speedy way guided him to the height of greatness and
glory. He who desires to obtain this favour from Citizens, must abstain from doing
any injury, must seek out all occasions of doing good, must attribute much to
others, must speak moderately of himself, must do good things, and make them
appear to be so, so as he may help not onely by his actions, but by his example.
Rigor, Severity, the neglect of all other respects, where there is onely an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
mind to do well (things which are sufficiently commendable in <hi>Cato</hi>) may
of themselves peradventure border nearer upon true vertue, but bear a less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with civil vertue, if respect be had to that which is found, not to that
which is desired. Who does not value the love of his Citizens, or will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
the acquisition thereof save by very upright ways, which are not always
possible, meets with continual occasion of contention, from whence great and
open enmities do often arise, which do at last put the City into confusion. So as
such men do first ruine themselves, and then the Commonwealth. When laws are
observed with such extremity of rigor, it seems to be done to oppress Citizens,
not to preserve Justice; Wherefore such a Government is but little acceptable,
and therefore easier to receive alteration upon any accident that shall happen: This
was seen in <hi>Cato's</hi> actions; for his way of proceeding got him many enemies, who
that they might make themselves able to bulk with his Authority, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
strong by Alliances and Friendships, and became not onely formidable to
him, but even to the Commonwealth. If <hi>Cato</hi> had not despised the Parentage
offered him by <hi>Pompey, Caesar</hi> had not joyned alliance with him by giving him his
Daughter <hi>Iulia</hi> for Wife, which was the occasion of both their too excessive
greatness, by which they ruined the Commonwealth. The people were not pleased
with <hi>Cato's</hi> severe way of proceeding, which made them the more easily adhere
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and his Associats, and so not perceiving it, became enemles to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
Therefore <hi>Caesar</hi> might still continue in the peoples good opinion,
and long preserve his Authority and Power: But <hi>Cato,</hi> though his counsels did
sometimes prevail, yet was not his Dignity and Power grounded upon so sound
foundations, as that he could alwaies keep himself in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>me condition: Nay,
sometimes things were born against him in the choyce of Consuls, when people
much more unworthy then he were Corrivals with him. The little pleasingness
of his proceedings was also cause, though under pretence of honor, and publick
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59987:39"/>
imployment, why he was sent from the City, and in a manner banished, being sent
by Sea to <hi>Cyprus</hi> for some concernments of that Kingdom; so as the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
suffered by his absence; and particularly <hi>Cicero,</hi> who was formerly upheld
by <hi>Cato's</hi> authority, and held for a Defender of the publick Liberty, was banished.
By these things the question seems cleerly enough decided, that <hi>Caesars</hi> way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
is much more easie and certain to bring a man to dignity and greatness,
then the way which <hi>Cato</hi> took.</p>
               <p>Yet he who on the other side shall examine <hi>Cato's</hi> manners and actions, as he
will find them more praise-worthy, so will he think that they may lead by a righter
and more direct way to true Honor, and to that greatness which is to be desired by
him that lives in a Commonwealth. For he takes a safer and a more noble way to
arrive at Dignity, who walks by the way of true Vertue, of Justice, Modesty and
Temperance, then he who endeavors the like by Popular Favor: For that Favor
which is won by a good repute, and by vertuous actions, is easily preserved by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and of herself; nay, the cry'd-up Honor which ariseth from publick Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Places, if it be not grounded upon true worth, soon vanisheth, and leaves
that in obscurity which did before shine forth so bright. But he who deals uprightly,
doth always advance as it were by a certain natural motion, and confirms himself
more and more in the habit of well-doing. So that Favor which hath so good a
leaning-stock, is more firm and stable; whereas that which is purchased by extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal
appearances, as it is easilier gotten, so is it upon any slight occasion more easily
lost. For those who are moved to favor for such reasons, are incited so to do rather
out of their own humor, or for their own advantage, then out of any true affection
that they bear to such persons: And therefore growing either glutted of the same
things they did so like at first, or thinking that they may receive them in a larger
proportion from others, they change their minds, and turn their liking elswhere.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he who does that which of it self is good, can never want a reward:
For though he do not purchase those exterior demonstrations which are usually
gotten by worth, and which do more illustrate it, he notwithstanding feels that true
content within himself which springs from well-doing, and which is held by wise
men to be the best reward of good actions. For he who loves and favors Equity
and Justice, makes the Laws be observed, prefers the publike good before private
interest, thinks nothing an injury wherein the Commonwealth is not offended;
this man may be truly said to be a great Citizen; for that publick dignity and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
maintains his private credit and estimation: Nay, such men as these, if by any
ill fortune or bad accident they fall from favor, they find always, as it were by some
occult power of Vertue, some others to protect them. As was seen in <hi>Cato,</hi> who
having drawn upon him the enmity of the greatest part of the Nobility, and being
but little befriended by the People for impeding the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law, though he
were for a while held low, he was notwithstanding created Consul in rivalship with
<hi>Metellus,</hi> who was favored by <hi>Pompey.</hi> And by a more notable example, <hi>Murena</hi>
himself, who was accused in Judgment by <hi>Cato,</hi> was not only not his Enemy after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but defended him against <hi>Metellus;</hi> and <hi>Cato's</hi> reverend authority prevailed
over <hi>Metellus</hi> his fury, who being accompanied by a number of armed men, was
come into the <hi>Piazza</hi> to promote the Law of making <hi>Pompey</hi> return with his Army
to the City in the time of <hi>Catalines</hi> Conspiracie: And we read, that when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Magistrates, Priests, the whole Senate, and very many of
the People went in such numbers to meet him, as the banks of <hi>Tybur</hi> were full of
them on both sides, as if he had entred into the City in triumph. And another time
being in the publick Assemblies put by the Pretorship, by the violence of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
<hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> yet he, being but a private man, was accompanied home to
his own house that very day with more men, then followed the Magistrates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:59987:40"/>
If then we will know in this diversity of affairs, which of these two courses it is
best to follow, since by what you have heard, equal credit may almost be given
unto both, we must weigh what his natural inclination is who will set these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
before him to follow them; what the true end is which he proposeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself, and after what Form of Gornment that Commonwealth is ordered in
which he is born, and which he serves: for without such considerations it is hard
to know what course of life a man must take. He who seeks to win favor, must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things shun affectation, as that which makes a man always suspected to be
ambitious, and his actions not acceptable. For he whose genius is naturally given
to humanity, and to a sweet and pleasant manner of conversation, if leaving that,
he will put on a Socratical severity and gravity, he cannot hope to use it so, but
that some other end being discovered to be in him, he will not onely not win cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
but will sometimes become ridiculous. So on the contrary, when a man is
known not to be wittily or facetiously given, but that his nature is rather given to
be grave, if he will appear to be civil and very familiar, fauning and flattering with
humble words, and in a base manner, he incurs the same mischief; for such forced
behavior denotes affectation, and grows tedious. <hi>Cato</hi> was born with this seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
as he had witnessed all his life time, by all his actions. He was a Sloven in his
feeding and in his apparel; he went on foot to his Country-house, and sometimes
when he was in place of Magistracy he would give Audience unshod, and in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unfit for the Bench. In fine, all his actions were unpollished, severe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
such things as others did most value. The clean contrary was seen in <hi>Caesar,</hi>
who was given to quaint behaviour, humanity and grace. They therefore by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways proved both of them great men, and famous, because they followed their
natural genius and inclinations.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the end which a man propounds unto himself, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
to get Honors and Imployments in a Commonwealth, is to be considered:
for if he aim onely at the publick Service, and at his Countries good, it is fittest
for such a one to lay aside all particular interest, and not valuing any private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
to attend onely a punctual observance of the Laws, and the depression of such
Citizens, who to the prejudice of the publick Liberty, will become too powerful
as did <hi>Cato.</hi> But if one who is meerly byassed by ambition, propounds unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the becoming great and powerful, by any whatsoever means; those arts and
applications which are pleasing to most men, and which purchase applause, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
liking, will certainly lead him more safely to that end, and conduce most to his
purpose, as they did to <hi>Caesar;</hi> who abasing himself that he might mount the
higher; giving, that he might get the more; being subservient unto others, to the
end that he might command over them, knew so well how to cover his most affected
and ambitious thoughts, as at last he did not onely attain to the greatest Authority
that is usually granted to any one in any Commonwealth, but drew all Dignity and
publick Authority upon himself.</p>
               <p>Next it must be had in consideration, what the Form of that Commonwealth must
be, in the which a man who lives therein, propounds unto himself the acquisition
of place and honor. For if the Form be Optimatical, wherein vertue is esteemed
above all things, certainly <hi>Cato's</hi> Manners and Customs will better sute with such
a Government; for in such a Commonwealth, the Magistrates in their dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
aim chiefly at those things which were very eminent, and much commended in
<hi>Cato:</hi> But if the peoples authority be great in the City, <hi>Caesars</hi> Manners and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
will be better beloved, and likelier to win approbation, and consequently
the peoples savor in their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>trages, which may carry them to the height of Civil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serment.
Therefore in <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rta,</hi> which was an Optimatical Commonwealth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
men did flourish, who in their lives and manners did resemble <hi>Cato;</hi> as on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59987:40"/>
the contrary, those Citizens were most esteemed of in <hi>Athens</hi> which was a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Commonwealth, who knew how to win the Peoples good will, after <hi>Caesars</hi>
way: whence it was that she fell easily afterwards into the power of many Tyrants;
insomuch as the liberty of the Commonwealth was possest at one and the same time
by Thirty such men. But in <hi>Rome</hi> where the Government was partly Popular,
partly Optimatical, both <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> might win renown, for divers Citizens
were diversly minded, according to the diversity of Government in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of publick affairs; but in that mixture, <hi>Caesar</hi> might get firmer, and more setled
authority then <hi>Cato</hi> in civil dissentions, because the Popular Faction was much the
greater. So that <hi>Cato</hi> siding with the Senate to the very last, and being, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his wont, and worth, unwilling, to be exposed to the licentious will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Conquerors, he was born down, together with the Senate, and reduced
to the necessity of making himself away. And <hi>Caesar</hi> being by the Soldiers suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages,
and by force, confirmed and setled in Power and Authority, which were
already too immoderately granted him in the Commonwealth by the peoples favor;
he possest himself of the common publick Liberty, and destroyed all Form of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

                  </gap>se and merit of that Cities
arrival at such a height of Greatness and Glory, is to be attributed. Three Ages
may chiefly be numbred wherein that great City did still more and more increase,
and grow greater in Reputation. To wit, the first, which may be termed her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy;
from the foundation of the City till the driving out of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> and
to the first Consulship of <hi>Iunius Brutus,</hi> and of <hi>Tarquinius Collatinus</hi> which was
the space of Two hundred twenty four years: The second, which shall be her
Adolesence, from that time till the beginning of the second Carthaginian War;
betwixt two which times, there passed the space of Two hundred forty six years:
The third, her Youth, which was the flowre of her years, and of her greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
may be termed the rest of that time which past from the beginning of the
said War, which was in the Consulship of <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Bold,</hi>
till <hi>Caesars</hi> Dictatorship, the space of Two hundred and twenty years, which
makes up the full number of Seven hundred and ten years, which the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Rome</hi> lasted, which might be so termed for the temperate Government
of the first Kings, and for the authority which the Senate held therein also, as long
as their Dominion lasted. For what concerns the times of Emperors, no mention
needs to be made thereof, for what concerns our purpose: For to boot with the
corruption which insued of the first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orm of Civil Government, they enjoyed,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59987:41"/>
and for the most part but unworthily, the labors of other men; and though the
City maintained herself in great height for the space of four hundred years, nay,
though many gallant and magnifick things were by the Majesty of the Empire,
and by the Emperors power, yet these did not concur to the first foundation of the
Empire, which is that which is now particularly enquired into; but the Emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re did
for the most part decline in divers parts, and in sundry times, till at last it began to
hasten more headlong to ruine.</p>
               <p>The chief and greatest praise then of this most noble and most artificial Fabrick
may be attributed to the first that laid the first foundation: For those that succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, finding that they might thereupon safely erect the great structure of the
Roman Empire, their Counsels were excited, and their work chiefly helped by those
who did first think thereupon, and did so work, as the City being well ordered and
disposed of with good principles, might rise to a greater degree of dignity and
Empire. But those of the third Age, having noble examples of worth before them,
and seeing so good and gallant a work already so prosperously increased and raised
up, went more couragiously on to greater and more noble works, having framed a
conceit unto themselves out of the former prosperous successes, that they might be
able to make (as they did) their City the Mistress and Monarch of all Nations.
The first Age was governed by seven Kings, of differing natures and customs for
the most part, but well fitted to what concerned the service of the new City, and
<hi>Romes</hi> rising greatness. For <hi>Romulus,</hi> the Father and Founder thereof, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
at Arms; so as accompanied by other military men, he began the first habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and did so order things, as the new City might subsist of herself, without
putting herself under the protection of any neighboring people. But <hi>Numa,</hi> who
succeeded him, that he might give the form of a true City to the new Inhabitants,
ordering them by certain Laws, and chiefly by Religious worship, did so behave
himself, as in all succeeding times that City was always much given to Religious
affairs; which though they were false of themselves, yet did he thereout draw good
advantage concerning Civil affairs. The third King, <hi>Tullus Hostilius,</hi> reassuming
Arms, bridled the boldness of the neighboring people, who conspired the ruine of
the City; and getting many victories over them, began not only to think of such
things as concerned the safety of the City, but to enlarge her Confines by way of
Arms in her neighbors Territories. <hi>Anus Martius</hi> did study Civil affairs more, and
minded the multiplying of people in the City, and the making of divers Orders
which might reduce it to the form of a great and well-governed City. <hi>Tarquinius
Priscus</hi> accustomed the People to know the majesty and dignity of Empire; by
which reverence he, to the great service of publick affairs, increased obedience in
those who both then and afterwards were to command in the City, and in the
Armies. But <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> the City being already got to her full growth,
procuring his own ruine by his rashness and unbridled licentiousness, opened the way
to the liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to her greater greatness.</p>
               <p>By which things it may be conceived, that the second Age found the City al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
well instituted in Arms and Religion, much increased in People and Buildings,
accustomed to know the dignity and majesty of Empire, she being esteemed and
feared by the neighboring people, an Enemy to Tyranny, and finally fit to receive
a good Form of Civil Government, and able to govern herself by her own Orders
and Forces. So as those who followed in the ensuing Age, finding the way chalk'd
out unto them to lead the City on to a greater degree not only of safety, but of
glory, they found less of difficulty in all their undertakings: As it is usual in all
things, whereunto it is harder to give a beginning, then to augment them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the praise is due to those first Romans, which is given to the first Invertor of
things, of knowing how to put on generous thoughts, and use good counsels, when
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59987:41"/>
the City was so weak as she knew not how to nourish them, nor had any example of
her own men. Therefore in the following Age, the height of praise which was
given to any one that had deserved well of the Commonwealth, was to honor him
with the name of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and to compare his actions to those of <hi>Romulus,</hi> and
of those that followed next after him; from whom, as from the first Founders of
the City of <hi>Rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> it was generally granted that the rest had received power and
vertue to imitate them. The custom was therefore always observed in <hi>Rome,</hi> of
honoring her Birth-day with solemn sacrifices, as that which by its happy Auspices
had not only given excellent Auguries, but as it were a certain vigor to the so
many other Felicities which did at all times accompany her. And it was particularly
interpreted for an excellent Augury of the City of <hi>Rome's</hi> greatness, and of her
increase in power and authority over all the Latines, that she was born and increased
from the ruines of <hi>Alba,</hi> most of the Latines having been Colonies of the ruined
City of <hi>Alba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if we shall consider what may be alleadged on the behalf of the second
Romans, we shall find such and so many things to be said for them, as the first Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of the glory of <hi>Rome's</hi> greatness may seem to be due to them, without offence
to any others. For he who shall weigh things well, shall find that this Age brought
forth more noble and truer Examples of real worth, then any other; so as they did
not only excell themselves, but even all Foreiners: For the military valor which
flourished in the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> of this Age, was accompanied with other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
vertues, and especially with vast charity towards their Country, not for their
own glory, but out of love to her greatness and prosperity. Danger was so despised
by some of them, as some famous men amongst them did even sacrifice themselves
and their lives for their Countries welfare; as the examples of <hi>Curtius,</hi> and of the
two <hi>Decii</hi> do even at this day, much to their glory, shew. The generous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in that Age did contemn riches as well as danger; so as they overcame not
only their Enemies, but even themselves; things which were praised and admired
in <hi>Quintus Cincinnatus</hi> in <hi>Fabritius,</hi> and in <hi>Paulus Aemilius.</hi> But how famous did
they prove in matter of War, and worthy of that praise which is given to excellent
Commanders? He who shall consider how Enterprises were managed by the two
<hi>Papyrii,</hi> the Father and the Son, against the <hi>Samnites;</hi> what the Forces of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Enemies were; of what advantage their victory was to the <hi>Romans;</hi> will
confess that their merits came not short of any, neither in those, nor in the following
times. This Age was often to withstand the <hi>Galls,</hi> who were powerful and bitter
Enemies to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by whom the very City of <hi>Rome</hi> was assaulted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered;
for the delivery whereof <hi>Furius Camillus</hi> grew so famous. But this was
not the only occasion of trying the Roman Forces against the <hi>French</hi> in those times:
<hi>Quintus Servilius Ala,</hi> and <hi>Q. Fabius</hi> withstood them; when the <hi>French</hi> returning
more powerful then before neer to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> by means of these illustrious
Commanders, their whole endeavors proved vain. In this Age, divers P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ople of
<hi>Italy</hi> did sundry times jointly conspire against the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> which, the more
formidable she grew to her neighbors, the more did a common apprehension make
them arm against her: And notwithstanding, she did not only seem not daunted
amidst those dangers, but having still the better of those by whom she was infested,
she increased by the ruine of others. For these reasons Forein forces were called in
by the very <hi>Italians,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrbus</hi> was received into <hi>Italy,</hi> that he might wage war
with the <hi>Romans;</hi> whose renown was so great, as the chief honor in matters of war
was given by <hi>Hannibal</hi> to <hi>Pyrrbus.</hi> And he who in a few words will conceive the
worth of the Commanders in this Age, let him say that <hi>Livy,</hi> who was much versed
in the Roman affairs, did attribute so much to the Commanders of this Age, as he
esteemed them not only equal, but superior to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great: holding for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59987:42"/>
certain, that if <hi>Alexander</hi> after he had conquered <hi>Darius,</hi> had turned into <hi>Italy,</hi>
he would have left the glory that he won in <hi>Persia,</hi> when he should have met with
the Roman Forces, commanded by <hi>Fabius Maximus, Valerius Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Cursor,</hi> and <hi>Titus Manlius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But above all things it is worth consideration, that in this Age, the City of
<hi>Rome,</hi> was confirmed and established with more certain and useful orders, as well
in Civil as in Military Affairs, whereby she long after was governed, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
whereof, she chiefly arrived at such a height of greatness. Great were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which were given in <hi>Rome</hi> to military worth, and those Citizens were much
egg'd on by glory to great undertakings, and sharp sufferings. Triumph was a
great ornament and glory to victorious Commanders; which was first used
to honor the Consul <hi>Post humius,</hi> for the Victory he wan over the <hi>Sabins.</hi> The
first equestral Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, were likewise an invention of this Age, which were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Consuls who overcame the <hi>Latins</hi> in Battel. In this Age the Mural and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vick
Garlands were first used, to the end, that there might be rewards for every
mans worth. The wintring of Soldiers in the Fields and under Tents, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to be used by the Romans in this Age: a thing which proved so useful and
necessary afterwards in greater and farther distant enterprises. What did more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in her greatest dangers and weightiest occasions, then
the authority of Dictator; a Magistracy of reverend majesty, and which proved so
often the true and onely remedy to maintain the affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> in their less prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
times. This was first created in <hi>Rome,</hi> to resist the forces of Forty <hi>Populi La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini,</hi>
who were joyned in league together against the Romans, and against whom
<hi>Posthumius</hi> was created the first Dictator. But how reverend and unviolable the
observance of military orders were with the Commanders of this Age, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
by the famous examples of the severity of <hi>Posthumius,</hi> and of <hi>Manlius
Torquatus</hi> against their own Sons, who for not obeying the command of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
though it were accompanied with noble daring, and happy success, was
punished by death.</p>
               <p>And as this age was busied in perpetual Wars, new Wars being perpetually
raised up by the same people of <hi>Latium</hi> and <hi>Toscany,</hi> whom they had often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
so to it that Fortitude, Vertue of mind, and Military Discipline is chiefly
to be attributed, by which the people of <hi>Rome</hi> proved more excellent then all
other Nations. For this so continual exercise of Arms for so many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
did so accustom the City to Military Affairs, as it was not onely easie for
those that followed after, to tread in the footsteps of these their Predecessors, but
almost necessary for the preservation of the City; which being long accustomed
to labor and warlike occupations, could not, nor would not without intestine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
live in idleness. And as for the orders in Civil Affairs, certainly no small
praise is likewise due to this Age; for not to touch upon many particular Laws and
Institutions; the most famous Laws amongst the Romans of the Twelve Tables,
made in the Decemvirate of <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> and his Colleagues, by which the
City of <hi>Rome</hi> was chiefly governed, were Institutions of this Age; industriously
taking divers things from the Grecians, amongst whom more then in any other
Nation, all learning, and all the most noble Arts did then chiefly flourish. Amongst
other things, great was the wisdom of allowing the <hi>Latius</hi> to be free Denisons of
<hi>Rome,</hi> for hereby the City was notably augmented, and her Empire established
For she did not onely for ever free her self from the vexation which she had had
for the space of Four hundred years by the Forces of these people, whom they
had often subdued, and who had often rebelled against the Romans, and could
not by Force be kept within the bonds of obedience; but being hereby obliged
so fast, and so interessed in the same Affairs with the Romans, she was much
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59987:42"/>
assisted by them in the so many Wars which the Romans made afterwards.
The use of Colonies was of great advantage likewise to the Roman Empire;
for it served to ease the City when she was opprest with too many Citizens, and
to keep others in obedience who were daily reduced under the Roman Empire. And
this use of Colonies, though it had a certain weak beginning, when <hi>Romulus</hi> sent
some to inhabit in the City of <hi>Fidena,</hi> yet was it oftener and more orderly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and confirmed in this second Age; So as experience shewing the good of
this institution to those that came after, this custom was ever after followed by the
Romans. This Age is likewise a great argument of the civil wisdom of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens:
for though there were therein important Insurrections often made, and so
great broils between the People and the Nobility; and though it were harder to
keep those in obedience, who had continued to serve in the Commonwealth in her
Wars for the space of a hundred years after the driving out of their Kings, without
pay, yet were they able to appease all discords without the effusion of any civil blood,
as it happend afterwards in the third Age, wherein great tumults arose from little
ones; so as Civil Wars, or at least dissentions and partakings continued amongst
the Citizens for about Fifty years, from <hi>Sylla's</hi> Dictatorship to that of <hi>Caesars,</hi>
thereupon the final ruine of the Commonwealth ensued. It also gives a great proof
of the perfection of the orders observed in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in these times, that she
was twice able to shake off slavery; First, that of the Kings, and then that of the
<hi>Decemviri;</hi> which the Third Age could not do, which being once faln under
the command of <hi>Sylla,</hi> though he himself forewent the vast authority which was
granted him, and left the City in Liberty, continued notwithstanding still in facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which soon after brought her past all remedy under <hi>Caesars</hi> most express Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
And certainly great was the endeavor after Liberty in this second Age, in
respect whereof all things else were set at nought; insomuch as <hi>Brutus</hi> did not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
his own Sons life, it being suspected that he had had to do with <hi>Tarquin</hi> to the
prejudice of Liberty; and the whole people of <hi>Rome</hi> condemned <hi>Manlius Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>
to death, he who had saved the Capitol and the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> for being sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
his actions tended towards Tyranny. Those who lived in the hardest times
of this second Age shewed their constant generosity, when the City of <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burnt and destroyed by the French, they would not abandon her, and go to
live at <hi>Veij,</hi> as their forlorn fortune, and the condition of these times seemed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
them to do; but kept their hopes alive for better things, which if they had
then abandoned, that name and fame of <hi>Rome</hi> had peradventure been for ever lost,
which her happy genius promised her. So as he who shall consider the works and
actions of those Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> of this second Age, may with reason think them
worthy of great praise; so as it may seem they had nothing to desire, whereby
to have been made as illustrious in the sight of the world, and their actions equal
to those of the Third Age, then to have had occasion of greater enterprises,
as they had. But on the contrary, these mens actions are more to be commended
for the integrity of their manners, for their love towards their Country, and for
their other noble vertues; whereas in those of the last Age the splendor of their
glorious actions in War, was oft-times obscured, and stained by other vices, by
Ambition, Avarice, and immoderate Liberty; to which things the Third Age
was so addicted, as they brought her in the height of her greatest prosperity, to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine.</p>
               <p>But before we pass this sentence, it will become us in justice to hear what those
gallant Romans can say in their own behalfs, who by the cried up Fame of their
stupendious actions, have filled the world with the glory, and wonder of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
greatness. And how much shorter the time was wherein the supreme Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
was founded and established, so much greater demonstration is thereof
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59987:43"/>
the generosity and worth of these men, who had the boldness to undertake so
many Enterprises, and could bring them to a good end. For, the first time that the
<hi>Romans</hi> carried their Forces out of <hi>Italy,</hi> was by reason of the Carthaginian War;
wherein amongst other things, it was not only a thing commendable, but much to
be wondred at, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> being till then unexperienced in Maritime affairs,
did so soon learn that manner of Discipline, as they overcame the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in
many Sea-fights, who for so long a time before had profess'd themselves to be
Sea-men, and had the first place given them by all other Nations for their Naval
preparat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons.</p>
               <p>But whereby can the excellent Military Discipline of the <hi>Romans</hi> be better
known, and their unvanquish'd worth, then by their deeds done in the second Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian
War; wherein at one and the same time they were able to maintain so
many Armies in <hi>Italy, Sicily, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Greece?</hi> And yet one only City of <hi>Rome</hi>
could furnish them all with Commanders and Soldiers out of her own Citizens, and
Italian Colonies; and that in so great a number, as that there was above Eighty
thousand fighting men of the Roman Army in the Fight at <hi>Cannae.</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<hi>Carthage,</hi> though her Dominions were large and powerful, after she had been
several times routed by the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> being willing to defend <hi>Africa,</hi> nay
the very City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the head of the Empire, was forc'd to recall that her
Commander in chief, and those her Soldiers which she had in <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi>
thrice overcome in battel by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> took still fresh courage, and assuming new
Forces, did even face Fortune, whom they won at last to be their friend, and in a
manner obedient to their deserts. But the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when once overcome by
<hi>Scipio</hi> in Fight neer <hi>Zama,</hi> yielded, and humbled themselves to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But
the last <hi>Punick</hi> War, as it ended in a shorter time, and with less trouble then the
former two, so brought it more glory and security to the <hi>Romans;</hi> for the very
name of the formidable Roman Forces, was sufficient to put an end to that War;
and the final ruine of <hi>Carthage</hi> which ensued, did for ever secure the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Rome</hi> from the false faith of the <hi>Cathaginians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But other great and noble feats of Arms, undertaken at the same time with great
courage and happy augury, as the War against <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and in <hi>Asia</hi>
against <hi>Antiochus,</hi> did sufficiently illustrate the Roman Forces, and did enlarge
the Confines of their Empire in farthest distant Nations. In the three <hi>Punick</hi> Wars,
which lasted forty three years, with variety of fortune, they fought sometimes more
for safety then for glory: But herein the People of <hi>Rome</hi> shewed not only the power
of their Forces, but the generosity of their minds; having undertaken the one War
to revenge the injuries received from <hi>Philip,</hi> in his having supplied <hi>Hannibal</hi> with
succors; and the other to preserve some Cities in <hi>Asia,</hi> antient Colonies of <hi>Greece,</hi>
in their Liberty, and from being injuriously oppress'd by <hi>Antiochus.</hi> And if it be
said, that these so many Enterprises were made by the Italian Forces; the first and
chiefest difficulty consisting in the subjugating of <hi>Italy,</hi> the first and chiefest praise
seems to be due to this Age: But take this for granted, it must be added, that a
great share of this very praise is due to the last Age; for the <hi>Insubri</hi> and <hi>Liguri</hi> were
not assubjected by the <hi>Romans,</hi> till after the end of the second Carthaginian war;
the first being conquered by <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the second by <hi>Quintus Fulvius;</hi> who wan
so much the more glory thereby, for that these are very noble parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
that the Country of the <hi>Ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bri</hi> was possess'd by the <hi>Galls,</hi> who were at that
time very potent in those parts, and <hi>Liguria</hi> was inhabited by a very fierce and
warlike people. These are not then things altogether so great and glorious, as
that they surpass all other things done by other men at other times: But if we shall
look further into this very Age of <hi>Rome,</hi> we shall meet with other actions so great,
and as miraculous, as their splendor will obscure the glory of those very <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59987:43"/>
who were so cryed up in comparison of other Nations, For when the City of
<hi>Carthage</hi> was utterly ruin'd, with which the City of <hi>Rome</hi> had fought so long,
and oft-times with variety of fortune, and those dangers being secured for ever,
there not remaining any other Potentate who could of himself gave a just counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
to the Roman power, they march'd so fast on to Monarchy, as in the space
of one hundred years, between that time, and the time of <hi>Caesars</hi> Dictatorship,
they extended the Confines of the Roman Empire almost over the face of the whole
Earth. Amongst the rest, great was that War which was taken against <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
under pretence of defending <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who were Friends to the
People of <hi>Rome,</hi> but in effect to oppose his vast designs, wherein aspiring at the

did the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> adoperate themselves in all the aforesaid Ages so worthily,
and so much to the good of the City, as each of them may seem to lay claim to the
chief Crown of the Roman glory. It may then be said, that though many things
concur to the production of any thing, yet do they not all do it after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
nor are they all of equal dignity in themselves, or of equal force for the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting

                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>, which
help'd so much to strengthen that body, and made it fit to sustain the weight of so
great an Empire. Those also who did next succeed them, who did add to her Militia,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59987:44"/>
her Government, to her good orders both for War and Peace, and made her
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itter for greater things, have their part therein; and finally, those who by so
many, and so signal Victories, placed her, as it were, with her own hands on the
top of her greatest power and dignity. But in this connumeration of things, what
can be affirmed, but that the last Age, which by her particular Acts, and labors
saw the Commonwealth seated, as it were, in the Throne of Majesty, may with
reason challenge the greatest part of this merit and glory, because she concurred
as the nearest cause to the founding, and establishing of the City in that state and
condition, wherein she was in her greatest excellency and glory amongst all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It is true, that he, who in another respect, will more consider the necessity
then the dignity of the thing, may peradventure be of another mind; for it is
most certain, that had not the City of <hi>Rome</hi> been first founded by <hi>Romulus,</hi> and
maintained by other Kings in her beginning against her insulting enemies, if the
Capitol had not been saved afterwards from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> if the so many conspiracies
made by the people of <hi>Italy</hi> against her rising greatness had not been repulst,
there could have been no such thing as the Victories and Triumphs of the <hi>Scipio's,
Marcellus, Fabritius, Metellus, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> and of so many others;
who atchieved those things by the strength of the City, already happily begun, and
encreased with much industry and valor.</p>
               <p>But as it usually falls out in natural things that their augmentation, changing as
it were that first Form, proves the corruption thereof, so as that subject being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to another condition, little count is held of precedent affairs; so in these
things which are formed by mans industry, as a more unpolished Form is suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by another, which renders that subject more excellent and perfect, no
man values the former, or considers it with a thought of praise or imitation:
So we see it falls out in the more noble Arts, as in Painting, Sculpture, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,
and the like, which daily grow to more perfection, those are most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in them who therein prove the greatest Masters; so as their particular
praise walks hand in hand with the perfection which by their industry they have
brought to that Art, wherein they have with much industry and study spent their
time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> his poverty was praised, and the like of some others of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
who were called up from the Plough to be Consuls and Dictators, because
they bore a certain proportion to the condition of those things, and of the City.
But the magnificence of <hi>Crassus,</hi> and of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> had more coherence with the
greatness to which the City of <hi>Rome</hi> did afterwards arrive. It seems then that
neither can there be any comparison made between these ages, for as they were
sufficiently different between themselves, so different thoughts, studies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
did become them: which things, if they had any thing of conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, it was rather by likeness, or figure, or rather some dispositions of
those first weaker operations, to the other greater and more noble. And as it
is seen in every individual man, the same things are not proportionate nor proper to
all Ages, but divers things do accommodate themselves to divers Ages, though the
one be subordinate to the other, so as the exercises may both be the same, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
because they are accommodated to the same aim, and end, but are notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
otherwise put in use, in Childhood, Youth, and Manhood; just so in the point
we are now upon, things suit not with a City in the second Age, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to her in the first, neither could the second do those things which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to the third, and which would not be praised in the third, had it not done
more then either the first or second. So to end this Discourse, it may be said, That
the City of <hi>Romes</hi> happy genius produced men well adapted to her three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and very excellent for what each Age and condition brought forth. For
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59987:44"/>
if the first would have made too much hast in agrandising, and making the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
famous, they might rather have disordered themselves, and by making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
enemies, have encreased the difficulty of effecting those things, which when
riper, proved afterwards more safe and easie: And likewise if the second should
have imbraced things disproportionable for her strength, and have carried her Forces
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> before she had therein setled the Roman power, it might have
proved rather the corruption then the perfection of the Commonwealth. The
first therefore, and the second are very much to be praised, for such things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
that Age and state of the City wherein they were done. But by how much
more the adoperating cause doth work upon a more noble a perfect subject, by so
much doth the work prove more perfect and excellent. Therefore those of the
third Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> having occasion to act in greater matters, as finding the City already very
spacious and powerful, the off spring of their industry and labour hath proved
more noble, and they have won such praise to the Commonwealth, as greater is not
to be pretended unto.</p>

               <head type="sub">How the Roman Empire, though it fell oftentines into the hands of
base and wicked men, was notwithstanding able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it self in the reign of many Emperors, and how it came
to be finally destroyed.</head>
               <p>AS amongst all humane actions; those Commands and Powers are
noblest, and of greatest worth, by which a man gets to be above other
men, and doth govern them in a manner as God doth rule and govern
the world, so of all Dominions and Commands that ever were, the
Roman Empire was greatly remarkable, and held in great esteem and
reverence by all Nations; and did so far extend her self, as it may almost be said
with the Poet, That her Confines were those of the whole world which was
known to antiquity. Which may be comprehended by this, that <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Great having divided the Empire between his three Sons, the elder <hi>Constantine,</hi>
to whose third part fell the Provinces of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and the greatest part of
<hi>Germany,</hi> together with the Island of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> made War with his Brother
<hi>Constantine,</hi> to whose share many other Countries fell, to come to a better aggiust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of division, wherein he thought his Father had dealt unequally with him.
But now this so stupendious Fabrick erected in the concourse of many years, by the
worth and labor of so many gallant men, must finally run the fate of all humane
things, must be dissolved and fall to the ground, and by her ruine occasion vast
revolution of things. Hence it was that so many noble Cities were ruined, and
the ground-work of some others laid, which proved afterwards very noble
Structures. Hence it was that many intire Regions, had their antient Inhabitants
driven away, and were possest by new Citizens had new Customs, new Laws, new
Tongues and new fashions brought in; and hence it was that <hi>Italy,</hi> which had
been the Seat of so great an Empire, was subject to greater alterations, and more
heavy calamities then other Provinces. It will not then be an unacceptable labor
(man being so naturally given to the desire of knowledge) to seek out how, and for
what causes chiefly these things happened. For that general rule, That whatsoever
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59987:45"/>
hath had a beginning, must have an end; will not satisfie our inquisitive under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.
Empires, as all other earthly things, have their beginning, increase, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
declination, and last ruine and destruction, all of them ordained and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of by certain causes: And though they may be seen to vary according to the
variety of Accidents, that is not notwithstanding Chance which appears to us to be
so, when we cannot penetrate into the true causes of things.</p>
               <p>In the beginning, the Roman Empire was governed in the form of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
her first Founders having begun to enlarge her Dominion amongst her
neighboring people. She continued in this her infancie, as I may call it, many
years, till the times of those famous <hi>Scipio's,</hi> who brought <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> under
her dominion. But afterwards in the ensuing Age, wherein <hi>Caesar, Pompey,</hi> and so
many other famous Commanders did flourish, she mounted to the height of her
greatness and glory: Neither did <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> degenerate from the worth of
them, though the Form of Government was changed; but he likewise did much
increase the Empires Confines in the Eastern parts amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> and other
exterior Nations, and establish'd excellent Orders both Civil and Military in the
Empire But this Monarchy may be said to sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d at a stay at this time, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in a Throne of Majesty, reverenced and obeyed by all Nations; and in this
condition she preserved herself for well nigh three hundred years, wherein though
many and great Wars were made by the so many Emperors who governed in those
days, yet were they rather made for the preservation, then for the enlarging of the
Empires confines: For there was not almost any of the barbarous and far distant
Nations, as well of the East, as of the West, which those Emperors were not forc'd
to vanquish and overcome several times, and reduce them to the obedience of the
Empire, from which they had rebelled. And if any one did enlarge the Empire in
furthest remote parts, as did the Emperor <hi>Trajan</hi> in <hi>Armenia, India,</hi> and some others
in other Regions and Provinces, it was notwithstanding at the same time lessened
in other parts by new Rebellions. But in <hi>Galienus</hi> his time, who was the thirty
fourth Emperor, the Empires supreme greatness began to decline: For though she
received her mortal wound afterwards in the time of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> which
was above a hundred years after, yet in this intervening time, the Empire being in
her decaying age, grew weak, yet sustein'd herself, and like a Tree whose root hath
been for a long time very deeply fix'd, could not be easily eradicated; so as though
she were oftentimes shrewdly shaken by Armies of sundry Nations, yet was she able
to resume her strength, and keep herself on foot.</p>
               <p>Thus stood the Roman Empire then, wherein many miraculous things offer
themselves to our consideration, and invite us to seek out the true occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For on one side it appears a strange thing, that an Empire arrived at such a
height of greatness, when she once began to decline, hasted so fast to her ruine,
there not being any other Potentate left in the World, which was able to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
her power, yea, which did not obey her, as subjugated by her Armies; having
also so many Soldiers to defend her, desirous for their own advantage to preserve the
Empire. But on the other side, he who shall consider, into the hands of how many
base and wicked men this so great Empire fell, he may very well wonder how so
violent a thing could endure for so many Ages, and how a Dominion governed by
so many Tyrants could pass from hand to hand through the series of so many Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
whereof there were above five hundred between <hi>Caesars</hi> time, and that of
<hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> in whose days the Roman Empire began visibly to fall,
by the taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the ruine of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of other Provinces belonging to
the Empire: And yet 'tis known, that the Persian Monarchy, which was of so
great esteem amongst the antient Kingdoms, was quickly ruined by its falling into
the hands of Princes given to idleness and pleasure, and was by <hi>Alexander</hi> carried
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59987:45"/>
to another Nation; whereof there are many examples seen almost in every
Age.</p>
               <p>Let us then say that another violence helped very much to sustain this violence;
of such a force is the union of alike things. Thus did the corrupt Customs of the
People and Militia of <hi>Rome</hi> help to maintain the State and Power of these Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Princes: For since People lived in <hi>Rome</hi> with much licentiousness, and were
ente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tained with many Pastimes and publick Shews made by the Emperors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
those appeared to be most splendid who were most overgrown with vice, as were
<hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> who did not only make the wonted sports of Hunting and of
Comedies be often represented with more then usual magnificence, but introd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ced
new Shews, as Naval battels, Chariots drawn by Camels and Elephants, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
all licentiousness to the Soldiery, no man desired to change condition; and
the Pretorian Soldiers enjoying all things of use and priviledg neer unto the City,
did not greatly care to be commanded by generous men: And when such Princes
grew tedious to them, they put them to death, proclaiming a new Emperor, and
receiving from the new Prince many gifts in reward of their wickedness: And the
disorder grew so great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as sometimes the Empire of the World was by the Soldiers
sold by Outcry to who would give most for it, and at low rates, as it fell out in the
time of <hi>Didius-Iulianus.</hi> Nor was the authority of the Senate able to correct this
so great inconvenience; as well for that being trodden under foot by force, it was
grown very weak, as also for that the antient Roman generosity was wanting in
them. So as the Senate having resolved, after the death of <hi>Caligula,</hi> to free the
City and Empire from the like Tyranny, and to restore her to her liberty, they
could not be constant iu their resolution; but being abased by fear, submitted soon
to the obedience of <hi>Claudius,</hi> of <hi>Caesars</hi> linage, and accepted of him for their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
as soon as he was cry'd up by the Pretorian Soldiers. The like to which
happened afterwards in many Emperors; those being confirmed by the Senate,
which were chosen by the Army.</p>
               <p>This licence was diversly used by the Soldiers themselves: For the Pretorian
Bands; and that Army wherein the Emperor was at the time of his death, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a particular priviledg in the choice of the new Emperor. Yet Emperors were so
often cry'd up by other Armies also, which were in several Provinces of the Empire,
as all of them desirous in <hi>Galienus</hi> his time to usurp this authority, there were thirty
two, who at one and the same time made use of the name and title of Roman
Emperor. So as it seems it may be truly said, that the Roman Empire was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
not in respect to unity, or to the same form of Government, but only in
respect of that Authority which Roman Armies held of making Emperors, whom
by reason of the said Armies all Provinces were to obey, there being no Militia
like to that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or which could resist them, or withdraw
themselves from their yoke. But great was the diversity in all things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in all Ages; for the height of Empire was arrived at by several ways: Some
got it by Inheritance, as <hi>Tiberius, Caligula, Nero;</hi> and in the following, <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,
Constantius,</hi> and many others; some, though very few, were c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>sen by the
Senate, many by the Emperors themselves, who in their life-time chose some one
for their Companions and Successor in the Empire, calling him <hi>Caesar,</hi> to whom
after the former Emperors death, the Title of Emperor, and of <hi>Augustus</hi> was
given: But their number were most, who got the Empire through favor of the
Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iery; wherein one and the same respect did not always prevail, but many much
different considerations; regard sometimes being had to the birth and affinity that
any one had to the former Emperors, sometimes to worth, and to some singular
action of War, sometimes to favor, which Commanders knew some way or other
how to come by from their Armies, and sometimes to some other such like things:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59987:46"/>
Whence it was that persons not onely of much differing condition, but even of
divers Nations, were made Emperors of <hi>Rome; Trajan</hi> and <hi>Theodotius</hi> were
Spainards; <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s; <hi>Dicclesian</hi> a Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian,
<hi>Cato</hi> a Slavonian; and some others. But that which made the difference
greater, was that this Empire as it was diversly gotten, so was it diversly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred:
By some so tyrannically, as there is no so infamous and wicked vice,
whereof you find not shameful examples in the lives of <hi>Tibe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us, Caligula,
Nero, Commodus, Caracalla, Heliogabolus,</hi> and other of those Emperors;
whereas the Empire was governed by some others with such Wisdom and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
as no more perfect Regal Government can almost be imagined. And what
excellent vertue (not to speak of <hi>Augustus</hi>) was there to be desired in
<hi>Vespatian, Titus, Trajan Adrian, Antoninus, Marcus Aurelius, Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi>
and such like? Whence it was, that there having been good and bad Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
in divers Ages, as much of Dignity, Authority and Power as this Empire
lost through the bad Government of those wicked Princes, it recovered as much
by the valor and good Government of these good and vertuous Princes.</p>
               <p>And this may be alledged for the first reason, why the Empire was able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it self for so long a space of years. For being for a while run into many disorders,
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch as were introduced by the baseness and negligence of other their Predecessors,
were by the worth of generous Princes amended, and returned to their first channel.
The Romans antient and confirmed use of good military orders, did likewise help
well towards this: Wherefore though the Empire were in the hands of unworthy
persons, yet finding the usual Armies already raised, and ready for any enterprise,
they were able by means of their Commanders, to wage war successfully, and to
quiet such rising, and rebellions, as continually arose in so great an Empire. Thus
<hi>Tiberius</hi> did not onely return <hi>France,</hi> which had rebelled to obedience, but
subjugated <hi>Comagena,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and driving out their Kings, reduced them
to Provinces. <hi>Nero</hi> drove the <hi>Parthians</hi> out of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and placed King
<hi>Tigranes</hi> there, making that Kingdom Tributory to the Empire. <hi>Claudius</hi> did
not onely reduce <hi>Mauritania,</hi> which by means of her Commanders made
insurrection against the Empire; but did himself in person pass with his Army into
<hi>England,</hi> to appease the Risings of that Island; and yet these Princes were not
thought to have of themselves any great worth in them. These and some other such
like causes may perhaps be alleadged why this Empire could maintain it self in that
greatness to which it was arrived.</p>
               <p>But to come to that which men are more curious in inquiring after, as a thing
very strange of it self, as also for many other notable consequences; to wit, to
the causes of its declining and ruine, Three may, in my opinion, be chiefly alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
The immeasurable greatness of the Empire, the simplicity and wickedness of
those who governed it, and the corruption of customs, which were far different
from those with which it was first founded, and wherein it grew great. Humane
imperfection is the cause why mans vertue, as it is not onely finite, and bounded,
but weak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d brittle; so hath it to do with things not onely finite and bounded,
but circumscribed within no very large limits; which were it otherwise, it would
loose it self in an Ocean from whence it would not know how to escape safe. And
of this, to omit the examples of many other of our actions, we will onely consider,
for as much as appertains to what we have now in hand, That his worth must be
exceeding great, who is to rule, and command over others. Phylosophers have
affirmed, That such a one ought to exceed others as far in Wit and Worth, as he
doth in Dignity and Power; nay that his worth and vertue ought to we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gh against
that of all those that he will rule over. But let us pass by these supreme Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which are rather to be desired, then ever hoped to be found. 'Tis very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59987:46"/>
that it is very hard to govern an Empire well, and the greater it is, the greater
is the difficulty of governing it. Wherefore <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> a very wise Legislator,
knowing that the quiet of a City, and the long preservation thereof in one and the
same condition, and with a certain Form of Government, ought to be the true
cause of ordaining good Laws, would of his own election so dispose of his <hi>Spartans,</hi>
and of the orders of that Commonwealth, as she should not be able much to enlarge
her Confines. But on the contrary, <hi>Rome,</hi> as all the constitutions of the City,
and the Cities Armies aimed chiefly at the enlarging the power of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
so did she never know what belonged to the enjoyment of Peace, not
onely by reason of foreign Forces, but not by occasion of discord between the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.
The bounds of her Empire grew to be almost immense, and she marcht
with her Forces to the utmost parts of the Earth, subjugating the farthest distant and
most barbarous Nations. But at last, not having almost any foreign Enemies to fight
with, her Citizens begun to make use of their Armies which had conquered other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in long and deadly contentions amongst themselves; till at last the worth and
fortune of <hi>Caesar</hi> prevailed, so as <hi>Augustus</hi> remained sole Lord of the World, and
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> who succeeded him, entered peaceably into so great an Empire, wherein
were an infinite number of <hi>Soldiers,</hi> train'd up in a perpetual Militia, and by reason of
Civil Wars, accustomed to live very licentiously. The greatest acquisitions of the
largest and farthest distant Provinces were very lately made, there having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
1700 Cities taken by two onely Commanders, <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
powerful Nations vanquished. So as it behoved to keep a great number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in those Garisons, to keep the people in obedience, which were in pares far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
distant from the Senate of the Empire. But the very same thing which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
to provide against those dangers, was cause of others, by reason of the
Authority which the Armies had already usurped, and out of hopes afforded to
the Commanders of attaining this supreme dignity, by being by the Soldiers cried
up Emperors. Wherefore one onely man, though of never so much worth, not
being able to supply all places, and provide for so many things as so great an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
stood in need of, and less able to correct the disorders, which in so many States,
as civil humors in members farthest distant from the heart, did daily more and more
encrease, the Empire must needs be continually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ext both by foreign Nations,
and by its own Soldiers; so as it was hardly ever free from such troubles; nor was
War sooner ended in one place, but it broke forth in another; nay for the most
part, divers Roman Armies fought in several places, at one and the same time,
each of them endeavoring to sustain him whom they had chosen to be their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
Therefore <hi>Adrian</hi> to remedy so many disorders in the Empire, which he
thought did onely arise by reason of the Emperors being so far off, and the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Confines, resolved not to keep his certain abode in <hi>Rome,</hi> but spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his whole time in travelling to visit all the parts of his Dominions, to keep his
Subjects in their duties; and knowing how hard a thing this would be to do, and
almost impossible in so large Confines, he resolved to shorten them in the Eastern
parts, making the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> the utmost boundeur of the Emire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

foot, another part rose up: And that so it befell many great Princes, who whilst
they seek to keep one part of their States low and quiet, the rest, which they keep

And it was the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then all other Empires, that in those very times wherein there was greatest
need of a continued succession of wise and generous Princes to confirm the State,
which by vertue of the great <hi>Augustus</hi> was reduced from War and past disorders
into Peace and good Government, should after him fall into the hands of three
very lewd and base Emperors, <hi>Tiberius, Caligula,</hi> and <hi>Nero;</hi> from whose enormous
vices those chief evils arose to the Provinces of that Empire, which we but now

of making Emperors, as they did in <hi>Galba</hi> after <hi>Nero's</hi> death, in <hi>Otho</hi> after
<hi>Galba,</hi> and so in many others. His worth who commanded in chief, and his good
fortune who was to succeed in the Empire, was sometimes able to make a Successor,
but not to take this authority totally from the Soldiery, through confidence of
whose favor many aspired, though by bad means, to usurp the Empire; and amidst
these contentions the Empire must needs be divided, shatter'd, and weakened.
From this root another disorder arose, which was cause of many heinous mischiefs,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59987:47"/>
to wit, the general corruption of Customs in all the Orders of the City of <hi>Rome:</hi>
For Subjects following, as usually they do, their Princes inclinations and exercises,
men began to give themselves over to an idle life; and Vertue being neither
nourished, nor at first maintained, still languished more and more; so as the Art of
Commanding failing, good Obedience was also wanting; every body made his will
his law; nor was there any sort of wickedness, how infamous soever, from which
the Commanders or Soldiers were restrained by any respect borne to the Majesty
of the Prince. All reason was reduced to the sword, and every one dared to attempt
as much as his power encouraged him to compass. Such and so great were the vices
which crept daily into men of all degrees and qualities, as it would be too laborious
a thing to number them up all. This one example may suffice to shew, to what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eness
and licent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ousness The affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> were reduced, when <hi>Galba</hi> having
chosen <hi>Piso Lasinianus,</hi> a man very famous for his civil behaviour and military
worth, his election was neither accepted of by the Army, nor by the Senate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was thought that if he should come to the Empire, he would correct the
many misdemeanors both of Citizens and Soldiers: But both of them being kill'd,
and in stead of him <hi>Otho</hi> was made Emperor in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> at the same time
cry'd up Emperor by the Army in <hi>Germany.</hi> the affairs of the Empire were then
governed with such confusion, and grew so much worse in the succeeding Age, the
disorders growing to be confirm'd by a bad habit, as when any Emperors should
go about to correct the immoderate licentiousness of the Soldiers, by reducing them
to their antient discipline, were they never so good and wise Princes, they were
slain by the Armies; as was <hi>Alexander Severus, Probus,</hi> and some others. So as
no certain Form could be given to such a Government, wherein the Soldier had so
great a stroke in Authority, making and unmaking Emperors at their pleasure; so as
it might seem to resemble a Popular State; and yet the Emperors commanding
with supreme authority in so ample a Dominion, Monarchy might appear to be there
formed.</p>
               <p>It is not much to be wondred at then, if this monstrous body of the Roman
Empire being composed of almost incompatible, ill-govern'd, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sproportioned
parts, should be sick of divers infirmities, and must at last suffer dissolution, sooner
then otherwise her greatness and power promised. The negligence and pusillanimity
of some Emperors were likewise cause why the City-Soldiers, who kept still about
the City, as it were the Life guard of the Princes person, and who were the flower
of all the rest both for valor and discipline, being long kept idle, grew so effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and so unaccustomed to labor and military exercise, as when some more valiant
Prince would make trial of them, they found themselves deceived in the hopes they
had of their prist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne worth. Wherefore the Empire having already received great
losses and damages in divers battels, things grew to that height, as (not to mention
many almost innumerable particulars which in this case might be produced) when the
States of the assaulted Empire would defe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d themselvs against the Northern nations
(as you shall shortly hear) they were forced to take others of the same Nations to
oppose their violence: To so great a want both of Power, Soldiers, and Military
discipline was the Empire reduced before it was so rent and so bereft of many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
as it was afterwards. Then, as the Roman Empire was got to that height of
power and greatness by the worth of those first antient Romans, and by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of their military discipline, so her good Orders being afterwards corrupted,
she took so clean contrary a way to her first beginning, as it behoved her soon to
fall to ruine; it being a certain and true rule, That States do increase and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the same means by which they had their first beginnings, and are corrupted
by the contrary.</p>
               <p>And he who shall consider the antient ways and works of those who laid the first
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59987:48"/>
foundations of this Empire, and shall compare them with those which insued in the
time of Emperors, will find such difference therein, as the necessity of coming to
such an end may soon be seen. The Roman Armies and their Leaders, were once
excellent examples of worth and discipline. Who does not praise and wonder at
what <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> did, who punisht his victorious Son with death, because he
fought the enemy before the sign of Battel was given? Very remarkable were the
severe punishments which were oft-times imposed upon the Soldiers disobedience,
even for slight causes, whose tumultuous proceedings were oft-time punished with
decimating the whole Army. But how different from these examples were those
which were afterwards in the following Age shewn by many of those, who waged
War, and commanded the Roman Armies? The Commanders indulgence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Armies, the Soldiers uncurb'd licentiousness, the authority and boldness
which they assumed unto themselves, both over the people, and over the very Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
whom they were to obey, are not they monstrous things in a well ordered
State?</p>
               <p>Those antient Romans did so study Military Affairs, and so frequent were the
exercises of the Militia with all Citizens, as when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ity of <hi>Rome</hi> had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
her bounds beyond <hi>Italy,</hi> she had so numerous Armies, as she was able
to maintain at one and the same time, but in several parts above One hundred
thousand men in Arms; and yet when so many calamities and ruines befel her by
the Barbarians, when she commanded over so many Provinces and Kingdoms, her
antient Discipline was so lost, as for want of Soldiers she was forc'd to make use
of mercinary Barbarians, who getting at last to be very powerful, did joyntly turn
their Arms against that Empire, for whose defence they were called in, and whose
pay they took. Nor is the vanquishing and beating of the Roman Armies, which
was for so many years unconquerable by other Nations, to be attributed to the
Goths, or those other Northern people; but rather to the corruption of their
Customs, to the loss of their good Discipline, and to the discord and baseness of
the Commanders, and Soldiers of those times. For were not the French a valiant
and stout Nation? to overcome whom, it behoved <hi>Caesar</hi> to fight so many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
and to make so often trial of the Romans worth and fortune, and that not
without much danger. Did not the Romans wage War in <hi>Spain</hi> for the space of
almost Two hundred years together, before they could well conquer that Nation,
and get quiet possession thereof? How often did the <hi>Saxons, Bavarians</hi> and other
people of <hi>Germany</hi> take up Arms to molest the States of the Empire? Yet all
their commotions were still supprest. And had not the Roman Empire almost
continual War by reason of their so many Insurrections, with many other Eastern
Nations, and chiefly with the Persians? And though sometimes they tasted of
adverse fortune, yet their loss was always recovered, as also the prejudice of the
reputation of the Romans Forces by their own Commanders and Soldiers, so as
they were always forc'd to keep within their own Confines, and under the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Empire. But when they stood in greatest need, when the Empire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved
so sore and so irreparable blows from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> it was brought to
such weakness in the Eastern parts by reason of the many great disorders which
were in the Head, and in all the Members, which were now become incureable, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
it was not able to sustain the force of the fierce and warlike Northern Nations.
And beginning once to fall, when its worth was but little, it could not get up again,
as it had done at other times.</p>
               <p>Now if we will apply these more general considerations, to some particular chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this Empire, the true cause of its declination will the more easily be known.
The Affairs of the Empire were almost at all times greatly molested by divers of
the Northern People, many of which were never reduced to the obedience of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59987:48"/>
Empire, some of which had not been known till they took up Arms, but of all
the rest the <hi>Goths</hi> proved the most famous for the ruine of the Empire, and for the
so many calamities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of many other Nations; and he who shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

confusion lose the discourse of humane wisdom; To think how this barbarous
people, and so far remote from our Regions, and unknown by them, insomuch,
as at this day their original is not by Authors agreed upon, without or Kingdom,
or Military Discipline, falling down tumultuously at first, to possess themselves of
other mens Countries, should soon become so powerful, and formidable, as that
they should overcome the Romans, who had overcome the world. Who could
have imagined that a new, and unknown people, were to come from forth the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Northern parts, to destroy so vast an Empire, by which so many powerful
Kings, and famous warlike Nations were subjected? The most general opinion
is, That these men who destroyed the Empire, came from <hi>Scythia</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi>
where they were possest of many large Regions, differing amongst themselves in
name and habitation; those who lived more towards the East being called <hi>Estern-Goths,</hi>
and others, more <hi>Western-Goths.</hi> But they were thought to be but new
Inhabitants of that Country, into which they were first come from certain Islands
in the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> Ocean; and that being worsted by some of their neighboring
people, after many contestations had with them, their Country being moreover
of two smal a circuit for their abounding numbers, they betook themselves to seek
out new seats, and other habitations. And thus they passed over very many times
in very great numbers into the Provinces belonging to the Empire, possessing
and indamaging many Countries: The things a little before mentioned, being the
cause why these evils, and the greater ruines which ensued were not remedied.
For the Empire being of a very vast extent, was continually troubled with sundry
commotions in sundry parts. The Princes who commanded were of little worth,
and the former antient valor and discipline was no longer found in their Armies,
which were given over to licentiousness.</p>
               <p>Hence it was that whenin the time of <hi>Philip,</hi> the first of that name, but in order
the Nine and twentieth Roman Emperor, the <hi>Goths</hi> fixt themselves in <hi>Mysia</hi>
and <hi>Thrace,</hi> such forces were not sent against these novelties, as might appease
them, and quell the then but small strength of these tumultuous people. For there
being no loyalty in the Commanders, nor valor in the Soldiers, those who were
sent by the Empeor against such enemies, intended their own particular interest
more then the service of the Empire. Insomuch as <hi>Macrinus</hi> and <hi>Decius</hi> being
sent the one after the other to be chief of the enterprise, made themselves be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up Emperors by the Army, having first permitted much licentiousness in the
Soldiers, that they might win their good will. And when the same <hi>Decius</hi> was
truly possest of the Empire, after the death of <hi>Macrinus,</hi> and of <hi>Philip</hi> also, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
battel with the <hi>Goths,</hi> he found the effects of nourishing sedition in Armies, and
in winking at their disobedience, and at the non-performance of their military du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uties;
for his Army was routed and put to flight by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and he seeking to save
himself by running away, was drowned in a marrish ground. And when after these
losses, the Empire ought to have been restored, and the honor thereof vindicated by
the Successor with new Forces; <hi>Gallus</hi> who had obtained this supream dignity by
the Souldiers rashness, and who was a poorly spirited man, and had come by the
Empire by indirect means; That he might enjoy his leasure time in <hi>Rome,</hi>
which he leudly spent, he was easily perswaded to make a shameful peace with
the <hi>Goths,</hi> not onely permitting them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were possessed of, but obliging himself to pay them a certain sum of money
yearly.</p>

Thus the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was Mistress of the whole World, became tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to a Barbarous people, who knew not till then what belong'd to Imperial
dignity, to Wealth, nor to Military glory: This base Agreement gave a great
blow to the reputation of the Roman Empire; so as in <hi>Galienus</hi> his time, who
soon after succeeded in the Empire, so many mutinies and insurrections arose, as
<hi>Italy</hi> it self was hardly kept in obedience; and the <hi>Goths</hi> grew so insolent, as break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Peace which they had made with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> they took many Cities in
<hi>Bythinia,</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and in <hi>Macedonia:</hi> By which prosperous successes others of
the <hi>Goths</hi> being encouraged, who had tarried all this while at home, where they
lived in narrow precincts, they sent to the Emperor <hi>Valens</hi> to demand abode in the
Provinces of the Empire; with whom fear prevailing more then the antient honor
of the Empire; and the Roman generosity, gave way to their request, allotting
<hi>Bulgaria</hi> and <hi>Servia</hi> for these new Inhabitants to live in; suffering the Northern
Nations thus to get footing, and to increase in strength, which had always been the
greatest Enemies to the Empire, and from whom the Emperors had received such
injuries and shame. These easie acquisitions, and the hopes of greater matters, made
<hi>Alaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> march not long after with a numerous Army from his
own Kingdom towards <hi>Italy,</hi> demanding that a place of residence might be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him by the Emperor <hi>Honorius</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and receiving a denial, did in his fury
do greater mischief.</p>
               <p>But the same Emperor <hi>Valens</hi> soon felt the harm of this his ill-taken advice: For
the same <hi>Goths</hi> increasing through the baseness and negligence of others, and the
<hi>Huns, Alani,</hi> and other Northern people conspiring together with them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and other noble Cities were endangered: which
made <hi>Gratianus</hi> choose <hi>Theodosius</hi> for his Companion in the Empire, for the great
repute which was had of his valor, though he were a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by Nation. But
though he behaved himself gallantly against these Enemies, and wan some brave
victories; yet since they had already got great strength, and were governed in
obedience under their valiant Masters and Commanders, and for that the Empire
was still busied in other Wars, it was thought expedient to come to peace with
<hi>Alaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> leading him and a great number of his men under the
Empires pay, to make use of them in other undertakings. For the <hi>Goths</hi> being
kept in continual pay by some former Emperors, amongst other Soldiers which
served the Empire, and being of themselves conversant in many Wars, they were
become a valiant People, and had learn'd the Roman discipline, though not the
corruption which overthrew it, in the Roman Camp. Which, though it might be
good for the present occasions, it did certainly prove very pernicious afterwards.
For though by this Peace <hi>Theodosius</hi> was safe from any fear of this Nation, whilst
he governed together with <hi>Gratianus,</hi> and also afterwards when he held the Empire
alone by himself, he being a person of singular worth, and one who by his industry
had somewhat renewed the antient discipline amongst the Soldiers, yet after his
death the Forces of the Empire beginning again to flag, and the Empire falling
into the hands of his two sons, <hi>Arc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Father whilst they were but young, and proved not to be of such gallant parts as
the condition of those times required, many of those who commanded under <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
in several parts rebelled, who were all of them cryed up Emperors by those
Armies wherein they commanded; by which occasions being invited, the <hi>Goths</hi>
did not only return to rise up in Arms against the Empire, but also other Northern
Nations who did then inhabit <hi>Germany,</hi> as the <hi>Alani, Franks</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> took up
Arms, and did at one and the same time assault the States of the Empire in several
parts; many of them marching more particularly towards <hi>Italy,</hi> and against the
very City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which after divers passages remained in prey to these Barbarians,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59987:50"/>
the antient Roman worth being so decayed, as there was not any one who did so
much as provide for the welfare of so stately a City, which was the Queen of the
World. And the Emperor <hi>Honorius</hi> (a thing which is not to be mentioned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much marvel) whilst <hi>Italy</hi> and other Countries were wasted with War, and the
very City of <hi>Rome</hi> was reduced to the utmost extremity, remained in <hi>Ravenna</hi> an
idle Spectator of his Subjects so great calamity, and of the ruine of his State, in so
base and stupid a manner, as being told he might do well to provide for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and safety of so many of the Empires Provinces, which being miserably
torn in pieces, were falling into the power of the Barbarians, answered, That he could
live without them.</p>
               <p>After the ruine of <hi>Rome,</hi> these victorious Barbarians past into <hi>France,</hi> and into
<hi>Spain,</hi> where being recruited with other people of their own Nations, and the
Roman Armies being busied in Civil seditions, and in maintaining those Emperors
which each of them had chosen, they had leisure to fix themselves there, and to
take possession of those noble Provinces, the greatest part of whose antient Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
being extinguished, they setled themselves there, and did long govern those
Dominions; and others of them passing into <hi>Africa,</hi> and having won large Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
did with the same Fortune and same thoughts institute their proper King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
But on the other part, other People called the <hi>Huns</hi> fell into <hi>Pannonia,</hi>
called now by their names, <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and possessing themselves likewise thereof,
fixt their abode and dominion there. So as there was hardly any Western Province
of the Empire which was not at this time troubled by this fury of War, the Roman
Princes and Soldiers not having sufficient worth to withstand them: Insomuch
that when <hi>Attila</hi> marched with a furious Army to destroy <hi>Italy,</hi> the Empire not
having any Soldiers that they durst confide in to impede his passage, the Romans
were forced to take King <hi>Theodoricus</hi> with a good number of his <hi>Goths</hi> into their
pay; by whose assistance that cruel Enemy was at that time kept off. But the
Empires weak Forces being at last tyred, and some Commanders being lost in
whom there remained yet some worth and discipline, the greater, and almost fatal
ruines of <hi>Italy</hi> began; whereinto when these cruel Barbarians entred, they put all
to fire and sword, bringing total destruction to many noble and populous Cities.
Which (according to the natural order of all things mortal, wherein <hi>Corruptio unius
est generatio alterius</hi>) gave occasion to the birth of the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> whereunto
the remainder of the Italian Nobility had recourse, and saved themselves.</p>

                  </gap> Commonwealth of Rome, though she suffered many
Defeats in divers Battels, yet did still prove Victorious
at last.</head>
               <p>HE who shall narrowly consider the great actions of the Romans, will
still discover new things therein not onely worthy of praise but of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.
Their prosperity was certainly very great, but proceeding,
as it is to be beleeved, from their worth, and from certain and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
causes. The People of <hi>Rome</hi> made more Wars, then ever any
Potentate hath been known to do, but that which occasioneth the greatest wonder
is, that their success in all of them was prosperous. And that though the Roman
Armies were in many Battels overcome, yet still in the conclusion of every War
the Victories sided with them:</p>
               <p>It will then be worth the while to seek out the truest, or at least, the most truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
causes thereof, by reasoning thereupon. The City of <hi>Rome</hi> waged continual
Wars from the first foundation thereof till <hi>Augustus</hi> his time, which was for above
Seven hundred years. The gates of that famous Temple of <hi>Ianus,</hi> which were
never to be shut but in time of Peace, stood always open, unless it were once in
the Consulship of <hi>Titus Manlius;</hi> nor was there almost any Nation known in those
daies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom the City of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not at some time made trial of her forces
and worth. That Commonwealth in so many, and so long contentions of War,
was likewise sometimes favored, sometimes frowned upon by fortune; so as
sometimes she was brought into very great danger; yet still she prevailed at last,
and triumphed over her formerly victorious enemies. Long and heavy was the
dispute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in her very beginning she had with so many people of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
chiefly with those that were nearest, who singly by themselves, and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with others, did conspire against the Romans, and did by all their best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
seek how to keep the powea of the Empire low, which was ordained, as was
afterwards seen, to the height of all greatness. Nor was the Commonwealth of
<hi>Rome</hi> secure from the efforts of foreign Nations; nay many times she was to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the fury of the French, who assailed her with great Forces, that they might
totally subdue her, and possess themselves of her Territories, as they had done of
so many other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Commonwealth made trial of her Forces, even in
the beginning of her greatness with other Kings; till beginning with the first Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian
Wars, to wage War further from her Confines, she proved at last a
terror even to the most remote foreign Countries, which she at last subjugated
assuming always greater and better courage, as her Empire did encrease, and her
Military Discipline bettering by exercise, as did also her worth by prosperous
success.</p>
               <p>Who will not then admire these so great and unparellel'd things? Who can
consider them without endeavoring to know the reasons thereof? <hi>Polybius,</hi> whilst
he recounts some of these wonderful things, terming the people of <hi>Rome</hi> invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
adds (that he may in a manner give the reason thereof) that these people
brought whatsoever enterprise, how hard and difficult soever, after many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
successes, to a good and desired end, because they were modest in prosperous,
and constant in adverse fortune. These two excellent vertues are certainly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to whosoever propounds true and perpetual Glory for his end, and does aspire
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59987:51"/>
thereunto: for the variety of humane affairs does not tolerate that man should ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at the height of power, and at supreme honors by a streight and short path of
continued prosperity; therefore constancy, or let us rather term it Magnanimity
or Fortitude is requisite for him, to the end that he may persevere in the same gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
and grandeur of spirit, wherewith he did propound any great action to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
without being weary or quiet till he hath effected it. And modesty is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
necessary for him, that is to say a temperate affection, so as he may not lose
himself in prosperous successes, and being puft up with pride and vain glory, may
not think he is come to his journeys end, when he is not gotten half way thither;
which is the cause why many have lost their good fortune, and not reaped the true
fruits of many worthy and well begun labors. So as it may be numbred amongst
those things which made great Kings amongst them, and which brought them to
so great an Eminency of power, and command, that they were endowed with these
two excellent Vertues, whereby they knew how to make use of both
fortunes.</p>
               <p>But these may peradventure be but general rules, and not such as may give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
for if we will look into the Commonwealth of <hi>Greece,</hi> we shall find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
eminent examples of both these vertues, yet were they not able to carry them
half the way so far towards the Goal, whereat the Romans arrived; therefore are
not their actions worthy that high esteem which is deservedly put upon the Roman
Affairs. There have likewise been many famous Princes in several ages, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wanted generosity of mind, constantly to prosecute noble actions by them
begun; nor modesty and temperance in all other affections, meerly out of a desire
of glory; and yet their enterprises have not alwaies succeeded well, nor have
they inlarged their Power and Dominions, as did the Romans. Let us pass on then
to other considerations wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch shall hereafter be looked upon, how the Romans
governed themselves and their counsels in their Militia, what their military orders
and institutions were, what state they were at first possest of, which served as it
were for a ladder for them whereby to climb up to the height of such greatness
and command, and we shall find that these were such amongst the Romans as were
not all of them together, or in such excellency in other Principalities and Nations,
so as they were with reason to produce such effects as they did. All the Offices of
War were admin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stred amongst the Romans by their Citizens; varying some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the condition of the persons, together with the names and authority of those
who commanded the Armies; for they made sometimes use of Noblemen, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of Plebeians. But they still kept amongst their own Romans, all the degrees
of the Militia, and afforded occasion to many to exercise themselves therein, so as
there was not any witty Citizen, or hopefull Young-man of noble extract, who
was far from them. Nay, it is seen, that those who were more given to
the study of speculative Learning, when the places, and Governments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge, did so require, betook themselves, as others did,
to the managing of Arms, and to warlike Affairs; in such sort as even <hi>Cicero,</hi>
wholly given to Philosophie, and the study of Eloquence, when he went Pro-consul
into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> waged War with the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Hence it was that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wanted Commanders, and if at any time the Roman Armies suffered any
thing by the imprudency or infelicity of one Commander, they knew quickly how
to make amends by the worth and fortune of another, as it fell out at all times;
For in that Commonwealth, by reason of her orders, and by her being still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in War, the way was alwaies open to many Citizens to imploy themselves
in Arms, and in commands of the Armies. Nor was the obedience which is
due by Soldiers to their Commanders the less for this. For a Consul, or Dictator
had the like authority in the Camp, as the person of an absolute Prince could have
had, who commanded his Army personally.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59987:52"/>
Therefore by descending to more particulars, the benefit may be the more easily
discerned which redounded to that Commonwealth, by means of these her good
orders: For if any disorder did at any time happen (as usually there doth in any,
how well soever ordered Government) through the fault of any particular Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
whereby the Commonwealth suffered prejudice in the administration of War,
this might soon be amended, and the prejudice received from the enemy, might
quickly be restored by the presence and worth of some other Citizen. Thus it
fell out, that when the Roman Armies, whilst the bounds of the Commonwealth
were but smal, were overcome by the <hi>Sabins,</hi> by the <hi>Equi,</hi> by the <hi>Capen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi>
by the <hi>Falisci,</hi> and by others of their neighbors, with whom they waged
War, they could easily stop the course of that their bad fortune, and shun run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into greater dangers. The rout which was given by the <hi>Equi,</hi> and <hi>Sabins,</hi> and
which was the greatest given in those times, was known to be occasioned through
the distaste which the Army took at <hi>Appius</hi> the <hi>Decemviri</hi> and at the injustice, and
cruelty which he used towards the Soldiery. Wherefore returning to the former
Government of Consuls, <hi>Quintius</hi> the new Consul had the means given him of
recovering the Militia's formerly lost honor and credit; by giving a great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
to those very enemies, who were grown so proud and insolent for their
victories had over the Roman Army.</p>
               <p>Thus likewise, when the Roman Armies were shamefully put to slight another
time by the <hi>

and then by the like of <hi>Genutius,</hi> and <hi>Titinius</hi> the military Tribunes, who
were mean and unexpert <hi>Plebeians,</hi> and who without much authority had the care
of the Army; When <hi>Quintus Servilius</hi> was created Consul, and after him <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Camillus,</hi> they won the most famous victories that the Romans had ever got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
till that time (which was Three hundred and fifty years after the building of
the City) against the <hi>Aequi,</hi> and other of their Enemies. But this may be better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in greater affairs, when the Commonwealth was much increased. The Roman
Armies rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ived so notable defeats in the War which <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> made against them,
as the whole affairs of the Commonwealth seemed to be in no little danger, having
so potent and victorious an Enemy within their bosoms: yet at last not being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
for any adverse fortune, but treating freely with their Enemy, rather as van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishers
then vanquished, they reduced their affairs to such a condition, as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
thought it his best course to quit <hi>Italy,</hi> and leave the Romans quiet. It is herein to
be considered, that the Romans being so long accustomed to continual Wars
with their neighbors the Italians, and particularly with the <hi>Samnites</hi> a little before
this time, against whom the Romans marched with numerous Armies, and had
good success winning many famous victories; insomuch as <hi>Val. Corvinus</hi> kill'd
above thirty thousand <hi>Samnites</hi> in one day, made much for their withstanding so
great an Enemy as <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and for their maintaining themselves against Forein
Forces, against the use of Elephants, and other new ways of warfaring, which <hi>Italy</hi>
had not known before; whence it was that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> did at this time abound
in valiant men, and who were expert in the Militia. So as <hi>Cynneas</hi> who was sent
by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> told him, that he had seen a City so very full of Inhabitants,
as he feared if his Highness should continue his war with the Romans, he should go
about to overcome an <hi>Hydra:</hi> And <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> himself hath more then once admired
the worth of the Roman Commanders.</p>
               <p>Who doth not even with wonder consider, how many Commanders, and how
many Armies the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> could set out in the War with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,
and especially in that with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> which did more endanger the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>Rome</hi> then all the rest? since it main<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ained War in so many several parts
at one and the same time, in <hi>Italy, Spain, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> Which they were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59987:52"/>
able to do by reason of the infinite number of men wherewith <hi>Italy</hi> was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited,
who were all well disciplined, by reason of their long exercise in War.
We read, that when the Romans made War with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they had sometimes,
what of their own proper Soldiers, and what of their Associates, who did all
neighbor neer upon them, twenty three Legions, which made about an hundred
thousand Soldiers, for defence of their Empire. Moreover, whilst the Common-wealth
kept her Forces divided in several parts, as she did with wonderful judgment
in the Carthaginian war, which was the sorest of all the rest, though she tasted of
adverse fortune sometimes in some parts, yet were not all her Forces utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed;
for that part of their Forces which was yet safe and entire, was able to
make good the fortune of the whole Commonwealth. Thus after those notable
Routs which the Roman Armies had, the one by the <hi>Tygurian Gauls,</hi> when the
Forces were commanded by <hi>Lucius Cassius;</hi> the other by the <hi>Cymbrians,</hi> when
they were led on by <hi>Caius Servilius Cepio,</hi> in which two Battels the Romans lost
above Eighty thousand Soldiers, they were able notwithstanding to recruit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and defend their affairs; because they had another victorious Army at the
same time, commanded by <hi>Marius,</hi> who had just at that time gloriously ended
the War against <hi>Iugurth.</hi> Thus when the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> seemed to be
utterly ruined by reason of the two discomfitures given them, the one at <hi>Thra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ia, Sicily, France,</hi>
and <hi>Spain.</hi> And though by reason of so many Wars which begot one another, the
Commonwealth must needs oftentimes run great hazards, especially since she oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
exposed her Armies to the doubtful event of Battel; yet did they thereby
receive this of good and safety, that by reason of their continual exercise of Arms,
they were the more easily provided of valiant and experienced men, and were the
better able to govern themselves in adverse fortune. The Carthaginians, on the
contrary, not being able to make use of many good Commanders or Soldiers, (for
they did not make use of their own peculiar Militia, as did the Romans, but did
imploy some few of the chief of their City-Factions in commanding their Armies)
could not so easily recruit and reinforce their Armies, when they were weakened
by any adverse fortune; nor had they whereout to pick better or more fortunate
Commanders, when any of theirs were faulty. Insomuch as when the Carthaginians
were overcome by <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> they were forc'd to recal <hi>Hannibal</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi>
suffering the Romans to take breath in those parts where they were most molested;
and <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself not having means to recruit his Army, which he had brought
with him from <hi>Africa,</hi> and which was wasted and weakened by long march, and
adverse fortune, was necessitated to give way to the valor and fortune of the
Romans.</p>
               <p>It made not a little likewise for the Government of the Roman Commonwealth,
and for the maintaining of her in her weak beginnings, that the Militia was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
for many years without any pay to the Soldiers. So as wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lst their means was
yet but small, and yet they must still be in Arms, by reason of their being still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
by many of the neighboring Nations, the want of monies was no cause of
not maintaining their Armies, as it hath been the ruine of many Stat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s; but if they
happened to receive a Rout, the Army might be recruited by other chosen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
men. But afterwards when the City was much better peopled, and much
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59987:53"/>
stronger, so as she was able to make greater undertakings, the publick Exchequer
was so enriched, answerable to what became a well-ordered Government, and
which aspired to the heighth of Empire, as she was not for this cause so incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,
as that she must yield under the weight of War, nor yet for any her greatest
mifortune. Whereas in some other Commonwealths, as in that of <hi>Sparta,</hi> the
poorness of the Exchequer introduced by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his Laws, hindred her from
enlarging her Empire; and when she aspired thereunto, she was forc'd for want of
things requisite to flie for help to the Kings of <hi>Persia;</hi> so as in lieu of domineering
over the rest of the Grecians, she became a servant to Barbarians, because she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
those Terms and Rules wherewith her Government was founded and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>
               <p>After these considerations, some things may be added which proved likewise
very advantagious for the securing of the Romans greatness: As the continuation of
the Militia, out of a duty imposed upon every Citizen, of spending almost all the
best years of his life in the Camp, every one being bound to militate till he had
advanced fifteen Pays at least: So he who had fought in one or two Battels, was
not permitted to sit down and rest, but continuing in the Militia, by reason of the
experience he had gotten, became more useful and advantagious in the Wars.
Amongst others, we have a notable example of one <hi>L. E. Siccius,</hi> who was slain
in the Camp in the time of <hi>Appius</hi> his Decemvirate, after he had followed the
Wars for Forty years together: and after having been in above a hundred Battels.
It is also a thing of great consideration, that the nerve of the Roman Armies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in their Infantry, though they had some Horse to strengthen them; whence it
was, that they were sooner recruited, and reinforced after a rout, for that men are
sooner recruited then horses: there being greater store of them: And which the
Romans could the better do, because they made use of men of one onely Country
for their Soldiers, that is to say, of their own men, and those of their Associates
who were at hand and ready to be joyned together, and be imployed in any action;
which doth not fall out so when Armies are to be raised and recruited out of many
Nations, and from Far distant places. But it was a great help to the Romans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other things, for the maintaining of themselves in all events of so many
Wars, which they made with so many powerful Kings and Nations, that they
were possest of <hi>Italy;</hi> a Province, which in those times did more abound in men
and arms, then any other Country; as may be known by many things, but chiefly
by this, That the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> had labored very long ere she could
subjugate <hi>Italy,</hi> which was not wholly subdued, in all the parts thereof, till after
the Commonwealth had extended her Precincts very far: when afterwards by
the Forces of the same <hi>Italy,</hi> she in a few years overcame all other Provinces, and
Nations. Therefore the War which was made against the Romans by the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
People, the <hi>Piceni, Pel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>companions to
the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> though there were but a smal part of the Italian Forces in it;
yet that Country being excellently well inhabited with warlike men, it was thought
to be one of the hardest, and most dangerous Wars, that ever the Common-wealth
of <hi>Rome</hi> made; nor could it be ended out by allowing those People, the
Franchise and Liberty of Roman Citizens, which was as much as to grant them
the thing they fought for; for the obtaining of that, was that for which they fought.
And we read, that a muster being made throughout all <hi>Italy</hi> of all the Soldiers
which might be assembled to withstand the danger which was threatned by the
Barbarians, when the <hi>

                  </gap>mmoned by the other <hi>Gauls,</hi> who were already possest of some parts of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi>
that they might prepare to assault <hi>Italy;</hi> the Muster role of such as were
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59987:53"/>
able to bear Arms, amounted to Seven hundred thousand Foot, and Threescore
thousand Horse, who were fit to serve upon such an occasion. And yet the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which was possest by the said <hi>Gauls,</hi> nor some other of those
Provinces which are now comprehended within the Confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> were not
numbered in this Muster-roll. Which is so much the more to be wondred at
for that this happened after the Carthaginian War; to wit, when the Common-wealth
of <hi>Rome</hi> was not yet gotten to that height of Power whereunto she
arrived afterwards; people multiplying through the greatness and felicity of
the Empire, and many men having been consumed in that long and sore
War.</p>
               <p>To these things may be added the excellency of Military Discipline, which as
it was in great perfection with the Romans, so was it of great advantage to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of so many Victories, and to the compleating of so many enterprises. For
though the <hi>Grecian, Macedonian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Militia were of great esteem at one
and the same time, yet that of the <hi>Romans</hi> did so far exceed the others, as that it
was not onely stronger, and more secure, but better fitted then the rest for all places;
and times. Amongst other Orders of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Militia,
wherewith the Armies of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did in particular so miraculous things,
the <hi>Phalanx</hi> was much celebrated; but this, though it were in it self of very great
strength, it oft-times proved not so serviceable, if upon any occasion it became to
be divided, or disordered: But the Roman Orders were not onely firm and
stable, as was the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> but were more adapted to every place, and every season,
and proved very congruous for all warlike actions; so as to their own great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and to the prejudice of their enemies, making use of their own Soldiers, the
Romans performed the Office of whatsoever military Discipline by their own men,
fighting in all postures, either in whole bodies altogether, or Squadron to Squadron,
or man to man, so as not any man was idle or useless in their Camps, or Battels. For
whilst they minded fighting, and not flying, or free-booting, the routs which their
Armies did oft-times receive, were not such, but that they did in some places
make their party good against their enemy, and keep some part of their Army
safe; which proceeded principally from the exquisite orders of that Militia. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as <hi>Hannibal</hi> when he came first into <hi>Italy,</hi> having after his first conflicts
learn'd the excellency of this Militia, made his Soldiers use the Romans Arms;
and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> did not onely betake himself to use these Arms, but did mingle many
<hi>Italian</hi> Soldiers, the better to accommodate his Militia to the Roman Ordinances;
saying, that that Discipline of the Barbarians (a name given by the Grecians to all
other Nations) was not at all barbarous. So when it happened that the Romans
receive any rout, as they did in the Battels made against the two aforesaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
<hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> very experience in other successes made them know
that it was not the goodness of any forein military Discipline which bereft the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
of the Victories which they were wont to bear away, but for that the Romans
wanted such excellent Commanders as those two were. Therefore when the worth
of the Commanders came to be equal, the goodness and excellencie of the Roman
Military Ordinances prevailed before those of those very Armies, which for some
other respects had the better of the Romans.</p>
               <p>But to proceed upon our late consideration, we must say that the Arms used by
the Romans were thought very convenient, and better then those of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as Launces which were usually given to Soldiers of the first Files; whereby
they received much benefit, as well to withstand the first fiercest efforts of the
Enemy, as to weary them in cutting those arms in peeces, being to come to closer
fight; and then whole bodies of fresh and well armed Soldiers succeeded in the
Roman Armies. For their bodies were covered with their Bucklers, which were
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59987:54"/>
very large ones, and the short, but very sharp swords and finely tempered, used
by the Romans, were of great advantage to the Soldiers, who might wield them
in a long fight, as well to defend themselves from their Enemies blows, as to let
flie upon them; which was not practised in other Militia's of those times; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
not amongst the French, with whom the Romans had often and dangerous
fights, for they used very little Bucklers, and long heavy swords, very sharp at
the point, so as they were easily wrested, and made unuseful. Therefore the
routs which the Roman Armies received, were very few in comparison of those
they gave their Enemies; and being but seldom worsted, and often victorious,
the state, strength, and reputation of the Empire did still increase; so as when
some adverse fortune happened, it was not sufficient to extinguish, no nor so much
as long to weaken the greatness of that Commonwealth. Divers particular good
rules observed in the administration of War, were likewise of great moment for
the carrying on of the Roman affairs. Amongst which the diligence which was
used by publick constitutions in dividing of the prey, may be numbred for one;
for they used to place the prey or booty first in publick, and did then so divide it
amongst the Soldiers, as those who were upon the guard shared as well thereof,
as those that were forwardest in the action, and who had sackt the Enemy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
occasion was not given for those notable disorders which have been observed
to happen in these latter times, wherein upon such an occasion the loss of the
whole Army hath ensued.</p>
               <p>The faith also which was so exactly observed, and the fair proceedings with such
Cities as were subject to that Dominion, won the Romans the good affection of
the people; by whose favor Empires are usually more upheld upon any adverse
accident, then by any other thing. Of these we read of many notable examples;
it being as far from that good Military Discipline, to bear with the insolency of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
as it is introduced in these our last Ages to the great prejudice of people,
though friends and subjects. For such faults as these were severely punish'd; the
which is observable amongst so many other actions, for what the Romans did to
those people, to whom they did not only restore the goods and liberty which had
been by the Soldiers wickedly taken away, and so their grievances were redrest,
but those were severely punish'd who had committed such things. To this may be
added, that the Romans, to the end that the power of the Commonwealth might
still prevail, and might upon any occasion be made use of, endeavored as soon as
they bent their minds to greater matters, to accompany their Land-forces with
Maritime-aids, so as the one might help the other, and the one not only be made
more powerful by the other, but more secure, as it fell out, and as it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in many of their actions; but chiefly when seeing their affairs succeeded but
ill with the Carthaginians, who prevailed by reason of their antient Maritime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and had likewise great advantage in their Land-Militia by their use of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,
which the Romans had not as yet well learned how to resist; they bent
themselves wholly to Naval preparations, wherein they did afterwards behave
themselves with such valor and prosperity, as they overcame these their so fierce
and cruel Enemies in a Naval fight, and raised their fortune.</p>
               <p>Let us in the next place observe, that the greatness and generosity of the Romans
was such, as not content to secure their neer neighboring dangers, and out of a desire
of quiet to leave the sparkles of those Wars unquench'd, from whence another fire
might soon be kindled, they always endeavored to see the last sparkle quite put out.
The Roman Army was overcome, and much endamaged by the <hi>Galli Gessati</hi> after
the death of Consul <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ilius,</hi> where their liberty being exposed to much danger upon
this so sad accident, the Romans would once more try the fortune of battel,
wherein they had good success, and cutting in pieces above Forty thousand of that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59987:54"/>
Nation, they did vindicate their former injuries. Nor yet did they then lay down
their Arms, though they were freed from that their greatest danger; but knowing
that there remained yet other powerful Armies of the same <hi>Gauls</hi> is other parts of
<hi>Italy,</hi> they would continue war against them, and of assailed become assailors; which
afforded them occasion of those <hi>Marcellus</hi> his notable victories, and of making
themselves masters of the chiefest Cities of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which were possest by the
<hi>Gauls.</hi> The Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was never in greater danger, then when <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>
passing over the Alps with a numerous Army, entred <hi>Italy,</hi> whilst his brother
<hi>Hannibal</hi> was there likewise with another powerful Army. They fought <hi>Asdrubal,</hi>
and to their great joy their Consuls were victorious: which notwithstanding, they
forbare not to continue war in <hi>Spain,</hi> though they were free from their greater and
neerer dangers; but with the Forces they had there, went to find out, and to fight
other Enemy-Armies of the Carthaginians which were in that Province; for they
knew if those Armies should remain entire, the War might easily be renewed, and
other impediments being removed, <hi>Hannibal</hi> would be the more easily succored
with necessaries which he wanted, and so might still molest the Romans in <hi>Italy.</hi>
Thus not allowing of any Peace, then what might be purchased by either having
totally quell'd, or at least very much weakened the Enemy, the Romans never laid
down Arms but when they were entire Victors: which other Princes not being
able to do, have deferred their ruine for a short time, but have not totally kept
it off.</p>
               <p>Many other things might likewise be thought of, by which it might be evidently
proved, that the Romans did always prove victorious at last, and did perpetually
increase their State and strength. But what we have already said, may suffice to teach
such Princes and Nations as shall aspire to the highest degree of glory, whither it is
that they ought to bend their thoughts, and which are the best means to arrive
thereat: And when all other necessary accidents shall correspond, those who shall
imitate the excellent worth and discipline of the Romans, will not find themselves
any whit deceived.</p>

years, till the time of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> wherein <hi>Italy</hi> underwent many
miserable ruines, as did also the very City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the Metropolis of
the Empire; so as she could not resume her antient greatness, as formerly she had
done after some adverse events.</p>
               <p>It appears to be, and truly is a thing worthy of deep discourse and consideration,
how this so great and well-founded Empire, after it began to totter, did so soon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59987:55"/>
into final ruine. If the time of this its duration be measured in respect to the
ordinary mutation of humane things, and more particularly of State-Governments,
the time of its continuance may appear to have been long enough: but if the
greatness and power of the Empire be taken into consideration, which was such as
that there was no other Potentate that could weigh against it, or rather no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which was not in some sort subject thereunto, it may very well invite us, so
far as may be probably conjectur'd by so great success, and where so many various
accidents concur, and have a share, to conjecture whether the Roman Empire
would have been longer or shorter lived, if it had been still governed in the form
of a Commonwealth, then it did when it fell into the power of one onely man,
under the government of Emperors. Many things may perswade us to beleeve
that in whatsoever condition or form of Government, this Empire must have run
the same fortune, and walked on with some little variation of time to the same end it
did. First the vicissitude of humane affairs, which by reason of their natural imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
will not suffer sublunary things to be still in the same state of being, but
will have it so, as being carried about in continual motion, they must sometimes
be raised higher, fall sometimes lower. Other People, and other Nations, besides
the Romans, have flourish'd in other times, though not so much, nor so highly
cried up. Other Ages have seen other great Empires, so as the rise of the one
hath been the fall of the other; and it is a great truth, that Lordships and Empires,
as do mens lives, nay as befals every thing that is born, in time wax old, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
on by ordinary and natural gradations, have their beginning, increase,
time of perfection, declination, and final ruine. Till <hi>Honorius</hi> his rule, at which
time the Empire began palpably to wander from its grandeur and dignity, it had
continued for so many years, as the longer duration thereof would have almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the common condition of other things; this may well be a general reason;
but one that is so approved of by other reasons, and continual experience, as it
may be reputed certain in particulars, though sometimes we ignore the proximate
reason. But to proceed to more particular considerations, why should we beleeve
that the Roman Empire should have been of longer duration if it had been governed
by a Commonwealth, then under Emperors? Not onely reason, but experience
shews, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Government of one alone is fittest to keep up supream power in large
Dominions; since all other great Powers and Lordships have been founded and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by one onely King or Emperor.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Rome</hi> is the onely example of a Commonwealth which hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
large Dominion; nay, we may therein also observe, that as soon as she
grew to be Mistress of many Provinces, that Form of Government behoved to
be altered, as not fit to sustain so great a weight. In the very times of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
when any thing was to be agitated or treated of, especially in Wars of
great importance and difficulty, they ran to create a Dictator; because the supreme
authority which by vertue of that Magistracie was granted to one man alone, was
held requisite for the good administration of the most difficult businesses. The
Magistracy of the Dictator did punctally represent the Majestie, and Dignitie
which the Roman Emperors did after retain; Wherefore <hi>Caesar,</hi> when he
made himself the Master of the Commonwealth, made himself be declared
perpetuall Dictator; And the name of Emperor was taken from the very
name used by the Roman Commanders, and shewed the Authority which
they had of Emperor, which is to command over Armies. And certainly
the uniting the power of many in one alone, doth not onely not weaken, but doth
much to the strength and power of a Government or State: For it encreaseth
obedience, facilitates resolutions, and hastens the execution of weightiest affairs.
So as had not the Roman Forces, when military Discipline flourished most amongst
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59987:55"/>
them, been with-held oftentimes, as if opprest by internal seditions, sprung from
that sort of Government whereof they did so much partake, and which did oft-times
retard great enterprises, it may be argued that the City would have sooner
gotten to that height of greatness and Empire, which she arrived at, born even
even by main force against all these difficulties, by the great worth of her Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
               <p>Let us observe in the next place, that though the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> had changed
the Form of Government, and reduced the supreme power into one alone, yet we
finde not, that she was bereft of those arms, and helps wherewith she had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
whilst she was a Commonwealth; but did rather encrease them, and did
very much establish Forces; for the Emperors kept alwaies about their persons
a great number of Soldiers, for the defence of Imperial Majesty, which were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Pretorian</hi>-bands, and Armies in the Garrisons of Provinces, which might
defend, and keep them from any commotion which might be raised, either by
their own Subjects, or by foreign Nations. Nor were the Emperors themselves
wanting in taking order for Arms and all things belonging to War; nay, not onely
those that were held valiant, but even who for all things else were esteemed cowards,
and given over to all manner of vice, did either by themselves, or by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
undertake and finish many Wars. So it seems likliest that the Roman
Empire might govern her self, and so long preserve her greatness as she did, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for being sustained by the chief Authority, and reverent Majesty of one onely
Lord, which was of such force, as it for a long time did overcome that weakness,
which otherwise might have befaln the Empire, by the abject baseness of many
Emperors; where on the contrary, whilst it was a Commonwealth, it was divided,
rent, weak, and easie to have been opprest, if it had then met with the power of
any great, and valiant Nations, which would have supprest it, as did so many Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
People do to the Empire. And if the corruption of antient customs may be
judged to have been the readiest and truest occasion of the ruine of this Empire,
the Commonwealth was never free from the like, but even as for this very cause, of
having faln from her good Principles, that first Government was altered, and the
City lost her Liberty, so might she have done, though she still kept the Form of
a Commonwealth. Avarice, ambition, immoderate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ensuality, were the maladies
wherewith the City of <hi>Rome</hi> began to be infected, not when she was governed
by Emperors, but whilst she was ruled by her Citizens in Civil Government; And
if it be objected that this did not hinder her from giving the greatest testimony of
her valor in War, since in the last Age of the Commonwealth, when these vices and
corruptions were rifest among the Citizens, Military Discipline did flourish most,
and greatest actions were done: It cannot then be said, that neither the corruption
of manners in the times of Emperors, did destroy the Empire, nor that the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
thereof could have longer preserved the power of the Commonwealth. But
so much the less for that the Empire did not fall to ruine (though it was sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agitated by home-disorders) in such sort, as that either the Subjects did vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their Liberty, or the Commanders of Armies divide the Empire amongst

though it was oft-times thrust at by such commotions, was still not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
able to subsist, and to raise it self up again when it began to fall. But
barbarous and foreign Forces overthrew it at last; with whom the famous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in the time of the Commonwealth, not having had any occasion to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if the Government of the Commonwealth had continued till that time. It is

to the injuries of foreiners, would have been the easilier opprest, if she had been
to have withstood the terrible shock of these fierce and wild Northern Nations,
which the Emperors Forces did notwithstanding long resist; insomuch as the
Roman Empire maintained it self for the space of two hundred years after it was
molested by these sorts of people; nay, it maintained it self in dignity and majesty
for about si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty years after it was shrewdly shaken, till in the time of the Emperor
<hi>Leo</hi> the First, <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> being totally abandoned, the name and power of the
Western Empire did totally terminate.</p>
               <p>It may therefore be thought a gallant and well-advised action, that the Emperors
did so long temporise, and keep the Arms of these so powerful Nations from the
more inward parts of their State, of <hi>Italy,</hi> and chiefly of <hi>Rome</hi> herself, like so much
venom from their hearts; with which if they should have tryed the fortune of War;
hazarding one Battel or more, as upon other occasions those antient Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
had done, they might peradventure have brought the Empire sooner to its
ruine, since they had to do with a very warlike people, and whose condition was
such, as they must either die, or overcome. And certainly they had done worse, if
they had therein trusted and relied upon Fortune, since they could have gotten no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by the victory when they should have won it, were it not the saving of
themselves for the present against those Armies, who might have been succeeded
by others of the same Nations, and so the War to have been renewed more hotly
and direfully then before, out of a desire to revenge the death of their friends;
whereas the loss of a Battel or two on the Romans side, might have drawn along
with it the ruine of a most noble Empire. It was then fortunate for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that she met not with these people in such necessity and danger; for if
that had befaln her, which hapned in the time of Emperors, that Fame might perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
have been obscured which she was happy in, of being glorious and victorious
in all Wars; and the course of her so many prosperous successes might have been
interrupted or broken off by this unfortunate end.</p>
               <p>Yet if we will look on the other side, we may peradventure meet with other no
less prevalent reasons which peradventure perswade us to the contrary. Experience
shews us how good the Orders were wherewith the Commonwealth was founded,
to make great acquisitions: But it is a general rule, That States are preserved by
walking in the same ways wherein they were founded; for every thing is preserved
and maintained by alike things, and are corrupted by the contraries. If the Roman
Arms, governed by her own Citizens with Civil authority, were sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
so many States and Kingdoms under the power of the Commonwealth, what
reason have we to believe that they should not still be as able to preserve what they
had gotten; which is more easily done? The baseness and carelesness of many of
those Emperors did doubtlesly open the way to the Empires ruine; for they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
suffered those Northern people to settle themselves in divers Provinces of
the Empire. <hi>Alaricus</hi> was permitted by <hi>Honorius</hi> to inhabit with his <hi>Goths</hi> in
<hi>France;</hi> and soon after becoming his Colleagues, they likewise obtained some
Cities in <hi>Spain</hi> from him. <hi>Valentinianus</hi> granted likewise <hi>Servis</hi> and <hi>Bulgaria</hi> to
other <hi>Goths;</hi> and before these, <hi>Gallus</hi> had bought peace of the <hi>Goths;</hi> so as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
more bold and insolent, they made themselves masters of <hi>Thrace, Thessaly,</hi>
and of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> Thus the very Emperors themselves having through their
pusillanimity suffered mischief to increase at home, and these their fierce Enemies
to grow powerful, they could not afterwards drive them out of those places which
they had possest themselves of, nor keep them long out of <hi>Italy.</hi> This would not
have been suffered by the generosity of the Roman Commanders and Citizens, who
when they were in a much worse condition, would by no means agree with King
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59987:56"/>
                  <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who had assailed <hi>Italy,</hi> unless he would leave them, and return to his own
Kingdom. And that they might draw <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to molest the Carthaginians in <hi>Spain</hi> and in <hi>Africa,</hi> after they had for so
many years generously withstood their Forces. And whilst that State continued
in the form of a Commonwealth, as if Liberty had infused noble and generous
thoughts into them, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was an example to all the world of all sorts
of vertue, chiefly of Magnanim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty in undertaking great enterprises, and of Fortitude
and Constancie in managing them, and in bringing them to a happy end. But when
the Commonwealth was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uin'd, and a new sort of Government brought in, that
antient Roman worth went astray by little and little, till at last it was quite lost.
So as the ensuing Ages gave as many examples of ignorance and baseness in the
very Emperors themselves, and in others who were of greatest degree and authority
in that Empire. Hence then it was, that the good and antient Customs being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
both in Civil government, and chiefly in the Militia, the State being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to great faintness, and growing old, had not strength enough to govern it self
when it met with stout opposition. The Roman Empire was brought to so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a condition when it was set upon by the Northern Nations, which wanted all
manner of order and military discipline, as well in their Commanders, as in the
Soldiers of their own Nations, whereof the Roman Armies had been for a long
time full; insomuch as for above twenty years together, before the <hi>Goths</hi> pass'd
into <hi>Italy,</hi> they put themselves into the usual pay of some of the Roman Emperors:
And when <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Second, who was to make head in <hi>France</hi> against a valiant
and numerous Army led on by <hi>Attila,</hi> it was found that the Army which he had
then got together retained only the bare name of a <hi>Roman</hi> Army, being totally
composed of <hi>Barbarians, Vizigots, Franks, Burgonians, Alani,</hi> and others, who
notwithstanding bore away the victory for the Roman Emperor. The like hapned
in <hi>Gratianus</hi> his time, who being set upon by <hi>Atalaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> was
fain for the defence of <hi>Italy</hi> to make use of <hi>Goths, Huns,</hi> and other Soldiers of those
Nations.</p>
               <p>But the antient valor of the <hi>Romans</hi> was no less lost in their Soldiers then in their
Commanders: For so great an Empire was grown to so great a scarcity of valiant
men, and such as were fit to command the Armies, which were to withstand the
raging violence of these fierce and barbarous Nations; as <hi>Honorius</hi> found none to
whom he could commit such a charge, but one <hi>Stilico,</hi> who was himself a Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
a <hi>Hun</hi> by Nation, and very perfidious; who moved by his own interest and
designs, sought to maintain his authority, and to the end that he might place his
Son in the Empire, whilst he commanded over those Forces which were raised to
extinguish the Gothish Armies, he did not only not beat them when he might have
done it, but sollicited other Northern people to assault divers Provinces of the
Empire, and so procured them more Enemies. And <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Second, having
placed all authority and hope of defending the Provinces of the Empire from the
fury of <hi>Attila,</hi> in one <hi>Etius,</hi> when he had lost that Commander, he had not any one
fitting to undergo that charge, but was forced to leave the passage into <hi>Italy</hi> free
unto him. That which is reported of <hi>Attila,</hi> doth greatly witness the weakness of
the Empire, and in what need it stood of valiant and faithfulnes; that being fore
told by his Southsayers, that if he should come to a day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

battel.</p>
               <p>The Wars made by the Empire many years before the times of this greatest
calamity and ruine, were made against their own Roman Commanders, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59987:57"/>
over their Armies in several places, and who being in far off Provinces,
rebelled against the Emperors, hoping that they might usurp the Empire, to the
which every one of them did aspire, since they saw that all ways, even the most
indirect, lay open to a succession therein, so as the Discipline and worth was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
in both the Armies, and still the Romans got the victory, that is to say, those
who had the greatest Power and Authorety in the Roman Empire. But as soon
as occasion was offered of trying the worth of those Soldiers who served the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
against foreign Forces, and that whatsoever the Roman Empire lost, proved
an addition to their cruel and mortal enemies, the weakness thereof was soon seen,
and what a loss it had suffered by the total corruption of Discipline, and good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
orders. Which could not have happened, if the Commonwealth had still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;
for it is not likely that valiant Commanders would be found wanting in
that City, where by the vertue of good military Institutions, Soldiers did so
much flourish; since those who had betaken themselves to other imployments,
when once they took upon them the Government of Provinces, behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so in the Militia, as they deserved commendations, for there was a certain
spirit of glory in them all, and a desire of propagating the common good, as also
an aptness for all things which did befit Roman spirits. But as soon as the Form
of Government being changed, the same Romans began to degenerate from their
antient worth, and that the chief imployments, nay the Empire it self fell into the
hands of foreigners, all things else must likewise suffer alteration; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
disorders in the Militia, and the licentiousness of the Soldiers grew to be
such, as so great an Empire seemed sometimes to be governed by chance: There
not being any one therein who took care for the common good, nor for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of good Orders, neither at home nor abroad. And the making of the
Militia mercinary, was cause of the going less in worth and discipline, as also of
treachery; Insomuch as those very Soldiers, who served the Emperors, favored
the Enemy; as it happened in <hi>Theodosius</hi> his time, when those who were to guard
the <hi>Pirentian</hi> Mountains, were bribed to let the <hi>Vandals</hi> and <hi>Sweeds</hi> pass into <hi>Italy,</hi>
without making any opposition; which was the occasion of other mischiefs. And
the treachery of his Commander <hi>Gallus</hi> hindred the Emperor <hi>Decius</hi> from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
a famous victory gotten of the <hi>Goths,</hi> when not being so well flesht as they
were afterwards, nor yet so powerful, they might have been the easilier kept
back.</p>
               <p>But in time of the Commonwealth, the Roman Commanders, and Soldiers,
fought for their own Grandezza; the Nobility grew famous and powerful, and
the people in whose name, and in that of the Senate all Wars were made, got ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and advantage by those things which by their Arms they added to that Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
So as amongst other actions of the Commonwealth, it is not without won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be considered, how she could maintain so many and so numerous Armies as
she did, meerly out of Roman Soldiers. But when these respects began to fail, and
that the Militia grew mercinary, and that the Soldier grew past all measure inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
by reason of their Commanders leudness, who permitted them to do all
manner of foul things, to the end that they might have their assistance in their
usurping the Empire: The Roman Empire which had formerly wont to be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to their Enemies, so obedient to their Commanders; began to behave
themselves poorly against their Enemies, and insolently against their Lord and
Master, troublesome to their friends whom they were sent to assist, and too unable
to defend them against foreign Forces: which things, as they were begotten by
the change of Government, so is it most apparent that they were the occasion of
bringing the Empire to a sooner and more miserable end. So many, and so heinous
disorders could not have risen, if the City had continued in a Form of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59987:57"/>
or of Civil Government; for though all the Citizens might not have
peradventure proved good and valiant, yet amongst so many there would still have
some one been found, of such excellent worth and charity towards his Country, as
would have been able, if not totally to cure such disorders, at least so far to have
bounded them, as they should not have run into so great a precipice. And though
amongst the Emperors, there were some who were endowed with excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
yet could not the affairs of the Empire revert to its beginning, because there
past sometimes a whole Age betwixt one and another of these good ones: And the
Empire, for a continued series of many Emperors was administred by base men,
plunged in a multitude of vices; Insomuch as it became almost impossible for those
who succeeded to reduce the affairs to any good condition, which had so long run
to the worse.</p>
               <p>Moreover no one mans abilities, though never so excellent, were able to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
so great a body, as was the Roman Empire, much less those of such as were
so unfit, even for Governments of less importance, as were many of the Roman
Emperors. Whence it was that <hi>Adrian,</hi> a wise Emperor, thought it fit for the
welfare of the Empire, to go in his own person, and consolidate it with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and visit in perpetual progresses, sometimes one, sometimes another
Province; for the good Government whereof, they being so many, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
the example of so many rebellous Commanders and Armies, shewed how
false and unworthy the Ministers had been who had been by the Emperors sent
thither. But in the Commonwealth there were a great many Citizens who were
interessed in the Government and Greatness thereof, so as though some valiant
man went to the Wars, the City remained not without Government or Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
nor did the appointing a Commander in chief over one Army, bereave
them of others who might command more Armies, if they had need to wage
War at one and the same time in several places, whereof the Commonwealth of
<hi>Rome</hi> did in all Ages give notable examples.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be affirmed, but that the Commanders, and Armies of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
have made War with people as powerful in Arms, as were those Northern
Nations, whose fury the Roman Empire could not resist. For, not to mention
so many bitter Wars made by those antient Romans, the enterprises done by <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> were they not undertaken against people, in whom all the
respects met which were considerable in those Northern Nations? very numerous
Armies; for we read, that one onely Army, amongst many sundry people where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
<hi>France</hi> was then divided, which was venquish'd and wholly overcome by <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
consisted of above Three hundred thousand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighting men.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59987:58"/>
went over the Mountains to encounter them; so as those Barbarians began to be
routed, and met with a rub to their greatest Forces: And afterwards those who
had advanced by another way, being gotten safe into <hi>Italy,</hi> they sent to desire
<hi>Marius</hi> the General of the Roman Armies, that he would assign them some Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
where they might live quietly, and they would therewithall rest contented,
without endeavoring to advance their Fortune any further by their Arms. But
they did not then obtain it of the Roman General, as did the <hi>Goths</hi> and other
Foreiners afterwards from some of the Emperors, who not trusting in themselves,
nor in their Armies, permitted those Barbarous hostile Nations to live peacefully
in those Provinces of the Empire, whereof they had injuriously possessed themselves.
Nay, though there were not above Fifty thousand Foot in the Roman Army, and
that they were to fight with six times as many of the Enemy, the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
did not refuse to join battel with them, and did totally overthrow the
Enemies Army, thereby securing <hi>Italy</hi> for that time, and for many years after,
from Transalpine incursions. But 'tis seen, that neither the number of the Enemy, nor
the desperate-mindedness of them with whom they fought, nor the discipline nor
induration in Armies and military duties, (all which things were in these barbarous
Armies overcome by the Romans) were sufficient to discourage the Roman
Commanders and Soldiers, whilst the Commonwealth did nourish generous
thoughts in them, and in their Forces. And in <hi>Augustus</hi> his time also, because
Discipline in War was observed, <hi>Drusus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius Nero</hi> were able to drive
away the <hi>Vandals,</hi> who were then called <hi>Borgondi,</hi> and to frighten other People of
the furthermost Northern parts from coming to infest <hi>Italy,</hi> as they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to do.</p>
               <p>No good argument can then be inforced from what hath been said, nor can there
be any rational judgment given of what would have befaln the Roman Empire, if
it had still been kept under the antient government of a Commonwealth, till the
great combustions made by these Northern people, by whom it was destroyed.
Certainly the acquisition, or preservation of States, does not depend upon the Form
of Government, whether it be of one alone, or of a few, or of many; for we have
examples cleer enough of great Empires which have been won, and preserved by a
King, by the <hi>Optimati,</hi> by a People, and by a Commonwealth mixt of divers sorts
of Governments. But the strength or weakness of every State depends upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Orders, chiefly in point of the Militia, wherewith it is instituted, and the
force and vertue whereof useth to be such, as even Tyrannical Governments, which
carry with them so much of violence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

preserved it long, as by woful example to others we may this day discern in the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Government. As then the City of <hi>Rome</hi> grew great and powerful, not
for being either formed of an Optima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for her good Orders and Institutions in military affairs; whence it was, that when

still end in victory: So cannot it be alleged for a true and immediate reason of the

the care and diligence of one only Prince, who was oft-times unfit for Government,

in the Commonwealths time. But it is very hard to penetrate into the true causes
of so great events, and so remote from our memory, which are reserved to the
deeper judgment of him who is the true and Supreme LORD, and who governs
and doth dispense States and Empires by ways and ends, which are unknown to

               <head type="sub">Why the Grecians did not much extend the Confines of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
as did the Romans; and how Greece came to lose her
Liberty.</head>
               <p>OF all other antient People, there are two that have been greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;
so as their names, and the glory of things by them done, hath
been conveyed over to the memory of Posterity with large acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
to wit, the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians;</hi> alike for notable examples of
all worth and vertue, but sufficiently unlike for the greatness and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Empire. For whereas the <hi>Grecians</hi> did not extend their Confines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bounds of <hi>Greece</hi> herself, nor did she long flourish in the same splendor
of dignity, nor greatness of fame and dominion; the <hi>Romans</hi> did command over
almost the whole World, and their Empire, although the Form of Government
was changed, endured for many Ages; for there past above eleven hundred years
between the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the time wherein she was taken and sackt by
the <hi>Goths.</hi> They then who shall consider these things, may with reason desire to
know why these two Nations did differ so much in fortune, since they were equally
worthy. It was not in any one City alone, that choise men for both all civil and
military worth did flourish in <hi>Greece,</hi> as in <hi>Italy</hi> they did in <hi>Rome;</hi> but many
Cities did at the same time produce Citizens excellent in all manner of things. It
would be a tedious thing to number vp the gallant Actions of <hi>Miltiades, Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Aristides, Phocion, Alcibiades, Age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e things, when

they are considered the wonder ceaseth, why she could not encrease her Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
answerable to the Fame, Vertue, and Glory of things done by that Nation.
<hi>Greece</hi> was divided into many several people, who were all of them totally, or for
the most part governed by proper Laws, and Civill Institutions in the Form of a
Commonwealth, though they were of divers States. And though they had a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councel, which was called the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>phictyo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> wherein men met, who were sent
from all the chief Cities, to treat of the most important affairs, and such as did
concern the common interests of all <hi>Greece,</hi> yet did not this Councel give one
onely and certain Government to all <hi>Greece;</hi> but it was such an Assembly as are
the Diets which are in these times sometimes call'd in <hi>Germany</hi> upon some particular
Occurrences; wherein many Princes, and free Cities of that Province meet, which
do much differ in State, Dignity, and Form of Government, and who have free
votes in counselling and in resolving upon such matters as are therein treated. But
amongst other people of <hi>Greece,</hi> the <hi>Spartans</hi> and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> antient people
of Greece, and who for a long time, had by their worth purchast much authority,
were very numerous and eminent when Greece did flourish most, both for publick
power, and for the admirable worth of particular Citizens. For though the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
the <hi>Argives,</hi> the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and some other people, were of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
in respect of other lesser Cities, yet they for the most part did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
follow the fortune of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> then their
own. And the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who for a while were in better esteem then the rest, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their Soldiers Discipline, whom they called by a particular name, of the
Sacred Cohort, yet because of all her Citizens, onely two arrived at any cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
honor, to wit <hi>Pelopides</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and for that her Militia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
but of Five hundred men, their City never arrived at that degree of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Glory, as did <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi> But as much as these were greater
then the others, so much did they the more emulate one another, both for private
worth and glory, as for publick Dignity and Reputation. To these did the other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Greece</hi> adhere, some being by them commanded, others by vertue of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
considerations. These two Cities were highly esteemed for the orders of the
first Founders of such Commonwealths, to with <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in <hi>Sparta,</hi> and in <hi>Athens,
Theseus;</hi> so as these people who did long before inhabit the same Country, began
to take name, and authority over the rest: Those who did inhabit the <hi>Terra firma,</hi>
held for the most part with the <hi>Spartans;</hi> and those of the Islands with the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
But yet every City was free, and hugely intent not to let the power either
of the <hi>Spartans</hi> or <hi>Athenians</hi> encrease too much, but to keep the strength of these
two chief Cities so equally ballanced, as when the one of them should go about
to oppress the other people of <hi>Greece,</hi> the oppressed might have recourse to the
other.</p>
               <p>It is therefore to be observed in all the actions of the Grecians, that the rest of
the people were never firm in their friendships, either to the <hi>Spartans</hi> alone, or
alone to the <hi>Athenians;</hi> but when the one of them began to exceed the other,
they sided with the weakest; not valuing any tie of friendship or confederacy, when
they met with any such respect: So as for a long time the affairs of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and
of <hi>Athens</hi> marcht hand in hand, though each of them both gave and received ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
routs, and partook both of good and bad fortune in War. <hi>Sparta</hi> was strongest
by land, and <hi>Athens</hi> by Sea; so as they did counterpoise one another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and for that (as it hath been said) they had each of them many dependants,
and confederates, they kept the forces of whole Greece divided, nor was there
means afforded to either of them, much to exceed the other. Wherefore neither
of them could busie themselves in far off affairs, nor against strangers, because they
were still at contestation between themselves. And if at any time they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59987:59"/>
to do it, they were either hindred or diverted, as were the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when
they past with their Fleet above <hi>Sicily</hi> under pretence to assist the <hi>Leontinians,</hi> but
in effect, to get the Island to themselves; aspiring, by advice of <hi>Alcibiades</hi>
(who had higher conceptions, then any former Greciah had had) to pass over into
<hi>Africa</hi> against the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> the <hi>Spartans</hi> having discovered the design, and
not being able to endure, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> should to their prejudice, grow more
powerful, resisted their Forces, and succor'd <hi>Messina,</hi> when the City was ready to
be lost, and also assailed the Athenians in their own Territories, to divert them
from that enterprise. The same thing, for the same occasion fell out, when the
Athenians passing with their Fleet into <hi>Egypt,</hi> had induced the Egyptians to rebel
against the Persians; and very powerful Forces were already brought by Sea from
Greece to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to assault the King of <hi>Persia's</hi> Territories; But the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
growing jealous of their greatness, frustrated that design, opposing them so
many waies, and by so many Forces, as if the business had been not to have abased,
but to have exalted the power of the Persians, the common, and continual enemies
of <hi>Greece.</hi> But these things were done by the Spartans, as they gave out, onely
to curb the immoderate ambition of the Athenians, and to maintain, and defend
the liberty of whole <hi>Greece;</hi> upon which pretence they undertook, and for many
years maintained that famous War, of the people of <hi>Morca,</hi> which did much molest
whole <hi>Greece,</hi> and kept their Forces very low. Therefore in the time when these
two greater and more famous Commonwealths did flourish, they made use of
their Forces more against themselves then against foreiners; and in domestick
War, which was the cause why <hi>Greece</hi> grew weaker, not more powerful: For
whatsoever of prejudice befel either of the parties, was prejudicial to <hi>Greece</hi> her
self, and the fame and glory of their victories was blemish'd and lessened by the loss
of those Grecians that were overcome.</p>
               <p>Therefore she never became formidable to other Nations, as did <hi>Italy,</hi> where
when the fame and worth of the Romans began to prevail, and the other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
Potentates were extinguished, her force and power being all of a peece,
the Roman Arms were dreadful to all people, nay they were all finally overcome
by them. But <hi>Greece</hi> never having been able to reduce her self to a condition,
that all her forces should be under the power of one onely Potentate, and that
War was administred under the Auspice of one onely Commonwealth, she was of
necessity to be alwaies too weak and impotent to inlarge her Confines much. So
as that which made the Grecians be much esteemed, to wit, her having so many
Commonwealths, did much diminish the glory and dignity of Empire, to which
otherwise her many signal vertues might have carried her, if her Forces had been in
the power of one onely or Prince, or Commonwealth; or at least if there had been
a greater union, and better intelligence amongst the so many Commonwealths that
were in her. But too great a desire of Liberty, which made it harder for one
People to be obedient to another People, was directly that which made them injoy
it the lesser while. For being weak, and divided amongst themselves, the way lay
open to any who who would assault, and oppress them. But the better the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
were accommodated with all vertue and discipline, which made them esteem
all others besides themselves barbarous, so much the more were they born away
with too much vivacity of spirit, to such an el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion of mind, as none of them
could indure to see themselves equall'd either in publick, or in private by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor any City to his, nor any of his Citizens to himself. So as every more
valiant man, and every more generous action grew suspici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> to others and were
more envied, and disturb'd then the rest, all their ambition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
upon themselves.</p>
               <p>It is reported that <hi>Pausanias,</hi> who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59987:60"/>
against the <hi>Persians,</hi> did in token thereof present the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Delphos</hi>
with that famous golden Trevet; whereat the rest of the <hi>Grecians</hi> being greatly
scandalized, made <hi>Pausanias</hi> his name be raced out, and placed in stead thereof the
names of all the Confederate Cities, whose People were present at that Victory.
And 'tis said of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> that full of vexation, he had wont to say, that he could
not sleep for thinking of the Triumphs of <hi>Miltiades.</hi> But there are a thousand
examples of such like things, which shews how fervently they did contend one with
another in point of glory. <hi>Themistocles</hi> and <hi>Aristides</hi> were profess'd Enemies;
so were <hi>Alcibiades</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icias,</hi> and many others of the most famous and valiantest
Citizens of <hi>Athens:</hi> Where there was such contention amongst themselves, and
so great care was had that no one man should exceed another very much, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any action which might make him more glorious and potent, as Ostracism
was ordained, which was, the banishment of such Citizens for ten years, who were
very remarkable either for excellency of parts, or prosperous fortune, more then
were the rest; by which means they lost their best Citizens, nay sometime made
them bocome their Enemies, as was seen in <hi>Alcibiades, Themistocles, Pericles,</hi> and
some others, who were born for the aggrandising of that Commonwealth, and yet
through the corruption of the Orders thereof proved prejudicial to it. Whereupon
<hi>Xerxes,</hi> who favored, and gave entertainment to such men, had wont to say, that he
prayed God that his Enemies might still banish such Citizens.</p>
               <p>The divers Forms of Government made likewise much against the union of the
people of <hi>Greece.</hi> Some of their Cities were much for Democracie, as <hi>Athens;</hi>
and some others lean'd more to Aristocracie, as <hi>Sparta.</hi> Such d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>versity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
produced diversity of Customs and cogitations; so as they could hardly be
all of them pleased with one and the same thing, every one measuring their actions
with peculiar respects divided from the rest. So as when in the time of <hi>Lysander</hi>
King of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> the City of <hi>Athens</hi> was taken, to the end that they might
master it the better, they changed the Form of Government, reducing it from a
Popular condition, the form of its former Government, under the authority of a
few, as that which did more resemble the <hi>Spartan</hi> Government. And in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
times, when the <hi>Spartans</hi> ran the same fortune with all the other <hi>Grecians,</hi>
and was compell'd to obey the King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> it was requisite to alter the Laws
and Institutions of that City, which were at first ordained by <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> These
things did beget and maintain so great a disunion in <hi>Greece,</hi> as she could not only
not unite her Forces together to carry them against other Nations, but hardly
could she defend herself with them: As was seen, when being mightily endangered
by an Army of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which came with a great power to assault her, the
War was diversly administred, they not agreeing what City should nominate the
Commander in chief; the <hi>Spartans</hi> would have reduced the defence to narrow
passages by Land, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> would have put the whole fortune of <hi>Greece</hi> in
their Fleet; the situations of their Cities, and the condition of their Forces, would
not permit that one and the same thing should be equally useful and commodious
for them all. Nor was the eminent danger of the <hi>Persians</hi> so potent Army able to
unite the Forces of all <hi>Greece,</hi> but that some of the chief People, as the <hi>Thessalians,
Argives,</hi> and <hi>Thebans</hi> would be exempted from out the League; and the <hi>Argives</hi>
being requested to adhere to the Confederacie of so many other Cities, answered,
that they would rather obey the <hi>Persians,</hi> then give way unto their antient Rivals
and Enemies, the <hi>Spartans.</hi> Finally, the <hi>Grecians</hi> having obtained a great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Victory in the Sea-fight at <hi>Salamine,</hi> when they were to have pursued
their Fortune, after having beaten the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leet, and made the Enemy retire, they of
themselves gave over all further hopes, and came home to their own Havens; for
that the <hi>Spartans</hi> envied the glory of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and fearing by reason of their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59987:60"/>
being stronger at Sea, that if they should have proceeded on in their success, they
would not have spared their own <hi>Grecians,</hi> but have domineered over them; and soon
after being more moved by envy, and their antient home-contentions, then by any
hatred to the Enemy, when they should have driven the remainder of the Persian
Army out of <hi>Greece,</hi> the associate Cities fel upon the <hi>Thebans,</hi> because severing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in these common dangers from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> they had recourse for friendship
to the <hi>Persians.</hi> So as <hi>Greece</hi> reaped no good by this prosperous success, because the
<hi>Grecians</hi> knew not how to value it, nor knew they how to use the Victory when they
had got it. <hi>Mardonius</hi> was overthrown at the Battel of <hi>Platea,</hi> together with his
whole Army, which after <hi>Xerxes</hi> his flight he commanded in chief: But what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
got the <hi>Grecians</hi> by so great a victory, save their dividing of the prey? which
made them return all of them the sooner to their own houses. Nay, there arose
greater and more cruel civil wars between them afterwards, then had ever been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and the business grew to that height, as the <hi>Spartans</hi> who had always profess'd
themselves more bitter Enemies to the <hi>Barbarians</hi> then all the rest, joined in league
with them, and conspired with <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> who was Governor of <hi>Libia</hi> for King
<hi>Darius,</hi> to ruine <hi>Greece.</hi> Truces made between them were also often broken; and
out of too great proneness to adhibit faith to the suspitions which they had one of
another, the publick faith was broken; no tye being strong enough to keep those
minds fast together, which were so divided by perpetual emulation. But of all the
rest, two things are very considerable as touching this present Discourse, and the
Judgment which is to be given thereupon; to wit, of what strength the <hi>Grecians</hi>
were in military affairs, and with what Princes they had to do, in the time when
<hi>Greece</hi> did flourish most, and had most reason to aspire to enlarge her Empire.
Certainly he who shall well consider it, will find that warlike Discipline was neither
so highly esteemed of, nor of that excellencie and perfection amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
as it was amongst the <hi>Romans;</hi> for the <hi>Romans</hi> valued nothing more then military
valor and discipline; nay, for a long time they studied no Sciences nor Liberal Arts,
(wherein those who took any delight, made use of <hi>Grecians</hi>) but did wholly give
their minds to military exercises, and sought for praise from nothing but from
War. Whence it was, that more Soldiers excellently well train'd up in millitary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
were to be drawn out of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> then out of other whole Provinces,
whereas the <hi>Grecians</hi> did not give their minds to the study of War, but to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to the Liberal Sciences, which flourish'd a long time amongst them, as
either born with them, or very well cultivated by them. There were as many of
them that frequented Universities to become Philosophers, as of those who studied
the Soldiers craft. How many Professors were there amongst them of Oratory
and Poetry, wherein they proved so excellent, as all that ever desired to prove good
therein since, have observed their rules, and trodden in their steps. How many rare
Artificers have there likewise been of <hi>Grecians</hi> in all the most noble Arts, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in Sculpture and Picture-drawing? The original, or at least the perfection
whereof, knows no other beginning then from <hi>Greece:</hi> In the memory of all Ages,

famous for the excellencie of Learning, and of the Liberal Arts, then for skill in the
Militia. Yet was the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> better then the rest at millitary affairs; and
<hi>Athens</hi> was sufficiently famous for her Fleets by Sea, and her skill in maritime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs:

of Libertie, then at the acquisition of Empire; not onely private Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
but even the publick weal being constituted in great poverty, and restrained
to a small number of Citizens; they were forbidden all commerce with foreiners,

had caused many of the Cities of <hi>Ionia</hi> to rebel against the King or <hi>Persia;</hi> to
make use of that occasion, and take up arms; shewing him that he might penerate
even to the Cities of <hi>Susa,</hi> and possess himself of the wealth of all those Kings;
The <hi>Spartan</hi> laught at the proposition, and considering onely the length of the
voyage, said, He would none of those riches, which were not worth so much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
Yet because the Government of <hi>Sparta</hi> preserved it self for a long time
without any great alteration or change, and grew therefore the stronger, it was
able to get the Dominion of whole <hi>Morea,</hi> and had afterwards the prime place
for dignitie, and Empire amongst the Grecians. On the contrary, <hi>Athens,</hi> which
by the opportunitie of the Sea, and by divers of her institutions aiming at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
of the City, seemed as if she onght to have inlarged her Dominion beyond
the Confines of <hi>Greece,</hi> could not make good use of her Forces, nor reap the fruit
which became the worth of some of her most excellent Citizens, who were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirited, and were minded to raise their Country to further greatness, because
she could never order her self so as to preserve herself long in one and the same
Form of Government, but was busied in perpetual Civil disorders, precipitating
herself sometimes into a corrupt Popular State, sometimes into the tyrannie of
a few.</p>
               <p>But the Grecians seemed as if all their thoughts were usually bounded within
themselves; insomuch as it is said of some of their most famous Commanders,
That they did more willingly exercise themselves in Wars made amongst the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
themselves, then in Wars against the Barbarians; since come what would,
the advantage and honor of the Victory did remain in <hi>Greece.</hi> But as for what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Militia, some may peradventure think, that it may be proved by some
famous Victories that the <hi>Grecians</hi> won from the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> that they
did much study Military Affairs, and were very good at Military Discipline, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as for that part, there was no more to be wished for in them. To this it
may be answered, That it is not to be denied, but that the Grecian Militia might be
thought to be good and laudable when compared to that of the Barbarians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whom
they had most to do; But that it is no waies to be held comparable to that
of the Romans, who did excellently well understand whatsoever belonged to the
true Militia, better then did any other Nation in any whatsoever time. Insomuch as
by reason of their good orders, and of the so many Victories which they wan, they
propounded unto themselves the conquest of the whole world; which out of the
same reasons they effected. But it is observable in the Victories which the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
got against the King of <hi>Persia's</hi> Forces, that they were occasioned, not so much
through the good ordering of their Militia, as by reason of a certain obstinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
which they had put on, to defend <hi>Greece</hi> from the eminent slavery of the
the Barbarians, the fear whereof made them bold to encounter whatsoever
danger.
Many of their actions prove this, as amongst others, that of <hi>Leonid as</hi> was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
famous, who being left with onely. Five hundred of his <hi>Lacodimonians</hi> to
guard the Strieght of <hi>Thermopla,</hi> fell boldly with them one night into the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
Camp, where were sundry Hundred thousands of men, not being perswaded
thereunto out of any hopes of victory of safety, but onely out of a desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59987:61"/>
the injuries done by <hi>Xerxes</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> by the slaying of so many enemies,
and by his own voluntary death. Who knows not that in the Naval fight at
<hi>Salamina,</hi> it was necessity that made the Grecians so couragious? Since the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> who were of greatest power in that Fleet, were already without
any Country, their City being burnt by the Enemy; so that their ultimate hope
of any good consisted in that daies good success. And to make the necesfity the
greater, <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who was their Commander in chief, chose wisely to joyn
Battel in a place which was far from any friends Territories, thereby to bereave
every one of any other hopes of safety but by being victorious. And the great
multitude of the Persians Fleet, served rather for confusion to them then for any
strength, for of above a thousand Vessels which were therein, it is said that hardly
Two hundred entred the Battel. And the Victory which was obtained not long
after by land against the Army led on by <hi>Mardonius,</hi> was rendred the less difficult
by the reputation which the Grecians had won by their Naval Victory, and by
King <hi>Xerxes</hi> his running away, whose Soldiers proved no more couragious then
did their Master, for whose glory it was that they were to fight; whereas the
Grecians fought for themselves, for the safety of their Country, their Houses, and
of all that they had.</p>
               <p>But to boot with all this, it may peradventure not without truth be affirmed,
That the actions of the Grecians have been transferred over to the memory of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
for greater then what indeed they were. For <hi>Greece</hi> had great store of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Writers, who according to the custom of the Nation, amplifying such
deeds as might purchase glory to them, have studied very much to set them forth
to the best, and to make them appear praise-worthy. Wherefore <hi>Salust</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his History, rendring as it were a reason why he took the pains to write,
saies, That the Actions of the Romans may appear to be the less, out of the little
care they had of putting them into writing, every one being more intent to do
praise-worthy actions, then to celebrate the actions of other men; whereas the
Grecians actions were made to appear, not what they really were, but such as the
most excellent wits of good Writers could by their adornments set them stately
forth.</p>
               <p>Moreover there met many things in the Romans, much differing from
what hath been said of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> for their whole study was to make their City
powerful by any whatsoever way, that they might, as they did, draw upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

occasion great store of Soldiers from thence. This was the original of the sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie,
wherein wicked men driven out of other Countries were received, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
People of many of the neighboring Cities, were allowed the priviledges of
the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the more to interess them in what belonged to the honor and
greatness of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to that of their Common-countrie, yet was not the War
administred under divers names or auspices, as it was in <hi>Greece,</hi> by reason of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Leagues had between several People, but by the sole authoritie of the Roman
Commanders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and still in sole respect to what made onely good for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now if we will co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sider with what forein Potentates the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
had to make War, we shall find that this also made it the harder for them to
acquire other mens Countries, for just when the Grecians, by reason of their
having many gallant men amongst them, might have aspired at the aggrandizing of
their Empire, the Persian Monarchie was grown so powerful as it ruled over all the
East; And was not onely got near to <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>a,</hi> by the possession of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but did
also possess <hi>Ionia,</hi> an antient Colony of the Grecians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So as it was a very great
and difficult undertaking, to go about to possess the Territories of so great a
Prince, who though he should receive a rout might easily recover his loss, and
put himself in a safe posture of defence, by reason of the largeness of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59987:62"/>
and the multitude of Soldiers that were at his command. So as join this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
impediment to the inward, which lay in their home discords, and we shall see
that the Routs which the <hi>Grecians</hi> gave to the <hi>Persians,</hi> did no further incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the <hi>Persians,</hi> then the loss of those Armies; nor did the <hi>Grecians</hi> receive any
further benefit thereby, then the defending of themselves, and their safety for no
long time from further dangers. But the Kingdom of <hi>Macedon,</hi> though of much
less strength for extent of Empire, became very formidable by reason of its good
Discipline in War, and for the great worth of some of her Kings, amongst which
<hi>Philip</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who as he proved a great Prince, and of deep
designs, so was he very pernicious to <hi>Greece:</hi> For divers People of <hi>Greece</hi> having
recourse to him for help against some other Grecians that were their Enemies, they
were willingly received, and their request graciously listned unto, that so he might
nourish their discords, and weaken all their Forces by continual Wars; by which
means he made himself Arbitrator of all <hi>Greece;</hi> insomuch as there were not any
of them who did not sometimes apply themselves unto him, either for Peace to
themselves, or for help by War against others.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Philip</hi> discovering his intentions at last, that he was resolved to rule
over all <hi>Greece,</hi> he entred thereinto with powerful Forces, and was no less grievous
to those who first called him in, then to the rest against whom he declared his
coming to be. So <hi>Thebes,</hi> which was the first City which made use of his Forces,
and did it oftner then all the rest, was one of the first (though with prejudice to all
the rest) that tasted the bitter fruits of her unadvised Councels, being ruin'd and
destroyed by the same <hi>Philip;</hi> who being much allured by the taking of that City,
and by hopes of greater matters, resolved to make himself Master of other Cities
of <hi>Greece:</hi> To which design whereas all <hi>Greece</hi> ought to have opposed themselves
for the common interest, they went about, though by several and divided councels,
to join themselves with him, and to place their own safety in his friendship and
fidelity. Thus did all <hi>Beotia, Thessaly,</hi> and other Regions adhere unto him; and
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who, encouraged by <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> took up Arms themselves, and
endeavored to raise whole <hi>Greece</hi> against <hi>Philip,</hi> being but in weak condition after
the so many defeats received from the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> they also had recourse to
him for safety by the way of favor and peace, not only for themselves, but for all
<hi>Greece.</hi> So as the <hi>Spartans</hi> being left almost alone to oppose <hi>Philips</hi> Forces, they
proved much too weak to withstand such a power; so as <hi>Greece</hi> being opprest by
Forein forces, fell at last into the hands of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> And when there was
a likelihood, by the death of <hi>Philip,</hi> who had not as yet well confirm'd his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over them, that the Grecians might have shaken off their yoke of servitude,
<hi>Alexander</hi> succeeded in the Kingdom, so valiant a Prince, as he was a terror not
only to his neighbors, but to all the East; who by his supreme greatness, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
worth, made all his Soldiers so inamor'd of him, as some of the Grecian
Commanders, who had followed him in the Wars in <hi>Persia,</hi> stuck not to affirm, that
there was not any one in <hi>Greece,</hi> who ought not to desire as the greatest happiness
that could befall them, that <hi>Alexander</hi> might sit in the Throne, as King of
<hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after <hi>Alexanders</hi> unexpected death, <hi>Greece</hi> seemed to have a better opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
offered her to remit herself into her former liberty, being just at that time in
Arms; for the <hi>Athenians</hi> with many other people were rebell'd against <hi>Alexander,</hi>
and had an Army on foot of Thirty thousand men, besides a numerous Fleet, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
because he would have received into their Country a great many of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
who had been banish'd for diversity of Factions. And moreover, the divisions
of Empire made by <hi>Alexander</hi> among so many of his Commanders, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
which suddenly arose amongst them, were things which gave <hi>Greece</hi> great
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59987:62"/>
opportunities of not being any more subject to be commanded by a Foreiner.
Yet could she not lay hold thereon, either because their former valor and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
began to fail in them, and their antient Customs to be corrupted, (for many
who had received favors from <hi>Philip</hi> and from <hi>Alexander,</hi> loved better to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by one man alone, then to restore their Country to her liberty; and chiefly
for that the People having for the most part had great authority in those days, the
best and most valiant Citizens were rewarded with banishment and other injuries
for their service:) Or else it may rather be said, that the same reason of Civil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
which had at first made <hi>Greece</hi> weak, and not able to maintain herself in a free
condition, did concur at this time likewise to make her relapse into slavery. Thus
the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and the <hi>Argives,</hi> who together with the <hi>Athenians</hi> had taken up
Arms against the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> either out of fear of <hi>Antipaters</hi> Forces (to whose
share in the division of the Empire after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi>
fell, of which Provinces he was formerly Governor) or else egg'd on by envy,
they soon forewent the League which they had contracted, lest the City of <hi>Athens</hi>
might have returned to her former greatness, and so suffered the <hi>Athenians</hi> to be
made a prey of by the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> And the <hi>Spartans,</hi> out of their same antient
respects, standing idle Spectators of other mens miseries, and not thinking that the
same afflictions might befall them, minded more to secure their own City with new
Fortifications, then to oppose themselves, as they ought to have done, to these
Forces of the Enemy, and not have suffered them to increase by the Forces of <hi>Greece</hi>
herself, and by those whom they had subjugated.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Greece</hi> enjoyed peace and quiet; some of them enduring patiently
the Macedonian government, and others not fearing (as they ought to have don.)
the like mischief, because it was not as yet come home unto them. So when by the
various accidents which befell the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in their own Kingdom, <hi>Greece</hi>
might have kept them low, or at least have kept them from further domineering,
permitting <hi>Cassander, Antigonus,</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> to live peaceably and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
for all them, and sometimes too much believing their flat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eries, and allured
by a certain appearing Liberty wherewith those Princes thought good to keep
the <hi>Grecians</hi> in obedience to them, they knew not how to make use of any of so
many occasions, till at last in <hi>Philips</hi> time (that <hi>Philip</hi> with whom the Romans
had Wars so long, who proved so gallant a Prince, and possest himself of <hi>Macedonia</hi>
together with other Provinces) she returned to her antient revolts. And as <hi>Philip</hi>
the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> made himself Lord thereof, by the same means whereby
he had got entrance thereinto; for King <hi>Philip</hi> entred <hi>Greece,</hi> being call'd in by the
<hi>Argives</hi> and <hi>Achaeans,</hi> who were made War upon by the <hi>AEtolians,</hi> with whom
many of the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> were so ill satisfied, as to shun being governed
by them, they voluntarily put themselves into the power of King <hi>Philip;</hi>
who hae the way at last opened unto him (to the end that no part of <hi>Greece</hi> might
be safe from the Macedonian Forces) to fall upon <hi>Sparta,</hi> with which City <hi>Philip</hi>
was before upon good terms and in peace: For the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> not being able
to endure that the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> by <hi>Philips</hi> favor, should grow too great in <hi>Morea,</hi> the
Principality whereof they had for a long time held, breaking their former agreement
and confederacie made with <hi>Philip,</hi> were joined with the <hi>AEtolians,</hi> assisting them
against the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> who were Friends and Confederates of the same <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hilip.</hi>
And after many revolutions, the business came at last to that pass, as the <hi>Grecians</hi>
being too late aware that they had suffered the authority of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to
grow too great over them, by which some of them had been formerly tyrannically
dealt withall, and others apprehending the like imminent danger, not able to endure
these yet greater mischiefs, they fled to the <hi>Romans,</hi> craving help and succor
from them against <hi>Philip;</hi> as did the City of <hi>Athens</hi> chiefly, as having suffered
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59987:63"/>
greatest injuries, and being wont to be the head of the greatest, and most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
innovations in <hi>Greece.</hi> Nor was it hard for them to obtain it; for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
making profession, that they had made it their business that there should be
no unjust power upon the earth, but that Reason, Justice, and Law should rule
every where, did willingly imbrace the protection, and defence of the weakest,
whom they found to be opprest by the more powerful: which thing under pretence
of defending others, and of a noble peece of generosity, made the way to divers
acquisitions the easier to them; covering by these means their ambition of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>But the Romans were very cunning herein, who in all their actions shewed as if
they desired nothing but glory, by which they did miraculously win the hearts of
all <hi>Greece:</hi> For in the Expedition which they made against <hi>Philip,</hi> their Armies
having, at the instance of the Grecians themselves past over the Sea, run many
hazzards, and endured much hardships; when they had conquered <hi>Philip,</hi> and
drove him out of <hi>Greece,</hi> they restored all those Cities which had been formerly
under his Dominion, to their Liberty; suffering them to live under their own
Laws, but yet so, as made advantagiously for them, placing some of their own
Roman Soldiers in some of the bordering Towns; alleadging that they did this
for the good of <hi>Greece,</hi> that being freed from the slavery of <hi>Philip,</hi> they might not
fall into the like of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> a powerful King at that time in <hi>Asia,</hi> who might
be the better kept out of <hi>Europe,</hi> for fear of not offending the Roman greatness,
then for fear of the weak forces of <hi>Greece,</hi> which were already very low. But the
truth was, that these places opportunely held by the Romans, served to secure
them of the Grecians fidelitie, if at any time forgetting their obligation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of novelty, as they had alwaies appeared to be, they should have a mind,
with prejudice to the Roman affairs, to joyn with any other stranger Prince; for
they desired that they might depend on the Authority of the Commonwealth of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So as that <hi>Greece</hi> which had so many valiant Soldiers and Commanders, and was
so famous amongst other Nations, not having known how to make use of time,
whilst the name of the Romans was but obscure, and that their Forces were busied
else-where, to make way for their further greatness; was forc'd afterwards to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the fortune of the Romans, and to confess themselves to be overcome by their
more excellent worth; and to acknowledge all that remained of good or safety to
them, from their favor.</p>
               <p>But to rerurn from whence we have digrest; and to proceed with the successes
of <hi>Greece</hi> in divers Ages, let us say; that it being the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of <hi>Greece</hi> to fall upon
two so potent neighboring Princes, as were the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> it
did not onely foment their Civil discords, but did hasten their final ruine, for if
the Grecians had had less powerful neighbors, they would either not have had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
unto them, or else the use of their Forces and assistance in their own <hi>Greece</hi>
would not have proved so prejudicial to them: It being a true &amp; general rule in State
Affairs, that no foeign Forces are to be made use of, for a mans own safety, which
are much greater then his own; for by so doing, a man must depend upon another
mans will; which where rule is in question, is usually more ready to endeavor its
own conveniency and greatness, then to keep word, and to consider another mans
good, though he be a friend and confederate: Yet it may be affirmed, that <hi>Greece</hi>
having for neighbors not onely one but two great Potentates, it was a thing which
as it hindred her from making acquisitions abroad, so it might have been of great
help unto her for the preservation of her self, and Liberty, if she could have made
good use thereof. For if at any time she should be opprest by one of them, she
had means to have recourse to the other, from whom she might safely build for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59987:63"/>
help, since self-interest concurr'd therein, for it would be dangerous for either of
them to suffer the others power encrease too much, by the ruine of <hi>Greece.</hi> So as
if the Grecians, when they were threatned ruine by <hi>Philip,</hi> had known how to
make use of the help which was offered them by the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> they might
peradventure have escaped that bad fortune; but being exceedingly jealous one of
another, they had all of them recourse to the same Prince, because none of the
rest might make use of his friendship and favor. Thus <hi>Philip</hi> the first had greatest
opportunity offered him, of making himself by degrees, First, chief Captain, next,
Arbitrator, and lastly, Lord of all <hi>Greece,</hi> by keeping some of her people quiet,
and in peace, which he easily granted them for his own ends; and by making War
at the same time upon some others of them, and he who shall compare these antient
successes of the Grecians affairs, with others of the ensuing age, and nearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, shall and will find very like effects which have sprung from the same occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For <hi>Greece</hi> being once humbled, and as subjected by the Roman greatness,
was afterwards returned to great honor and dignity in the time of <hi>Constantine</hi>
who placed the seat of the Empire in the antient City of <hi>Biz antium;</hi> but she
knew not how to keep therein by reason of her discords. For after that the <hi>French</hi>
and the <hi>Venetian,</hi> had taken <hi>Constantinople,</hi> though the Empire returned to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Grecians, yet through many and various chances which happened after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
whole <hi>Greece</hi> was divided; some of them following the Princes of the
Grecian extract, and some of them the Latins, the people for the most part hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the former, and the Nobility with the latter. So as recourse being had
to Arms, for the deciding of so many controversies, they applied themselves for
help unto the Turks, and causing a great number of them to pass over into <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tolia</hi>
in <hi>Greece, Greeces</hi> ultimate ruine did ensue thereupon. For these Barbarians, who
were accustomed to live among craggy Mountains, inamored of the beauty and
pleasantness of this Country, and moved, as some say, by a certain good augurie,
whereby they were advised to tarry there, promising them much happiness in that
Region, whereinto they were come, and called, they possest themselves of divers
parts and Cities of the Empire, sparing no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> friends, nor enemies; and placing
their Regal Seat amongst them, they grew soon much more powerful, being favored
therein by the great dissentions which still continued amongst the Grecian Nobility,
and other neighboring Lords, as those of <hi>Servia, Bulgaria,</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
themselves therein, they, together with their own interests, drew along with
them the destruction of many other States, and gave just occasion to postery, for
ever to blame their ill taken counsels. For if the Grecians had been at unity
within themselves, and as solicitous to keep the Turks from advancing their power,
as they were to abase that of the Latin Princes, they might certainly have hoped
to have kept that fire a far off, which hath burnt and consumed so many noble
parts of Christendom. Since it is seen that the Grecian Forces, whilst their Lords,
after being driven from the City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the Latins, kept in the parts
about <hi>Natolia</hi> (which was for above fifty years) although they had already begun to
be governed by one alone Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, under a just form of Empire, were yet able to keep
them bounded within the mountains of <hi>Natolia,</hi> in barren places, not suffering them
to make any acquisitions of moment, nor to enter into <hi>Europe,</hi> as they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
But it was the particular imperfection of this Province, and of that
in all other respects, most noble Nation, that she understood not, or knew not
how to make use of her many and valiant Forces; Since if we will look back upon
antient stories, when <hi>Philip</hi> had reduced <hi>Greece</hi> into his power, he put so high an
esteem upon the value of those Soldiers as he undertook by them chiefly to effect
his antient desire of making the enterprize of <hi>Persia,</hi> whch not being able (as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by death) to effect, was after so gloriously ended by his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59987:64"/>
And it is related, that being thus minded, <hi>Philip</hi> had already mustered Two
hundred thousand Foot, and Fifteen thousand Horse in <hi>Greece;</hi> and that <hi>Alexander</hi>
desirous to prosecute his Fathers intentions, but by different advice, building his
chiefest hopes in the body of an Army of but Thirty thousand valiant Soldiers,
many of which he raised in <hi>Greece,</hi> did by their valor chiefly end so many glorious

               <head>The Fifteenth DISCOURSE.</head>
               <head type="sub">Whether Ostracism, used by the Athenians, be a just thing, or no;
and whether it be useful for the preservation of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</head>
               <p>IT was instituted by the Laws in some antient Commonwealths, that such as
were very eminent above the rest either for Riches, Glory, Friends, or for
any other Civil power, or who did exceed the other Citizens for any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
worth, should be banished the City; not out of punishment or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
but for the common good, to the end that Equality being the better
maintained, and as it were a certain Consonancie amongst the several ranks of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
observed, the Government might be the safer, and more durable. Which
custom was for a long time observed by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and chiefly then when their
Commonwealth did flourish most; and ten years was the limited time for this exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This Law was commonly called Ostracism, whereof <hi>Aristotle</hi> toucheth a
little in his Third Book of the <hi>Politicks.</hi> But whether such a Law be just, or no, and
whether it may make for the preservation of a Commonwealth or State, for which
end it was instituted, is a Consideration of no small moment in point of Police;
there being much to be said on both sides, both in praise and dispraise of so strange
a Law and Custom.</p>
               <p>In the behalf thereof, these things may be had into consideration: That nothing
is more requisite for the long preservation of a City, especially of such a one as is
governed in form of a Commonwealth, where the Government is in the hands of
many, then Equality amongst Citizens; whereof the more excellent the temper is,
and the more it is tied fast by strict Laws, so as it cannot be exceeded on any side,
the life of that City or Commonwealth will be so much the longer, more quiet, and
more secure. A City may be resembled to a humane Body, compounded of divers
Elements, and consisting of many Members: and that as that humane Body is more
healthful and more handsom, wherein every elementary quality is better distributed,
and every member better proportioned; so that City or Commonwealth wherein
every degree of Citizens hath a moderate authority, state and fortune, and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the whole, doth preserve it self the longer, and keep freer from the
contagion of civil seditions. Though the Head be the noblest part of the Body, and
the Eyes the like of the Head, yet would they not be of ornament, when either that
or these were bigger then their ordinary and natural form; they would rather take
away all Decorum and beauty, which is nothing but a due proportion in all things.
Then, though it may seem a gallant thing to shew the greatness and nobleness of a
City or Commonwealth that there be many very wealthy men therein, and of
excellent civil gifts, and that the supreme Degrees and Negotiations of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
be bestowed upon these; yet another reason may perswade the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for this eminencie spoils the proportion of the whole, and doth not represent a City
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59987:64"/>
of Free-men, and partakers of the same Government, but the form of a Tyrannical
Government, consisting of Lords and Servants, hateful names in good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Therefore all the best Legislators have chiefly aimed at the reducing of all
things, as much as may be, to an Equality, in that City where they would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Politick Government, and a peaceful and durable condition. Insomuch as
<hi>Plato,</hi> to take away all occasion of civil discord, would have all goods to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
in that his Commonwealth which he propounded to himself for the most
exact form of Government: So as there should be no such name as Rich, or Poor,
but only that of Citizens of the same Country, and who live under the same Law.
So as no man could out-doe another, by altering this so necessary and useful Civil
Equality: which not being to be had where there is a Propriety of Goods, the
<hi>Athenians</hi> would provide against those inconveniences which the unequal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Citizens produced, by driving at a certain time out of the City such as
had caused the disorder, and who were suspected to be the Authors of Novelties,
and of trouble to peaceful living.</p>
               <p>And truly, he who shall consider what the beginnings of those evils have been,
which have inwardly vex'd and troubled both Commonwealths and other States
as well in antient, as in these more modern times, shall find, that all the confusions
and civil disorders which have after a long time brought many States to their ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ruine, have sprung from this root. How was partiality, and the corruption
of good and antient Orders introduced in the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> whence all
great things may take example, if not from having suffered avarice, and the power
of some Citizens to increase too much? Who having made themselves so great by
the continuation of military Commands, and for having many ways whereby to
purchase popular favor, as the Commonwealth could not keep them within any
bounds, nor could the Laws curb them, did totally subvert that Government: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as it was said of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he would not have any Superior to him in the
City; and of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that he would have no Equal. And <hi>Cato</hi> had wont to say,
that <hi>Caesars</hi> immoderate greatness had enforc'd <hi>Pompey</hi> likewise to exalt himself
above what otherwise became the publick service, to the end that the one might
counterpoise the other. So grant one inconve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ience, others will easily follow:
And as too great eminencie in any Citizen, although he be not ill-minded towards
the Publick, ought to be suspected; so it is hard to rid ones self thereof when it is
once brought in and tolerated, where those usual means and institutions are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had, without falling upon violent courses, which in
stead of Physick proves poison to that State. The House of <hi>Medici</hi> began to lay
sound foundations for its greatness in <hi>Florence,</hi> by means of old <hi>Cosmo's</hi> great
wealth; it afterwards increased very much by the vertue and wisdom of <hi>Lorenzo;</hi>
and so by little and little getting to a great height of power, which exceeded the
ordinary condition of a Civil State, it was no longer able to live under the Laws
of the Country, but would assume unto it self the superiority of that Government:
So as when the <hi>Florentines</hi> were too late aware thereof, they could not moderate
that too immease greatness; for the continued power of that Family, wherein there
had been excellent men for worth, and eminent degrees and dignities, purchased
by them both in their own Country, and elswhere, had got them so many to side
partially with them, as their own Faction was able upon any occasion to sustain them.</p>
               <p>The like happens also in some States wherein there is not so express a form of a
Commonwealth, but a supreme Prince, yet also many particular Lords of great
authority. In such States, the too much greatness of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rons hath oft-times proved
too pernicious: For there being in all men naturally a desire of growing greater,
and they having means to do so, where their power is not limited by the Laws and
Customs of the State, they are easily induced to mount higher then stands with their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59987:65"/>
degree, to equal their authority to that of the King himself, and to put for inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
prejudicial to the State. Amongst many others we have a notable example
hereof, in the present troubles of <hi>France,</hi> which were occasioned by having suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some prime Lords to grow too great in power, whence civil discords have risen
in the Kingdom, and the better to foment and sustain their parties, and to perfect
their designs, they had recourse to forein forces, and kindled that fire which is not
well quenched yet. It hath therefore been thought a very wary and well advised
course which hath been used by some Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this may be done by any ordinary way, as by Law and Custom (as it was among
the <hi>Athenians</hi> and other antient people) then this remedie proved the more just and
secure. There is not any mischief in the City which stands in more need to be
cured by the physick of the Law, then Ambition; for Ambition is such a sickness
in the mind of man, as where once it takes root it never leaves the mind free and
healthful till it be torn out by main force; but rather the maladie increasing by

that remains of this fire, though it be covered over with ashes, may cause great
Combustions. It seems therefore that no other remedy is sufficient for those
evils which proceed from pride and ambition, then totally to rid the City or State of
such men as are desirous to exceed all others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> said, that men who were truly wise would be as contented with not ruling
over others, as most men do what in them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

over others. Therefore where such a desire is discerned, and where there is matter
to occasion it, as are great riches, high places, and vain glory, a man may with reason
suppose that there is there an unsound soul, which ought to be taken away lest it
infect the whole Commonwealth. To take all Nobility, all riches, all civil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminencie,
totally away from a City or Commonwealth, as is now done in Turky,
and as formerly it hath been d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e by divers Princes, that they might rule the more
securely, relisheth too much of Barbarism, and Tyranny, though it hath not proved
an ill taken advice to them that have known how to use it, reputing it just, though not
in self, yet as it hath suited well with such a Form of Government; but to rid a City
of such things, and of such men for a certain prefixt time, is such a provision as
tends to the preservation of splendor and reputation, without either prejudice or
danger. This is a means whereby vertue and other civil preheminences may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded;
but not so, as the greater part be scorned, and opprest, for the haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of some few. And he who shall well consider it, shall find that banishment
from a mans Country is not a thing simply, and of it self evil, or at least not so
great an evil, but that it may be easily and willingly born withall, by him who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
the common good so well as he ought. But that which makes banishment be
thought a mischief, is the bad quality which is thereunto annexed, when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for punishment; there being thereby imprinted as it were in indeleble cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
that such a one is leudly given, and hath committed some fault, which is
a thing naturally abhorred even by the wickedest sort of men. But set this respect
aside, to live out of a mans Countrie, hath no resemblance of evil, but is willingly
imbraced by many as an advantage, and some endeavor it as a badg of honor, that
they may have occasion to serve their Prince, and to deserve well abroad. He
then, who to obey the Laws and Ordinations of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

as he merits thereby; for he may say that by this his obedience he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to his Prince and Country; though he do not act any thing. So then he
receives no injury, and may, and ought to pass by any particular inconveniency,
for the publick good. Nay it may so happen, that that very power and great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

For we see by experience, that these greatnesses and continued prosperities do easily
precipitate a man, either through the envy of others, or by being too immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used, and sometimes draw along with them the total ruine of the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>It may in the last place be alleadged, that this exemption from publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Court service, may make him retire to his private studies, and enjoy
himself, which ought to be esteemed one of the chiefest blessings which man can
attain unto in this life. Insomuch as the Philosopher said, that to be kept from
preferments is a pleasant breath of wind which sweetly co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Haven of peace of mind, and of his lawful studies, which many forbear to do

and to be praised, and that this custom of the <hi>Athenians</hi> is fit to be followed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

But now let us face about. What is more necessary for the preservation of a City
or State then Justice, without which no sort of Government can last long, nor
merit the name of a Commonwealth or State: For, take away Justice, and you
take away the very being thereof, and leave nothing but a mis-shapen matter, made
up of corruption and disorders. But in distributive Justice, which imports so much
towards good and quiet living, Reason doth advise it, and all good Customs do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of it, that a Geometrical proportion, not an Arithmetical ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
insomuch as it is not all men who ought equally and indifferently to share
of Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and endowments do deserve them. Therefore that Government where the Law
of Ostracism is observed, must needs be subject to all change and revolts: For it
cannot but be displeasing to the chiefest and best of the City, who seeing themselves
whilst they are present, threatned with exile, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and having recourse when they are absent to the favors of other Princes to revenge
themselves for the injury they have received, may easily disturb the Peace of the
City, and put the whole Government into a hazardous condition. Those who have
been driven out of their Country by reason of any Civil faction, as it fell out long
ago in divers Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> have always been instrumental to the keeping of those
Cities in perpetual troubles, and of reducing some of them to slavery, which had
wont to enjoy liberty. And yet what was this banishment but a kind of Ostracism?
For in these civil seditions, none but such as were of greatest power and authority,
and of whom the rest were most jealous, were driven out: Nor was this done by
the will of one only, but by their Decree in whose hands the reformed Government
was. So as it may be said, that these Cities used the Law of Ostracism; which hath
notwithstanding always proved prejudicial, and at long running mortal. And to
say truth, to what purpose could such a Law or Custom serve, unless it were the
more to exasperate Civil diffention? Which the same <hi>Athenians</hi> having learn'd

Nor is it true, that the power of Citizens, or greatness of Barons in a Kingdom,

whosoever should go about to take totally away from a City, would
ruine it, not bring it to perfection. Therefore the Law ought to provide for taking
away the abuse of things, not the things themselves, when they are not simply and
in themselves evil. And if the Authority which the Roman Commanders held in
their Armies had been well regulated, and their continuing is their military Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
moderated by a shorter time, <hi>Caesar</hi> could not have made use thereof as he
did to the prejudice of the Commonwealth, he having continued so many years
Commander in chief of the same Army, and in the same Province. Nor had they
needed to have raised <hi>Pompey</hi> to such a height, to oppose <hi>Caesars</hi> greatness: But when

If he be great and remarkable for glorious actions done by him, give him hard and

City or State; their friends or kindred, may be kept low and humble, whereby
their power is lessened; if they commit any excess in case of Justice, as such men
out of arrogancie often do, be severe unto them, take their priviledges from them,
declare them to be for a certain time uncapable of any Publick imployment, and do
some other such like things; which being done, upon some just occasion, although
the parties concerned be therewithall displeased, yet not being disliked by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality,
their hatching of mischievous plots against the present Government and
Weal publick, will have less fewel to feed upon.</p>
               <p>But what shall be said of him, whose worth and vertue doth exceed that of all
others? by what pretence can a just Prince, or a well-governed Commonwealth
humble such a man, or keep him low, or aloof from partaking of their Councels?
To this it may be answered, that if this supposed personage be endowed with
true vertue, he will not be subject to any suspition, nor will it be imagined that he
will do any foul or wicked thing which may be prejudicial to his Prince or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;
but that all his endeavors shall aim at the common good, and it is just and
convenient that such a man should alwaies bear sway in every well-ordered Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
But if the vertues which render him so great and eminent, tend to
policie, that is, when a man does that which is good and honest, having his mind
bent upon some other object then meer worth and honesty, as most men use to do,
out of hopes of glory, or of bettering themselves; which things notwithstanding

not being Mistress of larger Territories, be attributed to any defect in this behalf;
but many other things are to be taken into consideration, whereby the truest causes
of such effects, which amidst the uncertainty of such like affairs can be found out,
may be discovered by looking into.</p>
               <p>To know then whence such a diversity proceeds, we must take the business a
little higher, and examine, First, what was the original beginning of these two
Cities, <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice;</hi> what their Founders were; and then what their situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what the inclinations, studies, and vertues of their Citizens; and lastly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of times, and qualities of their neighboring Princes must be examined. All
which things appertain to this Consideration, as well as the Orders of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and their Form of Government. He then who shall look upon the first
Founders of these two Cities, willfind them, even in these the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r first beginnings,
not a little differing: which occasioned differing intentions, and differing ends; and
therefore peradventure a differing state, and differing condition. The first Erectors
of <hi>Venice,</hi> where men who were peacefully given, as those who having been wearied
by the so many calamities of <hi>Italy,</hi> occasioned by the inundation of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
had withdrawn themselves, that they might shun the danger of War, into that piece
of marish ground in the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, which was then greater then now it is, and
the chiefest of many small Islands, which by a common name were called <hi>Venetiae.</hi>
So as they lived for a while without any Orders either Military or Civil; those
first Inhabitants contenting themselves to live in peace and quiet, without dreaming
of any greater matter: For it neither stood with the end which they propounded
unto themselves in this their new abode so to do, nor did the condition of those
times permit it: And they were so fenced from the Arm sof Enemies as then, both
by the natural condition of their situation, as also by the salt waters, as they needed
not to arm themselves for their own defence. Therefore their Citizens being by
long custom inured to these thoughts, they had no thought of taking up Arms,
though the City were already much increased both in Forces and Authority, unless
when they were provoked, and more to keep themselves from being injured by
others, or to assist their Friends and Confederates, then out of ambition of Rule,
and of enlarging their bounds. And he who shall consider what their greatest and
and most difficult enterprises were in those first times, will see they aimed all at this
end. The <hi>Venetians</hi> fought first with the <hi>French,</hi> and afterwards against the <hi>Huns,</hi>
in defence of their Country, and of their Liberties; and long after with the <hi>Genoeses,</hi>
enforced thereunto by necessity, and provoked by many grievous injuries: For
this very valiant and generous Nation would not rest quiet, out of an emulation of
glory in Sea-affairs; wherein though they were oftentimes worsted by the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59987:68"/>
yet they still found occasion of new Contests. The Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi>
hath oft-times taken up Arms likewise, in times neerer this our Age, with greater
preparation for War, and with more courage to defend their State in <hi>Terta firm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

which they had already gotten with much ado, and whereof they were justly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed;
insomuch as they have sometimes valian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But it becomes not the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th of a <hi>Venetian</hi> to say how oft they have taken up
Arms in defence of their Friends and Confederates, lest he may seem to upbraid
others with the services his Countrymen have done them. But divers People and
Cities assisted and preserved by their Forces, do witness this. And to speak only
of things of more recent memory, how great a desire hath this Commonwealth
shewn to the common good? and to this purpose how careful hath she been of the
liberty and glory of <hi>Italy,</hi> in sustaining long and heavy War, to preserve the noble
<hi>Neapolitan</hi> Territories in the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, and the like of <hi>Milan?</hi> But he who
will look further back, and see what they have done, will find that the <hi>Venetians</hi>
have undertaken and finished famous enterprises out of zeal to Religion; as they
did in the Wars of the Holy Land against the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and divers other times
against other Princes, to preserve and increase the glory of the holy Church, and the
Papal dignity: which amongst many other actions, is cleerly and nobly witnessed
by the famous Naval victory won from the Emperor <hi>Frederick Barb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rossa;</hi> for the
which <hi>Venice</hi> doth at this day enjoy many great priviledges, in witness of her great
worth and singular merit. But it is needless now to particularize in those things
whereof all Histories are full: It will suffice to touch upon some things, whereby
it may be conceived what the first beginnings of the City were, and what were the
intentions and end of her Citizens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Romes</hi> ends were far different from these, who from her very beginning aimed
only at Empire and greatness; being built by <hi>Romalus,</hi> a fierce and ambitious man,
who not content to have recovered his Kingdom to his Grandfather <hi>Numiter,</hi> and
opened the way to the Lordship of <hi>Alba longa,</hi> resolved by the assistance of a
great many young men who followed him, to purchase a better fortune and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for himself, and to build a new City, which must have a warlike institution
to keep the minds of those stirring youth busied in military exercises, and to defend
himself from his neighbors; who finding that the new City aimed at greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
thought to keep is low. <hi>Romulus</hi> might with reason promise himself to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
more Dominion, and to enlarge his Confines; for he built his City in a
Country which was possest by many people, who were weak, and at odds within
themselves, so as he needed not fear any potent Prince who might oppose his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
or suppress his Forces before they were somewhat better established. This
was the first foundation of <hi>Romes</hi> greatness; for the City beginning soon to habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
herself to military discipline, and to turn her thoughts upon War, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandising
her State, she grew so confirm'd therein with time, and with continual
military orders, as the Militia and all things thereunto tending did continually
flour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sh in her. For those that came after, following (as it falls out for the most part)
the example of their Predecessors, her Citizens were always desirous of warlike
glory, and of Empire; proving to be like <hi>Romulus,</hi> and those other valiant men
from whom they had their beginning and increase. Thus they always made one
War beget another, not being able to endure the suspected power of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
nor yet the injuries done unto them by their Friends and Confederates; under
which two pretences they made first many notable acquisitions in <hi>Italy,</hi> and
afterwards (passing over the Sea) in <hi>Africa,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in many other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
               <p>But to pass on now to another Consideration, let us affirm that the situation is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59987:69"/>
of great moment for the Rule and Dominion which one City is to have over an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as that which affords security for self defence, and opportunity to subjugate
others; this helps likewise to make a City plentiful and wealthy, without which
States are hardly acquired. For where there is scarcity of livelihood, povertie is
more to be fought withall then Enemies, and want of wealth renders a City alwaies
weak, and easie to be wasted and opprest. Hence it was that <hi>Sparta,</hi> though she
had excellent Laws and Institutions, yet whilst she observed them, she could not
much inlarge her Dominions; for by them the City was bound for what concerned
both the private and publick condition, to be kept poor, and far from any commerce
with others; and in our time the Cantons of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> though they be a very
valiant Generation, yet being poor, and seated amongst Mountains, and for the
most part in barren places, their Soldiers being fighting under the pay of other
Princes, they have not been able to do any thing for themselves, or to make any
acquisitions, but have onely preserved their Liberties.</p>
               <p>If we shall then consider the situation of <hi>Venice,</hi> we shall certainly find it very
opportune for most things, and miraculously well for some things. For if we have
respect to safety; what City can be compared to this, which without any Bulwarks
of Walls, or Garrisons of Soldiers, defended by her natural scituation, is of her
self safe from all injuries, and inexpugnable? So as she is the onely example after
so many Ages of being untoucht by the Barbarians violence. If we respect abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of plenty and wealth, the accommodation that the Sea affords her, and the
so many Rivers which disgorge themselves, either into the neighboring Sea, or
into sher own Gulf, are such and so many, both for the conveyance of victuals, and
of merchandize, as it is no wonder that so great a multitude of people can live in
her with such abundance of all things, and not onely her own Citizens, but even
foreiners who inhabit there, grow rich therein. But as for Empire and command,
as she is miraculously accommodated for the imployment of Forces in Sea enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
so for what belongs to the like on land, she hath not those conveniencies
which peradventure are requisite. Therefore it was long ere she bethought her self
of purchasing any Territories in <hi>Terra firm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> minding onely Dominion at Sea,
whereunto she was invited by her scitua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>on, and by the institution of her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
touching which it is worthy consideration, that the Sea Militia and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
upon which the Commonwealth was for a long time bent, are not such as
can naturally give occasion of great command, because their Fleets cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
penetrate further then the Rivers which fall into the Sea; wherefore all her
acquisitions were onely Islands, or places on the Sea shore, because she had not
then numerous and well disciplined Armies to dive into the hearts of Dominions,
and to pursue victories.</p>
               <p>All Cities which have placed the pitch of their power in their Fleets, have had
the like success. For though they may have purchased some reputation, and some
precedencie by Sea, yet have they not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en able much to inlarge the Confines of
their command. Thus the <hi>Athenians</hi> and other people of <hi>Greece,</hi> though they
were very strong in these kind of Forces, proper to that Nation from whence the
art of building of Ships, and of Navigation is thought to have its original, yet
have they alwaies been esteemed weak, and but little valued by such Nations, which
they could not by their Forces make subject to their Dominions. But the City of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which studied more the Militia by Land, then by Sea, and built her
greatness more by Armies then by Fleets, having more field-room wherei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to exercise her Citizens valo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, made much greater enterprizes, and made many
Provinces subject to her Dominion. Not did the Romans make use of Fleets
by Sea before they were necessitated, that they might sail into <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
to oppose the power of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which they had reason
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59987:69"/>
to be jealous of, by reason of their too great power, and vicinity</p>
               <p>But when they had occasion to make use of their Soldiers by Sea, they shewed
no less forwardness and daring therein, then they had done by land: Insomuch as
the skill and experience of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had long been Masters at Sea,
was oft-times overcome and deluded by the valor and military Discipline of the
Romans; till at last that Nation which was held to be so powerful at Sea, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
and beaten by the Romans, who had a long time been unexperienced in
Maritime Affairs, but very expert in Land-Armies, and Military Discipline. So
as the Empire of the World being contested for by these two Commonwealths, it
was seen that it more availed the <hi>Romans</hi> to be a little superior to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
by Land, then it did the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to exceed the <hi>Romans</hi> much by Sea. For
the good Orders of their Armies, the valor and discipline of their Soldiers, got them
the victorie over the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and opened the way to the Monarchie of the
World; which had sundry times before been done by the same means, by the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Persians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians;</hi> Land-Forces having alwaies in great acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
prevailed over those of the Sea, and the Discpline of Armies over the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of Maritime Affairs. This is likewise more clearly seen by reason of the
new Monarchie founded in a short time by the Turks in <hi>Asia,</hi> and in <hi>Greece,</hi> which
was not done by Sea-Forces, wherein they were not any waies considerable, till
of later times, but by the multitude of their Cavalrie, and more by the firm
ranks of their <hi>Ianizaries.</hi> And to say truth, the very Forces by Sea are increased
and maintained by those of Land, for larger Territories do easily furnish men,
moneys, victuals, and other necessaries for the well ordering of Fleets at Sea. The
which is likewise known by experience of the very Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi>
which before she had got any State in <hi>Terra firma,</hi> could never make so numerous
Fleets, though she did very much study Maritime Affairs; nor could she prevail in
the important Wars against the <hi>Geno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ses,</hi> as she did afterwards, when her power
was much increased and confirmed by her Land Territories. Thus in this last<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Age,
she hath been able to set forth at first above a Hundred nimble Galleys, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
more Galleys, and greater vessels of all sorts, as hath been seen by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the two last Wars against the Turks, wherein nothing more gallant and
glorious could be desired on the Commonwealths behalf; whereupon also, as the
worthy and becoming fruit of such industry did the Victorie of <hi>Lepanto</hi> ensue,
which will be memorable in all Ages. And it may suffice to know what the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Forces of the Commonwealth are, and how they are abundantly supplied
from Land with all things to make them powerful at Sea, yea, even then when
the Sea was blocked up for what concerned them; that they were able to maintain
so great a Fleet in all seasons, for three years together. Wherefore <hi>Francisco Fos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> a Prince of singular wisdom, by whose advice, and under
whose happy auspices, great acquisitions were made on firm land, was wont to
say, that the Commonwealth could not have increased much in power, if she
had not imployed her Forces on land enterprizes; which because she had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
formerly done, was the cause why that greatness was much retarded and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
whereunto she might easily have arrived if such counsel had been soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
taken; and by setting before her the example of the worth and glory of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> she might have aspired to greater Empire. But those who governed
the Commonwealth were a long time far from any such thoughts; being more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon peace and quiet, or upon such Wars as might inlarge and secure her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
by Sea; which may be clearly witnessed by what past with <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es; whereby it is seen that the <hi>Venetians</hi> being contented with defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their friends, and vindicating their own injuries, dreamed not on their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59987:70"/>
of which they might easily have berest them; till when overcome by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and by the insolencie of the <hi>Carraesi,</hi> and by other accidents of those times,
they were compell'd to apply their minds and Forces thereunto, and to fix their
Dominion there.</p>
               <p>Let us consider on the contrary, how opportunely <hi>Rome</hi> was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ent
her Citizens dispositions much to augment her Dominions, almost in the midst of
<hi>Italy,</hi> just sitting for a principal City, being placed (as may be said) in the Center, to
the end that she may equally extend her Power and Forces on all sides. The City
of <hi>Rome</hi> stands on firm land, or <hi>Terra firm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> but so neer the Sea, as she may reap
the commodity thereof, without being thereby endangered: she is apt to breed up
Armies, and to nourish men in the exercise of the Militia; not is she inconveniently
seated for the transportation of her Forces by Sea into other far off Provinces.
This diversity of situation hath begot diversity of inclinations in the Inhabitants.
Thus doth Nature always adapt mens minds to those Arts which they are to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
themselves in, or else Custom doth inform the Habit, and turns it into Nature.
For as the <hi>Romans</hi> following exercises conformable to the situation of their City,
were more inclined to Land-war, and in Peace to husbandry: So the <hi>Venetians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to other things according to the diversity of place, applied their studies other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to defend their Liberty, and to increase their wealth, using the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Militia for
the one, and Traffick and Merchandising for the other. Which whosoever shall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
our Citizens withall, seems, not to know, that without these a City could
neither have long preserved it self, nor increase in state and wealth, as it hath done:
For not having any particular Territories whereout to extract their livelihood,
she would have been always poor and weak, and wanting other imployments, she
would have been destroyed, if not by forein Forces, by her own Idleness, as many
other Cities have been, the Citizens wanting wherein to imploy their thoughts,
and to exercise themselves in quiet times. But if the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> were much
commended for their husbandry, insomuch as of this day many famous men of that

divers other Princes become very powerful both in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Wherefore they met with many difficulties, and amongst the test the Wars proved
very heavy unto them, which they were forc'd to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:59987:71"/>
did not joyn against them, because they saw that if that Dukes State fell into the
power of the Venetian Commonwealth, the way would be laid open to her for
much greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> matters in <hi>Italy;</hi> whereupon a noble Victorie which was already almost
gotten, was impeded.</p>
               <p>Hereby it may be then conceived how much the condition of the times was
averse to the Commonwealths inlarging her Precincts by Land, partly by reason of
her self, and partly through other various accidents; which though they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more favorable unto her in what concerned the Sea, yet met she not with
small interruptions therein to her enterprises. For the Eastern Emperors being
Masters of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of other States and Countries, wherein the Commonwealth
was to have inlarged the Confines of her command by Sea, she could not make any
great acquisitions whilst they preserved themselves in such reputation and strength,
as became their State. But afterwards, when that Empire began to decline, she
began to increase and flourish gloriously, and her worth was waited upon by much
prosperitie; as was seen when the <hi>Venetians</hi> went in companie of the <hi>French</hi> to
the business of the <hi>Levant,</hi> and after many noble warlike actions they took the
City and Empire of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> of which acquisition the Commonwealth had
so great a share, as that their Dukes did then assume the title of <hi>Signoridella quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
parte, é Mezza, di tutto L' Imperio della Romania.</hi> And soon after with the like
prosperous success, they did by sundry means reduce many Islands, and chief
Maritime Towns under their obedience; and the Commonwealth marched on
apace to greater power and command. But this course of glorie and victorie by
War was much slackened by the original Customs and Orders of the City (as
has been said) which related more to Peace, and Merchant affairs, then to
War.</p>
               <p>Insomuch as the <hi>Venetians</hi> seemed for a while to make use of these new acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
rather for the better accomodation of their Navigation, and Traffick, then
for any occasion of other enterprises, Their business did therefore infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increase at this time; insomuch as there was not any City famous for
merchandizing in the <hi>Levant,</hi> whither the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ships and Merchants did not
flock. Nay, a great number of men of that Nation did usually remain in those Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
through whose hands the most precious Merchandise of those Countries past,
to the great advantage of the City, and of her private Citizens. So as the <hi>Genoeses</hi>
plying the same places, at first a certain rivalship and emulation arose amongst them,
as well for the profit of merchandizing, as for the expertness, and glory of Sea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
till at last they came to open and cruel War: which kept the Commonwealth
so busied, and perplexed by disturbing Navigation, and even private affairs,
as for a long while they had no leasure to undertake other enterprises, though they
had met with opportuity for it, and that they had been thereunto disposed. For the
<hi>Venetians</hi> having sundry times hazarded their Fleets upon the doubtful event of
Battel, they tasted both prosperous and adverse fortune; insomuch as they were
to fight in their own Gulf, not more for Empire, then for the safety of the
City.</p>
               <p>Thus whilst the Commonwealth spent her best years, partly in these private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and merchandizing business, partly in the so long and troublesome Wars
against, the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> another Power arose in the <hi>Levant,</hi> much greater, and
more formidable then was the Grecian Empire. For the <hi>Ottaman</hi> Lords, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by divers accidents, but chiefly by reason of the discords among Christians,
to make notable and successful progress in their rising Empire, grew quickly very
great and powerful not onely by Land, but also by Sea, having reduced the City
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> into their hands, a very fit place for Sea enterprises, whereby
the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> was not onely bereft of all hopes of further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59987:71"/>
their Dominion by Sea, having so great and powerful an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nemy to near
at hand, but even what they had already got, was exposed to hazard; so as being
to maintain a bitter and difficult War, and to manage it with unequal Forces
against this their sore and perpetual adversarie, she had more reason to think
upon her own defence, then by force of Arms to win what belonged to others.</p>
               <p>Let us in the next place consider the conditions of the nearest neighboring
people amongst which she was to inlarge her Confines, whereby we may also
know what difficulties the Commonwealth met with; for at the very first she was
to overcome the <hi>Dalmatians,</hi> a Nation not onely very valiant, but of a quick wit,
given to sedition, and desirous of novelties. Whence how great her difficulties
were in quelling these, may be conceived by this, that the Commonwealth of
<hi>Rome</hi> having so many, and so far distant Nations, yet could she never handsomely
put the yoke upon <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which never was under the Roman Empire until the
time of <hi>Qctavius Augustus,</hi> but had still before notably indamaged the Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
It is then no wonder that the state of a Commonwealth should be less, which
had to contend with such Enemies; and who may not know by the actions of this
Commonwealth, that she rather wanted occasion then worth for the further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
her State and fortune?</p>
               <p>Let us now likewise consider the condition of the times wherein the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Rome</hi> had her happy beginnings, and made the first progress to her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
Which we shall find to differ much, and to be free of the so many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which the <hi>Venetians</hi> met with. <hi>Rome</hi> had not at her first rise any power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
neighboring Prince; for the <hi>Assyrians</hi> had then the Monarchie, whose confines
did not extend beyond <hi>Asia;</hi> and after the concourse of many years it was carried
by <hi>Cyrus</hi> amongst the <hi>Persians,</hi> with whom it remained for about Two hundred
years, till it was destroyed by <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who though he made
greater conquests, and made his Forces be felt and dreaded much further off, yet
dying young in the height of his Victories, he could not get into <hi>Europe,</hi> nor afford
the Romans occasion of making trial of their Forces with a powerful and valiant
Prince. And by his death (he having left no issue, either legitimate or illegitimate
behind him) that Monarchie was soon destroyed, and his Empire was divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his chief Commanders; so as several Kingdoms were thereout framed,
with which severally the <hi>Romans</hi> did afterwards much to their advantage make
War. So as <hi>Asia</hi> having then been the chiefest Seat of the Empire, the Provinces
of <hi>Europe</hi> were not at that time any waies annoied by the power thereof; and those
that were further from thence, as was <hi>Italy,</hi> less then the rest. But <hi>Greece</hi> which
was then in high esteem for the excellencie of her Inhabitants genius, for what
concerned both Civil and Military vertues, was divided into many several People<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
who contending within themselves for the dignitie both of the soveraigntie
of that very Province, it so fell out that aspiring either wholly or chiefly thereat,
they minded not the annoying of other Nations by their Forces. In <hi>Africa</hi> the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> were very strong, the power of <hi>Carthage</hi> being almost at the same
times as much increased, as was the like of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> So as she had the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of many provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> and did possess the greatest part of <hi>Spain:</hi>
but this power did not any waies molest the <hi>Romans</hi> first designs, not did it
hinder them from making qcquisitions in <hi>Italy,</hi> not from confirming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
those Forces with which she afterwards did subdue the World. For the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> came not near the <hi>Romans</hi> for little less then Five hundred years,
till such time as both the Commonwealths inlarging their Confines, they grew
to be neighbors; Whereupon at last they commenced War, out of the envy and
jealousie that each <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of other. This was the condition and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of times
wherein the Commonwealth of <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whence it may be observed, that though there might be some great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

then, yet was there none which might compare with the Roman Emperors, who
had a greater Monarchy then all the rest; besides they were so far off, as their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
could not impede <hi>Romes</hi> increasing, though she were as yet but a new-begun
City. But she met with the like prosperous condition both of affairs and times, in
relation to her neerest neighbors: For <hi>Rome</hi> had not only not any great contestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with any powerlike Prince in her first and weakest beginning; but for the space
of three hundred and sixty years, till the first French war, she had no occasion of
making trial of her Forces against any powerful people; for then <hi>Italy</hi> was not only
not subject to any one Prince alone, who might be greater by other Forces and other
States, as it happened afterwards in the <hi>Venetians</hi> times, but being divided into
many parts, as well in respect of dominion, as of other separations, each Country
contained many people of differing government and power: So as <hi>Latium</hi> alone of
herself, which is now called <hi>Campagna di Roma,</hi> contained four Nations, or rather
Communalties, the <hi>Hernici, Latini, Volsci,</hi> and <hi>Equi;</hi> with whom the People of
<hi>Rome</hi> did for a long time make war. I mention not the <hi>Cecinensi,</hi> the <hi>Crustumeni,
Antinati, Sabini, Albani,</hi> and other Nations of less esteem, against which in her
beginning she exercised her Forces, whilst she learned (as a man may say) the first
rudiments of her Militia. <hi>Tuscany,</hi> though being taken all together she were very
powerful, and whose Confines were then much larger, yet was she divided into so
many Signories or Lordships, as the Forces of every People apart by themselves
must needs be weak and of small moment: which may easily be known by this,
that bare Three hundred men of the Family of the <hi>Fabli</hi> were able to wage War
with the <hi>Veienti,</hi> who were the chief of that Region, with whom they oft times
fought with display'd Banners, and with dubious event, and were at last supprest
more by the fraud, then force of their Enemies. So likewise the other parts of <hi>Italy</hi>
which were neerer <hi>Rome</hi> were so weakly inhabited, as it is not much, that a new
City, but yet well instructed in weapons, might get unto herself State and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
Nay, he who shall consider what the increase of that Commonwealth was
from time to time, will wonder how that People, who got afterwards the dominion
of the whole World, was so late in enlarging the Confines of her Territories upon
her Neighbors, when they were to contend in War with those that were weaker
then they, and that the bounds of their Empire did extend to beyond <hi>Italy.</hi> For,
for above the space of four hundred years, when the City was so much increased in
Citizens, as she raised Armies of Forty thousand Foot, besides Horse, the affairs of
<hi>Rome</hi> were notwithstanding in such condition, as they made War even under the
Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> with the <hi>Equi, Volsci,</hi> and <hi>Veientes,</hi> her first Enemies. And this
wonder is not a little increased, when you shall consider that Military discipline did
flourish even from the very first in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ever afterwards held in great
esteem by her Citizens, who were bent with all their might to augment the power
of their City, not being content, as were the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to enjoy peace and security.
Wherefore the <hi>Romans</hi> gave easily way for friendship to all Foreiners, that they
might by the multitude of their Citizens render their City more powerful, and
fitter to worst Adversaries: And their first King <hi>Romulus</hi> set up a Sanctuary, where
all sorts of men, whether free or slaves, good or guilty, might have receptacle.
But that Commonwealth had also her imperfections, whereby being troubled with
perpetual civil discords, she found many impediments, and much difficulty in effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Citizens generous designs. But being gotten to a great height of power,
the Counterpoise of forein Forces ceasing by her own greatness, she was able for a
time to bear with her so many discorders, till at last she was brought to her final
ruine.</p>
               <p>We must now be permitted to take some other things into consideration which
appertain to particular order of this Commonwealth. A City which aspires unto
Empire, must above all things else be well provided of Arms, so as she want not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59987:72"/>
any thing that is requisite for War: but she stand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> no less in need of good Laws,
which are for many respects of great importance in all Governments; as also for
that when the licentiousness of Arms, intrusted in the hands of Citizens, is not
corrected by the authority of Law, that which was destin'd for the good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
thereof, it turns at last to her ruine. Therefore it is requisite that a City
be constituted with such Laws as may result both to safety from foreign Enemies,
and to union between her own Citizens; by which civil agreement the strength
and reputation of a Commonwealth is much increased. Of these two conditions
which ought to make a City powerful, and so as that power may continue long, the
Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> had the first in perfection, but was very faulty in the second:
On the contrary, excellent provision was made by the Founders of <hi>Venice</hi> for the
second, but much remains to be wish'd for in the former. Thus then had <hi>Rome</hi> a
naturally warlike people, which she kept continually exercised in Arms, observing
exactly Military discipline and orders: But she was much disorderly and confused
in Civil affairs, nor knew she how to keep any setled from of Government, leaving
too much authority in the People, and wanting usual means to suppress the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
power of Citizens. Whereas in <hi>Venice,</hi> the form and order of Civil
Government is in every particular well disposed of, and excellently well understood;
so as she is the only example which in so many Ages, and so many accidents both of
good and bad fortune, hath never been troubled with any important domestick
discords. But then, as for Military orders, they are not altogether such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for the acquiring of a large Command; for at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> beginning, she applied
herself (as hath been said) to maritime affairs, not with any intent of subjugating
other Cities and Nations, but rather (as the condition of those times and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
did require) for what concerned Traffick and Merchandising, to which the
preservation of Peace did much condu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therein, and raised so great an opinion of valor and military Discipline of himself,
as the Commonwealth did very soon put their chiefest hopes in him, in all their
weightiest affairs. In brief, people that are of a ready wit, and noble spirit, do easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accustom themselves by exercise to all things, and prove excellent therein; the
experience whereof hath been seen amongst our selves, for those few who have
betaken themselves to Land-service, have given such proof of their valor (which is
witnessed by particular Histories) as it may very well be known, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
might have promised unto her self all gallantries from her Citizens, if
she had known how to make use of them. But she was run into this error, because
she would (as the conjuncture of times did almost require) follow the example
of the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who long before, and chiefly at that time when the
Commonwealth did most apply her self to Land-affairs, made use of mercinary
Militia's, which was then heightned to a great esteem by two famous Commanders
of that Age, <hi>Braccio</hi> and <hi>Sforza,</hi> who were afterwards imitated by others in
this sort of Militia; Wherefore the Captain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> whose Troops did ordinarily consist
of horse, led them along to the service sometimes of one, sometimes of another
Prince. So the Venetians who were but learners in this sort of Militia, saw that

may be added hereunto, which hath already been touched upon, that the
Commonwealth having then put her self in a certain course, which she had for a
long time observed, of making use of her people and her Citizen in Sea-affairs, it
seemed dangerous to some to make such an innovation in a City ordained for civil
Government, and which was greatly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixt therein by long custom. But it is not to
be denied, but that when the aggrandizing of a State or Empire is in question, this
which hath been spoken of is a great fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lt in a City which doth aspire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>And it is to be observed in the Roman Monarchy that the happy success of their
famous victories is chiefly attributed, to the discipline of their Malitia, because it
was excellent, and because it was exercised by their own Soldiers; and particularly
in the <hi>Carthiginian</hi> W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

limited and corrected by the Laws, cannot be prejudicial to the publick good; and
the experience of the very City of <hi>Venice</hi> confirms this, where so great authoritie
being so often granted in commands at Sea to her own Citizens, yet it was never
known that the Commonwealth suffered any mischeif thereby, and certainly a
great mistery lies in the well disposed orders of a City, by which Citizens are
easily kept within their duties, wherein if any one chance to fail, he is soon chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
without any disturbance to the peace of the City. Which if by nothing else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is sufficiently proved in the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> by the long duration of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
So as these things were very well understood and ordained by her;
and she might the more easily do it, by reason of the conditions of those her first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
as hath been said. But such freedom and licentiousness was given in
<hi>Rome</hi> to that warlike people, together with the government of their Forces, as

of civil affairs.</p>
               <p>By all which considerations it is manifest, That the diversity of success in these
two Commonwealths, hath sprung from this diversity of institutions, and from
so many accidents, and not from any one reason, as was said at the beginning; but
in this diversity both of them have their praises, and all those perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Have often, not without some, to me appearing reason, wondred, that some

things, for which other Princes and States, have been by other Writers much ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated.
He who will know the truth of such judgements; must take unto himself
more particular, and inward considerations, for it often-times falls out, that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

did first appear, and the face of things do seem to alter. Such actions may then

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59987:74"/>
the condition of the poor <hi>Pisans,</hi> how much it did deserve to be imbraced and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
both out of compassion and justice, is demonstrated (to omit for the present
other particulars) by what was done at the same time by <hi>Charls</hi> the Eight,
King of <hi>France,</hi> whilst he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> and by the so many favors afforded to the
cause of <hi>Pisa</hi> by all the chief of his Court. <hi>Charls</hi> had promised the <hi>Florentines</hi> to
keep the City of <hi>Pisa</hi> under their Dominion, being obliged unto them for their
readiness in receiving them into his State, and for having afforded them all assistance
and accommodation; yet did the afflictions of the <hi>Pisans</hi> appear to be so grievous,
as he was moved more by compassion then by his own interest, or by his promise
made to the <hi>Florentines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A forein Prince used this charity to the <hi>Pisans,</hi> with whom he nor his Kingdom
had never held any friendship or confederacie, his interests being not only separate
from, but contrary to their welfare: And shall it be thought a strange and irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
thing, that the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> which had had the <hi>Pisans</hi> for their
friends and associates in divers enterprises, and who kept still friendship and
commerce with that City, from whence also some of the noblest Families of the
Commonwealth draw their original, and whose cause for the same respects was
straitly annex'd unto their own, should interest herself in behalf of the <hi>Pisans,</hi> to
comfort them in their great affliction? Nor ought the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi>
to use greater respect to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> then they had used towards her, against
whose designs they had so opposed themselves in the Wars formerly made against
the Dukes of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> assisting their Enemies both with men and
monies, as they were thought to be the chief hinderance, why the business under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by the Commonwealth with great hopes of good success, had no better an
end. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were thereunto likewise moved by the example of others:
For if the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> the <hi>Lucheses,</hi> and those of <hi>Sienna</hi> had
assisted the <hi>Pisans</hi> as much as they were able, how could the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whose Forces
in <hi>Italy</hi> were much superior to theirs, stand idly looking upon the <hi>Pisans</hi> miseries,
and upon the prosperity and greatness of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> whereby the common
troubles of <hi>Italy</hi> were augmented, since they alone adhered to the French
faction.</p>
               <p>But let us consider a little more particularly the cause which was undertaken to
be defended by protecting the <hi>Pisans,</hi> and what it was that they did endeavour.
Certainly nothing but the recovery of their antient liberty, whereof they were
bereaved either by their several misfortunes, and by the violence of others, or at
least (as they said) to reduce themselves to a less severe government then that of the
<hi>Florentines;</hi> under whose dominion being fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onti,</hi> the <hi>Pisans</hi> pretended first by the
favor of <hi>Charls</hi> the Eight, King of <hi>France,</hi> and afterwards by the like of <hi>Maximilian</hi>
the Emperor, to be returned to their former liberty: The former having used his
power, and the other his anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

condition. And grant that respect were to be had to the possession which the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi>

them, and that their ruine would draw along with it great prejudice to the peace
and liberty of all <hi>Italy,</hi> they at last took upon them their protection and defence.
And I herein say nothing but what is most true, and confirm'd by the testimony of
those who have written upon the passages of those times.</p>
               <p>But let us consider other more particular accidents, and more weighty respects.
<hi>Charls</hi> the Eight, King of <hi>France,</hi> was at that time pass'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> to get the
Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> an undertaking wherein he had prosperous success, which was
an ill omen to <hi>Italy:</hi> All the other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> opposed him afterwards in his
designs, (instructed by the fall of the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> to have an eye to their own
danger) except only the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who still continued in adhering to the <hi>French,</hi>
the counsel of the most po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent Citizens prevailing over the opinion of the more
wise. So as the <hi>French</hi> preparing to return with mighty Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> they had
friendship with none, nor had they any other receptacle, save with the <hi>Florentines,</hi>
with whom they had already made a new agreement to be by them assisted with
men and monies. <hi>Pisa</hi> was at the same time straitly beleaguer'd by the <hi>Florentines;</hi>
and had she not been succor'd by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> all her other aids were so weak, as
she must speedily have faln into the <hi>Florentines</hi> hands; who being freed of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
and trouble of that Siege, would be more powerful, and more ready to assist
the <hi>French,</hi> and to facilitate the enterprises which they were to attempt in <hi>Italy.</hi>
Then if it were judged by the common opinion of all men to be just, honest and
laudable to take upon them the defence of the safety and liberty of <hi>Italy</hi> against
the <hi>French;</hi> how can those actions be blamed, which did tend (as it is seen) neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
thereunto, by keeping foreign Forces afar off, and by bereaving them of their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riends assistance? The affairs of the King of <hi>France</hi> did at this time ebb and flow,
but for the most part ebb in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> Great were the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragons</hi>
hopes of recovering the State, being therein assisted powerfully by the
same <hi>Venetians:</hi> The King of France, though his <hi>Forces</hi> were in a readiness, was
doubtful whether he should come into <hi>Italy,</hi> or no. So as at such a conjuncture of
time, every least thing which tended either to the augmenting or lessening of his
hopes, was of great moment. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> moved by these respects, did
much press the Venetian Senate to be resolute in assisting the <hi>Pisans,</hi> whilst he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was somewhat doubtful and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

such a resolution, that they might keep the <hi>Florentines</hi> busied about <hi>Pisa,</hi> and
the French from those succors, whereby the troubles and dangers of <hi>Italy</hi> were
increased.</p>
               <p>But I find that these transactions have been diversly interpreted, and the Senate
blamed, who did not aim at succouring the oppressed <hi>Pisans,</hi> not at the common
safety of <hi>Italy,</hi> but at their own thirst of bringing the City of <hi>Pisa</hi> under their
Dominion. To this it is answered, that where the actions are evident, no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to be given contrary thereunto; nor ought the secrets of hearts to be
searched, which is reserved to a more excellent power then what humane discourse
can arrive unto; it is certain that the defence of <hi>Pisa,</hi> which was oft-times denied
them, was at last undertaken by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> when they being forsaken by all
others, they were necessitated for the aforesaid reasons so to do. The <hi>Pisans</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to put themselves wholly into the power of the Commonwealth, and to set
up her colours in their City, the <hi>Venetians</hi> would not yeeld hereunto, nor accept
of this large offer; but the <hi>Pisan</hi> Ambassadors were sent back with many thanks for
their affection, and were heard in what they desired, though in a differing manner;
for the Commonwealth took upon her to defend the liberty of the City with the
forces and authority of the Commonwealth, which she did for many years, with
such fervencie and general consent, sparing neither expence, labor, nor danger, as
she could hardly have done more in her own defence; they sent both Foot and
Horse several times to the <hi>Pisans</hi> under their best Commanders, as also moneys
and victuals, and shipping to accommodate the City with all things necessary, and
to free them from the siege of the <hi>Florentines</hi> by Sea. Yet to give a greater te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of what their minds and intentions were in this, when it was propounded to
put the City of <hi>Pisa</hi> into <hi>Caesars</hi> hands, and to remit the right of their cause to him,
the <hi>Venetians</hi> did not onely not oppose it, but counseled them so to do, desirous
that this controversie might be ended, whilst their faith, and the common interests
were preserved safe; and when there was yet some opinion, that the <hi>Florentines</hi>
allured by this advantage, and hope, might have adhered unto the league; but on
the one side, in progress of time, the <hi>Florentines</hi> obdurate resolution was discovered
of governing themselves by Counsels, apart from the rest of the <hi>Italians;</hi> and on
the other, the deep deceits of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reality endeavor to secure himself from this his imaginary fear, by hindring the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
from pursuing that enterprise, to the which not long before he had exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate was inforced to maintain the cause which they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
to keep from breaking their faith unto the <hi>Pisans,</hi> and to free themselves
from the infamy and repute of weak advice, to which they should be subject, as if
they had condescended for fear of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the <hi>Pisans,</hi> which was agitated under the name of the Collegues, was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
onely by him, and according to his will and interests. But say I pray, is this
the onely enterprise wherein the sincerity, and candidness of the Commonwealth
is to be known in just things, and such as do concern the common good of <hi>Italy?</hi>
How often hath she maintained Wars, to the end that there might be a right, and

                  </gap> in the business concerning <hi>Pisa</hi>
may likewise be discovered, since when the agreement was come unto, the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
had no respect to their own advantage, but onely to the benefit of the <hi>Pisans,</hi>
to the preservation of their liberty as much as might be, and to the right of what
belonged to their Territories, which they were possest of when they put themselves
into the Commonwealths protection, wherein the <hi>Venetians</hi> were alwaies very
constant; though the imminent War with the Turks might have made them forget
the dangers and interests of other mens, for their own concernments. And at last,
as they would yeeld to nothing which might be prejudicial to the <hi>Pisans,</hi> so to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the World that in reality they had no thought in maintaining this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
to any peculiar design of their own, in making themselves Masters of that
City, they put the determination of these differences, into the arbitrement of
<hi>Hercules</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> which though it had not any effect afterwards, the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans</hi>
not consenting thereunto, yet it might be discerned, that the <hi>Pisans</hi> averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereunto, or the constancy wherein they persevered, was not fomented by
the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but rose either out of the meer election or necessity of the <hi>Pisans</hi>
themselves:</p>
               <p>But let us come to another consideration, more proper for this business, that is,
to the reasons of State, wherein th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> many of the same things do concur, yet they are
clothed with other respects, wherewith Princes building either onely or chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what may most redound to their own advantage, do not advise with counsel of
equity, or do not attribute thereunto what is requisite. It is most certain, being
already reduced to the greatest extremity, if they should have been abandoned
by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they must have put themselves either into the power of the
Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> or of the <hi>Florentines;</hi> but reason of State would not permit,
that in this conjuncture both of times and affairs this City should be joyned to
the Dominion of either of these. As for <hi>Sforza</hi> his vast and disordinate drifts
were already known, and how he would be the sole Arbitrator of <hi>Italy;</hi> so as if
he should become more haughty, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ft up by this important acquisition, no
part of <hi>Italy</hi> could remain quiet or secure either from his force or craft. And as
for the <hi>Florentines</hi> you have heard how resolute they were not to part from the
friendship of the King of <hi>France,</hi> by how much greater the danger of whose Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was in recent memory, so much the more were his friends and associats to be
kept weak and under, to the end that they might not increase to the prejudice
and apprehension of the rest. It was seen in what danger <hi>Italy</hi> was put by forein
Forces, how soon the Kings of <hi>Aragon</hi> were driven out of their Dominion, how
little resolute the other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were to withstand forein Forces, which
having once found an open and easie way into <hi>Italy,</hi> it was to be imagined that
they would be cause of greater dangers and molestations to her. So as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
being to be put into a condition of being able to resist the Forces of
greater Princes, and of not being exposed to their wills, she was necessitated to
think upon increasing her power and reputation, that she might depend upon her
own Basis, and be well esteemed of by others. She knew particularly that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

was a State which might accommodate or dis-accommodate the French designs,
accordingly as it was well or ill affected towards them. And the keeping of the

for the <hi>Venetian,</hi> in this conjuncture of affairs, to have footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to have
the City of <hi>Pisa,</hi> if not subject to their dominion, at least dependent upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Commonwealth. Now take it for granted, that that suspition might
be true which they have so much divulged, who have endeavored to cast a blur upon
the honor and dignity of the Commonwealth, to wit, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> intended
to make th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mselves absolute masters of that City, only out of a design of increasing
their dominion. Certainly the actions of a Philosopher, and those of a Prince, ought
not to be measured by one and the same Rule; nor must we fancy the condition of
men, and of affairs, to be what peradventure they ought to be, but what they are
for the most part. Magnanimity is the proper vertue of Princes, which makes them
always busie themselves about great matters, and whereby they make themselves
be dreaded and reverenced by others. Therefore the desire of Glory and Empire
is highly praised in such Princes as have been greatest and most celebrated, as <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,
Cyrus, Caesar, Charls,</hi> and all the rest of the most famous men, in whom a
spirit of Grandure and Generosity, which did still egg them on to new and glorious
enterprises, is not only commended, but even admired. If the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are praised and celebrated by the general consent of all men, had been content
to contain themselves within the precincts of <hi>Latium,</hi> their worth would have been
hidden and obscured, nor would their names have been so highly cry'd up to the
memory of posterity: And had not the <hi>Venetians</hi> had larger thoughts then to keep
within their private merchandising affairs (as it became them to do in their weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining)
dispising or neglecting such occasions as they sundry times met with of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
the bounds of their Dominions, the Commonwealth would not only not
have gotten such esteem and reputation as it hath got, but could not have kept her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so long in liberty, amidst so many revolutions of affairs, and such movings of
Forein Armies.</p>
               <p>It remains now only to see whether the opportunity of the Times, and condition
of Affairs did counsel them to purchase new glory and greater Empire to their
Commonwealth. Which though it may be known by what hath been formerly
said, yet it will more clearly appear by adding some other particular Considerations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Commonwealth was then in a more powerful condition then any Prince in
<hi>Italy,</hi> being much stronger then them all both in Land and Sea-Forces; the <hi>Pisans</hi>
cause was generally well wish'd unto; the <hi>Florentines</hi> were but little acceptable to
the rest of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> by reason of their friendship with the <hi>French,</hi> and
for this and other respects were particularly much hated by their neighbors, the
<hi>Genoeses, Seneses,</hi> and <hi>Lucheses,</hi> and all the actions of the Commonwealth seemed
to be favored by a certain Genius. She had lately gotten the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus;</hi>
she had enlarged her Confines in <hi>Friuli,</hi> by the acquisition of many Towns in the
Country of <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itia;</hi> and she prospered greatly in all that she took in hand, and
won much honor. So as in this happy conjunction, the <hi>Venetians</hi> ought not to
abandon their good Fortune, lest they might too late repent for not having known
how to make good use of their prosperity. They were to be ruled by the example
of things past: For having oftentimes let s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ip many opportune occasions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
their Dominion by Land, whilst their Enemies were but weak and not well
setled in their States, the like enterprises being by them undertaken afterwards in
a less convenient time, proved more difficult unto them. Others thought, that for
the like reasons the <hi>Venetians</hi> should have forborne to meddle with the affairs of
<hi>Pisa;</hi> for (said they) the City was so situated, as it could not be defended by them
without much expence and inconvenience, they being to take a long compass about
the Sea before they could furnish it with things necessary, and then the City it self
was not so great a purchase, as deserved so much labor to purchase it. They added
moreover, that at the same time, the friends of the other Princes did much envy
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59987:78"/>
the Commonwealth for her great prosperity; so as it had better become the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of that Senate to endeavour by concealing their thoughts of aspiring to greater
things, to allay this envy, then further to increase it, as they did by attempting so
great a novelty.</p>
               <p>No doubt but those wise Senators who sate then at the helm of Government,
did reflect upon these doubts and suspitions; but it is to be believed that they were
easily free of them, considering that the Commonwealth, when she was not yet so
powerful nor strong, had undertaken many difficult, but glorious enterprises in
parts far off, and had gotten notable victories against the <hi>Sara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ens,</hi> who were then
very strong both by Sea and Land, and had placed Trophies of singular worth, and
great zeal to Religion, in the Holy Land; that she had many times taken up Arms
in the behalf of the Emperors of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> against divers other Potentates,
and upon occasions, had reduced many Cities into her power, which had formerly
belonged to that Empire; and that likewise she had for many years maintained
sharp Wars against the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> and had put a period to many other gallant affairs
by apparent victories: So as they thought that the Commonwealth had reason to
promise herself good success in this her noble design of taking upon her the defence
of <hi>Pisa,</hi> and of the affairs of <hi>Tuscany.</hi> Wherefore then ought they to distrust that
the Commonwealth might keep the City of <hi>Pisa</hi> at her devotion, in times when
her power and authority was much increased, and being accommodated with so
many Ships and Gallies which were usually upon the Sea, and having the Island of
<hi>Corfu</hi> in the Gulfs mouth, to receive the Ships in the mid-way which sailed from
the one Sea to the other? But on the contrary, who does not know how very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
this situation was for many other things, and of what use for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth?
Their having got footing in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> might, according as occasions
should be offered, open them the way to greater acquisitions; and the Haven of
<hi>Ligorn</hi> was extreamly commodious for the Navigation and Traffick which the
City of <hi>Venice</hi> holds with the Western Provinces: which may the better be known
now, for that since the affairs which had wont to be transacted in the East, being
now turn'd to the West, Ships which come from thence laden with sundry sorts of
Merchandise, putting into the Haven of <hi>Ligorn,</hi> to shun further Navigation, do
there unload themselves, from whence their Loading is afterwards brought by
Land to <hi>Venice.</hi> So as it seems those wise Senators did even then foresee what high
esteem was to be put upon that situation. But their desires have at least prevailed
thus far, as that this Country is possest by very wise Princes, who are great friends
to the Commonwealth; with whom an excellent intelligence being held, as hath
been of late, and as it is to be hoped it will be for time to come, Commerce will
always be open, safe, and free in those Countries. So as no reason can perswade,
that the fear of being envied by other Princes, should keep the <hi>Venetians</hi> from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
so beneficial a thing: For if these thoughts (which ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
of by any generous Prince) should have been sufficient to have stopped the
course of the Commonwealths good fortune, she must not only have abstained
from this, but from other enterprises; and so her Dominion and Fame would have
been shut up within her own Washes, if that peradventure might have been
permitted them.</p>
               <p>It was therefore necessary for the preservation of themselves, and of their liberty,
to provide themselves of sufficient Forces (which cannot be had without Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories)
to resist such as would offend them; for the keeping of others well-affected,
is not sufficient to keep off injuries. But War is not alwaies made out of fear of
another Princes power, and with a mind to secure ones self therefrom, but most
commonly out of contempt, and out of a beleef of being able easily to effect
what you undertake against them; and envy is oftentimes more supprest in the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59987:79"/>
very height of good fortune, when a mans condition is raised much above that of
others, then when it is kept within common and usual precincts. But what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
envy ought the Commonwealth to have feared? If you will say any Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alpin
Princes, they had not as then any such firm footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor so ready
Forces, nor peradventure had they their thoughts so interessed, as that they were
to make War upon that account with the <hi>Venetians;</hi> if you mean <hi>Italian</hi> Princes,
every one of them were weaker then the Commonwealth, and the diversity of
their ends and interests would be sure to keep them from joyning together. Nor
was it likely that they would conspire with greater Princes against the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
since it became all of them to apprehend forein Forces, lest they might all suffer in
a common ruine. And if it be said, that notwithstanding it fell out so afterwards,
as was seen by the league of <hi>Cambray</hi> which proved so pernicious to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
it may be answered, That things are not done (especially among Princes)
as reason would perswade; and no certain judgment can be given of Actions
wherein Fancy reigns. But let it be said, that the condition of things, times and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
were altered by reason of many much differing accidents and actions, when
these more heavy Wars began; but chiefly, because the French being become
more powerful in <hi>Italy,</hi> by their acquisition of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of subduing her, they resolved to leave nothing unattempted, which might
bring this their design to effect; so as it was from hence that all the troubles and
dangers came upon the Commonwealth, whereas she ought rather to have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thanks, and good offices from the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> so as peradventure there
may be more reason to blame the Commonwealth for having called the King of
<hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> had she been thereunto moved out of a desire of inlarging her
Dominions, and had not been thereunto compelled by the fraud and insufferable
insolencies of <hi>Lodovico Sforza,</hi> to suppress the which she was inforced to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to forein Forces, which afterwards turned themselves upon herself. But
in the defence of <hi>Pisa</hi> things were otherwise; the end was very honest, for the
business was to comfort the oppressed, not to oppress others; and enterprise which
was to be approved of for the common welfare of all the <hi>Italians,</hi> whereby they
onely were weakened, who favored the affairs of forein Princes. The reward, if
the War succeeded well, was very great, for it made much for the advantage and
reputation, especally at that time, of having the City of <hi>Pisa</hi> either her Subject,
Friend, Dependant, or Confederate.</p>

               <head>The Third DISCOURSE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </head>
               <head type="sub">That the Commonwealth is not to be blamed for the unfortunate
successes of War, after the routing of the Venetian Army in
the action of Giaradada.</head>
               <p>HE who hath sought out an occasion to blame the Commonwealth of
<hi>Venice,</hi> out of envy to her glory, and particularly to the excellency
of her Government, falling upon the times of her greatnest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
says, That when by her unfortunate success at the rout of
<hi>Giaradada</hi> she lost her State by Land, she witnessed that there was
neither worth, nor strength, nor power in her orders to govern an Empire; and
that she had had her increase, and had to this day maintained her greatness, more
out of a certain appearance, and opinion, then by any excellency of power of
counsel. I find these things written in some Authors, but chiefly amplified and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Nicholas Machiavel,</hi> a name which hath formerly been very famous for
the curiosity of the matter which he took upon him to write on in his discourse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
it is now so condemned to perpetual oblivion by the holy Apostolick Sea, as it is
not lawful to name him.</p>
               <p>The misfortunes which the Commonwealth underwent in those days were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
very great, but such notwithstanding as ought rather to move compassion in
all mens minds, and shew the instability of humane affairs, then to afford matter of
blame, and further oppression. It is said that the imperfection of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
was discovered by these publick adversities; and (that I may give the very
words of some men) that there was no true worth or excellency in her orders; yet
prove they not this by any other reason then what is taken from the action it self,
to wit, because she lost the day to the French, and that by the loss thereof
the publick affairs were brought into exceeding great danger. But he who
shall penetrate more inwardly into the truth of these things, will not rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with this judgement, framed rather from the event then out of any reason, and
will speak much otherwise, and will take many other things into consideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he give his judgement. And if we will by this our Discourse penetrate into
the more inward considerations, we shall find that the Form of Government is
as it were the soul which gives a true being to a City. For a multitude of men as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
together could not have whereof to live, nor would their place of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
deserve the name of a City, were it not for certain Orders and Laws. But as
the sensitive soul, which informs the animated body, cannot always make equal
use of all her sundry powers and faculties; for though she preserve her self in her
own purity, and perfection, yet needing the parts of the body, and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rinsecal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
for her operations, she must oft times cease operating, and sometime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th
imperfect operations; so will it happen in a City, that though the form of
government, which is as it were the soul thereof, be of it self very vigorous and
perfect, yet can it not always, nor in all things shew its force and excellency, by
reason of the need it stands in of instruments, and by its encountring with many
extrinsecal accidents, so as it must sometimes rest wholly idle, and other some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
do but little good by its operating; Whence I infer, that though a City be
exceedingly well ordered for Civil and Military Affairs, yet cannot she promise
herself to enjoy peace long, nor long to keep herself in one and the same condition
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59987:80"/>
save onely as long as she shal be permitted so to do by the condition of other things,
which are out of the Legislators power. So likewise the adverse fortune of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
or Kingdom, which may depend upon so many other occasions, is not
sufficient to infer, that such States are ill ordered: But rather as he may deserve
the name of a good Orator, who handles his cause so as he does perswade handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though he he do not always attain his end; so ought not the Legislator to be
accounted less wise, nor those Laws less good, by which the Government is well
regulated as touching Peace, and the preservation of the City or State, though
various accidents may produce the contrary effects.</p>
               <p>These reasons and examples do cleerly shew, how ill-grounded those oppositions
are, by which, without any consideration of so many other circumstances, men
will conclude that the Orders of the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> were weak, and of
no worth, because her Army was worsted in the Battel of <hi>Geradada;</hi> and because
after that Rout, the loss of the State, and so many other great losses did ensue. It is
not the Event, but the Counsel by which things are done, which ought to give the
true praise or blame to our actions. Let us then see in this Case which we are now
upon, what the counsels were, what the hopes, what the condition of times were,
and of Princes, and let us look into other such circumstances, and then we shall be
able to give a better judgment. The times are three; and the affairs which upon
this occasion may fall under our consideration, are of three sorts; to wit, such as
did precede the action, those wherewith it was accompanied, and those which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after. The Commonwealth, before this unfortunate accident fell out, was not
only in a very prosperous condition, by reason of her happy success in the last War
against the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> but also (as it was thought) in a condition of
much safety, being joined in league and amity with the powerful King of <hi>France,</hi>
when unexpectedly she understood that almost all the Princes of Christendom had
conspired against her; and almost at the same time she heard that the King of
<hi>France</hi> had denounced War against her. Where will you find a mind so constant;
as will not be much disturbed at such an advertisement as this? The affection must
needs be moved at the novelty of the action, and Reason troubled by the greatness
thereof. What had the Venetian Senate reason to fear at this time less then this?
The King of <hi>France,</hi> in league, friendship and confederacie with the Commonwealth
for many years, out of observancie whereunto the <hi>Venetians</hi> had not only refused
friendship with <hi>Caesar,</hi> which was offer'd them with so much advantage to themselvs,
but had taken up Arms to defend and preserve for that King, their Friend and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate,
the State of <hi>Milan;</hi> little mindful of such a service, (as the usual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of other men are seldom found amongst Princes) conspires her ruine, and tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns
those Arms against her, which through their friendship were grown so powerful in
<hi>Italy.</hi> What should move him thereunto? Not desire of revenge; for there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
no injury: Not any fear of his own affairs; for he had found them already
very constant unto them: No self-interest; for he ought to have been jealous of
<hi>Caesars</hi> greatness, who had been his perpetual Enemy, and to have wished well unto
the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had been his antient Friends. But what shall I say of the rest?
Had not <hi>Caesar</hi> the like obligations to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as the King of <hi>France</hi> had,
which should have kept him from such a confederacie? Nay, had he not peculiar
respects which counsell'd him to the contrary? The injuries which the <hi>French</hi> had
done to the Empire; the King of <hi>France</hi> his particular hatred to him; the high
aspiring thoughts of that King, pernicious to the dignity of the Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the
German liberty. Wherefore as he could never promise himself safe and firm friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
from the <hi>French,</hi> so be ought rather to have obviated their power, then have
help'd to advance it. But who could have expected that such an action should have
proceeded from the admired wisdom of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> so unusual, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59987:80"/>
so harmful to himself, by reason of the prejudice and danger which he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
in not preserving the State which he had won in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> in
peace and quiet? For which cause, the greatness of the <hi>French,</hi> their fidelity, and
natural desire of novelty ought to have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>spected by him; yet he assented to
the increase of their power, and of his own danger. But how did those generous
thoughts which Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the Second seemed to bear to the greatness and liberty
of <hi>Italy,</hi> correspond with his joining in confederacie with the Transa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pine Princes
who went about to oppress her by the ruine of that Commonwealth, which was
confest by all men to be at that time the Maintainer of the Glory of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the
hope that she might again rise to her antient greatness and reputation? What safety
could the Apostolick Sea expect, by increasing the power of those Princes in <hi>Italy,</hi>
who were great of themselves, whom he feared, and upon whose authority he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> must depend?</p>
               <p>These certainly were such things as did transcend whatsoever could have faln into
the imagination of the Venetian Senators, or of any other men how wise soever:
Nor was the immensity of the danger less, nor less able to molest and confound the
minds of those who were to prepare for resistance against so great a War. The King
of <hi>France</hi> his Forces were of themselves very powerful, that Kingdom being then
more flourishing then it had been for many years before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and become more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
by the possession which the <hi>French</hi> had got of the Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> which
afforded them mighty conveniencies to assault the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fines of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
And though <hi>Caesars</hi> Forces were not of themselves greatly considerable,
yet were they increased by the fame he gave out, that he led his Army into <hi>Italy</hi>
to make a certain and noble prey thereof, and with a mind to restore the Empire
to its almost lost greatness, whereby he reconciled the mindes of the German
Princes and people, and got them to joyn their Forces with his. Moreover, the
King of <hi>Spains</hi> Naval preparation was in particular to be feared; to prevent the
which, those Sea-Forces of the Commonwealth were to be imployed, which should
all of them have been imployed in defending the State by Land from so fierce an
assault. The Pope added no small reputation to the League by his authority; and
his Spiritual arms being accompanied with Temporal forces, became the more
dreadful. And though the other petty Princes forces were but small, yet was their
will to offend the Commonwealth great; and the Kings of <hi>England, Poland,</hi> and
<hi>Hungary</hi> were sought unto and sollicited by all these together to join with them, and
to declare enmity to the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then the <hi>Venetians</hi> had yielded to this so new and great preparation for War,
which like Thunder made both its noise and harm be heard and felt at once, what
could have been said unto them? Ought not they to have been judged worthy of
excuse, and their Commonwealth free from the imputation that their Orders were
no ways good? For as an object of immensurable force does not move, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the sense; so the encountring with so weighty a conspiracie, was a thing not
likely to incite the Commonwealth to shew her vertue, but rather to disorder and
to confound her. Yet it is seen how she behaved herself upon such an occasion; and
whether it may be inferred from these her first counsels, as from a thing that was
in her own power, that she was not worth much, or that she did any thing unworthy
of herself, of her fame, or of the reputation which she held amongst other potent
Princes of that Age. What appearance was there in her of any fear, or rather what
greater sign could be desired in her of generous confidence and most noble daring?
What did she resolve to yield up of free-will? What noise, what complaints were
heard, which shewed that she would terminate that contention with vain words,
which could not be ended but with Arms? The Answer which was given to the
French Herald who came to denounce unto them, that the King was upon his
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59987:81"/>
march in Arms against the Commonwealth, was onely, that that War was intimated
them from the King, when they had more reason to expect Amity and Peace from
him; but that they would not be wanting to their own defence, being confident
that they should be able to defend themselves by their own Forces, and through
the right of their cause. The effects were answerable to their words; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themselves forthwith to provide for so great a War. The most expert Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
were sent for from all parts, veteran Soldiers mustered in all places, in
so great numbers, and so qualified, as it was agreed upon by the common consent of
all, that neither that Age, nor any other, for many years before had seen such an
Army of meer <hi>Italians</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> Great and very miraculous was the union and
concord both in the Senate and City, wherewith men of all conditions and ages
to lend their helping hand to assist their Country at so great a need. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
so great a zeal in every one to the common good, such resolution to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the state and liberty of the Commonwealth even to the last gasp, as those
who have appeared to be no very good friends to the <hi>Venetians</hi> in other things,
do praise these proceedings, being forced so to do by the power of truth.</p>
               <p>But let us come to those other things which accompany the action it self; The
Senate upon mature advice, resolved wisely how that War was to be managed;
they knew the enemy was very strong, the danger great, and that the wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are of
the Commonwealth depended upon the preservation of that Army which they had
now got together. But as it would be a great rashness to hazard it upon a Battel,
so to keep it onely to be a safeguard to the City, shewed timorousness in them,
would discourage their men, and increase the courage and reputation of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Whilst they bethought themselves what to do in this great exigencie to evade
both these inconveniencies, the Senate ordered their Commanders to march with
their Army to those Confines of the State of <hi>Milan</hi> where the Enemy should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be likely to make their first assaults; to the end that following their Army
in near, but safe quarters, and that keeping them still incommodated, and in jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
and fear of being assaulted, they might keep them from advancing further,
and from falling upon any enterprise. The Commonwealths Army was very
strong in Horse, amounting to the number of Ten thousand; and in Foot, to boot
with a great number of Soldiers of their own Country, commanded by their own
Orders, they had Twelve thousand veteran Soldiers, under experienced famous
Commanders, together with a great train of Artillery, and all other instruments
for War; so as the Senate had reason to beleeve, that they might effect their
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds of maintaining the War, and of keeping the field; and so spinning out
time (as it becomes those who are upon the defensive part, and find themselves
to be the weaker) secure their own Affairs, and keep further dangers from
them.</p>
               <p>For it oftentimes falls out through various accidents, that the greater Armies
be, they do so much the more easily moulder away of themselves; and the Forces
of many several Princes, though they be at first great and formidable, prove less
fit for great enterprises, by reason of the Colleagues different ends and interests.
And as learned Physitians use no strong and violent remedies when the sick party
hath but some grudgings of an Ague, and when the disease is not yet well known;
So these wise Senators were of opinion, that the Commonwealth being set upon and
almost opprest by the sudden violence of so many Enemies, it made not for their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
and safety, to come to the violent remedy of a pitcht field, with enemies whose
strength was not yet very well known. Together with these reasons, the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Senate had for their example the success of the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
finding her self assailed by powerful <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Forces, and her Affairs being
reduced to a great streight, preserved themselves from greater danger, by drawing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59987:81"/>
out the War at length, and by keeping the Enemy incommodated; but the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
had not a <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> for their Commander in chief, as the French
had an <hi>Hannibal,</hi> for there were many of those vertues in <hi>Lodowick</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi>
which were praised in <hi>Hannibal;</hi> chiefly a mighty thirst after glory, to purchase
which he valued neither labor nor danger. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was of a nature much contrary to that of <hi>Fabius,</hi> in knowing how to make
advantage of time; and though he had many other noble qualities, as greatness of
spirit in undertakings, unda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nted courage in executing what he undertook, and great
experience in matter of War; yet were these vertues little advantagious for the
present occasion; better befitting a Commander who was to assist a puissant Prince,
desirous of glory, and in his most prosperous times, then a Commonwealth, which
not making use so much of force, as of occasion, was slowly, but safely arrived at that
greatness, and which was now, more then formerly to proceed by the like counsels.</p>
               <p>But it may peradventure be said, that the Venetian Army wanted not a <hi>Fabius,</hi>
having <hi>Nicolo Orsino,</hi> Count of <hi>Pitigliano,</hi> who in his other actions may be truly
said to resemble <hi>Fabius</hi> very much, for he alwaies proceeded with the slowest and
safest advices; but in this he appeared much different, and inferior to him, since
he would not succour <hi>Alviano,</hi> who contrary to his order had given Battel, as did
<hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> who readily succoured <hi>Quintus Minutius,</hi> chief Commander of
the Cavalry, though contrary to his opinion he had rashly exposed himself, and part
of the Army to the danger of Battel. But on the contrary, <hi>Lodowick,</hi> King of
<hi>France,</hi> was not onely like <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but did much exceed him; for <hi>Hannibal</hi>
knew onely how to overcome, but knew not how to make use of Victory, having
spent much time to little purpose, after the rout given to the <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Cannae;</hi>
but <hi>Lodowick</hi> pursuing the Victory, stopt not till he had regained all that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto from the State of <hi>Venice.</hi> But the Forces of the Commonwealth
did either prove less valiant, and less fortunate then formerly they had done, or
else they were hurried by some occult cause upon this calamity. Yet can it not
be said that the Senates advice was less good, who in their Orders to their
Commanders, did alwaies lay before them the importance of the business
with express and particular command to shun the necessity of joyning Battel
with the Enemy. Those prudent Senators knew very well that that Army was
not to be hazarded upon the dubious event of Battel, wherein consisted all the
hopes of preserving her State by Land, and that the condition of affairs were such
on their side, that if they came to the trial of a Battel, it must be upon too much
disadvantage. The War was made at their own doors, so as if the Enemy should
prove victorious, the conquer'd party could not have time to rally or recruit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for preservation of their own affairs; but if the French Army had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
the War would not notwithstanding be at an end, the Forces of the
other Colleagues remaining still intire: which were likelier to be ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ned by their own
disorders, and by the discords which use to happen in Leagues, then by force of
Arms, which could not be made use of without danger. The bad advice of some
Commanders, or else some fatal adversity of the Commonwealth would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that this advantage of time should be waited for; whereupon they came to
the conflict, not onely contrary to the so many aforementioned respects, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
such disadvantage, as with but half their Forces they hazarded the whole For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the Commonwealth. How valiantly they fought is witnessed by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
consent of all men, nor do the victorious Enemies deny but that the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was a good while doubtful; but a few not being able longer to resist a much
greater number, that notable rout ensued which drew after it so many losses and
ruines; For the French Forces did not more secure the way to their Army in all
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59987:82"/>
places, and facilitate their undertakings, then did the reputation of their victory.</p>
               <p>Amidst so great amazement and astonishment, nothing was left unattempted by
<hi>Luigi Gritti,</hi> and <hi>Christofero Moro,</hi> who were the <hi>Provedatori del Campo,</hi> to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Commonwealths fading fortune: They betook themselves to rally the
remainder of the Army, they comforted the Captains and Soldiers with hope of
better success; they intreated the Nobility and people of <hi>Brescia,</hi> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cities, that being mindful of their, Loyalties, and of other things done
in service to the Commonwealth, in former Wars had with <hi>Philip Maria
Visconte,</hi> they would be like themselves, and with like constancy keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under the moderate command of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and abhorring the severe
<hi>Transalpine</hi> Dominion, they would with one onely inconvenience free themselves
from many grievous mischiefs. But they were all so possest with a Panick fear, as
no entreaties nor reason could be listned unto; those who had escaped the Battel,
were unfit either for strength or valor, to attempt any thing against the Enemy, no
disposition to defence was found in the City, no not so much as to keep themselves
from plunder; there were but few Forts at that time in the State, and those few of
no condition of holding out long. What was then to be done? to whom was any
recourse to be had? If all Princes and Countries were become Enemies, who were
to be trusted? If all memory of former benefits were laid aside, so as least grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
was found in those who had been most obliged, how could new men be raised,
and provisions made for a new War? The armed Enemy was already at the gates,
nay, even within their houses, threatning assured ruine. What was to be done in
such a general dispait, but to give way and suffer the cloud to pass, which they saw
there was neither wit nor counsel sufficient to withstand? And as sometimes it falls
out in greatest Tempests, that the skill and labor of the Marriners being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the malignity of the weather, they take down their sails and suffer the ship
to drive up and down whithersoever the Sea carries it; So in cases of greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
into which States do sometimes fall, he that sits at the helm must comply
with his fortune be it never so bad, till the fury of those tempests being past over,
the Commonwealth, though born down, yet not quite sunk, may rise again, and
make way for her pristine greatness.</p>
               <p>The Army being then to retreat, and the loss of the City drawing other losses
after it, as one stone that gives against another, it was thought the best course to
free the people from their former oathes, so to preserve them from sacking and
plunder, which they must have undergone, if they should maintain their loyalties,
and to free themselves from the tax of rebellion, if they should submit to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Such a resolution might appear willing, and therefore less generous, but it
was really necessary; prejudicial to him who doth consider meerly the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of things, but which might prove useful in the future: At first sight, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to proceed from rashness and fear, and yet it proceeded from wisdom, from
charity, and in respect to the good of the State, and of the Subjects. The piety
nor prudence of the Senate could not admit of the onely hope which was offered in
this sad condition of times, to be used for withstanding so many enemies, wherefore
the <hi>Venetians</hi> did magnanimously refuse those helps, and assistances, which were
offered them by the Turks; though but little before (as some writers affirm) they
had been very much sought unto by other Christian Princes, as by <hi>Frederick</hi> of
<hi>Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Lodovic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

after by the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> to be made use of against the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the justly conceived anger against so many conspiring Princes, nor the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of recovering what was lost, prevail with those most wise and religious men, but
that it was over-born with the zeal of Religion, and with a firm resolution of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the glory of their other atchievements against the Infidels, immaculate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59987:82"/>
neither would the reason of State, if well-understood, considered in the example of
others, suffer them so to do; and especially in the unfortunate success of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who having unadvisedly call'd in to their assistance the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes, who were much more powerful then they, had drawn a greater
ruine upon themselves, which proved the occasion of the fall of that Empire. But
being unwilling notwithstanding to give over all hopes of accommodating the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
condition of affairs with some ease, the Senate resolved to have recourse to
the Pope, and to <hi>Caesar,</hi> (though they had then appeared their bitter Enemies)
to treat of some Agreement. They were moved much hereunto by the respect and
reverence due to that holy See, and the pious and religious apprehension they had
of Ecclesiastical censures, to which they were subject; and they trusted more in
prevailing with <hi>Caesar,</hi> then with the King of <hi>France:</hi> For what hopes were there
to do any good by intreaties with him, who being first bound to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
by obligation and confederacie, had spurn'd at all those respects out of
meer desire of novelties? To these then they granted all that they pretended unto;
for being to make them quickly jealous of the King of <hi>France</hi> his greatness,
they knew some way would be found out for the Commonwealths better
fortune.</p>
               <p>But how is it possible to pass over here in silence another thing, not at all differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from this, by which such base aspersions have been endeavored to be cast upon
the <hi>Venetians;</hi> since by this our present discourse we go about to vindicate them,
by searching into the truth? We read in <hi>Guicchiardine,</hi> a Modern, and to give him
his due, in many things an excellent Historian, an Oration published by him in the
name of <hi>Antonio Iustiniano,</hi> sent by the Commonwealth to <hi>Caesar;</hi> wherein it is
said, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> begging pardon at <hi>Caesars</hi> hand, with much subjection and
servility of mind, did offer to submit the Commonwealth to be perpetually tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to the Empire, and to acknowledg to hold their liberty, lives and livelihood
from him: with some other base unworthy expressions, not only not true, but not
likely to be so. For first, it is very certain, that <hi>Iustinian</hi> being sent Ambassador to
<hi>Maximilian,</hi> and finding him at <hi>Trent,</hi> was never admitted to have audience,
peradventure for fear of offending the Confederates, and making of them jealous.
Then, it is most certain that the Senate gave no such Commission: And let him
who will not believe it, listen but to reason, and then he will be perswaded to the
contrary. The Commonwealth had then lost all her Territories by Land; but at
the same time she enjoyed all her State by Sea, wherein were not only one or two
Cities, but divers Provinces and noble Kingdoms; their Naval accoutrements were
very great, and equal, if not superior to those of whatsoever Potentate at that time;
all entire and whole, not having suffered any thing by this thunder of War, which
had only overrun their <hi>Terra firma:</hi> their Treasure but little diminished from what
it was at the begining of this War, which continued afterwards, and was maintained
for the space of many years: The City of <hi>Venice,</hi> placed by her miraculous situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in compleat safety, all attempts which could be made against it being to prove
rash and vain, as the effects proved afterwards: A great Train of Artillery, and of
all things requisite for War; a quiet People, and obedient at the beck of their
Nobility; and a constant and resolute mind in all the Nobles to demonstrate all
the proofs of worth and love towards their Country. But that which followed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in their defence of the City of <hi>Padua</hi> against the Forces of all the Princes of
the League, will suffice to prove, that the Commonwealth was not so weak either
in Counsel or in Power, as to have recourse to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

thousand years. Say, I beseech you, was not the Commonwealth powerful by Sea,
and sufficiently valued by all other Potentates, before she had any State in <hi>Terra

firma?</hi> Nay, she was oft-times seen to neglect occasions which were offered of
making acquisitious in <hi>Terra firma,</hi> thinking her self safe and powerful enough
without them</p>
               <p>What was it then which could move them to make themselves Servants and
Subjects, who had no reason to doubt not onely their liberty, but nor their chiefest,
most antient, and most proper Dominion, which was that of the Sea, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
whereof, as affairs stood then, they had no reason to make such haste to
<hi>Caesar</hi> for friendship? Who can with reason blame the advice, as the condition of
things went then, of giving and yeelding that up to <hi>Maximilian</hi> which could not
as then be kept from him; to wit, some of those Cities in <hi>Terra firma</hi> which he
pretended right unto; since some agreement ensuing with him by such concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and injuries ceasing on that part, the way might be opened to straiter, and
more particular and advantagious conventions with the same <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
desirous of novelties, whereby the Fortune of the Commonwealth was again
to be raised up. And this counsel tried afterwards with others had good success,
when they joyned in a new confederacy with the same French against <hi>Maximilian,</hi>
who scorning their fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the counsels, these the actions of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> from whence, some would take
occasion to detract from the praise and dignity of their Commonwealth, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
from the excellency of their Government.</p>
               <p>But we may better know how injuriously this blemish is laid upon them, if we
will examine how other Princes and States did behave themselves, when they were
in like adversity; which I do not alleage as taxing any one, but to shew the usual
course of affairs, by the example of others. Observe what art the King of <hi>Aragon</hi>
used to preserve his State, when <hi>Charls</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>France</hi> came against
them in hostile manner. <hi>Alphonso</hi> who possest the Kingdom, having tried the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of fear before the danger grew near, out of the meer report of the French
Forces, departed from <hi>Naples,</hi> leaving all things at six and sevens, whilst their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was yet in <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Son, who had boasted that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himself, and to that purpose had mustered a great many Soldiers, retired with
them into the narrow passes of the Kingdom, without making any triall either of
his fortune or of his valor, and yeelding rather to the Fame, then to the Forces of
the Enemy, suffered them to take free and quiet possession of that most noble
Kingdom. But <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> who was reinvested in his State, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of the people, and by the assistance of other Princes, with which the <hi>Venetians</hi>
did readily joyn, what use did he make of other mens labors, and of his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
Soon after the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> was assaulted, by <hi>Lodowick</hi> King of
<hi>France,</hi> and by <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> at which assault being much discouraged,
he would not l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> sten to the advice of his Commanders, who advised him to keep
the field, but made some slender provisions for the Towns, and soon after, thinking
more how to escape, then how to defend himself, he fled into <hi>Ischia,</hi> and went
from thence into <hi>France,</hi> and put himself into the power of the same King his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
contenting himself rather to live a private man in peace and safety, then to
reign in trouble and danger.</p>
               <p>But what shall we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in War? How easily when they met with the first misfortune, did they suffer
themselves to be bereft of all they had before so happily acquired in the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples?</hi> And that so hastily, as it seemed that they had freely yeeled up the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of so many, and so noble Cities to the victors, the <hi>Spainards,</hi> by agreement,
and as it were in reward for the day which they had won. Nor is this the onely
example; since we have seen the same <hi>French,</hi> who were faln with such fervency
with their Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> and had with miraculous prosperity recovered the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59987:83"/>
State of <hi>Milan</hi> but a little before, resolve suddenly to forgo all that they had won,
and to retreat to beyond the Mountains, after the ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> which they had received from
the <hi>Swizzers</hi> at <hi>Novara;</hi> the succour which they met withal by the way as they
fled, not being able to make them halt. Who was more famous then for dexterity of
wit for the managing of weighty affairs, then <hi>Lodorica Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan?</hi>
yet when a great deluge of War came upon him, what use could he make of all
his Artifices? Could he shew that constancy and generosity which he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times before publickly boasted of? The onely news of the league made against
him, by <hi>Lodowick</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> did so astonish him, as
losing all understanding, and leaving his Affairs unprovided for, he resolved at
very first, upon what ought to have been his last and most desperate advice, to fly
into <hi>Germany,</hi> foregoing the defence of that State, which being once lost, he
did afterwards in vain seek to recover.</p>
               <p>But in this point I may help my self in looking a little more backward, and
trying whether the gallantry of the antients, so much commended, did produce
other effects then those that I have spoken of. The <hi>Romans,</hi> who conquered the

behaved themselves; for he is very timerous who is not bold and generous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous

defence, but sought how to save himself and the best things he had, in the
Capitol; their houses, and walls were abandoned, and the very gates left open to
the Enemy by the Roman Soldiers, who fled into the City to save themselves;

               <p>But what shall we say of things that happened afterwards, when their Fame
grew greater? Did not the <hi>Romans</hi> lose possession of all <hi>Italy,</hi> after the rout

their own houses, rendred themselves prisoners to the Conquerors; others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to the Sea side, intending if they could have the benefit of shipping,
to go to some other Prince, and seek out a new Country: But with what despair

<hi>Charls</hi> the Eight, King of <hi>France,</hi> to the Conquest of the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples,</hi> may be numbred amongst the saddest, and most recent:
For ever since that time, the Transalpine Nations have had a power
in <hi>Italy;</hi> and the greatness of the Italian name, which began at that
time to be raised up again with hopes of greater glory, all the parts of <hi>Italy</hi> being
under the command of our Italian Princes, return'd to such a declination by this
blow, as it could never since recover its pristine majesty. But that which most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
the minds of those who are any ways generous, is to think, that this most noble
Country fell into such misfortunes through the fault of her own men; and that the
Italian Princes, to satisfie their own disordinate desires and immoderate ambition,
did call in Forein Nations to the prejudice of <hi>Italy;</hi> and little valuing the truer and
greater dangers, they stood basely looking on, and suffer'd this their common
Country to be rent in peeces by Foreiners. The French Forces did at this time
pass into <hi>Italy,</hi> by which she had not for a long time been molested, being called
in by <hi>Lodovick Sforza,</hi> and maintained by other Italians: But ere long they were
all aware of their ill-taken counsel, being touched by the danger more at hand, by
rearon of the French-mens great felicity; which as it might have been foreseen
further off, so was it not now so easily to be remedied. They therefore joined all
of them together afterwards in confederacie for the safety of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to oppose
King <hi>Charls</hi> his designs: So as after the acquisition of <hi>Naples,</hi> as he would return
into <hi>France</hi> by the same way which he had come in, with his Army, which was
notwithstanding much less numerous in men, he was opposed by the Army of the
confederate Princes, as he came to the banks of <hi>Tarus,</hi> who meant to hinder his
passage, and to fight his Army. For a little before, the Pope, the King of the

honor of <hi>Italy:</hi> But notwithstanding, there wanted not those then who desired
they had been more moderate; nor will it be now from the purpose to examine
this business, so to draw some secure document for times to come by a diligent
examination of the things done, and to know whether they were really such as
deserve praise and imitation, or whether there was any thing more to be desired
therein: For they appear to be attended with that wisdom, without which no
action, though perchance it may have good success, deserves either to be praised or
imitated by wise men. The taking up of Arms to drive the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi>
was doubtless a resolution as much to be commenped in the Italian Princes, as some
of them were blamed for calling of them in, and others for assisting them to the
common shame and prejudice. But how these Arms were to be made use of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

can be fought without much hazard and uncertainty of success, since there may
happen many unthought of accidents, wherein the use of wisdom is excluded. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where to join battel is to be thought a good advice, the condition of affairs
must be such, as that a man be not necessitated thereunto, but makes it his choice,
and comes to it with greater hopes of overcoming, then fear of being worsted;
and likewise the advantage must be more that is to be expected from the Victory,
then the prejudice which depends upon the loss thereof. By thus measuring the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of these affairs by these rules, we may the better know what judgment to
give thereof. If we consider the state of affairs before the Armies drew near, there
appears no necessity of fighting at that time: For the King of <hi>France</hi> led his men
back over the Mountains to their own homes, without prejudice or injury to any
one; so as the meeting him to stop his passage, and give him battel, proceeded
from election, and from the determinate counsel of the Princes that were Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
against him: But what the end of the combat was like to be, and how the
business was ballanced, might be guess'd at by many particulars, before a stroke was
struck. The King of <hi>France</hi> led along with him an Army consisting of <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Switzers;</hi> the former excellent for the Horse-Militia, and the latter excellently
well disciplin'd in Foot-service: So as the Italian Militia was confess'd by all men
to be far inferior to both these; for they had wholly lost all their antient excellent
institutions, and had wanted true discipline for many years, being by Foremers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft
of their antient military glory. But the much different impressions which were
in the Soldiers themselves, was of great importance upon this occasion. The <hi>French</hi>
were haughty, and puffed up by their success at <hi>Naples;</hi> they slighted the Enemy,
their very name seeming to have infused so much terror into all the <hi>Italians,</hi> as that
neither Princes nor People had dared to oppose them, but afforded them free and
safe passage every where. On the contrary, the <hi>Italians</hi> accustomed only to such
Wars as were made in <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein little valor was shewen, and less discipline, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
almost any loss of blood, as if it were for meer shew and sport, were to fear the
unusual encounter with the <hi>French,</hi> and to boot with their valor to apprehend their
prosperity, which had made the way so easie to them to so great and so noble an
acquisition. The Kings party was likewise favored by the Kings own presence, and
the danger which his own person was in; which occasioned no small daring in the
French Soldiery, some being thereunto stirr'd up by their natural love to their King,
others by hopes of reward, and others for fear of punishment. But of all things else,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59987:85"/>
the diversity of the cause ought to be of greatest moment. For the <hi>French</hi> had no
hopes of safety, save what lay in their Arms, being in an Enemies Country, the
way in their return home very difficult, by reason of the craggy Mountains though
they should meet with no impediment by the Enemy; the Army of the Colleagues
suffered not under the like necessity, for being at its own home, it might be sure
upon any adverse fortune to have safe receptacle in every City. Moreover, the
<hi>Italians</hi> were incited to fight, onely out of a desire of honor, or of revenge, and
this was much more in the Princes and Commanders, then in the common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;
which things being well considered, might by reason of what is the usual
issue of such actions, cause rather doubt, then hope of victory, if they should come
to a day of Battel; or at least might make it appear, that businesses were so equally
balanced, and so doubtful, as where there was no inforcing necessity, to pursue a
business so full of danger, was not worth the while. We must now consider the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as also the disadvantage which might happen upon the good or bad success of
the battel; which though it be in all affairs doubtful and uncertain, yet out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
respects it was now both those in extremity. We will say that the then
chief moving cause was, to drive the <hi>French</hi> Army out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to restore those
of <hi>Aragon</hi> to their Kingdom, out of which they were driven by K. <hi>Charls.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Princes might in all liklihood have compast this their intention by other
more safe, and more secure means. For what disturbance might they meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
in the enterprise which they were to endeavor against the <hi>French</hi> in the very
Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> from that Army which hasted to pass over the Mountains,
and was to dissolve of it self? And say that those people should be routed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
should therefore the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> be disposed of according to the
pleasure of the Italian Victors? No certainly, for the King had already left strong
Garisons there of his best Soldiers to secure it. The victory could not be so great, and
favorable for the <hi>Italians,</hi> but that they must have lost some of their men; so as
if they had a mind to attempt any thing upon the affairs of <hi>Naples,</hi> it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for them to have gone with all their Forces upon that enterprise, then to give
battel to those, who did not any waies oppose their design, since when they should
have overcome them, they were to go with that Army, lessened by the Battel, and
wearied with marching, to the main business of taking the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi>
where the things offered at by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would have had easier success if he had
entred the Kingdom with greater Forces, and as he was willingly received by the
City of <hi>Naples,</hi> whither he might come at first with those few men he had, so
would the rest of the Cities willingly have revolted from the <hi>French,</hi> and have put
themselves under the obedience of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> if they had seen he had Forces suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to defend himself, and to make good their rebellion. But say that the Colleagues
would have secured themselves yet better from the <hi>French,</hi> to the end, that their
intentions upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> might not be hindred or diverted; had
it not been better for them to go with the Army of the league to find out Monsieur
<hi>d' Orleans,</hi> who at the same time had possest himself of the City of <hi>Novara,</hi> to drive
him out of <hi>Italy,</hi> together with those of his party who had setled themselves there,
then to follow those, who did of themselves that which was most desired by the
league; to wit, hasten back over the mountains? Nay, it may be further said, that unless
the <hi>French</hi> should be necessitated, as seeing their King in danger, as also that Army
which was pursued by the <hi>Italians,</hi> they would not peradventure have sent at that
time more men into <hi>Italy,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>d'Orleans</hi> would not have had any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to have possest himself of <hi>Nevara,</hi> which did afterwards redound to the great
prejudice of the Colleagues, and particularly to the business of <hi>Naples:</hi> For part
of those Forces which were promised and intended to assist <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the Kingdom, marched to the recovery of <hi>Novara,</hi> out of desire whereof,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59987:85"/>
                  <hi>Lodowick Sforza</hi> did at last draw himself out of the league. Whence it appears,
that it was rather revenge, or vain-glory, then any just reason which the Princes
proposed unto themselves in this their confederacy, that moved them to resolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fighting the French Army.</p>
               <p>But let us now consider more particularly, what of advantage, what of good the
Colleagues might have got, if they had had the better of that Battel. The best
which they could hope for, for all these their pains and dangers, could be nothing
else but the routing of those Forces, which were not likely to make War any
more in <hi>Italy;</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> had as then no reason to think of any Transalpine
Affairs. It may be the person of the King, who was then in the Army, might
peradventure be considerable, if he had faln into the power of the Colleagues;
But both his life in that hurly burly was exposed to great danger, and say he had
been taken prisoner, he might have found many waies how to eseape. And say al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
had faln out according to the wish of the Colleagues, what would the <hi>Italians</hi>
have gotten by having so great a Prisoner, but the drawing upon themselves an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
of Foreiners, which would still have put them into greater troubles and
dangers? That warlike Nation, which was at this time more then at any other,
devoted to their King, would not have sat down by such an indignity, such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
without revenging it with their own Forces, and by drawing other Transalpine
Nations who wished not well to the glory of <hi>Italy,</hi> especially in Military Affairs to
joyn with them.</p>
               <p>Let us see an example of this in what followed the next Age after; where we
shall find that the imprisonment of King <hi>Francis,</hi> though taken by so great a Prince
as was <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, to whom none of the Princes of the League, no not the
whole League it self was to be compared, produced nothing, but longer, and more
heavy Wars, which ended not till the conquerors had yeelded many things to the
conquered. But on the contrary, let us imagine into what ruine <hi>Italy</hi> would have
faln, if the Army of the League had been routed and defeated, the Enemy being in
the State of <hi>Milan</hi> wherein are so many and so noble Cities, for defence whereof
there were no other Forces on foot, then those which were to hazard themselves
in that Battel; and to raise another Army which might be able to make head against
so powerful enemies, and so victorious, would be a business of some time, and
very hard to do if not impossible. And if the very name of the <hi>French,</hi> and the fame
of their Forces had made the way to so great a victory easie to them, and so easie the
conquest of so noble a Kingdom, what mischief had they not reason to expect, if
by the discomfeiture of that Army, the Forces, not onely as formerly, of the Kings
of <hi>Aragon,</hi> should have been beaten of whole <hi>Italy,</hi> and also such forein Forces
as could be ready to afford any succor, for in that Army were all the Soldiers, that
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had in <hi>Italy?</hi> So as there was not any State which upon such an
accident could promise it self security. Affairs then standing upon this foot, who
can praise the advice taken by the confederates, of fighting the <hi>French?</hi> But on
the other side there want not other reasons to plead for the honor, wisdom, and
maturity of the <hi>Italians</hi> in this action, to boot with that noble daring which
can by no means be denied them, it is very likely that the flourishing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and prosperity of <hi>Charls</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> began at that time to make him be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and suspected not onely by all the Italian Princes, but also not very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the King of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> insomuch as he who had called him into <hi>Italy</hi> did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
repent his rash advice, and he who did not withstand him, blamed himself
for his slackness, and irresolution: so as they agreed all together to abate the so great
power of that King, and to curb his prosperity, and his thoughts of further achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
If then the King had been suffered to return without any let, safe and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
into his Kingdom, was it not to be feared, that the <hi>French</hi> not content
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59987:86"/>
with their having got the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> would pass over the Mountains the
next year again with greater Forces? to what danger would the Dukedom of
<hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Tuscany</hi> have been exposed? upon which States it was known that the
<hi>French</hi> had set their minds, neither would they have spared the rest, if they had had
any opportunity offered them of advancing further.</p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Italians</hi> should have seemed but to doubt their beating those Soldiers,
who were but the remainder of an Army which had first past the Mountains, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad left a good part of their Forces in several Garrisons in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi>
many whereof were likewise dissipated through several accidents; what hopes had
they to withstand their entire, and much greater Forces, with which they were to
return the next year on this side the Mountains to new enterprises? Nor had they
any reason to despair of victory, since the Colleagues had an Army for number of
men much grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er then the Enemy, commanded by experienced and valiant Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
well provided both of Curasiers and Light horse, well disposed to all actions,
and which were to fight with people opprest with fear, and who may be said to
have almost run away already of themselves; especially the advantage considered
which the assai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts for the most part have. It was further considered, that the
French Army had done nothing whereby to be dreaded, or to cool the courage of
other men; since the <hi>French</hi> had not onely not met with any occasion of fighting,
but had not so much as seen the face of an Enemy; since the Enemy was the rather to
apprehend this encounter, for that it was unexpected, they being accustomed to find
all passages open, not needing to make their way by the sword. Nor was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
small which they might promise unto themselves, by beating a victorious
Army, and a warlike Nation, the person of so great a King being also in that
Army; wherefore in such a case, the French-mens courage was rather to fail, then
to avial them. And it was to be beleeved that the Enemies to that Crown would the
sonner appear against them, as the Emperor <hi>Maximilian, Henry</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> would continue the more firm to the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
confederacie. Then what courage, or what hope of succour would those
French-men have, who were left behind for the defence of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples?</hi>
and the City of <hi>Novara,</hi> which though it were back'd with the Kings men, who
to this purpose kept his Army a long time together after the Battel, was reduced
to so great streights by the Colleagues, as the King was compelled to yeed it up
upon Articles to <hi>Sforza;</hi> would it not soon have been taken by the sole reputation of
the victo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y? Neither would this have been an occasion of dissention (as afterwards
it was) amongst the Colleagues, and which bereft them of the chiefest advantage
which that confederacie could hope for.</p>
               <p>These are the Considerations which we may conceive did move those Princes
to resolve upon following the French Army, and to join battel with it. But that
which amongst such diversity of reasons seems more answerable to reason, is, that
the Battel was not occasioned out of an absolute resolution and resolute advice, but
happened party out of necessity, both Armies being already drawn very near, and
partly upon a resolution taken by the Commanders upon the very place. But the
Princes of the Leagues truest intention was to necessitate the King of <hi>France,</hi> when
he should see so great a preparation for War to be made against him, to hasten his
departure the more, and to enforce him to draw so many more of his men from the
K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ngdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> that so he might make his passage the surer. And that the
Kingdom not having sufficient Garisons to defend it, might the more easily fall
into the power of the <hi>Aragoneses,</hi> for whom the same Colleagues were preparing
a Fleet by Sea to assault it. Nor was it judged by the example of things formerly
past, that the States of <hi>Italy</hi> were free from the insolencies of the <hi>French,</hi> unless
the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for <hi>France;</hi> since in his former passage to the enterprise of <hi>Naples,</hi> though he was
more necessitated to make hast, and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he might meet with opportunity of pleasing himself, or procuring any thing of
advantage?</p>
               <p>The Colleagues seeking to provide for these mischiefs, &amp; rather to shun new incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,
then endeavor to repair their past losses, they thought it the best course
that their Army should follow that of the Kings, so to keep him in perpetual jealousie
and suspition, and hinder him if he should make any attempt; hoping likewise, as they
had like to have done, that this was the way to make the King come to some good
agreement with them, which had been often endeavored, and not without hopes of
good success, even when the Camps were very near together. But the Colleagues,
incited either by the Armies being so near together, by the desire of glory, or hope
of victory; or perchance being inforc'd so to do, as it usually falls out when the
Enemies Army is reduced to straight passages, they fought the <hi>French;</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
of the Leagu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reason to hope for victorie, then to fear loss in that daies fight, as the effect did
in part prove, it being the common opinion, that had not their own men been put
into great disorder, by their own light-horse, who fell too soon to pillage the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Camp, they would have had a full and glorious victory. But though the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
should have succeeded otherwise, they knew the state of affairs to be such, as

                  </gap> the Kings behalf could not occasion them those great mischiefs,
which upon such an occasion have been considered, the Kings Forces not being so
great when most entire, much less being much weakened by the conflict, as could
prove very formidable. Such like events may teach us not to attempt such things
in which it is hard to resolve, and wherein the profit which may accrue is very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
nor to bring our selves to such a condition, as the necessity of putting on another
resolve, bereaves us of choice. Nor will it be a less useful precept for Princes, to
have a great care, and to be very well advised in chusing their Commanders, which
are to have the chief imployment in great enterprises; for if their nature and
customs be not conformable to the thoughts and intentions of the Prince, it is in
vain to give them any Instructions or Commissions; for oft-times a resolution is to
be put on upon the main concern, wherein a mans natural inclinations may prevail
over whatsoever strict command which the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               <p>AMongst those things which fall into discourse when people talk of
weighty State Affairs, and of War enterprises, one, and a chief one,
is that of Leagues, and Confederacies, in which divers Potentates do
joyn, either out of some particular design of their own, or for their
better securitie, or to abate the power of others. And the weakness of
Potentates who are wanting in the antient military worth and discipline, hath been
the occasion why we read of more examples of such unions, in these latter times, then
we have heard of formerly. So as now adaies, as also in some later times past,
when any great enterprise is debated upon, recourse is forthwith had to Leagues,
by means and vertue whereof, it is usually thought, that greater ends may be
compassed, then can be hoped for from the peculiar power and vertue of any one
onely State; and chiefly to curb and keep under those Forces which do threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
whole Christendom with most danger and damage. Those who speak in the
behalf of these Leagues, and who heighten the hopes thereof, use these or the
like reasons.</p>
               <p>First, because reason, &amp; natures self doth teach us, that the multiplication of the force
and vertue of the movers, makes the motion the greater, and more powerful; and that
power and perfection which in humane affairs is denied to one alone, is easily found
amongst many. There is hard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y any one so weak, or so little befriended by the
gifts of nature or fortune, who may not be some help to another, by adding that
little which he hath to the much more of the others. This is the cause why in
humane actions, and especially in such as are of the nobler sort, the perfectest
are those which are most compounded: The best harmonie is composed of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ones of V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yces. The perfectest State Governments (alwaies provided that
they be essential and not meer Idea's) are those which being composed of the Three
best, do comprehend the perfections of all the Three; and it is easie to observe
the like in many other things. And <hi>Aristotle,</hi> when he would shew the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which proceeds in every thing from this concourse and union of many, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the example well known in those times of publick banquets and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where those wherein many were imployed, some in one thing, some in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
proved more noble and sumptuous, then those which were made by
any one onely, though never so wealthy Citizen. Let us then gather by this, that
such Forces likewise, wherein several Potentates do concur, for some noble and
important action, where every one lends his assistance and advice, will be fitter to
atchieve any great enterprise, then those of one onely, though never so great a
Prince.</p>
               <p>In War there are several Offices, and several imployments, whereunto we see
that one N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who are able to imploy several people, and several Forces, as Leagues may do,
(especially if they be made between puissant Princes) may have great designs;
for they shall have wherewith to offend, and defend, both by Land and Sea, and
numbers enough of Soldiers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But besides this, many things are requisite for the maintaining a long War;
Arms, Ammunition, Victuals, Money, and other things, the which no one State
can sufficiently furnish, at least not without much incommodity, for any long time:
but where many joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any thing, nor for the difficulties which are occasioned thereby. Moreover, for great
enterprises, as they cannot be so soon effected, so are they subject to the hazard
of ill success, when they depend upon one onely Commander, who when he is
lost, there is never another of equal authority, valor and experience left to succeed
him; for there are but few of those that are fit for much pains-taking, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of great affairs. Insomuch as that State is very happy, which in more
then one Age meets with a generous and warlike Prince; and that Prince is very
fortunate who when he will not follow the Wars in his own person, hath a Subject
of his so qualified, as becomes him to be who is to command an Army, when the
War is difficult, and of importance; which is the cause why we often-times see
great enterprises which are we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> begun, precipitate into great disorders and
ruines.</p>
               <p>The death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, without any legitimate Heirs fit to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Government of such an Empire, and of so weighty affairs, kept the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> (of which two Nations his valiant and unconquered
Army did consist) from following his prosperous course, and from conquering the
Well, as he had done the East, and which whilst he was alive, he had proposed to
himself to do. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> chiefest ruine arose from the want of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders;
for having placed their hopes in one onely <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they were forced
to send for him back out of <hi>Italy,</hi> to defend themselves in <hi>Africa</hi> against <hi>Scipio;</hi>
and his fortune forgoing him, when he was beaten they knew not whom to betake
themselves unto, to uphold their tottering Commonwealth. But in Leagues there
is no such hazard run; since the best Commanders that are in any of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Princes States may be imploied, and the Princes themselves may serve upon
an urgent occasion; so as one Commander being lost, another may be found to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him, of as great excellency and worth. For every State hath usually in all
Ages had some one man more eminent then the rest, unto whom is greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
they have recourse. So as a League, if we suppose it to be like a well
Fabrickt humane body, may, since it hath the strength of many Dominions uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in it, be resembled to <hi>Briar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </hi> for strength; for as he had a hundred hands, to
make use of as he pleased in several actions, so many do lend help to such a League,
and make it stronger and fitter for any undertaking. Moreover when we have
to do with a very powerful Prince, as it falls out in great Enterprises, if we will
weaken his strength, we may endeavor chiefly to keep his forces divided, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
in several parts, for so they are lessened, and become less apt to make resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
but as this will be hard for a single Prince to do, though a great one, for
he who will drive another man from his own home must be much stronger then be;
so is it more easily done when many are confedrates together, and this not onely
because several <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great and difficult enterprise was to be undertaken (not to speak of antient times)
but of more modren ones, against the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> two Nations, which
have governed and domineered in these latter times with great fame and force,
recourse was had to Leagues, to <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

could not continue on their enterprise with like success as at the first. And hath
not this last Age seen one of the most signal and illustrious Naval victories that was
ever heard of? which was the fight at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> which was won from the <hi>Turks</hi>
by the League of the Christian Princes. But let us add somewhat more in pursuit
of our former considerations. Greatest enterprises, though happily begun, are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
left imperfect, when they depend upon the Forces of one only Prince; for the
rest of his neighboring Princes, either out of envy, or fear of his greater prosperity,
take up Arms against him to make him give over the hopes of further acquisitions,
and bethink himself of defending his home-affairs; and to keep the scales more
equal between him and his neighbors, and to take away the jealousies of State,
which are of all other things most dangerous, and whereof we have infinite
examples. But when a weighty War is to be undertaken by the Forces of many
Joint-Potentates, this suspi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion ceases; for Leagues are usually made with other
Princes and neighboring States, or with such as are concern'd in common interest.
And this Amity or Confederacie doth not only secure those States with whom the
Confederacie is contracted, so as the one fears not the other; but it preserves each
of them from the injuries that any may go about to do to any of the Confederates.
For one State supporting another by reason of their convention, things are so well
and stoutly govern'd as People not being able to worst them, keep from molesting
them, knowing that by offending any one Confederate, they shall draw upon them
the Forces of all the rest, and hasten their own ruine. Every one of these Princes
may then by reason of their strait conjunction and confederacie with others, more
boldly and more resolutely undertake and accomplish any whatsoever enterprise,
without danger of being diverted by any particular interest of his own. And all these
Considerations are better confirm'd by many notable examples. <hi>Greece</hi> was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that powerful Prince of <hi>Persia,</hi> with an infinite number of men
both by Sea and Land; almost all the several People of that Province, united and
confeder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted together against this so great a warlike power: And such was the
efficacie of this un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on, as that though one only <hi>Greece</hi> was to withstand the Forces
of almost all the Eastern Nations who were flock'd together to that enterprise, but
still under the Imperial command and conduct of one and the same King <hi>Xerxes,</hi>
they did not only make their part good, but repulsed so puissant an Enemy, much to
his own prejudice</p>
               <p>The associate War which happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ned in the time of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> wherein
many Associates and Confederates of the <hi>Romans</hi> did conspi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e together against the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59987:88"/>
Commonwealth of <hi>Rome;</hi> though the Confederates were all of them but weak
people, as the <hi>Maruceni, Vestini, Samnites, Lucans,</hi> and other of their neighbors,
yet was this War held one of the most dangerous that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> did ever
sustain: For these people had join'd themselves together with much fervor, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
themselves of the Roman Nobility, who had first promised them, and then
denied them the liberty of being Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi> And in these later Ages, whole
<hi>Germany</hi> having confederated together against the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, was
able to raise so numerous an Army, though all the German Princes did not concur
therein, as did much perplex and endanger <hi>Charls.</hi> Which examples prove what
many Forces, though weaker being taken apart, can do when join'd together,
against one potent Prince. These then may seem sufficient reasons and examples to
ground a favorable conclusion in the behalf of Leagues, and to make them be held
a strong and powerful means to order great enterprises by, and to bring them to a
good end.</p>
               <p>Yet there be many good Considerations which may be alleadged on the contrary
part; so as he who shall mind realities, and not what the magnificencie of name or
preparations do promise, will doubt much whether these Leagues and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
do really prove what they appear to be. It is most certain, that as the truest
perfection consists in union, and that whatsoever will partake of that, must be
reduced to this; so may all our humane actions prove the more successful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
the more reducible they are to this unity; and if it happen to some sometimes
otherwise, it is because those some are not capable thereof either of themselves, or
because their corrupted customs will not suffer them so to be: But it is not to be
denied, but that in all humane actions, chiefly such wherein great affairs are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
and more chiefly in matters of War, after mature advice taken, sudden exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
is requisite; and that it is necessary to reduce all things as much as may be
to this unity: So as the soveraign authority consist in one only, and not in many;
for the multiplicity of those that concur (especially by way of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rity) in the same
action, doth not help, but rather disorder and confound. Then look how much
harder it is to reduce things to an unity in a League, the less gallant do they prove,
and less fit for prosecution of great affairs: For they contain, and almost naturally,
such contrarieties, as must occasion the sudden corruption thereof. Several are the
thoughts of several men, the customs of Nations different, and (which in this case
is of most importance) the counsels and resolutions by which confederate Princes
govern themselves, do not only differ, but are for the most part contrary, according
as State-jealousies are apt to breed occasion of falling out. The powerful desire
after Rule never suffers right to be known, nor people to be there with contented:
It is therefore to be observed, that in all Ages the greatest and most signal actions in
War have been done and accomplish'd by the worth and prosperity of one only
Prince, or at least of one sole Potentate, with a series of divers Princes and Captains
who have commanded therein. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, the Commonwealth of
<hi>Rome, Charls</hi> the Great, and in these latter time; the Ottoman Empire, not to
mention many others who have been great and potent, though not altogether so
highly cry'd up, did all of them arise to that height of glory and power by the
power and worth of one only Command, with the true and proper military discipline
of each of them, and under the conduct of one and the same Principality. On the
contrary, Leagues shew their weakness at the very first sight: For company and
multipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>city denotes always imperfection, and in this particular makes it be known,
that those things which a Prince or a Commonwealth cannot by reason of their
weakness do of themselves, and by their own Forces, they seek to effect it by the
company and help of others. Wherefore (as it hath been said) in this respect
Leagues have been more frequently used in these latter Ages, then of old: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59987:89"/>
many Princes and States are failing in military worth and courage, and not able of
themselves to do any notable action; so as one Nation, or one Prince not being
able to overcome another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all of them wanting the excellencie of good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
he who hath at any time endeavored to advance himself by some design, hath
been forced to have recourse to the advantage of Leagues; of which <hi>Italy,</hi> since
by reason of the declination of the Western Empire, she hath been divided into so
many members, and Scignories, hath in particular afforded many examples, which
may serve to teach whatsoever belongs to these Leagues: whereof we do not read
of any great good effect which hath ensued at last, or at least which have continued
long in their first prosperity; for their Forces, though powerful enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when met withal by contrary respects, and wearied in their first attempts,
have soon gone but lamely off. And he who shall well consider such particulars as
are most necessary in great undertakings, will easily see how badly they do corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond
in Leagues. Deliberations would be wise and mature, but not slow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable;
execution would be speedy and bold; counsels are oft-times to be
taken upon unexpected accidents; the end of all ought to be one and the same,
though the Offices, Degrees, and Authorities be different; the respect and aim one
and the same, whereunto all resolutions do tend; to wit, the safety, glory and the
greatness of that Prince or State, for whom the War is made; the reward and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
one and the same, and alike the loss and shame, so as the possibility of have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
means to lay the fault on another, do not retard the doing of what is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itting.</p>
               <p>These are things which have alwaies been hard, and rare to be found; yet they
may the more easily be met withal in an enterprise which is undertaken by one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wise Prince, or by one well governed Commonwealth; But in Leagues all
things run counter byass to these important affairs. It is not alwaies generositie, but
fear which makes a Prince take up Arms, which likewise makes others joyn with
him, who otherwise do much differ from him in desires, and interest: but that brunt
being over, and every one being in their former particular, and more natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he who dreads War bends to idleness, and willingly takes all occasions to
change War for Peace; and he who was become a friend by reason of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencie,
not out of any good will, discovering his real affection upon some other
occasion, or by reason of some change, returns to be not onely as formerly, an
Enemy, but more inveterate then before; so as these Ties of Common interests
being soon loosened either by particular interest, or by some other affection, hatred,
confusion, and disorder doth thereupon ensue.</p>
               <p>The Moralists <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay, That friendship cannot long continue between those where
one and the same thing is not interchangeably given and received; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
true friendship is onely found, where the end is not that which is advantag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous
or delightful (because equal correspondencie is not usually there) but what is
honest, which alwaies is, and does still continue the same on all behalfs. In the
Friendship or Leagues of Princes, every one hath his own conveniencie, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
benefit for his aimed at end, and then the like of others onely so far, as by
accident it may square with his. But it commonly falls out, that what makes for
one, makes against another; so as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame things cannot please all: wherefore a
thousand accidents do easiry cause diversity of opinions, contentions and breaches,
so as hardly any League hath been able to preserve it self any long time. It is also
usually seen that no man minds what is recommended to the care of many; and
therefore in Leagues, which are fastned together but with weak Ties, whilst one
doth either trust upon anothers provisions, or is ill satisfied with others omissions,
men neglect their own daties, and study more to pick a hole in anothers coat, then
to mind his own business. The ignomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y which may in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ue upon such defaults, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59987:89"/>
the loss of reputation, which use to be great incitements to a noble mind, are not
so much valued in things which are undertaken and negotiated by many together,
because the way lies fair to excuse ones self, by laying the fault upon another, or at
least the fault is lessened by others being sharers therein.</p>
               <p>Thus that common benefit, which is so magnified and cried up, and which
ought to be their onely object, is found onely in a certain fancied Idea, and in a
<hi>potentia remota,</hi> or in a vain and useless appearance, whilst none endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to its true, essential, and perfect being, by laying aside their own proper
and peculiar advantage, and by directing his actions to the common good of his
Colleagues. So as he who shall duly consider what the first intention is of making
a League, and with what degrees it is proceeded in afterwards, and to what ends it
is directed, will by many evident examples find it quickly so transformed, as though
it meet not with any external forces, it easily dissolves and moulders away of it
self. Leagues made by Christians against the Turks have oft-times in particular
met with these impediments and difficulties; the League between Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Sixt, and the three most powerful Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Kingdoms of
<hi>Spain, Fance,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> was stipulated with
great hopes and noble intentions; the <hi>Venetian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Fleet came into the
<hi>Archipelag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> where they had some prosperous success; but the forces of the other
Colleagues were in vain expected the first year, and it ended the second year before
it had fully effected any thing, by reason of the discords which arose between the
Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which were occasioned by the division of <hi>Naples,</hi>
so as these Princes turned their Arms each upon other, which were intended against
the Infidels. The league made between Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi>
the Fift, and the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> against <hi>Sultan Soliman,</hi> likewise ended
almost as soon as it was begun; and it is too well known, as being of rescent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
what occasions of victories were thereby lost, and out of what respects.
But what greater thing could be expected from any League, then from that which

Fleet which was destied for so great affair in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and to make the best sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the year pass over without any advantage; whereupon all other things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may have the same intentions in preserving it.</p>
               <p>What greater reason can one Prince have to promise unto himself the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of friendship and fidelity from another, then had the Commonwealth of

of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, and exposed her State to so much labor, and
danger; and did so long maintain a great part of the expence of a weighty War,
first, to free the Seconds own person from Prison, and then his Sons; yet (as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually

that many times the Colleagues began to square but badly in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of their agreement, which tends much to the prejudice of the common
interest. Whilst the last League against <hi>Selinus</hi> the Turkish Emperor was in treaty,
and when it was so high time to relieve <hi>Cyprus,</hi> it was long and importunately argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Rome,</hi> where they were first to imploy the Forces of the League; and some of
the Spanish Ministers were so blinded with their particular interest, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and stifly maintain'd it to the very great prejudice and loss of time, that
as soon as the League should be fully agreed upon, the Forces thereof should march
to the Sea-coasts of <hi>Africa,</hi> to take in such places as they thought might make most
for the advantage of <hi>Spain;</hi> not weighing that whilst they should leave their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

and which reason could not perswade before.</p>
               <p>But if these peculiar respects be at first concealed, they break forth in the process
of time, and work sometime worser effects in such of the Colleagues as are either
weakest, or do confide most in the Confederacie. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> though
falling off from the other Colleagues, he joined with great offers and prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice;</hi> yet when the City of <hi>Brescia</hi> was recovered,
he would keep it for himself, and appropriate the first fruit of victory to himself,
which by the former, and by renewed capitulations was destin'd to others. Pope
<hi>Clement</hi> the Seven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> join'd
together in League against <hi>Caesar;</hi> but their ends were, if not apparently contrary,
at least intrinsecally different. The King of <hi>France</hi> desired by all means to free the
Crown of <hi>France</hi> from some prejudice which he had done it by the former agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to set his Sons at liberty, who were left with him in nature
of Hostages: But on the contrary, the other Confederates chief endeavour was,
to take the Dukedom of <hi>Milan</hi> from <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to secure <hi>Italy</hi> from his power.
The enterprise was begun with prosperous success, the Italian Princes doing readily
what became them; but the King of <hi>France,</hi> when he knew how to obtain his ends
by another way, and began to suspect the Colleagues constancie, did neither make
War on the other side the Mountains, nor did he send his Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> as he
was bound to do: Whereupon the League which was made with great preparation,
with good beginning, and better hopes, ended in an agreement, which was volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and advantagious on the Kings behalf by the recovery of his Children, but
inforced, and not over-secure on the behalf of the other Colleagues, who fell short of
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir conceived hopes, being abandoned by their Friend and Confederate, the King.</p>
               <p>To know then the truth amidst this diversity of reasons and examples, we must
distinguish and consider apart for what occasions, and with what respects every
League is made, what the end therein proposed is, and upon what terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
it is concluded; for by these particulars we may the better know what good
or bad may be expected by joyning together in League, and whether the League
be likely to be of short, or of long duration. Sometimes Leagues are made by
Princes or Popularities out of necessary defence, and to provide opportunely for
their own safeties; the Confederates obliging themselves by particular and stated
obligations to defend each others State, when they shall be assaulted by any others
from without: And such Leagues as these have proved profitable, as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the preservation of Peace, and to a certain and honest end; and whilst no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59987:90"/>
but the common interest is treated of, so as they have all the same object, as
well in maintaining, as in making the Confederacie. The Confederacie made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Pope, the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Commonwealth of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Milan,</hi> and other lesser Italian Princes, did long preserve the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
was for a while very advantagious for the Colleagues; for the only drift thereof
was to constitute some assured bounds to every of their powers, and to settle them
in a just temperature, making the Confederates thereby the stronger and more able
to withstand any one that should attempt any thing against them. Sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
Leagues are made for more necessary self-defence, and which must suddenly be
actuated; to wit, when a State is assaulted by one more powerful, and that the
neighboring Princes, lest themselves might suffer if they should permit a neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power to grow too great by the ruine of that State, do take up Arms jointly for
the defence thereof, in whose defence they know their own safeties are concerned,
since they might soon incur the like danger, if they should not keep him at a further
distance from the others home. And such a League may also at first do gallant and
memorable things, if it so fall out that the condition of affairs being altered in the
same League, and the Colleagues interests becoming different, they will advance
further with those Forces, and with more full intentions to ruine that Foe-Potentate,
and take occasion by joining in League to increase in State and power. When
these respects, and their contraries already han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led are considered, these Leagues
do usually lose all their efficacie, since they fail in their chiefest and surest ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
when the truest conjunction fails, which is that of Princes minds, thoughts
and designs, whence conformable actions, and such as are of great efficacie and
worth do arise.</p>
               <p>Almost all the People of <hi>Greece</hi> join'd together to defend themselves against
<hi>Xerxes</hi> his Forces, a mighty King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who came to assault them with an
innumerable Army; and they got that famous Victory by Sea at <hi>Salamis,</hi> which
furnish'd them at the same time with prosperous successes at Land, where they put
the same King to flight: And <hi>Greece</hi> was preserved at that time by vertue of that
League from so great a danger, against which it appeared almost impossible that she
could defend herself. So likewise in these latter times, the Pope, and <hi>Philip</hi> King
of <hi>Spain</hi> join'd with the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> in defence of the Kingdom of
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> (to whom that Kingdom, as part of her Territories, did chiefly belong)
when it was assaulted by powerful Turkish Forces; and having put together a
powerful and numerous Navy, they bore away that famous and singular Victory,
which will be celebrated in all Ages; the Turkish Forces were routed and shattered
at Sea, and their honor and courage lessened: But when all this was done, what
other thing did the victorious <hi>Grecians,</hi> answerable to the hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Victory, the whole fruit whereof at their reurn home ended
in the dividing of the booty? So also the Christian League by Sea, did not only
spend the rest of that Autumn, a fit time for any enterprise which they could have
undertaken, after the honor they had won in the aforesaid Victory, in dividing the
prey, and in other matters of small moment, but also spent all the next en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uing
Spring and Summer idly, without being able so much as to keep together, so to
keep the Enemy from recruiting, to the great, notable, and woful example of what
we are now in treaty of, and to shew that the Forces of Leagues are weak, though
made between potent Princes. The purchase which is got, or which is hoped for,
cannot be so equally divided and agreed upon, but that some of the Confederate
Princes will happen to have a greater share then the rest; and every increase, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'r so little, doth easily cause jealousie, or at least envy in the rest. Almost all the
Potentates of <hi>Europe</hi> convened together in the famous League of <hi>Cambray</hi> against
the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> allured by the hopes of being able to divide her
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59987:91"/>
noble, rich, and flourishing State, which was so much a more prevailing object in
the minds of the confederate Princes to make them endeavor by their joynt Forces
to suppress the Commonwealth, and bereave her of all her riches. But as soon as the
Colleagues first design began to discover themselves, and begot jealousies and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
amongst them, insomuch, as the very same Princes who had conspired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to ruine the Commonwealth, did soon assist and succor her, being become
bitterer Enemies one to another, and amongst themselves (each others greatness
becoming formidable and hateful to their companions) then they had been before
out of the same reason to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> against whom they had joyntly taken up
Arms.</p>
               <p>It was not hard, though not very reasonable, for <hi>Lodowick</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> being blinded with the same desire of enlarging their
Territories, to joyn together in driving the <hi>Aragonians</hi> from out the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples,</hi> but afterwards they did as easily disagree, touching the dividing of what
they had got; So as the League might help to bereave others of that Kingdom, but
other Forces were requisite for the appropriation of it to ones self, and thereunto
the proper and peculiar vertue of the Militia, and of good counsel was likewise
required. Leagues use likewise to prove advantageous when many Potentates
take up Arms against one new Prince, who is yet but weak, and not well
setled in his State; as was seen by the example of the League made by the
Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> against the <hi>Scalligers,</hi> and certain other petty Lords or
Tyrants; for Leagues being of some validity in their beginning, and not meeting
with any stout resistance, may at the very first effort have ruined the Enemy against
whom such Legues were made, but when they have to do with a Potentate of
esteem, though he be inferior of himself, to the power of the Colleagues, they
have not produced any great effects; as may be known by divers confederacies
made by the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> against the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice;</hi> against
which, as being become formidable to them all, though all <hi>Italy</hi> hath more then
once taken up Arms, yet she hath been able to defend herself against such forces;
for the first Efforts being withstood, the rest proved less difficult, by reason of the
usual weakness which Leagues are soon reduced unto. And it might have succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so with her likewise, in the times of greater danger in the Leagues of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
had not <hi>Alviano</hi> with his unseasonable resolution, of immaturely hastning on the
the Battel, drawn that ruin upon the Commonwealth, which she might easily
have escaped by temporising, and the League have been dissolved thereupon, as it
was not long after.</p>
               <p>Now by reassuming all these considerations, these general and true Conclusions
may be thereout asserted; that Leagues may prove beneficial, either when they
aim simply at defence, and at the maintaining of Peace, by the reputation of such
an union; or when one that is not able to defend himself by his own particular
Forces, is actually assaulted by one that is more powerful then he, and whom he
is not able to resist of himself. For if no other good be got by such unions, yet
the business is spun out the longer, and there may be a way sound out to deviate
imminent ruine, by diversion. But he who will conside too much upon such U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
or be less diligent in negotiating those Affairs which of himself he is not
able to do, will soon finde he is deceived; nay if he be not the more cautious, and
circumspect, he may become a prey as well to him who appears to be his friend, as
to his formally declared enemies. Whence it is inferr'd that to make Leagues
out of a meer and voluntary election of increasing Territories, is very uncertain,
and falacious, yet may prove good if many who be strong and powerful joyn against
one that is weak; but at last the fire is greater which breaks out amongst the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues
themselves, then that which they carried home to another mans house. But
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59987:91"/>
that a State which is already grown great and powerful, may be opprest by the
strength of Leagues, unless it begin first to totter by reason of its internal disorders,
from what the experience of so many past passages teacheth, and from reason
which is corroborated by custom, is a thing which no man ought to promise
to himself, unless he delight in flattering himself with vain and prejudical
hopes.</p>
               <p>There remains yet some things to be stated which have formerly been alleadged
in the behalf of Leagues, lest they may get more credit amongst men then they
deserve. To that then which was said, That the multiplicity of the movers, make
the greater motion, and things are better done by many, especially things of the
highest nature, then by reason of the imper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ection and weakness of our humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
can be effected by a few, it may be answered; That it is true, that the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of many is requisite to the affecting of great things; but it is also as true, that
for the right carrying on of affairs, it is requisite that the second causes (to speak
in terms of natural Philosophie) should be subordinate to the first, as is seen in
the Order and Government of the world: So doubtlesly no great enterprises can
be effected without Armies, Commanders, and a thousand other necessaries; but by
how much the more all these are constituted under the power of one alone, by which
their order and union is the greater, the work they take in hand will prove so much
the more excellent and perfect. A Prince, though single in what he goes about, is
not forbidden the making use of Soldiers of several Nations in his Militia, to the
end that he may have an Army (as hath been said) fitter for any military action,
in businesses which are at once undertaken against several States, so as all of them
be to be understood as Enemies, though they be not confederates; but the truest
and securest rule in this case would be, to be so careful and diligent in training up,
and in disciplining a Prince his own Militia, as that he may be able to provide for
all actions of War, out of men of his own Dominions, as we see those have done
who have done the most glorious actions. The same may be said of other things
belonging to War, for which a wise Prince ought so to provide, as that he may rely
upon himself, and not upon the friendship of others. As for the assertion, that
Leagues do abound in Chiestains fit to command Armies; this proves not alwaies
true by reason of the scarcity of excellent men which hath been found in all Ages;
or say that such be to be found amongst confederate Princes, they use to cause
more of discord and contention, by reason that every one pretends to have the
supreme command, and chiefest honor in the Militia; and more of prejudice to
the Leagues, then of profit or advantage. And if it be found that some Leagues
have effected great matters, it hath happened (though but seldom) where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
respects, which we have mentioned, have concurr'd. But in the fore-named
unions made by Christians against Infidels, no good reasons can be given which do
sute well with the business now in hand, if we speak of Leagues according to the
ordinary acception of reason of State; for such Princes or People as were signed
with the <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ciata</hi> had all of them but one onely respect and affection, which was
more prevalent with them then any other, to wit, their zeal to religion; therefore
their Forces not being onely kept together by that so powerful bond, but even
their souls, more heavenly then humane rewards being proposed to them, they
might work miraculous effects: though they could not, even in this case, altogether
sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> those disorders which are caused by the association of so many, and by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of sovereign Lords, and of Nations. The same may be said of other
Unions, as of those that did associate the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of the Hans Towns of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi>
for amongst these certain particular respects did concur, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them all, no respects of States concerning differing interests, and other
things, which have been considered in Unions which do truly and usually bear
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59987:92"/>
this name of Leagues: For when, though against Infidels, any enterprises have
been attempted by Leagues, out of other reasons, and other humane respects
concurring more principally therein, what success they have had, and how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
though usual to Leagues, may plainly be known by other examples already

and to compare it to the most celebrated and most cry'd up former times; affirming
that the antient worth is sprung up again in these our days, and in our now modern
men, which come no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> short of, nor differ from the former times or men, save in the
veneration which is given to Antiquity. They celebrate the ingenuity of modern
men, for the excellencie and perfection unto which they have brought many noble
Arts and Sciences, which were obscured and of no esteem in former times; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that of the Militia. In which respect, by the so many new-found ways of
Fortification, and expugning strong Holds by their Engines, and by other very
miraculous Inventions, it appears that the industry of Modern men hath not only
equall'd, but in many things much exceeded that of the Antients; and that the
glory of many excellent Professors of the most esteemed Arts shines cleerer in the
present Age, for that they have not only sufficiently improved that of the Militia,
but also Architecture, Painting, Sculpture, and other noble Arts and Disciplines,
which are adornments to Civil life, and have drawn them out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> obscurity wherein
they were hidden for a while.</p>
               <p>I do not differ so much from the opinion of these men; nor do I think that other
mens actions ought to be so much heightned, as that through a foolish modesty or
ignorance we should undervalue our own, when they deserve praise. But as for Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
actions, which as they are the most perspicuous to the eyes of all men, so are
they most commended, or blamed by the universality of men; when I call to mind
the warlike actions done by the Antients, and those done by our Modern men, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
that those do so far exceed these, as they can hardly admit of any comparison;
though these latter Ages, as they have produced more excellent Wits in other
Disciplines, so also may they glory in the valor and generosity of some Princes, no
less great in worth then in Forces. But that which peradventure affords no less cause
of wonder, and which affords particular matter for this discourse, is to consider
whence it is that modern Princes, though some of them have been generously
minded, and of much experience and worth in military affairs, of great possessions,
and strong in power, yet have they not been able to bring to pass such enterprises,
as for their weighty consideration, for the shortness of time, or for the easiness
wherewith they were done, can walk hand in hand with those of the Antients;
amongst whom we see one only <hi>Alexander,</hi> one <hi>Pompey,</hi> one <hi>Caesar</hi> to have subju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59987:92"/>
many entire Provinces, and conquered many Nations. And not to go further
in search of the like examples, since one Age alone, very neer this of ours, can easily
furnish us with them: Were not the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Francis</hi> the First
King of <hi>France,</hi> and (if will pass by the errors of Religion) Sultan <hi>Solyman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of the Turks, Princes great, and valiant in all acceptations? in whom so many
endowments both of Nature and Fortune did concur, as hardly any thing remained
to be desired in any of them, to make and constitute a potent Prince, and an excellent
Commander, fit to undertake any action, how great or difficult soever. What was
it that <hi>Charls</hi> with his undaunted and dreadless spirit did not undertake? Who was
ever known to be more ambitious of praise and military honor then <hi>Francis,</hi>
never weary, nor satisfied with toiling in Arms, and in leading Armies? <hi>Solyman</hi>
was so fervently bent upon purchasing glory in the Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great, was not able to asswage it; for he dyed in the Field amongst Soldiers, when
he was eighty four years old. These great Princes were so puissant, and so remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for the number to Soldiers which they led to Battel, for military Discipline, and
for all that belonged to War, as their Age had no cause to wonder at, nor to envy
any preceding times, which were famousest for such affairs. Yet he who shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
examine their actions, will find they come far short of the famous acts of
the Antients, and that they correspond not with the fame and opinion of such
Princes and of such Forces. For if we we shall consider the deeds of those few afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
not to mention so many others, what, and how many were the things done by
<hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who having in so short time vanquish'd the powerful Persian
Empire, victoriously overran the whole East, and made the terror of his w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

known to People almost unknown till then, and yet died whilst he was very young?
How many Cities and Provinces did <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> bring under the Roman
Empire? The first conquered and subjugated <hi>Pontus, Armenia, Cappadocia, Media,
Hiberia, Syria, Cylicia, Mesopotamia, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Iudaea;</hi> things which though
done, seem incredible: And the other, though he did not overrun so great a space
of Land, did no less admired things, if we will regard the condition of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered;
He quell'd the warlike <hi>Switzers, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and made so many
and so fortunate expeditions, as by his means only above eight hundred Cities were

               <p>What can be alleadged on the behalf of these modern Princes, which may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with these for military glory? <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperor led sundry times puissant
Armies upon several undertakings; but what was the fruit that he reaped by his
most famous Expeditions? The greatest and most victorious Army which he ever

the Trophy of Victory which he got there for so much expence and labor, was
only not being overcome; for his Army never saw the Enemies face. The Wars
of <hi>Germany</hi> were very difficult in this behalf; yet therein he contended not with
any Prince, whose Forces were of themselves equal to his; nor were they made
out of election, or hope of glory by new acquirements, but out of necessity, and for

thereby, was only the restoring the affairs of the Crown to the former condition,

               <p>The Wars made so long between <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperor, and <hi>Francis</hi> King of
<hi>France,</hi> with no less hatred then force, did oftentimes weary both their Armies;
but though <hi>Caesar</hi> had several times the better, yet at last the power of <hi>France</hi> was
not diminished, nor the greatness of <hi>Charls</hi> his command made any whit the larger,

might have some greater appearance of generosity, the business being very difficult,
and attempted with great courage, and much danger, and wherein the glory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be more then the advantage; yet the unhappy success of the one, did
much lessen the honor and praise won by the other; and these undertakings did
finally produce no greater effects then the acquisition of one or two Cities, and
those none of the chiefest of <hi>Africa:</hi> whereas one onely <hi>Scipio</hi> subdued <hi>Carthage,</hi>
the Head of so great an Empire, and brought all those Regions under the <hi>Roman</hi>

               <p>The Acts done by <hi>Solyman</hi> were somewhat greater then these, but not to be
compared to those of old; nor peradventure will they appear to be very famous, if
we shall consider his power, and the long time that he lived Emperor. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
much time, and many men in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> making many expeditions against
it, and yet got but one part thereof, which was none of the greatest Provinces neither.
He wan the Island of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> but what glory could redound to so mighty a Prince by
overcoming a few Knights, who were weak of themselves, and who were not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured

yet could he not add <hi>vici;</hi> for as he with great celerity over ran a great part of

any place, or establish any conquest, he retreated to within his own Confines,
having lest the greatest part and the best of his men in the Enemies Country, rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and defeated by divers accidents. These things then, and many other the like,
give just occasion of wonder, and incite curious wits to search out the truest causes
of such diversity of successes.</p>
               <p>Amongst which, nay, in the primary place, the different means of warfaring in
those times, and in these may come into consideration, wherein if we come to more
particulars, we shall meet with the use of Forts and Strong Holds, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more frequent in these our Ages, then they were in former times, the art
of building being doubtlesly in greater perfection with us then it was with them.
There is hardly any State or Country now adaies, wherein there are not many
Towns and Cities, either assisted by natural situation, or else by art reduced to
much safety by many inventions found out by modern Professors of Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so as almost every place is so fortified as it is able to hold out with a few men,
against many; and he who will in these times enter into another mans Country
with an Army intending to possess himself thereof, must first win all the Castles
and strong Holds upon the Frontiers; for it were ill advised to advance forwards
and leave such places behind them, since his victuals may be thereby hindred, and
he may several waies suffer much damage and be greatly disturbed. Moreover to be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aster of the field, &amp; leave the Cities and strong Holds unreduced, would be but to
labor hard to get possession for a few daies, which being founded only upon the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a field-Army, when that should be worsted, all things formerly won, must of
necessity fall of themselves. Hence it is, that since much time must be spent in
lying before a Fort or Citadel, and that many men are requisite to take it, and all
this often-times in vain, the attempts of modern Princes meeting with this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are not so soon nor so sadly compast, as they were by the Antients who met
not with such obstacles. And how can it be expected therefore that many great
victories should be won, since they meet with so many rubs by means of these
strong Holds? whereof we see many clear examples in the actions, of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Princes.</p>
               <p>The Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> made War several times with numerous Armies against the
King of <hi>France,</hi> propounding great matters unto himself, which proved all but
vain at last, by his having met with strong Cities well munited, such as required
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59987:93"/>
much time and labor to take them; wherefore though his success in War was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
prosperous, yet it came so late, as he hardly got any advantage or benefit
thereby; as was seen when after much time spen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

advanced, though he reduced it to his own power, yet was he at last forced
to come to agreement with the Enemy (as finding his Forces much weakened by
that acquisition) that he might fall upon another Enterprise. The same, and for the
same cause, befell <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who having sent his Son the <hi>Dolphin</hi>
with powerful Forces to the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, to the end that he might break
into <hi>Spain,</hi> promising himself easier success therein, by an unexpected assault, and
because he had assaulted at the same time other parts of <hi>Caesars</hi> Dominions with
other Armies: The <hi>Dolphin</hi> being at the very first to take <hi>Perpignano,</hi> a Fort pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon those Frontiers, he there met with such, and with so many difficulties, as
this sole encounter was sufficient to keep those Forces from pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Solyman</hi> being entred with a powerful Army into <hi>Hungarie,</hi> intending to pass
into <hi>Austria,</hi> wasted so much time in expugning the strong Hold of <hi>Buda,</hi> as it
proved the safety of that Country, and chiefly of <hi>Vienna;</hi> before the which he was
in that respect the longer a coming, and by this delay afforded the defendants the
more time to provide for their own security, so as the City being of it self very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
it may be said that she did not onely save her self, but by the preservation
thereof, all <hi>Austria,</hi> and other Provinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> were preserved then, and
several times since. So likewise in the War which was made by the same <hi>Solyman,</hi>
against the <hi>Venetians,</hi> though he was come thither himself in person, with power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Forces both by Sea and Land, yet his Forces being repulst by the Fort of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fir,</hi>
which was forcibly, but in vain attempted by the Turks, he was forced to
withdraw from before it; whereas without the help and advantage of such a strong
Hold, both the Island of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rfee,</hi> and other places belonging to that State must
have submitted to so great and warlike a preparation. By reason then of these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and such occasions, the undertaking of later times have proved less glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for matter of action, then those of former daies. When <hi>Alexander</hi> had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in Battel <hi>Darius</hi> the powerful King of <hi>Persia,</hi> he soon made himself Master
of his whole Kingdom, and passing further into the Country, even to the ocean
Sea, he found the way so ope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as the onely difficulty he met withal, was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming
of those Fortresses of Rivers and Seas which nature had furnished the
Country with: Insomuch as those who writ his actions, speak but of two strong
Holds of any importance, about which he was necessitated to spend some time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Indians</hi> in his victorious over-running so many Countries. But <hi>Pompey</hi>
made such way in following <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and in planting Trophies of victories,
in all places whereby he past in so many Eastern Provinces, amongst people that he
had rather march'd over, then over-come, as it may be easily conceived that he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
no where with any impediments by strong Holds, which were able to stop the
course of his victorious Forces. <hi>Caesar</hi> found it somewhat a harder business to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate
those people of <hi>Europe,</hi> with whom he was to fight; but this was more out
of the nature of the situations and the savageness of the people, then by reason of
any stout resistance made by any well fortified Cities; yet in the space of Ten years
he compleated so many victories, as he subjugated There hundred several sorts of
People.</p>
               <p>It these, though great Princes, and most valiant Commanders, had been put to
the expence of moneths and years in the taking of one only Fort, certainly their
atchievements would have been fewer, and their glory not so much cry'd up. This
was manifestly known by the example of other Ages: For it may be observed, that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59987:94"/>
the so great progresses of War have been made chiefly in the Eastern parts, where
at all times (peradventure by reason of the largeness of the Country) the use of
strong Holds hath been least had; so as not only <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and
<hi>Pom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ey,</hi> both of them more famous then all other Commanders, but some of the
Roman Emperors have by their Chieftains subjugated spacious Countries in a
short time: And in later times, <hi>Selymus</hi> the Great Turk by the same reason was
able totally to subjugate the Soldan of <hi>Caire's</hi> Empire; For having had the better
in many Battels, and not meeting with any strong Hold to withstand him, the
whole Country which was under that Empire fell as a prey into the power of
the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were Victors and Masters of the Field. But such acquisitions, as
they are very easie to be made, so are they but seldom peacefully possest; which
was the cause why the Roman Emperors could never so govern those furthest
Eastern parts but that either by the Inhabitants themselves, or by their neighboring
Kings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umults were continually raised: So as it behoved them to subjugate the
same Provinces several times. But if these difficulties of winning Forts and strong
Holds did retard the course of Victories, certainly they ought not to lessen the
praise of modern Princes and Commanders; but when they deserve it by their own
military worth and industry, as great discipline, cunning, constancie, and sufferance
is discovered in this sort of Militia, and as such acquisitions are more stable, and less
subject to the various fortune of War; so the fewer actions of these men may for
glory and praise be justly compared to the many of the others, wherein perhaps
they would have equall'd them, had it not been for the concurrence of such differing
accidents and respects.</p>
               <p>But if we shall continue to examine other parts appertaining to the Militia, we
shall find that the diversity of effects hath proceeded from the diversity of other
things. The invention of Guns is so new and so miraculous a thing, so out of the
way of all War-Engines which were known and used by the Antients, as it may
well be bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eved that this must needs have made a grert alteration in the managing
of the Militia; and the use and invention of Gunpowder is so increased in these
times, and so variously multiplied and perfected, as it may be said that men make
not War now a days with steel and iron, as they were wont, but with fire. Then this
formidable Instrument of Artillery, which makes so great and irreparable havock,
is the reason why Commanders proceed with more caution in giving Battel, and
seek to spin out the War in length, to reduce the Enemy to some necessity; and
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sing more Art, and trusting less to Fortune, they spend more time in bringing
their enterprises to an end, but do it with more security. Wherefore we seldom
hear of pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch'd Fields in these days, wherein whole Armies sight with all their
Forces: And hence it is, that the Forces of such as defend an assaulted Country
not being to be vanquish'd, nor much weakened but with time, unless they want
fitting defence, no great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ogress is made therein. which is not done more by time
and industry then by open force. Where likewise it is to be weighed, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
which is now adays put upon Armies of bringing along with them a great
Train of Artillery, all their proceedings must be much more slow, and without
them they can neither keep themselves from being offended by the Enemy, nor yet
can they undertake any enterprise, wanting such Instruments without which no
Town nor place of importance can be taken.</p>
               <p>Let us wind about a little, and see what hath been done by the Antients. What
a voyage did <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great make in the pursuit of <hi>Mithridates?</hi> He wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h his
Army overran abundance of new Countries, continually conquering and subjecting
them, with as much ease, as if he had gone to visit them upon pleasure, and not to
wage War with them. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great would go into <hi>India,</hi> he made
his Soldiers leave all the Booty which they had got in <hi>Persia,</hi> and all their Baggage
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59987:94"/>
behind them, and choosing out some of his nimblest men, be with them made
that long and difficult journy, and sent many back, thinking that a few (but those
valiant) Soldiers, would suffice him for that purpose; for in that Age, twas only
worth and power which bore away the weightiest affairs. So as such Princes and
Conductors of Armies as had a strong and able Militia, as was that of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great, and that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> not meeting with any strong Holds to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them, nor with any Soldiers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> worth and experience as they were, not
which could withstand their assaults, they suddenly bereft the Countries which they
assailed of all defence, by worsting their Armies wherein their sole security lay, and
so made themselves easily masters of them; and by the reputation which their men
won, and the terror which they caused in their Enemies, who had no where where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
to flie or to have refuge, they made one Victory make way for another, so as
they might in a short time lay the ground-works of those great Monarchies which
the World doth now so much wonder at.</p>
               <p>To these things it may be added, That the chiefest strength of the Antients, and
that wherewith they atchieved their chiefest actions, lay in their Infantry, which
could easiliest and with greatest expedition winde about every where, and be made
use of at all seasons. But changing their custom afterwards, so as those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
great Armies would have their Foot aided continually, and back'd by good
store of Horse, they could neither begin, nor finish great enterprises, as made best
for them; being to consider the Season, the Country, and other conveniencies,
and their Horses being to have meat, which they could not always, nor in all places
come by. Wherefore now that by reason of the greatness of their Empire, the
<hi>Turks</hi> Confines are so separated, and so far distant one from another, it may be hoped
that other Princes may rest the quieter, and the more secure from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncursions,
for that their Land-forces consisting much in Cavalry, they cannot move so sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nor lead on their numerous Armies so easily nor so commodiously, nor do such
notable things by Land; and which the self-same respect may make it be doubted
that they may bend their studies more to Sea-affairs.</p>
               <p>Together with all these respects, the condition of Times and of Potentates is
not slightly to be considered, if therein we meet with a generous Prince, and one
that is desirous of military glory. For if he chance to make trial of his arms and
worth with a Prince of equal, or not much inferior state, valor, and military disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
he cannot hope by any power he hath to make any great acquisitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he will meet with a just counterpoise to his worth and power: For though he
may peradventure be puffed up with some good success, yet is he not sure but that
he may have some adverse fortune, whilst his Enemy is still strong, thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h as yet
wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sted. What did <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> leave unattempted to get footing in
<hi>Italy?</hi> how many Armies did he lead thither? how much treasure did he spend in
those attempts? when was he ever weary or satisfied with warfaring? Yet being
withstood by the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, who was of equal force and worth,
and was resolute to keep the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> all his endeavors proved vain,
finding it very hard to get any thing, and impossible to keep what he had gotten,
that State being befriended and back'd by too great Princes. Whence it was, that
by reason of the resistance which each of these great Potentates made against the
other, knowing that they could not much exceed one another, and each of them
having an eye upon the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> they both of them did still much endeavor
friendship and consederacie with the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and chiefly with the Common-wealth
of <hi>Venice.</hi> For, what neither of them could effect of themselves, which was
to keep the others Forces suppressed in <hi>Italy,</hi> they thought they might the
easilier do it, by joining with some other Italian Potentate; so the many Wars
which happened between them, and chiefly in <hi>Sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y,</hi> and in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:59987:95"/>
must at last be ended by agreement without any advantage to either party, both
their Forces, being weakned, but neither of their hatreds or emulations slackned,
though <hi>Charls</hi> the Fift, by the unexpected death of <hi>Francisco Sforza,</hi> did at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that State to his Dominion.</p>
               <p>Hence it was also that <hi>Charls</hi> and <hi>Solyman,</hi> greatly fearing to encounter each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
did very much shun the having to do together, and to hazard that glory to the
uncertain events of War, which they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th so much labor arrived at. And
this was the cause why <hi>Charls</hi> though he was a bold and valiant Prince, when his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> was in great danger by reason of <hi>Solymans</hi> Forces, resolved importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
to pass into <hi>Africa;</hi> for being resolute that he would not march against <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
Forces, nor contend with them, he would witness to the world that it was neither
labor nor danger, that kept him from turning to the defence of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and
<hi>Austria,</hi> which were then assaulted by the Turks; but because he esteemed the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Africa</hi> very necessary. And when a greater necessity wrought it so that
they were to take up Arms one against the other, and that numerous Armies had
taken the field, yet they kept still aloof off, the fear, and apprehension which each
had of the others power and fortune being alike; so as at last so great an accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Soldiers disbanded, neither party having seen the face of an Enemy;
whilst <hi>Charls</hi> would not give way that his Army should go from before the walls
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> to go find out the Enemy, not would <hi>Solyman</hi> advance further to meet
him, though he had at first publickly given out that he went from <hi>Constantinople</hi>
to fight with <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperor before his own doors. So as you may clearly
see, that it was the counterpoise of these two great Princes of one and the same
Age, which kept their Forces confined within certain bounds, which for their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
and other respects might have carried the Trophies of victory into the furthest
remote Countries.</p>
               <p>Now on the other side let us examine the condition of Times and Potentates
with whom those famous Commanders of old had to wage War: <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>x<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nder</hi> the
Great, found the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> wherein he successfully made his first expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
for extent of Empire very rich and powerful, but wherein was an ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined
Militia, and commanded by unexperienced Leaders, and men of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor;
wherefore exceeding the <hi>Persians</hi> in worth and discipline, though he came
short of them in numbers, he may be said to have been better then they for matter
of War, and therefore willingly imbraced all occasions of joyning Pattel with them.
And for what concerns the Eastern Kings and Nations, which he afterwards
brought under his power, who knows not how unfit they were for War, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
weak, not joyned in confederacie for common defence, nor sustained by
strong holds, nor by the strength of a well ordered Militia? Insomuch as the
greatest glory that can be attributed to <hi>Alexander,</hi> is for the generosity of his
mind, which moved him to venter upon so many enterprises, in desert and almost
unknown Countries, rather then for that he overcame great difficulties in fight, and
brought them to an end.</p>
               <p>The same almost may be observed by the things done in the Eastern parts by <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Great. It is true that <hi>Caesar</hi> met with greater difficulties in the things he did
in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Spain,</hi> for he waged War with people who knew how to manage
their Arms, and who were till then thought unvanquishable; wherefore he spent
more time there. Yet these Provinces were divided into many Kings and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,
none of which were very strong of themselves, nor were they very secure
by the assistance of others to make them able to resist an Army of veteran, and
excellently well disciplined Soldiers, as was that which was commanded by <hi>Caesar:</hi>
So as it seems we may with reason conclude that if these cried up Commanders
had met with powerful and valiant Armies, able to be compared with theirs, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59987:95"/>
that these had been guided and upheld by the experience and worth of great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
their fames would certainly have been less, not would they have so easily
have assubjected so many Countries, and erected their Trophies of victories in so
many Regions as they did.</p>
               <p>But besides all these considerations, we may perhaps with reason weigh, the arts

it seems this was the onely thing which they propounded to themselves for reward
of all their labor and danger, and for the end of all their undertakings; for they
have left many noble examples behind t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <head>The Seventh DISCOURSE.</head>
               <head type="sub">What the cause is why Italy hath enjoyed so long Peace and Quiet

               <p>HE who shall call to mind what troubles <hi>Italy</hi> for a long time hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
under, which after the passage of <hi>Charls</hi> the eight, King of <hi>France,</hi>
till the Peace made at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> was for the space of thirty five years
continually infested with better Wars, and subject to all those greater
evils which the wickedness of man hath found out to his own undoing,
may justly think her very happy in this present, and the last preceding Age, wherein
after so long a combustion she hath enjoyed so happy and quiet a Peace: For though
in this time some little sparkles may have broken forth, yet have they not spread
much, nor lasted long; but being confined within some small circuits, the greater
and more noble parts of <hi>Italy</hi> have remained safe and untouched by this flame.
Wherefore those Princes who this mean while have had the government of the
several States of <hi>Italy,</hi> are certainly much to be praised, and the people of <hi>Italy</hi> are
chiefly to acknowledg so great a benefit from their wisdom and vigilancie. Yet
because there have divers accidents happened, which have opened the way to
Princes wherein to walk directly on to this right end of Peace and Concord, it
may be worth the while, particularly to examine from what causes this good
hath proceeded; for thereby it may likewise be known how the like may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
               <p>It is a Proposition sufficiently known, and indubitably true, that <hi>Sublata causa

will cease. Wherefore by truly examining the causes from whence the Wars and
molestations of <hi>Italy</hi> did proceed, we may perceive how these ceasing, she hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in that peace and quiet, which may be said to be the true, proper, and most
natural condition of a State; all other workings in a good Government, and even
War it self being ordained for Peace: whereby as Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

taking away the impediments which do disturb it, just as health is introduced into
our bodies by taking away those ill humors which keep them from their perfect and

arose from that Spring-head, and which brought no other advantage to the
Authors.</p>
               <p>But let us make a little further enquiry. The so famous, and as it may justly be
termed, so pernicious War to all <hi>Italy,</hi> made by the League of so many Christian
Princes, who had all conspired the ruine of the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> whence
did it arise but from these two w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cked seeds, Fear and Ambition? Many Princes
apprehended the greatness of the Republick, which was already much increased by
the prosperous success in War wherein she was associated by the <hi>French,</hi> whereby
she was become very formidable, especially to the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> wherefore they
all desired her abasement for their own security. Nor was the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi>
totally free from this fear, who had learnt by late experience how powerful the
Forces of the Commonwealth were grown, which had bereft him of some Towns
belonging to him. But <hi>Lodovick</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> (the thir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>quenchable) growing still more desirous to possess the whole State of
<hi>Milan,</hi> whereof he had already gotten the greatest part, and repenting himself
that the Cities of <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Giaradada</hi> were fallen to the <hi>Ventians,</hi> was egg'd
on by this spur of Ambition to join in conspiracie with the other Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Commonwealth, which had so lately and so many several ways deserved
so very well at his hands. After these ensued many long Wars, though not equally
grievous, which had many various and uncertain events, and which were fomented
and maintain'd by these seeds of all discord, fear and ambition. When the greatness
and power of the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth was increased and confirm'd in <hi>Italy,</hi>
the Commonwealth apprehended that her State in <hi>Terra firma</hi> would not by reason
thereof be very safe: she therefore willingly took up Arms, accompa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ied by the
<hi>French,</hi> to secure herself from the danger she conceived she lay under by reason of
the continual neighborhood of a greater and more powerful neighbor, by having a
particular Prince of that State, who might be Duke of <hi>Milan. Francis</hi> King of
<hi>France</hi> desired likewise to see the Emperor bereft of that State, but out of other
respects; to wit, because his ambition was such as would never suffer him to give
way to the fortune of <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperor, and to see <hi>Charls</hi> so much superior to
him, especially in <hi>Italy,</hi> where his Predecessors the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and he himself
with no less fervencie, though with worse success, had labored so long, with such
expence, and with the loss of so many men, only to retain and keep some Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>
               <p>This was the tree, from which the boughs or sprouts could not be so fast cut off,
but that one War soon succeeded another; wherewith <hi>Italy</hi> was long perplex'd, till
in the year 1529. the Princes being tyred, and the People ruin'd, agreement was
made in that famous Meeting at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> in which so sound foundations of the
peace and quiet of <hi>Italy</hi> were laid, as they may almost be said to have continued till
now, with fair hopes of longer continuance. For though f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thoughts tempered, all occasions of making any great change or alteration of
States in her was taken away, such as had hapned in the former Ages, through the

there. But though the Forces of that flourishing and powerful Kingdom were
very formidable before these Civil Discords, yet experience hath shewed that their

caused more dread then damage; for their Armies being to be furnished with all

would take up Arms against him; for he hoped to attain those things by the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

was apt to commotions, wherein he had had but ill success at the same time in <hi>Italy,</hi> by
reason of the weak assistance of the <hi>Senesi;</hi> but all this while, and upon all these
ocasions, it may be truly affirmed that these were rather Tumults then Wars;
which (as hath been said) was occasioned chiefly, for that such a disposition of
mind and of affairs, was found in the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> as they did not much, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all at a time interess themselves in these Wars. And though some of the Popes
did busie themselves therein, yet since these Wars were not treated of as any thing
belonging to the Church, or immediately appertaining to the Apostolick See,
they were neither favored by the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> nor yet imbraced by the
succeeding Popes, with the same thoughts, because their ends, nor interests were
not the same; nay they did rather endeavor to appease, then to foment them. And
those who were the raisers and furtherers of these novelties, and of the coming of
forein Forces, being weak of themselves, and not being seconded by any, they could
not long make good the War, not having sufficient Forces of themselves, nor being
able to make such use of the Transa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

party. Whereby she did not undoubtedly advantage herself onely, but whole <hi>Italy,</hi>
where she being one of the chief Potentates; by keeping quiet and newrer, not

               </p>
               <p>Hence then it ensues, that the best advice for the preservation of this peace and

hath been said) have in former times been cause of her perturbances. In which
happy condition she will still continue, if the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> shall know so to
moderate their desires, and keep themselves so closely annexed together by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mind, and by good intelligence, that the one may not fear the other for any
desire of novelty which may be found in them, nor discover themselves to be so
weak by their divisions as out of the easiness of the prey, ambition may move others
to aspire after their States.</p>

Princes, be commodious, and of true safety to a State, or no?</head>
               <p>FOrts and strong Holds are of late grown into so great esteem, as Princes
seem now adaies to mind nothing more then these for the security of their
States. Yet this business may admit of such various considerations, as it
is not peradventure easie to be discerned, whether a Prince that is thus
advised be in the right way to effect that which he propounds unto himself,
which is, the securing of his affairs. To know then what ought truly to be thought
in this case, we must first consider what this art of Fortification is of it self, on
which so much study, and expence is bestowed, and whether it be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such undeniable principles and reasons, as by means thereof the benefit at which
it aims, of preserving Cities and States in safety, may be expected from it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this first consideration admits of no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> smal doubt or difficultie; for we are
taught by modern exper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ence, that all the waies whereby a strong Hold may be
assaulted and take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

as that it may be asserted, that thereby an art is found out which contains all sorts
of possible offence, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch is governed by a cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

intent thereof, and to come to the perfection thereof. Nay, rather we find to the
contrary, that the professors of this Art do not agree well in their principles; and
that time makes it subject to such alterations, by reason of the new waies which the
wit of man finds out as well for offence as defence, as it seems it must be confest, that
this is not in reality a true art, or at least, that it is so imperfectly known and used, as
that strong holds are but a weak foundation for the safety of a State, though they
be never so many, and be in esteem by military men. For, say nothing else does
it, the experience of more then one Age doth evidently prove, that is a short time
they become vain and useless; since a Fort which was formerly greatly esteemed,
and held to be almost impregnable, hath now by the invention of new engins, and
wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and it may be beleeved, that the same may befal any strong holds which are in
these daies built, by reason of the new waies of offending which many do daily
with much study and industry labour to finde out.</p>
               <p>Whence it is that Princes find they have often spent much time, workmanship
and moneys, in a business, which in time of need can but little avail them; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
they wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l reap any benefit thereby, they must continually be at new expence both
of monies and men, keeping them continually busied in new works and Fabricks,
adding alwaies, or altering many things about their Forts, to fit them to the use of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59987:98"/>
the present times and Militia. But give it for granted, that such strong Holds may
be brought to rather an imaginable, then a possible perfection and security, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they are no way serviceable of themselves, but are like dead and useless things,
which have need to be as it were inanimated and be made useful by good Garisons,
who may keep and defend them.</p>
               <p>And if otherwise, they serve for the conveniencie and service of the Enemy
which makes it yet more questionable, whether strong Holds be a greater safety
or weakening to a State; and where there are many and very great ones, the doubt
is made the greater; since so many Soldiers must be imployed in their defence, as
if the Prince be not very powerful, he shall hardly find Forces sufficient to keep
several Armies (as they may be termed) on foot, some within the Forts, and some
in the Campagnia. Nor can it be made good, that strong Holds are of themselves
sufficient to secure the whole State; for though they may entertain the Enemy for
a while, and stop the first brunt of an impetuous assault, yet at last, unless they be
back'd with Forces from without, and timely succored and relieved, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
either by power, length of time, or necessity, they must yield and fall into
the power of the Enemy: which cannot be denied, no not by the very Professors
and Favorers of Fortification. And yet it cannot be denied, but if a Prince have
sufficient Forces to keep the Field in his own Country, he may thereby keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from being injured; for men do not easily put things to hazard, where they
think to meet with stout opposition; and the only opinion and reputation of such
Forces, is able to keep off the greatest dangers: For the Enemy who did design
to assault such a State, becomes jealous and doubtful, nor is he bold enough to
enter far into such a State as is guarded by a good Army, and chiefly in situations
(such as are almost in all Countries) as are naturally fortified by Hills, Vallies, or
Rivers; where it is hard to enter, and harder to retreat. And if any well experienced
Captain command over such Forces, he will be likely enough to defeat the Enemy,
without endangering himself, by keeping him from victuals, and so imployed and
busied in sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry ways, as he shall neither be able to keep long in the Country, nor
much less imploy himself in the taking or sacking of any Cities; since he knows
he is hourly subject to surprisals, and to be ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n'd; and strong Holds securing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but those quarters where they are situated, they do not secure the State, if
they be but a few; and if many, they require all the Forces for their own defence,
and leave the Enemy master of the Field, to the Prince his prejudice, and the
Peoples despair. So also, if they be but little ones, and incapable of such Works,
and so many men as are requisite to make them hold out long, they and the Soldiers
which defend them are lost; and if they be great, and contain large plots of ground,
as is most in fashion in these days, they may be more perfect in themselves, but they
need so many men to defend them, as those Forces which ought to be imployed
for the safeguard of the whole Country, or a great part thereof, are bounded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a little compass, in defence of some City or Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>adel. And yet these very Soldiers,
when drawn out into the Field, may do much better service; for being fashioned
into the body of an Army, they become as it were a moveable Fort, which secures
at once many Cities, and a great Tract of Country: nay, by these the Enemy is
much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Forces, they may be carried into another mans State, and set another mans ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on fire, before it take head in ones own house; but he who placeth his safety in
strong Holds, puts himself into a condition of being at his Enemies disposal, in
whose will it lies to choose what shall make most for his advantage, with great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the opposing party: For he may either pass by the For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, over-ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is assaulted, and cannot be releived, by reason that the Forces thereof are
disperst and imploid in the defence of the strong Holds; or if he will make any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
archievement, he may sit down before any Fort, and without indangering his
own men, whilst he shall live upon the Enemies Territories, he may in time, take
it by siege, and effect his own desires (for as hath been said) no strong Hold can
promise it self long safety where no succour is ready at hand.</p>
               <p>But let us come a little closer to the business, and let us suppose that these strong
Holds may be brought to such a condition as they may be assuredly able to resist
any open force which shall come against them, and not be deceived in that their
beleef, as often times they are; How can they secure themselves from treacherie,
and from such dangers as they may be subject unto by the negligence of Soldiers, or
falsehood of the Commanders that have the custodie thereof? in which case the
Princes danger is so much the greater, and more irreparable, for that his Enemy is in
the Dominions, in a well munited seat, from whence he cannot hope to drive him,
without much labor and difficultie. But in greater Cities wherein are a multitude
of people, and where these cautions and suspitions are not to be found, others no
whit inferior to these do arise; for such quantities of victuals is requisite to feed
the many men that are therein inclosed, as no Prince is able to provide for so, as may
serve them for a long time; and if this fail, to what end serves Walls, Weapons,
or Soldiers? To this may be added that the safety of such strong Holds, does
in a great part depend upon the pleasure of the people, who being of themselves
naturally fickle, do often favor forein Princes out of very slight reasons, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
out of a meer desire of noveltie; and plot by sedition, and by open force
against the present State, and deliver themselves, and the City into another mans
power: And though they may afterwards repent themselves of their folly, they
know not how to mend it, when a powerful Army is within the City Walls; nor
can this be done by him who defends the State, because he cannot keep so many

his Subjects, as a legitimate Prince ought to do, he is loath to destroy a City
of his own though whole Armies be therein.</p>
               <p>But if the State be open and not pestred with Fortifications, though it may the
more easily be lost by sudden assaults, or by ill affected Subjects, it will be the more
easily regained, and as soon as the Prince who is deprived thereof, shall have means
to rallie his Forces which by misfortune may have been beaten, he soon makes
head again, and recovers what he had lost, the Enemy not having any safe hold
wherein to abide. And of this there are many apparent examples. If the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of <hi>Venice,</hi> in the times of her greatest calamitie, had had her State in <hi>Terra
firma</hi> so well provided of strong Holds, as now it is, she might not peradventure
have run so great a misfortune, she had not so soon lost so many and so noble Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as she did; but it may be alleadged on the contrary, that if in that evil Crisis
of affairs wherein she was brought to such adversity, she had had so many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Forts as now she hath, and that they had faln into the power of the Enemy, she
would not certainly have so soon recovered her losses, and restored herself into
her pristine power and greatness as she did. We likewise see the State of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
which fell so often into the power of the <hi>French,</hi> it staid not long under their
Dominio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, for not finding any strong and Royal Forts, wherein they could make
any safe abode, nor having time to erect any by reason of their continual Wars, or
for want of monies, the defenders of that State did often times prevail; and every
accident, either of the change of the peoples minds, or of their Enemies increase
of Forces, were sufficient to drive them out: Which would not have happened if
they had but once been Masters of any strong Holds, from whence they could not
have been expel'd, without a long and hard siege. <hi>Guide Ubald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59987:99"/>
but of small Territories, but very wise, and well experienced in War, moved
by these respects, after he had recovered his State which was formerly taken from
him by Duke <hi>Valentine,</hi> he resolved to slight all the strong Holds that were
there, knowing that they could not at first preserve his State unto him, and
when hee should lose it, they would make the difficultie of regaining it the
greater.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Charls</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>France,</hi> going to win the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>
past through <hi>Tuscany,</hi> the Forts which the <hi>Florentines</hi> had built for their own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie,
were the very things whereby they were most indamaged, and these falling
into the power of the <hi>French,</hi> whose Forces they thought they were not able to
withstand, they put the <hi>Florentines</hi> to vast expence, and made them undergo great
slavery, out of a desire of recovering them. Whereas if that State had la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n open,
the King, who was bound upon other enterprises, passing forward, would no waies
have troubled the affairs of that Commonwealth. The like, and almost out of
the like respect, did afterward befall Duke <hi>Cosimo,</hi> when the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the
Fifth would keep some Castles belonging to that State in his own power, which
should otherwise have been left free to <hi>Cosimo;</hi> and which was the occasion of
that saying, <hi>Chele fortezza sonoi ceppi della Toscana,</hi> That strong Holds are the
fetters of <hi>Tuscany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the greatest mischiefs which strong Holds use to bring with them;
but there are others not altogether so grievous, but more certain and irreparable.
For who can deny but that the excessive charge which Princes are at, not onely in
building Fortresses, but more in muniting, and guarding them doth sufficiently
exhaust the publick Exchequer, and necessitate the disbursing of such moneys in
times of peace, as ought to be kept for the more urgent occasions of War. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he who could see what vast sums the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> hath spent for
some late years past in making and muniting so many Forts both by Sea and Land,
would be very much astonished, and would confess that so great a mass of treasure
would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> sufficient to provide for any War how great soever, and to withstand
for a good while any potent Enemy. It may peradventure likewise be said, and
not untruly, that whilst a Prince reposes much confidence in being able to maintain
his State by means of these strong Holds, and by the assistance of a few Soldiers,
he is not so careful as he ought to be of other things which belong to the Mili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia,
which are notwithstanding real and secure foundations of a State. The <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
would not therefore suffer their Cities to be begirt with a wall because they
beleeved that by the thoughts of such securitie, their Citizens would become more
careless and negligent in managing their Arms, by sole means whereof they thought
that the Forces of an Enemie might and ought to be kept afar off. Which that
wise man would likewise infer who said, That the walls, which ought to secure a
City should be made of iron not of stone. And a <hi>Spartan</hi> being demanded by an
<hi>Athenian,</hi> what he thought of the walls of <hi>Athens?</hi> answered, That he thought
they were very handsome for a City which was to be inhabited by women;
inferring, that it is not necessarie, nor honorable, for able, valiant men, to secure
themselves from their Enemies by such means. It is likewise usually seen, that a
Prince, who thinks he shall be able to curb his Subjects, to gov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them as he pleaseth by means of Bulwarks and Castles, and that therefore he needs
not the love of his Subjects, is much less mindful of those things which become a

                  </gap>on. Yet we are taught by many evident
examples that the peoples love or hatred is that which doth most preserve unto him,
or bereave him of his State, and makes them more ready or backward to render
him obedient; as is of late seen in <hi>Flanders;</hi> which so many Fortresses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

Prince. And it may generally be observed, that such Governments as have lasted
longest, have been preserved, not by the advantage of strong Holds, whereof
some have not had any, but by vertue of a good Militia, and of the Subjects
love.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were accustomed, when they had won any new Country, to send
new Inhabitants thither, who being placed either in the antient Cities, or in others
built by themselves, they called Roman Colonies; and by these mens valor, as
People devoted and obliged to the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> out of remembrance
of their desert, and in gratitude for the good which they had received, they easily
kept the new Subjects in loyalty to the Commowealth, and the Countries which
they had won by their Arms, in obedience. The which, being moved thereunto by
the same respects, the <hi>Venetians</hi> did likewise in <hi>Candia,</hi> sending many of their own
Gentlemen thither to make Colonies, and to defend and maintain that Island. But
the <hi>Turks,</hi> in a very violent manner, but answerable to the custom of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
do almost totally destroy the antient Inhabitants of their new-gotten
Countries, chiefly the richest and the most noble, from whom they take their

assigned over to the Soldiers, upon condition that they are to maintain a certain
number of Horse, by which means they keep a great number of Warriors continually
on foot, who se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ving for Garrisons for the safety of the new acquired Country, are
notwithstanding always ready to serve in any other place, and upon all occasions as
they shall be commanded, to the greater benefit and safety of the State, then Forts
and strong Holds can do to those other Nations which make most use of them. But
other Princes, who have had greater abundance of Territories, if you will respect
their Inhabitants, did use to leave great store of Land upon their Confines desert
and unmanured, as at these times the <hi>Persians</hi> did upon their Confines towards the
<hi>Turks,</hi> to render it more difficult for a numerous Army to pass through them to
their prejudice, or in case they do, to make any long abode there: which hath often
been of great use to them, as hath been seen, when very mighty Armies have been
led on by the Ottoman Emperors against the Persians, they have most commonly
been wasted and destroyed by their own sufferings and wants.</p>
               <p>From these things it appears it may be inferr'd, that there are other Arts and
ways which may much better do that for which Fortifications were first found
out, and for which they are now a-daies so much used, especially amongst
Christian Princes. And yet if we will face about, some other, and those no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
arguments will be found, which will plead for the very great advantage
which Princes and States receive from Fortifications. It is most assuredly certain,
that to secure a mans self by all means possible from offence, is a precept not only
taught by Reason, but dictated by Nature, which, as it were by some occult and
miraculous counsel, hath pleased to divide those Nations by a long series of high
tow'ring Mountains, and to secure them from the injuries which the diversity of
Climate hath produced in their several affections and customs, and consequently
a certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n natural enmity; and hath likewise provided in all parts more eminent seats
amongst Mountains, and more inclosed ones amidst Vallies, wherein the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
may preserve themselves safe from the force and violence, which the stronger
use to exercise upon the weaker. So as Fortification may be said to be an Art which
doth imitate and help Nature, because her operations are like those of the others,
and do sometimes reduce the workmanship of Nature to more perfection and use.
And though this be not grounded upon so certain principles as those of the Sciences,
yet doth she govern herself by a kind of Reason in such things wherein she is
versed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:59987:100"/>
And thus much may serve to prove that she deserves the name of Art; neither
ought she to be ever a whit undervalued, because new things and new rules are daily
found out by the industrie of those that study her, since it is proper to natural and
eternal things to keep themselves always in such a condition, as that they suffer not
any alteration. But say what thing it is, which of all humane operations, wherein
such certainty and constancie is to be found? No man will notwithstanding say,
that men are to live idly, or totally to betake themselves to Contemplation, and
despise so many Arts, which are the ornaments of Civil life, because we cannot
proceed therein by way of demonstration to one only and certain truth. Nor can
it be said that this Arts of Fortification is of late invention, for it is very antient, and
hath been known almost in all Ages, and by all Nations; but sometimes in lesser,
sometimes in greater perfection, according to a certain variety and vicissitude which
Time causeth as well in Arts, as in all other things. The Antients had their Forts,
and Engines of War to take them, which by a general name they called <hi>Tormenta:</hi>
Amongst other Engines which served to batter down Forts, the Rams were much
known and used; and we find mention made of many other sorts of Instruments
belonging to the offence and defence of Cities; and of these some so miraculous,
as their force may be said to cause no less wonder then do our Guns now-a-daies.
To this purpose we read, that when <hi>Scipio</hi> would vanquish a certain City in <hi>Spain,</hi>
the Defenders thereof threw certain Irons over the walls, so artificially ordered, as
they therewith drew up such of the Enemies Soldiers as came neer the walls, to the
top thereof. And it is related of that famous <hi>Archimedes,</hi> that he invented an
Engine which was used in defence of his Country <hi>Syracusa,</hi> by which an armed
Gally might be raised by force out of the water, and drawn up on the Town-walls.
How can it be then said, that such Art of Fabricking was unknown to the Antients,
if they used such study and industry in defending and in oppugning Forts? Nay,
many of their most cry'd up Commanders have been praised particularly for this;
and the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were very excellent at all things belonging to the Militia, were
very good at this also, and did thereby preserve their State, which they had almost
lost by fighting: For <hi>Hannibal</hi> in his prosperous course of victory, was forced to
keep so long, and spend so much time before some small, but strong and well-walled
Castles, and Colonies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the safety of the City of <hi>Rome</hi>
was in a great part attributed thereunto.</p>
               <p>But to speak no more of these antient proceedings, do we not see that many
Forts and Castles have been built in not many Ages ago in many places, and chiefly
in <hi>Italy?</hi> Which though the use of Cannon renders now of no use, yet compare
such Fortresses with the manner of warfaring in those days, and they may be held
almost equal to ours, or at least they shew that men did study as much then to
secure themselves from being injured by the Enemy, and the better to maintain
their States and Territories by that art, as they do now. The so many Sieges and
beleaguering of Cities, whereof mention is made in all Ages, do cleerly prove
that the use of Fortification is of very antient use, and hath been continued in all
Ages, though it be now reduced to much greater perfection. Now if we shall
consider what advantage is made by Fortifica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions, we shall find them to be many,
and of great importance: For it is sufficiently manifest, that a Country wherein
are no strong Holds, is alwaies in apparent danger, and left almost at the discretion
of the Enemy; who whilst they may safely at unawares enter thereinto, not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with any obstacle, have it alwaies in their power, if not to prejudice the main
affairs of that State, at least to vex the people by fire and rapine, of whose safety
and preservation the Prince ought alwais to be careful.</p>
               <p>We may find sad example of this by the late and well known passages of the
Country of <hi>Friuli</hi> in the late Wars which the State of <hi>Venice</hi> had in <hi>Terra firma;</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59987:101"/>
being totally destitute of strong Holds, it became a prey to whosoever would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
it; insomuch as it was not onely ruined and destroyd by regular Armies, but by
such as passed tumultuously over the mountains; the Inhabitants thereof being only
so long secure, as the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army was permitted to remain amongst those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines;
but as soon as being summoned from thence, upon other occasions, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to be gone from thence, the Enemies returned again to fresh and secure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations;
which will likewise befal any Region which is not defended, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Fortresses. And where the members of a State are far asunder, if it
must be defended onely by the Soldiers sword, many Armies will scarcely be able
to secure it; whereas by means of strong Holds, the same people who are able to
defend them, will likewise serve in a great part to preserve the Country; as well
because many of the Inhabitants may there finde safe refuge, as likewise for that is
no good advice nor usually imbraced by good Commanders to advance forward,
and to leave the Forts of the Enemy placed in fitting parts upon the Frontiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
them, the State is preserved from greater dangers. As on the contrary, the
State wherein there are no strong Holds, though it be provided of a good
and valiant Militia, yet must it depend upon the various chance of War, and
hazard all upon the uncertain event of Battel; and if any thing of misfortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal,
the whole Country is left to the discretion of the Enemy, and the Armies
not having any safe place whereunto to retreat are totally defeated by one rout;
as it happened in the last Age in the Soldan of <hi>Cairo's</hi> most famost Empire, which
Soldan being overcome in several Battels by <hi>Selymus Ottoman,</hi> and wanting time to
rally his Army, and strong Holds whereunto to have refuge, did in a short time
lose his whole Kingdom and the Empire of the <hi>Mammalucchi</hi> was overthrown;
which was before very famous for military discipline, and esteemed very secure,
by reposing its safety in the valor of strong and able men.</p>
               <p>To this may be added, That strong Holds do not onely secure States from these
utmost hazards of adverse Fortune, but make very much for the keeping it away,
and often-times they reap the intention of true securitie, without any hazard; for
when he who intends to assault a State, shall consider that his attempts are likely
to prove tedious and difficult, and that it is doubtful whether he shall be therein
victorious or on, he does not so easily fall upon the business; but when the War
is once begun Fortresses do assuredly sufficiently keep from comming to join Battel;
for the assailant will not easily hazard himself upon the danger of a pitch'd Field;
because he sees he shall be debarr'd the chief fruits of Victorie (which is the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of some City or place of importance) by strong Holds: And so also he who
is assaulted, the more he sees his affairs in a good posture by the means of strong
Holds, the more he endeavors to prolong the time, to the end that he may defeat
him by his own incommodities, without much use of weapons: Whence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. is that
in these times, wherein the perfection of fortifying is much increased, field Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
are seldom fought; for to fight makes not for the advantage of either of the
parties out of the above said considerations; Since the wit and industry of the
Commanders seems to prevail over Fortifications and do in a great part take that
uncertainty from War which useth to be found therein. In the condition of the
present affairs and times, it is also seen that as much time is spent in the taking of
one onely Fort, as in former Ages, and when another manner of Militia was in
use, was spent in taking in whole Provinces. Which peradventure is likewise the
cause why the Princes of these later Ages, though some of them have been very
powerful and valiant, have not made any great progress in all the Wars which
they have made: Wherefore it seems it may be affirmed that Fortification is a
very noble and excellent Art, because it helps to compass the ultimate and true
end which ought to be the aim of War in a well regulated State, to wit, peace and
securitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:59987:101"/>
What is then to be resolved upon in this diversitie of allegations? It is a true
and general rule, that all things cannot suit with all things, nor ought we in the actions
belonging to civil life to seek for that which is simply, and of it self good, for it would
be in vain to do so; divers things prove useful to divers ends, and to divers persons,
and they ought to be accommodated to the condition of times, quality of customs,
and to other particular accidents. Therefore the same manner of proceeding in
the Government, and preservation of their States becomes not several Princes, but
several waies. Such Princes as have large Dominions, and powerful Forces, may
securely repose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> safety in their Militia, and Soldiery, they have no great need of
Castles or strong Holds; and if they will have any, it may suffice them to have
them placed upon their utmost Confines, to secure their Country from sudden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions,
and for the opportunitie and securitie of such Garisons as such Princes use
to keep in their provinces, which are furthest remote, and at a great distance from
their Imperial Seate; as the Roman Emperors did in former times, and as the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
Lords do now, who trusting in their own power, do endeavor much more
the taking of Forts which do appertain to other men, then the making of new
ones themselves, which they stand not so much in need of, for that their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
keeps them free from being injured by others. But lesser Princes ought to
govern themselves by another rule, and stand more in need of strong Holds; for
not having any large Territories, nor much money to keep a great many Soldiers
continually in pay, what they cannot do by force or reputation, they do by the
advantage of Fortifications; for they keep what belongs unto them so well guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a few Soldiers, as sometimes the Forces of any whatsoever powerful
Prince are not able to pluck them out of their nest, nor yet to bereave them of
any part of their State: Whereof we have had many examples in these later times.
and amongst the rest, the defence of <hi>Malta</hi> is very remarkable, which being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
by the Forces of so great a Prince as was <hi>Solyman,</hi> the few Knights of
<hi>Malta</hi> were so able to defend it, as the Turks were forced not without some shame, and
much to their prejudice, to quit it, after having spent much time, and lost many
men before that Fort.</p>
               <p>And the Turks having learned by the experience of others, the good of strong
Holds being now to have a better esteem of them, then formerly they have had,
especially in places furthest off from the Seat of the Empire, where all things
necessaie cannot be provided for, but in a long time, and with much inconveniencie.
They have to this purpose built many Forts in the parts which they have lately got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in <hi>Persia;</hi> and have therein done very wisely; for whereas the former <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Emperors, reaped no good by their enterprises upon <hi>Persia,</hi> but as soon as their
Armies were withdrawn, the Country which they had over-run, but not gotten, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the obedience of its former Lords, now, by degrees from time to time,
they have by their Forts so confirmed themselves in the possession of such places as
they have once taken, as the <hi>Persians,</hi> being a people little verst in the expugning of
strong Holds, have but small hopes of ever driving them out from such spacious
Territories, first gotten by force of Arms, and afterwards by such means main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by them, &amp; by a safe possession secured unto them. So as the use of Fortresses
are sometime according as place and occasion shall serve of no smal service, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tie Princes, but even to the greatest. But as for the number of these
strong Holds, for the time, form, and other accident, which ought to be observed
in the building of them, no such certain rule can be given as can serve all men at
all times. Only this may be said, that a wise Prince ought to consider herein, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what he designs to do, but what his Estate, and what his Forces are; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that which was intended for a cure and sustenance, may prove poison and ruin
to the State. As when a Prince will make such, and so many Forresses, as that by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59987:102"/>
reason of too great and inconsiderate expence in time of Peace, in maintaining them,
he must of himself consume; then that will prove true which hath formerly been
considered, that a Prince of no great fortune, not being able to garrisonise or furnish
so many Fortresses with things necessary, not to draw forth the body of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjusted
Army into the field, in greatest danger of War, will find he hath not secured,
but increased his own dangers, and hath put the total of his affairs in great disorder
and confusion.</p>
               <p>Fortresses then, as all other things in a well ordered Government, ought to be
disposed of with good judgment, and a well regulated temper; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as their number
and greatness may be proportionable to the condition of the State, and of the Prince
his Forces: They must not be placed idly in all places, but only upon the Frontiers,
and in places fit for that purpose; and so as the natural situation of the place may
assist Art as much as may be, and be also thereby assisted; for such Fortresses may be
maintained in greater security, and with fewer Soldiers. But above all things, all
possible care must be had, that in time of greatest need they may be succor'd; for
no Fort can hold out long against a great force, unless it be supplied by new Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Munitions, and with all other necessaries. It is also very advantagious for
Fortresses, that there be good store of good Earth or Mould within them, whereby
they may several ways accommodate themselves for defence, according as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to take them are made; and also to have ready opportunity to use the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of many retrears, and to gain time, which is the proper and grearest conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
for Fortresses. So as if fitting provisions and respects be had, Fortresses so
built will prove advantagious for a Prince or State, not only in the opinion of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but even of Statesmen. But when they are made without judgment or art, it is
not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ault of the Work, but of him who knows not how to use it, if such good
effects do not ensue thereupon as are desired: Which happens not only in strong
Holds, but in all other things, which being ill used, lose their efficacie. Thus then
those arguments are easily answered by these distinctions, and by what hath been
alleadged in the behalf of strong Holds, which might at first occasion any doubt:
For the Art of Fortification ought not to be despised, because it hath not alwaies
been the same; rather it ought to be so much the more esteemed, because we see it
grows every day to greater perfection by new inventions, and by experiences.
Thus it fares also with the Art of building of Ships and Houses, with that of Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Physick, Painting, and of all other excellent Disciplines, which (Experience
being the best Introductress) did not arrive at such excellencie and estimation sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
but in process of time.</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding, this Art of Fortification hath in this our Age gotten some
more setled Rules, and (as a man may say) more certain Principles, since the use of
Batteries and of other manner of Attaques introduced by modern men, whereby
she doth govern herself in the whole, and in every one of her particular members,
in form, distance, proportion of parts, and in other things, which are alwaies the
same, where the seat will permit it. Variety of noble Wits have added so much of
ornament and of perfection of late to this noble Profession, as all doubts which may
be put whether there be a true Art thereof, or no, are evidently cleered: And
though sometimes she may vary by reason of the diversity of situations, or by any
other accidents which cannot be comprised within one and the same Rule, this
ought not to detract from the dignity of the Artificers thereof, then it doth from
the Polititian (who certainly is the chiefest Archi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ector in all our Civil operations)
to proceed by probable arguments, and oftentimes alter his advice, that he may fit
his actions to the circumstances which do accompany them. Nor doth it follow,
that such an Art should be the worse thought of, because it doth not alwaies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
its end, which is the preservation of such a City, or such a Country where
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59987:102"/>
such Fortifications are erected; since that likewise depends upon various accidents,
which no humane art or wisdom is able to foresee nor when foreseen, to provide
alwaies by any industry a due remedy against them. It may as well be said, men
ought to forbear building of Ships, and deprive themselves thereby of the Traffick
and Commerce which is held with far distant Countries, because many Ships perish
in the Seas. The Physitians care doth not alwaies cure the sick party; the Orator
doth not alwaies compass his ends by his perswasive oratory: Ought men therefore
to forbear Navigation, Physick, or Perswasion? If a wicked and persidious man
betray a Fort unto the Enemy which was recommended to his trust, ought this to
be attributed to the evil and imperfection of Forts? What thing is there so good,
as may not be abused by wicked men? 'tis only Vertue which hath this priviledg;
all other adorments of Humanitie would be ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inct, and expell'd the World.
If a Fort be lost for being badly garrisoned, ill defended, or by some other sinister
accident; ought the fault which is committed by the Prince his negligence, the
Commanders ignorance, or by the Soldiers cowardise, be laid upon the defect of
the Fort, which is of it self well made? But say, I beseech you, are such disorders
and dangers as may arise in a State, by want of care in a Prince, by the per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idiousness
of Commanders, or cowardise of Soldiers, become so peculiar to Forts and Citadels,
as the same by the same occasion may not happen in Armies, and in all other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
howsoever attempted? Wherefore then by seeking for such perfection in
Forts, as is not found in other things, shall we by the loss of that advantage which
may be thereby received, and is often received, leave the State in the hands of
Chance, and to the discretion of him who doth design to assault it. Nor ought it
to be said, that strong Holds should be despised, and the whole safety of the State
be placed in the Militia, as in a thing of firmer foundation, because it is not every
Prince that can alwaies keep an Army in pay, nor would this be sufficient to keep a
State from unexpected assaults, which hath many several Confines. Moreover, he
who placeth all his hopes of securing his State in Armies, and in openly fighting his
Enemies, must oftentimes (as it hath been said) hazard all to Fortune, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the danger of a thousand accidents; and unless Field-forces be back'd by
strong Holds, and equal to those of the Enemy who doth assault them, they must
remain idle and of no use: For not being able to withstand the shock, what can they
do else but retreat, and suffer him who shall be stronger to make himself Master of
the whole Country? whereas by the help of Fortresses, a few are able to resist many,
and to gain time, the only true remedy of him who is the weaker, and who is to resist
and withstand the Forces of one that is more powerful.</p>
               <p>Nor ought the example of the <hi>Spartans</hi> be of any validity to perswade the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
who would not secure their Cities with Walls, or any other Fortifications;
because having only to do with other people of <hi>Greece</hi> who were weaker then they,
they thought themselves safe without such helps; and that by doing so, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
more praise and reputation: But when they were to wage war with the
<hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who were powerful Enemies, even they sought to put
themselves in a posture of defence, by having recourse to narrow passages; and to
keep off the Enemy, assisting the natural situations of the places by Fortifications.
Moreover, the <hi>Syartans</hi> had but small Teritories, and but a few places to guard,
and were much given to the Militia; so as they who will reap advantage by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their counsels, must be Lords of Cities, all the inhabitants whereof must be
Soldiers, and all of them desirous to preserve the State, as were the <hi>Spartans.</hi> But
the reason why the Duke of <hi>Urbin</hi> did slight some of his Forts, was peradventure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knew himself too weak to defend them; and besides, because he thought it
better not to invite others to wage war with him, either out of a jealousie of them,
or out of a desire to make themselves masters of them, he being to consider all
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59987:103"/>
Forces as they related to his, or if he would make use of other mens assistance he
must depend upon them. And for what concerts the strong Holds of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> it
may be said in the first place, that it was the imprudencie of <hi>Pietro de Medici,</hi> not
the Castles which did trouble and disorder the <hi>Florentines:</hi> And secondly, that it
may be Duke <hi>Cosimo</hi> would not so easily have gotten <hi>Caesar</hi> to have confirmed him
in the possession of that State, had it not been that he might thereby secure himself of
his faith in that new Dominion; But the accidents which may occur are so many, as
it is impossible to comprehend every particular under one and the same rule. And is
it not a vain thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g to affirm, that strong Holds ought not to be made use of, because
if it so fall out as the State which wants them be lost, it may be the more easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered?
For that is no more then to expose a mans self to mortal wounds, out of
hopes that when he is hurt he may find a cure. And what Prince can assure himself
that though he hath been negligent in muniting his State with Forts, his Enemy
when he shall have made himself Master of his State, will not fortifie such seats as he
shall find commodious for his safety.</p>
               <p>But if it be said, that a Prince grows wicked, covetous, and cruel towards his
Subjects through his too much confiding in strong Holds, it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> easily to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that these so far remote affairs have any thing to do with the vices of the
mind, and if they ought to be taken into such consideration, the reason would
reach no further then to Castles and Citadels; but in greater and more important
Fortifications, the Prince is so much the more bound to preserve the love and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie
of his Subjects, in that he stands in the more need of them for the safety of the
City thus fortified, for if it should fall into the Enemies hands by the peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
the loss would be the greater. But it may be the consideration of expence
which that Prince puts himself unto, who builds many strong Holds, may seem to
bear more weight with it then any of the rest, whereas his chief care ought to be,
to accumulate treasure in time of peace, against Wars shall happen; to which it may
be answered, That States cannot be preserved without charges and expence; and
that if a Prince should go about to procure the like securitie to himself by his Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
as he doth by his strong Holds: he must be at infinite more expence, and such
as none but great Kingdoms and Empires are able to undergo. But if a Prince
proceed therein with such temper and judgement as hath been spoken of, and
which is also requisite in all things else, he can incur no danger by Fortifications, of
running into those disorders and necessities, which many careless men, and such as
know not how to govern do fall.</p>
               <p>We will then conclude, that Fortifications are very useful in all States, but
chiefly in small ones, and those more then any others, which have many Confines,
and powerful neighbors, for such States have need of good guards, and have not
wherewith to keep Armies perpetually on foot, as the Turks do in these times, nor
to make Desarts as do the <hi>Persians,</hi> nor to institute Colonies in several parts, as was
the custom of the antient <hi>Romans;</hi> and if the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> did imitate
them therein, it was but once; and with more desire to the self-inhabitants of the
Island of <hi>Candia</hi> at her devotion, then to defend it from forein Forces; But now that
the Turks power is grown so formidable, it would be altogether unuseful, and not
of any moment, without strong Holds, and a well paid Militia; therefore the care
and study which Princes take more in these latter times then they did formerly in
Fortification must needs be praised by whosoever considers things with a right
judgment.</p>

               <head type="sub">Whether the Opinion of Pope Leo the Tenth were good or no, and
his counsel safe, of driving forein Nations out of Italy, by the
help of other Transalpine Forces.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ITaly</hi> had been molested with Wars by forein Nations, almost continually
for the space of Thirty years, when in the time of the Popedom of <hi>Leo</hi> the
Tenth, she seemed to have some hopes of quiet, and of enjoying some better
condition, after her so many and so grievous vexations and ruines, which had
called to mind the unhappy memorie of the former calamities which she had
undergone by the invasion of the Northern Armies. But the wounds of the late
evils remained yet uncured; for two noble members of this Province were faln
into the hands of forein Princes, the State of <hi>Milan</hi> being at the devotion of
<hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth being possest of the
Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> which Princes being now weakned and weary with so many
Wars, so as the one could not exceed the other, and having at that time their
thoughts elsewhere bent, being governed more by necessitie peradventure then by
their own wills, they seemed to rest satisfied with what they did already posses in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and that they would suffer her to enjoy at least some rest after her past mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestations.</p>
               <p>In this posture of Affairs, Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who had often negotiated with several
Princes about the business of Arms, and had endeavored (as he said) the liberty
of <hi>Italy,</hi> and chiefly the preservation of the Dukedom of <hi>Milan</hi> in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Sforza's,</hi> was much displeased to have the power of strangers any
longer continued, and particularly that the Church should be berest of two noble
Cities, <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> which were become members of the State of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi>
Therefore with a haughty and generous mind, he resolved not to prefer an
unsecure quiet, before some present troubles, so to shun other molestations and
dangers, which he thought might grow the greater by such a peace, in future, if
not to himself, at least to the Church. And knowing that he should not be able
either of himself, nor by joining with other <hi>Italians,</hi> to drive forein Potentates out
of <hi>Italy,</hi> he resolved to join with some foreiners against some other foremers, with
design (as he said) that when some of them should be forced to forgo <hi>Italy,</hi> it
might be the easier to expel the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leo</hi> having thus put on this noble and generous resolution, it may seem to merit
praise by all men, as to the intention; but as for the means he took to compass it,
it is not so easily to be agreed upon; for many and weighty respects do concur there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
for some of which, this action may seem to be as wise, as glorious; and if we will
reflect upon other some, there will appear much more of difficulty and danger
therein, then of security and hopes. That all Transalpin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and consolidated, and must become more formidable to the Church, and to all the
Italian Princes, unless it were by some of the same forein Nations. If the sole
Forces of the Italian Princes, when <hi>Italy</hi> by reason of a long Peace did flourish most,
were not sufficient to stop the French Forces, which were then but new in those
parts, and but meanly assisted; what reason was there to believe, that this Province

to suffer them to settle there, and to get in time greater authority over the
people, and more love to the States which they had gotten, was a certain and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
ruine, and an utter abolishing of all hopes of ever restoring the States which
were postest by strangers into the hands of the Italian Princes. But the fear lest both
these Princes, who were grown so powerful in <hi>Italy,</hi> might join together against the
Territories of the Church, or those of other Italian Princes, to divide them amongst
themselves, as had happened not many years before, when the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi>
and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, King of <hi>France,</hi> who had been formerly at such great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
one with another, grew good friends by dividing the Lands between them
which belonged to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> might chiefly perswade the Pope to quit neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality,
and to side with the one or the other of these Princes. <hi>Leo</hi> knew, that upon
many past occasions he had done things not only of but little satisfaction, but of
much disgust to both these Princes and Nations, more particularly to the <hi>French,</hi>
who were alwaies jealous of his cunning; so as great emulation growing in them
both, and a desire of commanding over all <hi>Italy,</hi> and finding that affairs were so
equally poised between them in this Province, as the one could not much exceed
the other, nor make any new acquisition, it was with reason to be feared, that being
void of all hopes of having the Pope to side with either of them, from whose friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
they might for many reasons expect very considerable assistance, they might at
last convene together to the total oppression of the Liberty of <hi>Italy.</hi> Nor was
<hi>Leo's</hi> Neutrality in this conjuncture of time and affairs able to secure him from
such a danger, since he had formerly openly declared himself and taken up Arms in
company with others; and chiefly since the <hi>French</hi> knew, that he was no waies
pleased with their Dominion in <hi>Italy,</hi> as well for the common affairs, as for his own
particular dislike that they had possessed themselves of the Cities of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censa,</hi>
which were returned to the obedience of the Apostolick Sea by his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
<hi>Iulius.</hi> So as the Churches State, and that of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> which was
under the same Popes protection and government, grew to be those alone which
were exposed to the injuries of all men; for the <hi>Venetians</hi> were still firm to the
<hi>French,</hi> and the other lesser Princes adhered some to the fortune of the <hi>French,</hi>
some to that of the Imperialists. It was then the most useful, safe, and requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

counsel, to join in friendship by particular and reciprocal obligations, either with
<hi>Caesar,</hi> or with the King of <hi>France:</hi> By doing which, to boot with security, many
good effects might follow, to wit, that the adverse party being supprest and driven
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> that party which should yet remain there as friend, and free from the
jealousie or rivdship of any forein Prince, was likely to afford a long Peace (a thing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59987:104"/>
very necessary in respect of the many late afflictions) and such accidents might the
more probably happen in process of time, whereby <hi>Italy</hi> might more easily free
herself from the se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vitude of one only Lord and Master, then she should have done
from the like of two; it being unlikely that two Principalities should meet with
one and the same fortune, at one and the same time. But if nothing else of good
had happened during this discord and contention between these two Princes, their
States must be subject to the expences and troubles which do necessarily accompany
War; so as some revenge would be had upon these forein Nations, for the so
many calamities which they had brought upon <hi>Italy;</hi> and that saying of the
Scripture would be verified, <hi>To revenge a man upon his Enemies, by other
Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Empire began to decline, and the antient Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
worth and discipline was almost lost, they not having Forces sufficient of their
own to withstand the Northern nations, made use of the Soldiers of the same
Northern nations to drive their Fellow-foreiners out of <hi>Italy;</hi> as particularly
of the <hi>Goths,</hi> of whom they had several times great numbers in their Armies. But
say that one of these forein Princes could not have worsted the other, though assisted
by the Apostolick Sea, even in this condition of affairs hopes would not be wanting,
whilst War should continue between them: For after having long wrestled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
especially since the quarrel arose out of hatred and warlike emulation, it
was not unlikely that they would rather quit the Terititories which they held in
<hi>Italy</hi> to some third persons, then to yield one to another, so as it might remain in
their own power: Concerning which surrender, particularly of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi>
many Treaties had been formerly. <hi>Leo</hi> had likewise a very fresh example of councels
taken by the Venetian Senate, which in the same case was confirm'd by experience
to be very wisely done: For that Senate finding that their State was fallen into great
misfortunes, and reduced to so low an ebb, as she was not able to recover of herself,
they joined with some of their very Enemies, against other some of their Enemies;
whereby they did not only separate them, but did revenge themselves much to the
prejudice of those that they had excluded from their friendship, and did thus recover
the State which had been usurped from them. But <hi>Leo's</hi> advice was afterwards the
better approved of by the particular issue of this very business: For having after
many several cogitations of mind join'd in confederacie with <hi>Caesar,</hi> the City of
<hi>Milan</hi> was taken from the <hi>French</hi> by their joint-forces, and the Cities of <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ma</hi>
and <hi>Piacensa</hi> were recovered to the Church; not without great hopes, had it not
been for the unexpected and unfortunate death of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> should
have then been totally expulsed out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Maximilian Sforza</hi> reinvested into
the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> according to agreements made by the Pope, which would have
greatly secured the liberty of the Church, and of whole <hi>Italy.</hi> Which when it should
have so succeeded, there was reason enough to hope, that the <hi>French</hi> would join in
driving the <hi>Imperialists</hi> out of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> being satisfied (without
any other reward) with having revenged themselves for their received injuries, and
with seeing the <hi>Imperialists</hi> reduced to their condition, for what concerned the
affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> And it might be hoped that this might the easilier be done, by
reason of the far distance of <hi>Caesars</hi> Territories, and by reason of many ill humors
which began already to grow in several places; whereby be might be necessitated to
bend his Forces and thoughts elswhere, and leave his affairs in <hi>Italy</hi> but weakly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.
<hi>Leo</hi> then may seem to have grounded his councels well, like a wise Prince
(as he was) upon good foundations, for as much as may be effected by humane wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where so many other accidents do concur. Yet were there not wanting some
who did greatly blame this resolution of Pope <hi>Leo's,</hi> taxing him with inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

again in War: And if we shall look more narrowly into this business, we shall
find that many Considerations were wanting; which may raise at least some
rational doubts, whether the Pope were more to be praised, or to be blamed for
this action.</p>
               <p>It is most certain, that War in it self is troublesom to Princes, grievous to the
People, and subject to many various and uncertain chances. So that as every wise
Prince ought alwaies to avoid it, where there is no express necessity, it appears that
this Prince ought to have had it in more horror then any other, in respect of the
times, and of his degree and place, which ought rather to have made him endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
peace and quiet between Christian Princes. The Dominion of the Church
was by his Predecessors means arrived already to such a largness, as it might seem
better to become the Succeeder to augment the safety thereof by procuring friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with other Princes, and by a constant neutrality, then to expose himself to
new troubles and dangers, by adding more States thereunto. <hi>Italy</hi> having been
much afflicted, and brought in almost every of her parts to great misery and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
for having been the seat of War for the space of thirty years, did not onely
much desire peace and quiet, but did chiefly expect it from the Popes councels and
actions, by reason of his supreme authoritie, and of the zeal he ought to have born
to the publick good.</p>
               <p>How could it then deserve praise, that when forein Princes seemed to be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to suffer <hi>Italy</hi> to remain quiet, he should afford them occasion and means of
imbroiling her in new troubles and calamities; which were certainly to insue by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assuming
Arms, where the advantage which might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> gotten was very
doubtful and questionable? But, that which in this case <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be considered,
is, that <hi>Leo's</hi> intention being to drive the foreiners out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to vindicate
her liberty, he should have chosen some good means to have done it. Many antient
and modern experiences might have taught him, how hard a matter it might be
to keep the <hi>French</hi> on the other side of the Mountains. The <hi>Romans</hi> were not
more troubled with any other Nation then with the <hi>French,</hi> in freeing <hi>Italy</hi> from
forein invasions; for she was oft-times assaulted by them, and many of her parts
possest by them, and the Empire it self was endangered by their Forces. And of
late years since the passage of <hi>Charls</hi> the Eighth, though they had proved variety of
fortune, yet kept they still the same resolution of waging war in <hi>Italy,</hi> and of keeping
footing in this Province, not being frighted from this resolution by any misfortune
how great soever; but being once beaten back, they returned with great fury to seek
out novelties; and at this very time that we now speak of, they were possest of the
Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> Therefore to secure himself from the <hi>French,</hi> it was not sufficient
to drive them once out of <hi>Italy;</hi> for the Forces of that large Kingdom being still
very powerful, and they being alwaies prepared for novelty, their desire bore
them chiefly thereunto, where it had done formerly, so as <hi>Italy</hi> remained still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to new incursions, and subject to the miseries of War. Therefore this inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Pope <hi>Leo's,</hi> of keeping the <hi>French</hi> long out of <hi>Italy,</hi> could not peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have been compassed but in a long process of time, and with much variety of
success, no, not though <hi>Italy</hi> had been all of a peece, and in greater power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
then she then was.</p>
               <p>Whereas at this time the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> being now returned to great
power, was joined in confederacie with the King of <hi>France</hi> by vertue of antient
Capitulations; nor was it to be hoped for, that out of any uncertain hopes, and
of long expectation, she should easily forgo such a friendship: And as for other
Princes, they were but weak, and their ends not constant nor conformable. And on
the other side, <hi>Caesar</hi> was very bare of monies, and had many other irons in the
fire, so as the greatest weight and care of managing this War was likely to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59987:106"/>
the Popes share, wherein if he should slacken never so little, all that had been
done would have been to no effect; and those places, which by reason of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie
with the Church, were taken from the <hi>French,</hi> would quickly and easily
have faln into their hands again. But say that <hi>Charls</hi> had been able to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploted
all his Forces about this business, the greater they had been, the greater
share would he have pretended in the business: and the less able had the Pope or any
others been to oppose his Forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charls</hi> the Great, a Prince of excellent worth, freed <hi>Italy</hi> from the slavish yoke
of the Northern Barbarians, driving the <hi>Lombards</hi> from thence, who had had the
chief command there for Three hundred years; but he would therefore make the
greatest advantage thereof unto himself, creating his Son <hi>Pipin,</hi> King of <hi>Italy;</hi>
nor ought any of <hi>Charls</hi> his promises to be thought sufficient to shun such a danger,
to which it was known he was much more moved out of a fervent desire to draw
the Pope into this confederacie of excluding the King of <hi>France,</hi> then that he had
any waies quitied his desire to the Dukedom of <hi>Milan.</hi> What reason was
there then to beleeve, that when <hi>Caesar</hi> should be become more powerful in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and should have driven out the <hi>French,</hi> he should likewise be expell'd from thence,
when his Territories and Authority should be there the greater? It is rather to
be beleeved, that by his increase of power, <hi>Italy</hi> should be in a worse condition,
and the danger thereof the more, for whilst these two Princes stood upon equal
terms, and with an invererate mind did counterpoise one another, the other States
were the more secure, it being unlikely that any one of the parties would permit
that the others should increase, or be heightned by the ruine of any of the Princes
of <hi>Italy;</hi> but he that should be assaulted by one was sure to be assisted by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so as <hi>Leo</hi> ought chiefly to have endeavored in this conjuncture of affairs to
have kept these scales even by his neutrality; for whilst the business stood thus, it
behoved the very Enemies of the <hi>Italians</hi> to value their Friendship, for their own
good, and for the preservation of their States.</p>
               <p>It is not easie to decide whether it did really conduce more to the good of <hi>Italy,</hi>
that the Pope should continue in his neutrality, or by his joining with some one of
these forein Princes who at that time had so great an influence upon <hi>Italy,</hi> the success
being to depend upon many very much differing accidents; for since humane wisdom
is not able to provide against them all, she cannot find any secure way which leads to
that destin'd end. Let us say then (still keeping our selves within some general
rules) in the first place, that to join in friendship and confederacie with a more
powerful P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ince, and one who is a near neighbor, when the increase of power
is intended by this conjunction, is never to be done without danger, nor ought
such a resolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion ever be taken but out of great necessity; especially not by such
Princes, who are not so weak, as they need a leaning stock, not to depend in all
things upon the event of anothers fortune. Now <hi>Leo</hi> had no such reason to forgo
the little quiet which he had then purchast by plunging into a Sea of Leagues and
Confederacies, which are very hard to be laid fast hold of with Princes of great
powerl, desirous of glory, who pretend the same things, and between whom
War is not so easily ended, as it is reassumed. The Churches Patrimonie was
sufficiently secured by the majesty of Religion, by Pontifical power, by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
which by many waies she may be supplied with, and by her Dominions, being
at this time much inlarged by <hi>Iulius</hi> the second. So as <hi>Leo's</hi> intention is to be
praised for having his thoughts so carefully bent upon the Libertie of <hi>Italy.</hi> It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be desired that he had had either more judgement or temper, to know
and chuse an opportune time, and a sitting occasion; and yet it is likewise a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
rule, that to wait for the advantage of Time, when Affairs are upon great strieghts,
do usually bring notable advantages, and sometimes by new and unexpected waies.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59987:107"/>
                  <hi>Italy</hi> was long under the obedience of the Western Emperors: If at that time when
their power and authority was so great, the Popes would have call'd in forein Forces,
and made use of them to reduce the Government of <hi>Italy</hi> under the Churches
power, or else into the hands of some other Italian Princes, <hi>Italy</hi> would in the first
place have certainly been given in prey to the insolencie of foreign Soldiers, and
at last she would peradventure have been brought to a worse condition. But by
temporising, such occasions arose, as the Church increased her Dominions by
certain lawful Donations without the shedding of blood, and all <hi>Italy</hi> remained
subject to her own proper and particular Lords; and the Western Emperors being
long vex'd and troubled by the Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> were forced to forgo the affairs
of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, though <hi>Caesar's</hi> fortune and power was then very great, yet was it
subject to great alterations, by reason that he was a new Prince in his Dominions,
because that they were far divided one from another, and for that many were
apprehensive of so fast increasing greatness. So as many more opportune and better
grounded occasions might peradventure arise of compassing such an intent, and
the War made against him by the <hi>Germans,</hi> which tended so much to his danger,
might prove such a one. By making fit use of which accidents, <hi>Caesar's</hi> power might
receive a rebuke as concerning the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> if the French forces had been any
ways received, or that the <hi>Italians</hi> had been of the same mind as formerly they had
been more unseasonably. Therefore to separate the friendship of the <hi>French</hi> totally
from the <hi>Italians,</hi> as <hi>Leo</hi> did for as much as in him lay, discovering a double injury
to them, since the King of <hi>France</hi> might think that fraud was join'd to ill will,
could not be but an ill-taken advice. He had done better to have somewhat allaied
their power as to the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> then to have quite extinguish'd it, till the
<hi>Italians</hi> might get some better light how to recover their liberty. The <hi>Venetian</hi>
Senate took another course, though they had therein the same intent: For whilst the
affairs of these two Princes, <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperor, and <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> were
in the greatest heat of War in <hi>Italy,</hi> they would apply themselves to each of their
fortunes, and according to the condition of time and affairs, they often changed
friendship; being still constant in their aim, which was to keep their Forces as equally
ballanced as they could, and that they should both be weakened by their contention
one with another: But when occasion was offered of falling upon one without
too much advantage to the other, (as it did in the last Wars made by the <hi>Venetians</hi>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> after King <hi>Francis</hi> was let out of Prison) they stood firm and resolute,
not being easily perswaded upon any conditions to lay down Arms. For on the one
side, <hi>Caesars</hi> power did decline by reason of many adverse chances, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>Naples</hi> were in great confusion and danger: And on the other side, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>France</hi> were not much bettered as to the prejudice of the liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi>
for a chief Article in this Confederacie was, That the State of <hi>Milan</hi> should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to <hi>Francisco Sforza,</hi> as at last it was. But <hi>Leo</hi> in this conjuncture of affairs
did precipitate himself into friendship with the <hi>Imperlalists,</hi> and drew the enmity
of the <hi>French</hi> upon him, so as his danger became almost equally the same, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
event the War should have; and the sequel did more demonstrate this by
the imprisonment of <hi>Clement,</hi> and by the slavery which <hi>Caesars</hi> greatness threatened
to all <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So as it appears to reason, and by the sequel, that a noble and magnificent fabrick,
as <hi>Leo's</hi> proposition touching the freeing of <hi>Italy</hi> from the subjection of Foreiners,
was really to be esteemed, was not built upon of true and solid a foundation as was
able to support so great a weight. But for the present, after many various accidents,
the condition of affairs may be esteemed either good, or at least less bad; forasmuch
as <hi>Italy,</hi> through <hi>Philip</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> great wisdom and moderation of mind,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59987:107"/>
hath enjoyed a long and peaceful condition, and flourisheth no was much as she hath
done in many preceding Ages, to the Peoples great comfort, and to the singular
praise of the late Princes.</p>

               <head type="sub">Whether the Counsel taken by the Emperor Charls the Fifth, and
by his Commanders, of not parting from the walls of Vienna,
when Solyman was come with very great strength from
Constantinople to assault it, deserve praise, or blame.</head>
               <p>AS two great and famous Princes, not only for the largeness of their
Dominions, but for their particular warlike valor, the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi>
the Fifth, and <hi>Solyman Ottoman</hi> the Grand Signior of the <hi>Turks,</hi> did
both of them flourish in one and the same Age; so amongst the most
memorable things of those times, the stupendious preparations for
War made by the above-named Princes in the year 1532. was most remarkable,
and variously thought of. All possible means was used by both of them, and the
whole World put into Arms; so as the fortune of these two Empires was judged to
depend upon the worth and prowess of these two Armies. But the success did no
ways answer the fame of so great Princes, and the noise of the preparation; for
neither did the Imperial Army stir at any time from the walls of <hi>Vienna,</hi> nor did
the Turkish Army come within many miles of them.</p>
               <p>Now since more recent businesses have recalled this to memory, it may prove
no unuseful Consideration to represent what of praise, or of blame may be given to
this resolution put on by the Emperor <hi>Charls,</hi> and his Commanders. Many were of
opinion then, and the same may now be thought, that in this case, or in the like,
the managing of War in this manner, standing only upon defence, and expecting
to be assaulted by the Enemy, did much withdraw from the reputation of the
Christian Militia, which was already much in the wane, and was sufficient to awaken
fresh spirits and boldness in the <hi>Turks</hi> to undertake any thing the more easily against
them in the future; since the flower of all the Soldiery of all the strongest and most
esteemed Nations of Christendom, being assembled under the conduct and auspice
of a mighty Prince, the Head of all Christendom, and in a business of such weight,
which had drawn the eyes of the whole World upon it, not any the least thing was
put forth against these Enemies, no Army brought to face them, nor put in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of seeming really to desire battel; none of their Forts were assaulted, no
Country of theirs prejudiced: Why were so many valiant men brought from their
own homes into far distant Regions? why such expence? why such preparation
for War? Was it that so strong and flourishing an Army should rot and moulder
away about the walls of <hi>Vienna?</hi> What could have better decided the question
which till then was disputable, in behalf of the Ottoman Princes, and of the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Militia, and against the true honor of War, which our Princes and Soldiers have
long laid claim unto, and sometimes atchieved, then after so great a preparation of
Arms, after so cried up an enterprise with intention to quell the Turkish forces, to
halt so long, and to so little purpose, not knowing what resolution to take, but that
that Camp, then which no former Age had for a long time seen a greater, nor a more
noble one, should stand still, like an unmoveable Fort? Being overcome by truth,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59987:108"/>
we must confess that the hopes of Victory for Christian Princes was lost, or at least
brought to this pass, as not to lose, must be termed Conquest; but neither could
this be done by taking this course.</p>
               <p>No Christian Prince had usually so great and so setled a Militia, as could conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
maintain such an Army in the field, as was at this time put together with
much pains and industrie; so as by drawing out the War in length, they might
think to weary and disorder the Enemy, and finally to overcome at last. But on
the contrary, the Turks, who have continually a numerous well ordered Army,
may easily upon whatsoever occasion send forth very powerful Armies to vex the
Christian Princes, taking sometimes one place, sometimes another, without ever
quitting them, or being driven out from them: whereof there hath been so many
proofs already made, whilst we do nothing but make a defensive War against the
Turks, as till this time hath most commonly been done in this very business, and
by those very Princes who managed this War; the experience whereof hath been
too evident, and too much prejudicial, by the affairs which unhappily be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which delay might peradventure prove unfortunate, by reason of the weakness
which is brought upon the Forces of Princes by long lying idle, and especially those
of such Princes as keep not a continual Militia on foot. Whereas the Turks, who
have an Army alwaies ready and well paid, and who by making one War continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
spring from another, keep them alwaies well disciplined, might at another
time with greater Forces assault the same Territories of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> as
it happened not many years after. So as had they not been freed from greater, and
more eminent dangers by <hi>Solymans</hi> death, the authors of this advice might have
repe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,
how far the true zeal of Religion, and a noble forwardness hath been
often favored from Heaven with prosperous success; as when divers Princes of
<hi>Europe</hi> crost the Seas to wage War with the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and to recover, as they did,
the holy Land from the Infides, driving them out of divers Cities of <hi>Asia,</hi> whereof
they were possest.</p>
               <p>But these are not the sole examples; for he who shall call to memorie greater
actions done by famous Commanders, will know that they were well advised when
they assaulted the Enemy, not waiting for him at their own doors; since the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
and damages are great and evident which do accompanie those who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the War diversly in this principal point. He who assaults the Enemy within
their own Confines, enheartneth his Soldiers, infuseth fear into the Enemy, carries
all loss and danger from his own home to that of his Enemy: But he that staies
expecting that the Enemies Forces should come home to him, minding onely to
withstand him, encourageth the very Enemy, and makes him the more bold and
insolent, puts his own Subjects in despair, by making them maintain their own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and exposing them to the rapine of the Enemy. Moreover if any adverse
chance befal whilst the Enemy is in the bowels of their State, all that they have is
made a prey of, and irrecoverably lost.</p>
               <p>We read of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in whom we have the character of a most excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
that King <hi>Cyaxares</hi> being encamped in his friends Country, and staying
there to expect the Enemy, he advised him to change his resolution, and to enter
the Confines of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and set upon them at their own doors, and shewing
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59987:108"/>
him the advantage he might make thereof, perswaded him to do so; by which mean
he got a notable Victory, worsting a great many of the Enemy with a much lesser
number. It was alwaies <hi>Caesars</hi> course, who was the true Master of good Militia,
both to pre-occupate the Enemy, and to be the first that should assault, when
Battel was to be given; thinking that the courage which the so doing infused into
the Soldiers, did to boot with other benefits, help much to the getting of the
victory; wherefore he taxed <hi>Pompey</hi> of an error, because he did not so in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Battle of <hi>Pharsalia.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> understanding that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was coming
with a powerful Army to prejudice them in <hi>Italy,</hi> though the first defence was made
by mountains and craggy situations which he was to overcome, yet they thought fit
to fight him before he could get into <hi>Italy,</hi> and so keepe the War the furthest off
them that they could. But <hi>Scipio</hi> not being able to bring him to Battel, though he
met with him at the banks of <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> as soon as they heard that the Enemy was
got on this side the mountains, the <hi>Romans</hi> would not notwithstanding withdraw
their Armies, as if they had been afraid to come before the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
<hi>Hannibal</hi> gave out he would assault, but sent their men with the same Consul <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
to beyond the River <hi>Po</hi> to fight him, wisely knowing that the danger doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
so much the more, by how much nearer the Enemy approaches to the heart
of the Country. And the same <hi>Romans</hi> understanding afterwards that <hi>Asdrubal</hi>
was coming with a great Army in <hi>Italy</hi> to assist his Brother <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they resolved
to meet him beyond the River <hi>Metarus,</hi> to prevent the Enemy, knowing that
to eschew this danger, was to occasion other great dangers. Thus the victory
gotten over <hi>Asdrubal</hi> bereaved <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the victories which he was likely to have
gotten, if the <hi>Romans</hi> had been slower, or less resolute in encountring the Enemy.
The Imperial Commanders ought to have taken the same advice, and might
have done it; for the Turks must make a much longer march into <hi>Hungary</hi> and
<hi>Austria,</hi> then we to assault their Confines, which are now grown too near us.
Moreover the Turks chiefest strength lying in their Horse, which cannot march
till the earth afford fodder for their Cavalry, and being to come out of hotter Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
into a colder Region, they cannot without much difficulty and incommodity
march into the field in the first season of the year, as others may do, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
doth differ from theirs, both in the condition of Militia, and in the temperature
of the Air, wherein the first skirmishes are to be made.</p>
               <p>So as it appears to be very strange, nay, indeed a very great wonder,
that having made so great a preparation for War, they would not so much as
in thought pre-occupate the Enemy, and enter into the upper <hi>Hungaria,</hi> from
which Country they might have been furnished with many commodities, and upon
occasion, secure themselves by a fortunate day, a long time from Turkish Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
for it was not likely that by <hi>Solymans</hi> departing that year without having done
any thing, he should forsake the Guardianship and protection which he had taken
upon him of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> but rather aspire to make himself Master of
that Kingdom, as he did, being more encouraged thereunto by the weakness and
backwardness of the Imperialists, who if when they had done their utmost, had
done nothing at all, and the Turks knowing that <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperor being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in other very considerable Wars, would not be alwaies able to afford his
Brother so great assistance, was not this a great incitement to them quickly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the War, to the greater prejudice and danger not onely of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> laid claim unto, but even to the like of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> own Territories?
and not long after the fact it self shewed what might have been foreseen by reason;
for <hi>Solyman</hi> could not onely not be perswaded to quit the protection which he had
taken of his Pupil King <hi>Steven,</hi> but before he should come to any accord with
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> demanded tribute from <hi>Austria;</hi> and the conditions both of the War and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59987:109"/>
Peace growing daily worse and worse, the greatest part of <hi>Hungary</hi> being lost after
the notable discomfitures of the German Armies at <hi>Essechlo</hi> and <hi>Buda,</hi> and the other
part continuing still in great danger, the certain loss was known which did redound
unto them by not hazarding a Battel at this time, when the fears and hopes were at
least alike on both sides.</p>
               <p>But say that this had been too rash, or too difficult a thing to have been effected,
what hindred them or disswaded them from passing through their own Countries,
and marching with their Army to between <hi>Dava</hi> and <hi>Sava,</hi> a Country which had
not at all been prejudiced by the late Wars, and therefore fit to furnish their Army
with victuals, and where there are many mountainous seats, which were advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> and incommodious for the <hi>Turks</hi> in respect of their Cavalry;
whereby they might have preserved two Provinces, which were Patrimon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and therefore ought to have been the more carefully
kept, <hi>Carinthia</hi> and <hi>Stiria;</hi> which being abandoned, were left a secure prey unto
the <hi>

                     </gap>urks,</hi> who utterly destroyed them by fire and sword, endangering likewise the
loss of some of their chief Cities; for the way would have been block'd up, and kept
<hi>Solyman</hi> from coming thither, if it had been first possessed by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> and
<hi>Solymans</hi> reputation would have been much lessened, if he had tarried behind, leaving
that Country untouched, which he was come to assault with so great an Army.
But to do as the Imperialists did, to keep so many men with so great a Train of

                  </gap>ress, and which
being but meanly provided of men, had formerly repulsed great Turkish forces;
what was it, but by this new and prejudicial example to confirm the Turks, and even
our own men, in the opinion, that the Christian Militia was inferior to that of the
Turks, and that our Princes being intent upon their own defence, and not without
some fear to imploy their utmost endeavors therein, were for their parts to suffer
the Turks to enjoy their large Empire in peace and safety? Which the Ottoman
Princes have brought to so vast a greatness, not by letting their Forces lie idle,
and by being content to defend that Title which they had gotten at first, but
by going every where to find out the Enemy, fighting him upon all occasions,
and by making their way by their swords into other mens Countries. How oft have
the Turks entred into the Consinus of <hi>Persia,</hi> nay, wrought themselves in even to
her inmost parts, chiefly intending to come to a day of fight with the <hi>Persians</hi>
Armies, which they have often enected? though the <hi>Persians</hi> were rather to be
feared, then to be despised, for their antient honor in War, and for the manner of
their Militia; and yet at last they have in these last Wars got safe possession of the
chiefest part of this most noble Kingdom.</p>
               <p>What then is more to be said, but that if this way of proceeding have proved
prosperous to those that have walked therein, he who takes another way walks on
towards destruct on, and either through ignorance, or too great a thirst after quiet
and secu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity, involves himself into greater troubles and difficulties? And though
the loss be made by peece-meal, which may peradventure make it appear the less, yet
at last the whole falls into more certain, though a later ruine. And to speak of more
modern affairs; how had not only the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> but several other
States of Christian Princes been preserved from the Turkish power and insolencie,
if the Leagues Fleet, shunning all occasion of fight, had retreated without that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Victory of <hi>Lepa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>?</hi> But it was afterwards more cleerly seen, that <hi>Charls</hi>
his intent on in this War was far from joining battel with the <hi>Turks,</hi> either that he
would not hazard his glory and honor, or manifestly confess himself interior to
<hi>Solyman</hi> in Forces, when <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Austria</hi> being assaulted at another time
by the same <hi>Solyman,</hi> in stead of succoring of assisting his Brother who was in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59987:109"/>
danger, he went to try new adventures in <hi>Africa,</hi> of a much more inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
nature. If a day of Battel be ever to be had, what else was there to be done
to keep off the ruine which doth threaten Christendom every day more and more?
He who hazards, may lose; but he may also win: And he who stands idly, and does
nothing, whilst he endeavors security by useless means, does by degrees daily fall
into new dangers, and doth as it were voluntarily (but for certain, basely) submit
himself to the yoke of a grievous and unworthy slavery. If <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> had
been so forward to furnish men and monies for this enterprise, (the authority of so
great a Prince who was the chief Author and Head thereof, being considered) as
upon other occasions which did happen not long after, these assistances might have
been sooner hoped for. When were the whole Forces of <hi>Germany</hi> seen so united,
as they were at this time? Nay, it was rather to be doubted that many seeds of
discord were to grow, which were already spread abroad throughout this Province,
by reason of Religion and State-policie, whereby <hi>Germany</hi> might be weakned and
divided. From whence then was there any good to be hoped for against this so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Enemy, if so great a preparation for war proved altogether vain and useless?
The condition of present Times, and of long Custom, will not suffer us now to hope
that we may see what formerly fell out in that famous Councel of <hi>Clerement,</hi> that
at the words of an Hermite, at the bare exhortations of a Pope, Christian Princes
and people should readily take up Arms against the Infidels, being content for bond
of firm union to be all of them signed with the sign of the Cross. But now when
any such thing is treated of, such disputes are made upon every point, every one
looks so much to their own particular ends (not measuring things aright, nor mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the common interest in comparison of their own) as Leagues and Unions being
contentiously handled, slowly concluded, and untimely dissolved, there comes no
good of them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it cannot be said, that they thought by delay to reserve occasions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for Victory, to which the Cause which was then in hand ought not a little to
have excited them; to wit, the maintaining of King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in his just pretences
to the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary;</hi> from whom, without any right, and unprovoked by
any injury, it was attempted to be taken. Very shame should likewise have been
able to have made them not suffer so miserable a spectacle of such devastations and
ruines as were made by the Barbarians in <hi>Carinthia</hi> and <hi>Stiria,</hi> whilst they stood
looking on with so great an Army; at which the Imperial Commanders being at
last moved, they went about (though late) to revenge these injuries; and their
boldness being assisted by fortune, the Freebooters were routed, and almost quite
discom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ted in all places where they were assaulted. So as it appears it may be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this late example, that they might have done greater things, if they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
it. Moreover, so many military men might very well have known what
advantage might have been gotten by giving Battel, since in this posture of affairs
great rewards were to be expected from the Victory, and but small loss, had they
been beaten: For the Christian Army, if victorious, might have penetrated into
the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions, where there are no strong Holds, save some few upon the
Frontiers; and not meeting with any obstacles, might have marched even to before
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> planting their Trophies in sundry places, by one sole Victory.
Whereas on the contrary, the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> upon any adverse fortune, had many
strong Holds whereunto to have retreated, and by maintaining them, might have
retarded the course of the <hi>Turks</hi> victories, and have recruited their broken Forces.
But say, I pray you, who could assure the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> that they should avoid the
hazard of a Battel? Was it not rather to be believed, (especially if we will consider
the boldness of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are wont to meet but with weak resistances) that
answerable to what they gave out, they would advance and force the Christians to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59987:110"/>
give Battel, as the Voyage taken by <hi>Solyman</hi> did promise, who kept not within his
Consines, but was entred into the Imperialists Country, so far as some of his
Horse Troops made inrodes even to <hi>Newstat</hi> a Town standing in the same Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine
Country, and not far from <hi>Vienna?</hi> And say that being assaulted by the
Enemy, they had been forced to fight, who can deny but that both before, and
after the conflict, the business would have proved hazardous to the Imperialists,
since they were to fight at their own homes, and in their own defence? For great is
that astonishment which is caused by the bold coming on of an Enemy, and men are
alwaies readier to run away there where they have best means of saving themselves;
and in case of adverse Fortune, the danger is greater when the Enemy is in
the bowels of the State; and if the inhabitants overcome, the less good redounds
by the victory, because the enemy hath time to rally, and to defend himself. These
were therefore notable disadvantages, which were unaviodable whilst the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
Camp remained fixt before the walls of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and thereby made themselves
to depend upon the Enemies resolution.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all this, he who shall duely consider the present condition of
the Affairs of the Empire, of the Militia, and of all other things which belongs to
such a business, may peradventure be of a different opinion, and judge otherwise,
and if not commend, at least excuse the resolution taken by the Imperialists, of not
parting with their Army from before the walls of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and from the River <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius.</hi>
That the Turkish Empire is very great, and potent, is a thing too well
known by us to our cost; but the care how to prevent the maladie and weakness
into which Christendom is fallen by the greatness of such an enemy, hath been so
long in cogitat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on, as to use violent means, might bring ruine upon her, rather then
procure her safety. Christian Princes have not in this age a setled, well disciplined,
well ordered Militia, and kept in perpetual pay, as the Turks have, and as the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and some other Empires have formerly had; Whence it is that numerous
Armes cannot be raised without length of time, and much difficulty; and for
want of continual exercise, by which the Soldiers of one and the same Nation
have been known to be able to supply every military Office, recourse must be had
to several Nations, for men fit for several actions in War; so as it is thought that
either by natural inclination; or by antient Custom, or by meer opinion, every
Nation is best, some for one thing, some for another; as also because there are but
very few in any place, who are well instructed in Military affairs. For no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
is entertained except it be in time of need, or some few who are kept in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
with little or no exercise.</p>
               <p>The charge also of assembling Soldiers from several, and far distant Countries,
as also all things which belong to War, is much the greater; and whereof not
any one State of our Princes is compleatly furnished. So as put all these together,
it is from hence, that when any enterprise hath been to be taken against the Turks
in these times, with numerous and powerful Forces, they have not been able to be
got together in any reasonable time, nor well ordered; which delay arising from
necessity, hath hindred our preventing the Enemy, and our assaulting them at their
own doors. But particularly, is it not very well known, that at this time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we now speak, <hi>Caesar</hi> was to assemble Soldiers from so many Nations, subject
to other Dominions, and to joyn together the Auxiliary Forces of <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>Italy,</hi> as in doing thereof so much labor and time was spent, as before the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Army was mastered at <hi>Vienna, Solyman</hi> was already come to <hi>Belgrade?</hi> so as,
to have resolved upon preventing the Enemy, and of assaulting his Confines before
the arrival of his Army, was impossible, though it had been thought expedient
to have done so; nor ought reason to prevail over experience; and this so much the
less, for that there wants not other reasons to prove that the Turks are readier at
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59987:110"/>
their counsel, and speedier at their executions, then we can be. But let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that all prolixity and difficulties therein might have been helped, and that
it had depended upon the free will of the Imperial Commanders to assault the
Turks within their Consines; say, I beseech you, what design could the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
have had to euer into the Enemies Country? Should they perhaps have stood
idly expecting the shock of the Turkish Army, if it should advance towards them?
or if <hi>Solyman</hi> should not have advanced, but have shunned the encounter, should
they have marched on and forced him to fight? Or should they have endeavored
to have taken some of the Towns, or Forts which were held by the Turks, by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault;
and carry the perjudice home to him, who would have brought it to them
in the defence of another man? Let us examine all these things, by considering
the last proposition.</p>
               <p>In what place should the Imperial Army have incamped, which would not have
been very incommodious for them, and far off? they were not yet absolutely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of divers Cities upon the Frontiers of <hi>Hungary,</hi> as they were afterwards. But
let us argue the business in general; if the place were weak which they should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
what honor should they win thereby? Or would the advantage of such an
acquisition have been answerable to the expence, and to the expectation had of such
an Army? Besides, such purchases are to little purpose; for such places are soon
regained by him who is master of the field; and if the Imperialists would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
the taking of any strong place, and should not have effected it soon and
easily, to how great danger did their Army expose it self? they must either raise
their siege, with loss of honor, and with those other bad consequencies which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in such like cases; or else they must keep their station, and be cut in peeces,
when a powerful Turkish Army should come, and find the Imperialists scattered and
busied about the taking in of strong Holds; as afterwards fell out upon the like
occasion of <hi>Buda;</hi> which might teach Commanders, with what temper they are to
proceed when they fall upon such affairs, and when they have to do with a potent
Enemy. But it may be yet more strongly urged, that whilst the Turkish Forces
should keep themselves safe and inire, the Imperialists had but little hopes of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they should happily have gotten. Were not <hi>Modon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and <hi>Corone</hi> recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Turks by the Imperial Forces, under the Ensigns of the same <hi>Charls?</hi>
yet these very Towns were soon after abandoned, and forsaken, because they knew
they were not able to maintain them against the Turkish pussant Forces. Have not
the Imperialists and Spaniards made oft-times many attemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s in <hi>Africa,</hi> and had
good success therein? Yet in whose possession are these very places now, which
were gotten with so much charge and danger? Did not the Turks soon repossess
themselves of those places from whence they were driven? The League made
against the Turks in the year 1537. wherein the same and forces of the same Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Charls</hi> were interessed, did it not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Fortress fit for their greatest
designs? But how long were we able to keep it, though it were strongly garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned?
These experiences may serve to shew, that the good gotten by such cost and
labor, hath not at last proved any thing, save dishonor in forgoing what was
gotten.</p>
               <p>But to fall upon the other head; If the Imperial Army should have continued
incamped in any strong situation of the Enemy which they might have taken, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
attempting any thing more; how would it have been in any better condition,
then it was when incamp'd before <hi>Vienna?</hi> rather on the contrary, the danger was
greater and more evident of falling into mighty disorder, especially for want of
victuals, by their going from the Banks of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> from whence alone they
could have been safely and oppor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ely furnished therewithal; for they were to
provide for the victualing of a great many, and the Enemy did abound in Horse,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59987:111"/>
whereby their succors might have been cut off. It may peradventure be alleadged,
that they might have preserved a great tract of Country from the inrodes, plunder,
and firing made by the <hi>Turks.</hi> But first, they were not certain to make this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
the Country being large, and exposed to such accidents as these; nor were
they able, without dividing their Forces, to supply all places: And the <hi>Turks</hi> seeing
this place well guarded, if they should have taken their way above the <hi>Danubius,</hi> as
they did beneath it towards the <hi>Alps,</hi> finding the fields more large and open in
those parts in <hi>Moravia, Silesia,</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> they might have made larger inrodes,
and with less danger: whereas having quartered themselves in the mountainous situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of <hi>Stiria</hi> and <hi>Carinthia,</hi> they might at least revenge the injury, and in some
sort preserve their honor by killing many of them, who being disbanded, were gone
to pillage the Country.</p>
               <p>It is commonly advantagious to advance towards the Confines of a State,
where the Passes are narrow and difficult, either by the ruggedness of the situations,
or by reason of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orts upon their Frontiers, so as the Enemy may be by these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
kept afar off. But what was there in King <hi>Ferdinands</hi> States, which could
perswade him to take this course; the Country being large, open, and where many
Armies would not have been sufficient to have kept out an Army which was resolved
to enter, as these did? But it may be said again, that this was not a loss which
would counterpoise (as might very well have happened by reason of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies)
the breaking up of that Army, whereon the defence of King <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nands</hi>
States did relie, and which was of so great a concernment to all Christendom.
And it may be also added, that the further the <hi>Imperialists</hi> had advanced, whereby
they might the better have met with the Enemy, and have fought him, if they should
not afterwards have done it, their fear would have appeared to have been so much
the greater, and that they had repented to have proceeded so far; whereby they
should not only no have increased, but have lessened the reputation of the force and
worth of that Army. But for what concerned their marching forward to encounter
the Enemy, with a resolution of giving him battel at his own home at which the
Considerations made to the contrary do seem chiefly to aim, it is business of so
weighty, and so numerous consequences, as it deserves to be well examined. It is
a general Rule, That it is requisite the Assailant should have greater Forces then
he who is assailed, or at least equal Forces: And is there any one so blinded with
desire, as that he does not see the <hi>Imperialists</hi> disadvantage in this behalf? <hi>Solyman</hi>
brought with him an Army consisting of One hundred and forty thousand fighting
men, and almost as many men more for other Camp-occasions, furnished with
Artillery and all other Requisites for War, an Army verst in Victories, and which
was then to fight in the sight of their Lord and Master, a fortunate and valiant
Prince; and who are promised by their Law, that whosoever dies fighting for his
welfare and glory, shall be eternally rewarded in heaven: An opinion which hath
much advantaged the Turkish affairs in point of War. Entire obedience, excellent
military discipline, patient undergoing all wants, and great toil and labor, are things
whereunto the Turkish Armies are accustomed; in vertue whereof it is, and not by
chance, that they have had so many victories: And it was the opinion of all men,
that these things did at this time abound in that Army. Now on the other side, the
Imperial Army was far short of this in numbers, the fighting men not exceeding
the number of Fourscore and ten thousand, whereof there were but Thirty thousand
Horse. It is hard to say what men might promise to themselves from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
and Soldiers gallantry, since no precedent nor subsequent trial hath been
known to be made against this Enemy: Marry, such disorders as are usually seen in
our present Mili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia, might easily be therein seen; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> mutinies before
they were come to the Camp, the like of the <hi>Italians</hi> after their arrival, great and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59987:111"/>
open hatred amongst the Nations which were in the same Camp, as if they had been
in two Enemies Camps, insomuch as they were like to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all together by the ears more
then once, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> being jointly highly incensed against the
<hi>Dutch;</hi> the Commanders at variance amongst themselves, envying one anothers
glory, raisers of commotions and disobed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence amongst the Soldiery, as was seen by
the last of punishments inflicted upon some of them. Now what the issue in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
might prove betwixt two such Armies as you have here described of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists</hi>
and of the <hi>Turks,</hi> any man may judge, who is capable of ordinary reason,
without any further experience of War.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to the other heads: What situation could there be chosen which
was not disadvantagious for the Imperialists? The parts of <hi>Hungary, Wallach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a,</hi>
and of the neighboring places where the Armies were to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et, consisted all of open
Champaigns, where most assuredly the Horse (wherein the Turkish Camp did so
abound) have the better of Foot; and worth is overcome by numbers, where the
lesser Army may be circumvented by a greater multitude, and better use may be
made of Horse, which may either advance where they find advantage, or retreat
without any prejudice where they cannot withstand the Enemy. Therefore the
Imperial Commanders knowing the disadvantage thereof in that situation which
they had taken, though they were secured by the City of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and by the River
<hi>Danubius,</hi> yet they stood alwaies with their Squadrons in order for any assault;
their Foot was divided into three great Squadrons, whereof one stood firm in the
midst, and betwixt this and the other two were the Horse quartered, so as they did
inclose the whole body of the Army, which was surrounded and secured by great
store of Artillery. Another reason may be added, which is, That in case of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
the Imperialists Army might suffer a greater discomf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure then that of the
Turks; for it would be harder for the former to keep any of their Foot entire, or
<hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> then for the Turks to preserve their Light-horse, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ready according as occasion should serve, either to charge, or sustain a charge,
and save themselves. Wherefore it may be said, that the hazard was not the same,
and therefore not to be put to the trial, as affairs stood. And if it be advantagious to
assault an Enemy at his own door, the affording rest to Soldiers, whereby to be the

and are wearied by their long march, and the inconveniences thereof, hath also
something of good in it.</p>
               <p>Nor must we be govern'd by examples wherein the same accidents meet not;
for general Rules are not to be observed at all times, and especially not in War,
which is subject to so many variations. If <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> when the first
went to fight the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and the other the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> had been in that
condition as those were of whom we now speak, we may perswade our selves (such
was their known wisdom) that they would have done otherwise: And if the <hi>Romans</hi>
chose to meet <hi>Hannibal</hi> first on the other side the Mountains, and afterwards at his
first entrance into <hi>Italy,</hi> it may be said, besides the diversity of accidents which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell'd
them so to do, that our Princes have no such Militia, nor so ready, as the
<hi>Romans</hi> had, nor had they means of recruiting their Armies so soon as the <hi>Romans</hi>
could do in case of adverse fortune; and that they were able to maintain so many
Armies, not only in <hi>Italy,</hi> but in <hi>Spain, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> at the same time when
<hi>Hannibal</hi> was in <hi>Italy,</hi> shews, that as they were forward in giving Battel, so they
knew how to supply themselves again: which the Imperialists could not at this time
have done, if they should have lost that Army, which they had taken such pains to
assemble together from so many several parts. It is acknowledged, that to put ones
self upon the hazard of a Battel, is a thing which is done by wise Commanders when
they are back'd with another Army, which may afford them means of fighting a

else a whole State is adventured upon one only Battel. As for the success of the
Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> it was accompanied with some accidents which are seldom seen to

because we might make use of the advantage of the Venetian Gallious, by whose

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ered before they could come to a further
conflict. But the next year, the condition of affairs being altered, they took an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
course: For the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were taught by their former bad success, not
being willing to join battel with our greater Vessels, and our men being wisely well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised
not to divide nor separate their slighter Gallies from the greater, as finding
themselves either weaker therein, or at least not stronger, there was nothing done,
though the Fleets were several times very neer. In this point likewise, the Land-Militia,
and that of the Sea doth differ; for as for Sea-fights, the Christian Forces
are in number equal in Shipping to the <hi>Turks,</hi> but sufficiently beyond them for
matter of worth and discipline: Marry, in Land-Armies the <hi>Turks</hi> do far exceed the
Christians in numbers; and as for valor and good discipline, they cannot as yet be
accounted inferior, unless we will, to detract from the Enemy, and to our own
shame, as having been so oftentimes beaten by so base and unexpert men.
But howsoever it be, we cannot but have a great esteem of the Turkish power,
which their continued prosperitie hath made so. What reason was there then that
a new Army, made up of so many several Nations, wherein the Soldiers did hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know their Captains, and were much less known by them, who had not as yet
done any military act jointly, nor well learnt how to know, nor follow their colours,
not acquainted with the Country, and wanting all those things through which, by
the true Art of War victories are gotten, should advance, and give Battel to an
Enemy so formidable both for same and forces? nor can the event of a set Battel
be truly judged by what befel those of the Turkish Camp, who disbanding from
the rest, went, though in great parties, to pillage the Enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es Country, the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
not being any thing alike; the Turks had the disadvantage of the Countries
situation, of being loaded with prey, of being in disorder (as commonly befals
those who go to plunder, not to fight) and of other accidents. But besides all
this, he who relates this business, mentions not any baseness in the Turks, but
saies, That notwithstanding these disadvantages, they defended themselves ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously
to the utmost of their power.</p>
               <p>But what did the same <hi>Solyman</hi> (who cannot be denied to have been very vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
and greatly experienced in matter of War) though he had all the advantages
that have been mentioned? he did not advance with his Army as near as, as he
might have done, nor did endeavor to enforce others, nor to be enforced himself
to fight, but rather went out of his direct way, which he had taken to come to
<hi>Vienna,</hi> and kept for the most part in strong and commodious seats, as between
the two Rivers of <hi>Sava</hi> and <hi>Drava;</hi> and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a powerful and van glorious Prince,
who professed that he had undertaken that War meerly out of a desire of glory
would make use of haesitatious counsels, where the consequences were so great and
so heavie; how would it have becomed <hi>Charls,</hi> a Prince no less wise then
valiant, and who was necessituted by many other important affairs of some
other States of his, to leave <hi>Germany</hi> suddenly, as he did, to have put himself
upon the dubious events of Battel, whereby to indanger almost his whole
Fortune? When <hi>Marius</hi> was sent against the <hi>Cymbrians,</hi> who were faln down
into <hi>Italy</hi> (which was thought to be as considerable a War as any that the <hi>Romans</hi>
had made) the same circumstances concurring thereunto, whereby to infuse terror,
as do now to make the Turkish Forces so formidable; as crueltie, barbarism, the
great number of the Enemy, and the fame of the victories which they had won;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59987:112"/>
the wise Commander would not (though many occasions had offered themselves,
and that he was taxed by the unexperienced, of timerousness) come to a pitch'd
field with such an Enemy till for many moneths space he had kept the Army ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to the performance of duties, and to Military actions, and chiefly till he
had acquainted them with the aspect of the Enemy, and how to have the bett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great advantage.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Caear</hi> used to prevent the Enemy, and to be the first that should assault;
it is to be considered that he commanded a veteran Army, of whom he had by
long Wars had much experience. So as the same example is not to be made use
of in a new and tumultuous Army, and of so different conditions. But let us
likewise consider what were the reasons which made these two Princes take up
Arms; for by the first rise of Wars the reason of their administration, and the
good means whereby to conduce them to a good end, is best known. The War
was offensive on the Turks behalf, undertaken with great surquedrie, and with
great hopes of victory and glory; <hi>Solyman</hi> having propounded unto himself to
revenge the injuries done by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> then King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to <hi>Iohn</hi> King of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> who reigned under his Guardianship and protection. But whether this
was his true intention or no, or but pretended, that he might possess himself of the
Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> (as afterwards he did) it was most certain, that he could not
compass his end of beating the Forces of these two <hi>Austrian</hi> Brothers, <hi>Charls,</hi> and
<hi>Ferdinand. Caesar</hi> on the other side, being usually distracted and busied,
as now in particular, in other Wars, had betaken himself to this, to defend
the assaults which were threatned his Brothers Territories, as also the honor of
his family, or rather that of all <hi>Germany;</hi> or, to confine ones self to narrower
bounds, it may be said, that this contention of War did pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>yman,</hi> who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
little to his honor, been driven from before the walls of that City, professed
to return thither with greater Forces, being firmly resolved to reduce it to his
power, and to challenge the Emperor to a pitch'd Battel. <hi>Charls</hi> on the contrary,
having brought his Forces about that City, had propounded unto himself the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, and to frustrate this so great furie and boasting of <hi>Solymans.</hi> Now then,
whilst <hi>Vienna</hi> was preserved, and that she was kept free from all dangers, and that
<hi>Solyman</hi> was so curbed and frightned by the Imperialists Forces, as that he du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not advance, or make good his word which he had publickly professed, did not the
Imperialists effect the business they had taken in hand, without the effusion of
blood? Did they not preserve their own honor, and do service to all Christendom?
If this Army (as the success of Bittel is more uncertain and dubious, then any
whatsoever other humane action) had received any no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able defeat, when would
this wound have ever been cured? The afflicted body of Christendom must have
its wounds long kept open, and have still ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cerated more and more. How would
<hi>Caesars</hi> particular Enemies have been encouraged to fall upon his Territories, and
to have endangered and molested his own particular affairs, whilst he should have
shewed courage enough, but little good counsel in defending another mans right,
which did not immediately concern himself? Had the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rks in former times been
made retreat to their own Confines, as now they were, without having made any

                  </gap>sition, they had not been masters of so many Christian Kingdoms, as now they
are. And had their Forces proved still vain, their Militia would have been imbased,
and they would have been discouraged from troubling others without any good to
themselves; which peradventure would have been the safest and securest way of
weakning so great a power as that, by temporizing, affording them thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of growing idle, and of falling into domestick disorders, so as they might the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59987:113"/>
more easily have received a blow, and have been overcome both by cuning and force.
Nor will it avail to affirm the contrary, as if the future dangers and troubles had
been certainly to have happened, or that they might have been made greater by a
new commotion of War; for it was more answerable to reason, that when <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
should have done his utmost with his whole Forces, assisted by his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
he would have suffered the Estates of <hi>Austria,</hi> and of <hi>Germany</hi> to have
remained quiet, if King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had rested content with his own Patrimonie,
and with the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> together with the hopes of succeeding in the
Empire, without intricating himself in new troubles, by obstinately maintaining
his pretences to the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> drawing thereby the fury of the Turkish
Forces upon him, as he often did. So as King <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and his Councellors
are more to be blamed for those many mischiefs which ensued afterwards, and for
those which we are still threatned with by the so near neighborhood of the Turkish
Forces then <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperor and his Commanders. For they seeing King
<hi>Iohn</hi> taken into so powerful a protection as that of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, so as it
was impossible to put the <hi>Dutch</hi> in possession thereof by driving of him out; all
anger and ambition ought to have been laid aside, contenting themselves rather with
the neighborhood of so weak a Prince as the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> then with that of
so powerful and formidable a Potentate, to whom four Empires and eighteen King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
do yield obedience.</p>
               <p>These things may be on all sides variously considered, as various Judgments
may be given on those actions which are not of a setled, ordinary, and natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
but which through various accidents do flote up and down, as it happens in
counsels concerning War. The truth is, that the Forces, hope; fears, and almost
all other consequences of these two Empires were (as it were) equally ballanced in
this behalf: So as it was a work not discernible by humane wisdom, or by any true
grounds, whether to have come to a pitch'd field, or to abstain from doing so, would
have been the better advice. In either of the Armies, the Flower of the Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tia of
the warlike Nations both of East and West was assembled, a vast number of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
excellent Commanders, most valiant Princes, and of as great renown as any of
whatsoever former Age, and who had both of them won famous Victories. Great
were the rewards, great the inconveniences, which were proposed on all sides ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the various success of such a days fight; immortal glory, shame not to
be rased out, high hopes, greatest fears. So as it is no wonder if in this parity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which presented themselves before the eyes both of the <hi>Imperialists</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi>
a Battel, for which both parties were prepared and disposed, did not ensue. In which
case he who will detract any thing from the <hi>Imperialists</hi> in not daring to fight, must
praise their wisdom as much, and their mature advice; it being a Rule generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of by the universal consent of all men, That where the business is doubtful
and difficult, we must rather adhere to that which holds us from doing any thing,
then to what eggs us on: For, <hi>Had I wist,</hi> comes too late, and is always to no
purpose; whereas whilst things are whole and entire, place is left for new

even into their most secret retirements who forsake the world, being a vice which

               </gap>ie, wherein
I took such delight, as I wrote a book thereof, which I was afterwards perswaded
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59987:114"/>
to print, and so to impart it unto others: I learned how to become morally good;
it is true I did; but is not the first precept in this knowledge, that the doctrine of
manners, is it of self very vain? For it consists in doing, in action, not in knowing; it
had been much better, that setting his commandements before mine eies, who is the
true and real Master of that Christian life which I live, and have yet to live, I should
have imploied my time in observing the precepts of the divine Law, rather then
in collecting the Documents of Philosophers; who wanting the taste of that truest,
chiefest, and most excellent vertue, which divine love doth so much the more afford,
as it is the more ardently inflamed, applied themselves to a certain mediocritie, which
is better discerned or known in their Idea, or in their writings, then in the affections
or actions which they go about to moderate. Afterwards, when I was come to mans
Estate, being commanded so to do by him whom I ought to obey, and it being a
thing also which I my self did much desire, I betook my self to write the History
of my Country; a good and gallant work. But what proportion can the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
which I hoped for thereby, bear with the pains I took, which was truly very
great? Had I spent part of the time and study which I imployed therein, in the
reading of divine Books, I cannot doubt but that I should have been inflamed with
the love of spiritual things, which for so long a time I did so little relish. And to
pass by other things, I cannot deny, as best knowing mine own intrincecal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but that whilst I labored so much to celebrate the fame and glory of others by
these my Writings. I often felt within my self a certain tickling and delight out of
the hope which I flattered my self withal, and wherewith I nourished my thoughts,
that by these my labors I my self might likewise reap some honor; and (as the
Poets say) live in my fame after my death. Oh gross vanity! and when this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
(with which I must confess I was sometimes drunk) gives place to reason,
I acknowledge, that amongst all vanities none is greater then wordly glory; which is
vain, because man glories of that which is none of his, for he hath received every good
thing, especially the endowments of the soul, from God: Vain, because it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it self; it hath no true existenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, it is made up of various opinions of men,
and of theirs most, who know least; Vain, because it reflects upon that which is
not in us, upon that which is a trivial and common accident, to wit our Fame, the
memory whereof we do with so much vanity desire to propagate. Tell me thou
humane soul, which are so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>amored of this bare shadow of good, which
doth not at all belong unto thee, if after thou art departed out of this world, thou
couldst have any thing to do with humane affections, what good would this folse
glory do thee, which thou dost so much do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e upon, as thou dost sometimes lose
the way which leads to true heavenly glory: If thou shalt be damned, and in the
eternal torments of Hell, thinkest thou that the satisfaction of this thy glory shall
be able any waies to ease those immense and unconceivable Torments? and in thou
shall be fixt in heavenly bliss, what need in that abode hath he of worldly glory, who
is glorified with eternal glory? who is satisfied, who is content, who is for ever
blessed? But since I examine mine own waies, I return to consider my life.</p>
            <p>Some few years since I gave myself to the government of my Country; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I found the way so plain and easie, and the savor and grace of my Country so
far above my merits, as I soon got into great Honors, and into the chiefest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
which I still containe in, and do imploy my time. But my Talent is
so small, as though I spend it all, I know it is but little. And if I spend all, how
can I, according to humane respect, be blamed? Or what reason have others to
complain more of me, then I have of my self? Since so little a part of my life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
or almost none at all, wherein I may recollect my thoughts, what time
have I to think of my end? to repent me of my sins? to endeavor amendment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and yet I see I am not diligent in doing any thing. The most troublesom, yea, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59987:115"/>
the most contented thoughts wherewith my mind is now incumbred, will vanish as
a shadow, or as smoak before the winde, and shall be withered as flowers by the
Suns beams; and yet whilst this mind of mine is continually involved in these affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
cares, it is so filled with the fantasms of those things wherein I imploy my
self all the day long, as I most meditate onely upon them, and though unwillingly,
have them alwaies before mine ties, at all times, in every place, and upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
So as all contemplation of nobler and better things which I sometimes turn
my self unto, is alwaies mixt with these base affections, and troubled with these
clouds of worldly thoughts.</p>
            <p>Alas, how hard is it to serve two Masters, God and the World? The world mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
its actions by its worldly respects; he who makes that his stay, who lives
acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng to that, can make no new laws to himself, but must govern himself by
those which are commended, and practised by those who walk in the waies of the
world. But how far different from these are Gods waies? Patience, Humility,
Poverty, Obedience, Self-denial, and the giving over of all worldly care, are
things which are abhorr'd by the worldly wise, but otherwise to God. How badly
do the fallacious rules of worldly wisdom agree with the instructions of true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie,
especially those of this corrupt Age, wherein heavenly and divine things
are often troubled and confounded with a certain vain name of Reason of State.
Crowns, Empires, Kingdoms, and all power is given by God; and though the
weakness of our reason be such as it cannot penetrate into the infinite abyss of his
wisdom, yet does he dispose and order all things with certain and infallible ends,
though unknown to us. Therefore unless that great, and omnipotent Lord God,
by whom Kings do not onely reign upon earth, but the earth it self is sustained and
held up with a miraculous equality of weight, do not keep the City, how vain is all
this your learning, O ye wise men of the world? and you Princes, how vain are
all your Forces to maintain your Lordships and States? Thou, whosoever thou
art, who dost manage the weightiest affairs of Principalities, put thy heart into the
hands of thy God, and he will infuse worthie and becomming thoughts into thee;
He will give thee true Wisdom and true Fortitude. The World builds
nothing but Towers of <hi>Babell;</hi> nor is it aware thereof, till its desig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and
many years labors, being overthrown by its own confusion, it sees its rashness
laid low; and those thoughts which aimed at Heaven thrown, down to Hell.</p>
            <p>But I return again unto my self. I see that these many years past wherein
I approach to old age, I imploy my time in studies, thoughts, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of differing natures in themselves, but all conformable to what tends
to my prejudice. For they robb'd me of my rest, have still oprest me with
many cares, and led me astray from more holy desires, to which, if I had
bent my mind in time, I might hope now to sit and feed at the Table of those
true good things which now I want. What do I then do? What do I think?
What do I expect? Why do I not change my thoughts and exercises, if
I know that those wherein I have hitherto spent my time do me no good;
nor for all the labor I have taken, have made me ere a whit more happy then I
was at first? Nay, I may say, they have made me more wretched, since I have
consumed the greatest part of my life wofully, and without any profit. Do
I peradventure hope, that whilst I my self do not change, the nature of those
things wherein I am verst should alter? That trouble should turn to delight?
That the Affairs of the world, so full of anxious cares, should turn to the peace
and solace of the soul? That worldly good shall assume a new vertue of make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their possessors well apaid and satisfied? That these brackish waters of
the pleasures of the Age, of which the more we drink, the more we are athirst,
should become sweet and savory, and afford any true delight or content? Men
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59987:115"/>
who are blind in what concerns their own good, are wont to pervert the nature of
things; to make them their Masters who are given to them to be servants. Such
are the goods of Fortune, as the common people call them, because they know
not how to raise themselves up to the knowledge of that mystery whereby their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Author and free Donor doth dispense them. But what greater misery is
there then this humane felicity? The true Lord and God is made known unto us,
and yet we continue to adore the Idols of Avarice, Ambition, and Vain glory:

be not of great worth, as truly they are not, why dost thou so much love them?
Why endeavorst thou so much to be master of them? Why dost thou dread the

of our life. But if we would consider their infide, and discover the deceipt and
cousenage which is woven therein, we would shun them, as some holy men have
done, least we be by them, and with them hurried down into Hell and damnation.
We have our happiness within us, and seek for it elsewhere. He who will search
his own house well, what wealth shall he find there whereby to inrich himself
with precious treasure, which is hidden from us because the darkness of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59987:116"/>
these fruits of true peace? So full of cares, and destracted with so many thoughts?
Who is continually to combate with those Enemies who wage within him, to wit
the affections of worldly things, to the which we our selves, do as it were furnish
Forces against our selves, by finding out new objects, and new materials whereby
to increase them. We worldly men will feed the soul with meat which belongs
not to her, wherefore it is no wonder if we be never satisfied, and if one appetite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
another even <hi>in infinitum;</hi> You, you are they who teach us by your lives and
examples, that nature is satisfied with a little; and that man can never be said to
be rich by abundance, nor poor by want; other goods, other endowments, other
ornaments are requisite then those the world seeks after; the further a man advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
therein, the further he finds himself entred into an intricate and confused Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
and after having made a long voyage, he findes himself further from his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

<hi>Martha;</hi> I know which is the right and safe way, and I take an intricate and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
way to lead me to my desired end. I am busied, sollicited, and troubled with
many things, and yet I know that one thing is onely necessarie, that there is but one

               </gap>ng which can so become the companion of my life, as it will never forsake me. I
serve the world, and being given over to cares I entertain them more and more; love
of Children, Houshold government, administration of goods, the Commonwealths
business, are things which I would fain free my self of; but I neither know how, nor
when to do so. I endeavor to be less affectionate in having to do with worldly things;
to taste them for nutriment, not to be drunk with them; but how hard is it to fix
the slippery appetite so, as it fall not from the use to the abuse of those things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it is continually excited by the provocation of its perpetual companion, Sin?
He who stands alwaies near the fire, though he thrust not himself into it, so as he be
burnt and consumed, yet he must feel a troublesom heat; and which is worse, the
soul which is outwardly warmed with these earthly affections, freezes inwardly
for what concerns divine things: Prayers grow luke-warm, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not usual; and in brief, the thoughts of the soul are choaked by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
of the body. Yet I am much comforted, that I find in my self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
a desire of becoming better; which is a sign that I have not lost the

my actions and thoughts flote up and down, not knowing where to find a Haven
to put into; yet (thanks be given to God) this ship of my soul which contains
many precious wares in her which were assigned over unto her, hath not made ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.
The integrity of communication, puritie of conscience the knowledge of
the truest good, things which I have not used according to their worth, are yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
at their true price and value; so as they may one day enrich my soul. Thou
my Lord, thou my Creator, thou my Redeemer, to whom my thoughts are better
known then to my self, let this my reverent affection be acceptable to thy charitie;
through thy great goodness pardon my imperfections, and supply my defaults by
thy infinite merit, so as I may totally despise these earthly things; free me from
