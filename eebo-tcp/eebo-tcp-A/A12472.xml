            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which for my part should haue gone on, and passed without any my speeches, or writings, if it had passed in innocencie and simplicitie of it selfe. But because it so deepely reprooueth the contrarie minded, argueth their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, confuteth their opinions, impaireth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> alleaged, the Author knoweth by whome: I thought good, being one of the simplest of those that preach that doctrine, yet most touched in the said Treatise, to deale towards thee after this sort.

For what is the estimation of a minister in the Lord, if he be bereaued of the truth? None surely in my iudgement, any way. First therefore iudge thou of my doctrin: secondly thou shalt, if God giue grace, vnderstand our faults and imperfections laid to our charge.

            <p>Amongst other things and points of this sort, that trouble many, is this one; Namely, concerning <hi>praier for All men.</hi> And some say we ought to pray for all men, and some say we ought not. From thence they grow to reason, concerning Predestination, and Election: so of Calling and Reprobation: then to discerne this mans wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now in handling of this question, I see many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to ensue. On the one side, if I saie, Pray for all men: then they will say, What shall become of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates? Beholde one that praieth for reprobates. All men shall not bee saued. And all men are not to bee praied for.</p>
            <p>On the other side, if I say, All are not to be praied for, I feare I shall speake against the truth, against the Church of God, against scripture it selfe.

            <p>Some haue said, That it is a superfluous thing, to pray for all men, That such men are more charitable in praier then God would haue them to bee, That they doe more worke than euer the Lord required, That it is a superfluous and foolish charitie. And (therfore) one in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2747:7"/>
acertain booke, setteth down this state on the question.</p>
            <q>But now for the better satisfying of those, which haue beene troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter, and desired resolution at my hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for the remouing of their doubts, we wil a little further consider of the matter, and see what we are to iudge of it by the word of God, which is the perfectest rule that we can go by. Your question (beloued in the Lord) is, whether it be lawfull to pray for all men, or no. Yea euen for the verse reprobate, whom God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h reiected in his eternall counsell, that they may be saued in the day of the Lord. For that is the state of the qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stion indeed. To which my answere is. That al men being taken in that sense, we are not, Nay, wee ought not, to pray for all: because all shall not be saued.</q>
            <p>In these words (first) there is a satisfying promised, and that according to the best rule, (which is the Word) and it is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll if it be performed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the question is set downe: which I mislike for sundrie causes. First it comprehendeth in it too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to bee comprehended in one queston. As, <hi>Praier, All men, R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>probates, Reiection, Eternal counsel of God, Saluation in the day of the Lord</hi>; And euerie one of these will moue manie a question.</p>
            <p>Also it containeth a diuision of the question, and so in part to import a resolution. As, when mankind is diuided in the question, into Elect &amp; Reprobate, which sheweth not plaine dealing: and the question not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently propounded, which thing should be obserued.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is farre from the nature of a question in art.<note place="margin">Aristo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he putting forth of a question: and not to farce in as much as we list. For a simple question is short, and containeth no more than ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> expresse the thing that is spoken of, As, <hi>An sit fides,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ether there be faith or no. And the compound que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2747:7"/>
hath but the nature of the proposition. As, <hi>An fides sit iustificans,</hi> that is, whether faith be iustifying, or no. And therefore a question must bee proposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently and plainly: Let obiections or exceptions be answered as they may.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the verie Pharisies propounded the question more truly (in respect of the nature of the question) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, than this is, when they said: Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto Caesar, or no? And therefore,<note place="margin">Ramus.</note> as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> noteth out of <hi>Aristotle. Amputanda quae supersunt,</hi> The things that abound must be abridged. And this is the question, and the onely question, <hi>Wheher it bee lawfull to pray for All men or no.</hi> For other things contained in the question, they shall bee answered in their place.</p>
            <p>Now then wee come vnto the answer. The answer is, That in that sense, they are not to be praied for. And there is a reason added: because all shall not be saued. But these things are matters disputable. And the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not rightly propounded, the answere can not bee much auailable. And as for the reason, it shal stand forth in his place, and come to the sifting.

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:2747:8"/>The question is, Whether al men be to be praied for or no. S. <hi>Paul</hi> answereth, Let praiers, supplications, intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and giuing of thanks, be made for all men.</p>
            <p>But that I may proceed herein, for the edifying of the simple, I will first shew the occasion of this rule, and the circumstance of this place: secondly, I will grow on to the interpretation of the same.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle of the Lord, that <hi>Timothie</hi> might the better be furnished for the ordering of the Church of Ephesius, first biddeth him take heed,<note place="margin">1.

               </gap>lleth them, for whom praier should be made. For all men, For kings, and for all that are in authoritie.

            <p>The circumstances are sundrie: and the first is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Apostles person, the author and giuer of this rule of praier.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2747:9"/>
from the Lord: Exhort that first of all, and before all things, when the church is gathered to heare the word teach them and exhort them. That streight in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in this sort, and for this purpose they pray vnto and call vpon the Lord. And he ioineth herevnto the foure kinds of praier <hi>(Deprecationes)</hi> deprecations or praiers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating the Lord to deliuer vs from all euill, from the daunger of sin, from punishments and plagues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anging ouer our heads. <hi>(Obsecrationes)</hi> Obsecrations, supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when we desire at the hand of God, happier suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in the estate of the church: the plentifull increase of blessings, both spirituall and temporall, to be poured vpon vs: the summe of which good things are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Lords praier. <hi>Postulationes interpellationes,</hi> Intreatings or praiers, when we poure foorth our iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before the Lord, pray for the conuersion of them that afflict vs: and when we intreat the Lord one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, for sauing health, and deliuerance. <hi>Gratiarum acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones,</hi> Giuing of thanks: when we praise the Lord, for his benefits, renounce our owne strength, confesse all from him and his goodnes. Thus then the Apostle saith: I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort aboue all things, that publike praier be made in the church and congregation: that is, praiers intreating the Lord for deliuerance, supplications for the increase of Gods gifts, both spirituall and temporall: postulations, intercessions, for conuersion sauing health and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: giuing of thankes, for the Lords great kindnesse shewed. Let these be made in the congr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gation for all men. Thus far then we see plainely, who commaundeth, the Apostle of the Lord, a sure maister builder, from and by the spirit of God: What he commandeth, publique praier to be made: For whom, For all men.</p>
            <p>Now yet for all this, we are not thought to haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any great furtherance or aduantage, towards that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2747:9"/>
state in this question which we looke for, if we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our selues. For although the Apostle say, Pray for all men: yet it may be in some certaine phrase of speeche. And though it bee pronounced <hi>All men</hi>: yet in some speciall sence, it may be particuler inough. And so to pray for all men, may be no more to say, Then to pray for some men, or for some men of all sorts, &amp;c. For this phrase <hi>All men,</hi> is taken sundrie waies: and it may be S. <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth some one of those particuler waies. And therefore we will speake of them first, and shew which all men we meane. In the treatise before spoken of, there is sundrie distinctions of (all men) as in this phrase of speech: Such a man teacheth all the towne grammer; Al men go in at this gate: when as yet he teacheth no more, then such as come of the towne; and no moe passe at the gate then such as goe in. Againe this word (All) is not put alwaies in the scripture for euery particular man woman, and child: but sometime for the greater part: as, all the Aegiptians came to <hi>Ioseph</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">Gen. 47.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the greater part. And sometime for the elect: as, As by <hi>Adam</hi> all die: so by Christ shall all be made aliue: that is, all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, &amp;c. Sometime it is taken also for the wicked, as thus: Ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake: that is, of all the wicked. For the auoiding (therefore) of these and such like manner of speeches, I set downe in plaine words after this sort, That S. <hi>Paul</hi> when in this rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue specified, commanded to pray for (All men) that he meant that wee ought to pray for all men, that is, all people, vniuersall mankind. And for the auoiding of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles, in this sence doe I take his words through all this whole discourse: and therefore I will proceed after this sort.</p>

For we ought to hope well of them, seeing they are created to the image of God. And seeing our saluation commeth onely, for the meere and free goodnes of God; why will hee not do the like to them, which now are in the way of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as wee were.

               </list>
               <p>These wordes containe especially three things: First the exhortation or commaundement, concerning praier in the Church, and for whom, in the first verse, according as I haue set downe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the end and effect, that may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the second verse, To lead a quiet life, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A reason of such kind of praier, For it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the sight of God, &amp;c. in the third verse.</p>
               <p>Concerning the exhortation, or commaundement, which is the first verse, hath beene sufficiently spoken: that is, That it is a commaundement, that praier be made for all mankind in generall: publiquely, and vniuersally in the Church and congregation: yea for kings, and for all that are in authoritie, vnto whom any dignitie or ciuill function is committed. For Christians might thus thinke, That they ought not to pray for them which conferre and bestow all their riches and power to withstand the Gospell, and the kingdome of Christ Iesus: which thing before all things is to bee sought. For Rulers how many so euer they were, at those times, were euen as it were so many tyrants, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors, and euen sworne enemies of Christ, and of the professors of his holie name. The Apostle (therefore) euen meeteth with this scruple, bidding them also to pray for them: For surely the wickednesse of men, can not cause or worke any thing, but that neuerthelesse the ordinance of the Lord, is to bee loued and praied for. And kings and magistrates, are ordained of God. For euerie power is of God: yea, euen the wicked Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and gouernors, are giuen for the sinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his iudgements hanging ouer their heades.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2747:16"/>
Now in that he saith, For kings, and for al that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; might be good matter found, and arguments drawne, for the defence of the cause, and Praier, as wee haue set downe. For I doe not thinke, that verier Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates haue liued, since the ascention of the Lord, then haue beene some, contained in this clause, where it is said (Kings, and all that are in authoritie) whome the Church, from time to time hath praied for. And yet as most wicked rebels and apostataes, haue fallen away, or haue quite renounced, or neuer receiued, or more cruelly persecuted, or more feare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ully beene blinded, from the waies of the truth, and the light of the Lord, which liueth and lasteth for euer.</p>
               <p>But because the matter hereof, is comprehended in this, That praier is to be made for <hi>All mankind</hi> vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally: and that such like arguments are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein. Therefore I surcease vpon such occasions, and goe forward to my prefixed article, and point: which is to shew the Reasons, why praier should bee made for all men in generall, beginning with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> in the third verse aboue: who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this reason:</p>
               <q>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, who will that All men shall be saued, and come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the truth.</q>
               <p>This reason conteineth two thinges: The one, that this kind of praier for mankind and for all men, <hi>is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God,</hi> the other thing is a consequent thereof, shewing, <hi>that it is his will, that all men should be saued, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> And therefore such a praier is pleasing vnto God, and agreeable vnto his will.</p>
               <p>The first part.</p>
               <q>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Sauiour.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:2747:16"/>A good God is not pleased but with good things, he is pleased with this praier, this praier (therfore) is a good worke a good thing: Early in the morning will I direct my praier vnto thee, and will looke vp:<note place="margin">Psal. 5.4.</note> for thou art the God, that hast no pleasure in wickednes, neither shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euill dwell with thee:<note place="margin">73.</note> truely hee is kind and louing vnto Israell, euen vnto such as are of a cleane heart.<note place="margin">Psal. 100.3.</note> Bee thankfull vnto him (therefore) and speake good of his name: for the Lord is gracious, his mercie is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting; and his truth indureth from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>It is also (acceptable) that is, wel pleasing: yea it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him better then a bullocke, that hath hornes and hoofes: Thinkest thou that I wil eat buls flesh,<note place="margin">Psal. 50.13.</note> and drink the blood of goates: Offer vnto God thankesgiuing: Who so offereth me thanks and praise, he honoreth me. Thou delightest not in burnt offerings:<note place="margin">51.17.</note> the sacrifice to God is a troubled spirit. The Lord said vnto <hi>Salomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Reg 3.</note> ask what thou wilt, that I may giue it thee: <hi>Salomon</hi> said, giue thy seruant an vnderstanding heart. &amp;c. And this pleased the Lord well, That he had desired this thing. For it was to discerne righteously between brother and brother, for the setting vp of iustice and iudgement, and for the preseruation of his people. So intreat God for his people, yea and for all mankind, count it not a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in praier more then God requireth: say not it is a superfluous and foolish charitie to doe it. For it is the Lords commandment, and such kind of praier, is good, pleasing, and acceptable in his sight: and he shall heare it, and it shall returne into my owne bosome. And this much for the first clause or part.</p>
               <p>The consequent of the reason, is a describing of the will of God, to be applied vnto thy praier, wherby thou shalt know, that thou seruest him. For hee that calleth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2747:17"/>
vpon him, according to his will, serueth him. And the words be these:</p>
               <q>Who will that All men shall be saued, and come to the acknowledging of his truth.</q>
               <p>Some take these words and make them absolute of themselues, and apply vnto them sundrie significations: according as they may bee taken in diuinitie, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as in some sence, and in some respect, this way or that way, they may be interpreted: but that is not much pertinent to this matter. For the words are respectiue, and are the cheife clause and weight, of the reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the holy ghost, establishing that praier. For the exhortation concerning this rule of praier, consisteth of three parts. A proposition, the end and effect, and a reason.</p>
               <p>The proposition. <hi>Let praier be made for all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The end and effect. <hi>That we may lead a quiet life, in all godlines, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason. Thou wilt say, Why so? and wherfore? the holy ghost informeth thee: <hi>For that is good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, in the sight of God our Sauiour.</hi> And he confirmeth that by his will: who will haue all men to be saued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth: as if he should say, Therefore is it good and acceptable in his sight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would haue no man cast away, but be saued: because he would haue no man ignorant of him, but all to come to the knowledge of his truth: he will not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should conuert and liue. We need not be afraid to vnderstand the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles words, I doubt not but the Apostle knew what he wrote, for he had a good teacher. Let vs therefore take them according to the mind of the teacher. And since his mercie stretcheth vnto All men, let vs hope
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2747:17"/>
and pray that we may be of that number, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and enioy such his mercies, laid vp in store for them that loue him.</p>
               <p>But least I may seeme to speake some vnnecessarie thing, let me shew by other places of scripture, my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning, and whether the reason of any doctrine or scripture, be so necessarie or no: or whether I haue spoken cleane from the purpose. First (then) we read in S. <hi>Mathew.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> While thoughts did arise in the heart of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> it was said vnto him of the Angell: Feare not to take to thee <hi>Mary</hi> thy wife: (the reason wherewithal he is confirmed, is) for that which is conceiued in her, is of the holie ghost. Againe, thou shalt call his name Iesus: The reason, For he shal saue his people from their sins: againe, He that abideth in me, and I in him,<note place="margin">Io. 15.5.</note> the same bringeth forth much fruit: The reason, For without me,<note place="margin">Io. 4.23.</note> can ye doe nothing. Againe, the true worshippers, shal worship the father in spirit and truth: The reason, For the father requireth euen such to worship him. Again, Ye know not of what spirit ye are: The reason, For the son of man is not come to destroy mens liues,<note place="margin">Luk. 9.55.</note> but to saue them, &amp;c. Againe, But there are some of you that beleeue not: The reason, For Iesus knew from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which they were that beleeued not,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.64.</note> and who should betray him. Wee see in these few as in many, how notablie the spirit of the Lord, doth suggest a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son proper to the thing that is handled, for the further instruction, comfort, and edifying of his children. As if he should say in plaine words: search the scriptures,<note place="margin">Io. 539.</note> For in them, ye think to haue eternall life, and they are they that testifie of me. A reason most notably encouraging the seruants of the Lord, to seeke for eternall life, and to seeke to know Christ in the scriptures. So here in hand at this time, Pray for all men: For it is acceptable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2747:18"/>
to God, who wil haue all men to be saued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. A reason setting forth the pleasure of God, that before him such a praier is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that he will the same too: that they pray, that is, All men to be saued, and to know the truth. Then wee see, euen from the instruction of the spirit of the Lord, That these words yeeld a reason p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which purpose <hi>Caluin</hi> noteth vpon this place, After that (saith he) the Apostle had taught that that thing was profitable which he commanded: now he setteth downe a more forcible argument, that is, that it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto God, <hi>Nam vbi constat de eius voluntate, instar omnium rationum nobis esse debet.</hi> That is, For where the matter is knowne to be the certaine will of God, that ought to be vnto vs in stead of all other reasons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.

                  <hi>Quia autem dei voluntas regula est, ad quam exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da sunt, officianostra omnia,</hi> Because indeed, The will of God is a rule by which all our duties and doings, are to be squared and tried.

Thus he saith, Imitate thy God, desire as he desieth: If he will haue all men to be saued, pray thou for it. This holy father seeketh not out anie strange sense, anie other way; He biddeth thee doe, as God willeth.</p>

Doth not the Phisition therefore make shew in publique place; as that hee sheweth hee will heale all commers: yet so, as if he be sought for of the diseased, &amp;c. This holy father respecteth the outward ministerie, and the voice of the Gospell: he derogateth nothing from the will of God. God hath giuen health for all, if they will come: he is a Phisition for all, if they will seeke him.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hereof thus writeth.<note place="margin">Aug. Encher. ad Laurent.</note> 
                  <hi>Praeceperat enim Apostolus, vt oraretur prò singulis hominibus &amp; specialiter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderat prò regibus &amp; ijs, qui in sublimitate sunt, qui putari po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terant, fastu &amp; superbia seculari, à fidei Christianae humilitate abhorrêre. Proindè dicens: Hoc enim bonum est, coram sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatore nostro deo, id est, vt etiam prò talibus oretur: statim vt desperationem tolleret addidit: Qui omnes homines vuls sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uos fieri, &amp; in agnitionem veritatis venire. Hoc quippe Deus bonum iudicauit, vt orationibus humilium, dignaretur sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem praestare sublimium.</hi> For the Apostle had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that praier should bee made for euerie man, and especially he added for Kings, and such as were in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: who might bee thought through pride and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2747:19"/>
worldly pompe, to abhorre from the humilitie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith. Therefore saying: For this thing is good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God our Sauiour, That is, that euen for such, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be made: Forthwith, That he might take away des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, he addeth: who will haue All men to bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

               <p>Saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> After the Apostle had said and charged, to pray for euerie man, and all that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; That he might take away desperation, hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Who will haue All men to be saued. This, saith he, he speaketh, that none should despaire. And againe leauing Gods secret discerning and iustice to himselfe: we must sincerely beleeue, That God would that all men should be saued. So then these fathers diminish nothing of the Lords commission. Pray (saith one) as God commaundeth: If hee will saue all, pray thou for all. He will saue all (saith an other) but thou must keepe the condition, and draw neere vnto him. Lastly, These wordes (who is the Sauiour of all men, &amp;c.) are added to take away desperation. So these fathers nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the nature of the wordes: but make considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how they bee applied concerning praier, for all mankind in generall.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Caluin.</note>But let vs heare later writers, and what they haue thought. First (therefore) maister <hi>Caluine,</hi> speaketh thus hereof, <hi>Sequitur deinde huius secundi membri confirmatio. Quia velit Deus omnes homines saluos facere.

Then what is more right, then that our praiers should readily serue, at that our Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. Lastly, he sheweth, that the saluation of all men is well pleasing vnto God, because he calleth all men to the acknowledging of his truth. It is an argument <hi>(Aposteriori.)</hi> For if the gospel be the power of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to saluation, to all that beleeue. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that all are inuited, to the hope of eternall life, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the Gospell is offered, &amp;c. Master <hi>Caluin</hi> here inioyneth vs, to pray as the Lord commaundeth, That the saluation of all is pleasing vnto God, That all are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited, to whom the Gospel is offered.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cal. vpon the first to Tim. ca. <hi>1.</hi> vers. <hi>3.</hi> ser. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note>Also in his sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s thus he writeth. This is the reason why S. <hi>Paul</hi> vseth this argument, that God would haue all the world to be saued, to the end, that as much as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in vs, we should also seeke their saluation which seeme to bee as it were banished men out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, especially at such time, as they are vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers. And againe a little following:</p>
               <p>And indeed we see, how holy writ doth greatly set forth this adoption, that God had made of this people of the Iewes. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth vs to pray for all the world: and so, not without cause addeth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2747:20"/>
which is here set downe, to wit, Because God will haue all men to be saued. Also afterward; For why are we in this world, but onely to set forward the good will of God, as much as we can: Thus maister <hi>Caluin?</hi> Wee must pray as the Lord decreeth, The health of al is wel pleasing to God, All are inuited to whom the gospell is offered, We must seeke the saluation of all: Wee must set forth Gods will, We must pray for all the world.</p>
               <p>And out of the Siriac, the words are thus translated: <hi>Qui vult vt omnes filij hominis, seruentur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tremelius.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; sese conuertant ad cognitionem veritatis, &amp;c.</hi> Who wil that all the sonnes of man be saued, &amp;c. So translating all the sons of man, for that which we say, All men. And master <hi>Bullinger</hi> hath thus: <hi>Christianorum enim est,</hi>

                  <hi>imitari exemplum dei patris, &amp; Iesu Christi filij sui. Ille autem sinit solem suum, oriri super bonos &amp; malos, &amp; pluit super iustos &amp; iniustos.

For the one suffereth his sun to shine forth vpon the good and the euill, and sendeth his raine vpon the iust and vniust: and Christ also praied for his persecutors. The Gentiles in their rites, curse such as professe Christ: but Christians must pray for All men vniuersally, euen for their enemies and sinners. And <hi>Erasmus</hi> thus interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:<note place="margin">Erasmus. in <hi>1.</hi> Tim. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> Last of all let thanks be rendred vnto him, &amp;c. And let these be done, not only for the Christians, but for all manner of men also: lest Christian loue should appeare to bee but a streit-laced loue: as though it fauoured none, but of his own sort: but let it be extended abroad in most large manner, after the example of God, both to the good and to the bad: like as he being perfectlie

good and beneficiall to al, as much as in him is, bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his sun to shine, vnto the iust and also to the vniust. And in as much as God giueth publike quietnes, by means of Ethnick rulers: it is reason that thanks be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred also for them. And it is vncertaine to vs, whether that ruler being a wicked image worshipper, shall in short space receiue the gospell: for that cause, Christian loue wisheth the saluation of all. The Iew loueth the Iew, the brother loueth the brother, &amp;c. This is not a gospell-like loue; but that is a gospell-like loue, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the godly for Christ: and loueth the wicked that they may once repent and turne vnto Christ. And prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is to be made, not only for the whole generall sort of men, but also especially for kings, &amp;c. Againe, Christ is the Sauiour of all, he excludeth none from saluation, he bringeth the light of the gospell vnto all, &amp;c. Also, If the common father of al, sent him to saue all: and if he gaue himselfe, for the redemption of all: it is meet for vs to endeuour by all means, that his death may indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently be auaileable vnto all.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Beza. in. <hi>1.</hi> Tim. <hi>2.</hi> Psal. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note>And <hi>Beza</hi> giueth this note vpon that verse, saying, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other argument, why churches or congregations ought to pray for all men, without any difference of nation, kind, age, or order; to wit, because the Lord by calling of all sorts, yea sometimes those that are greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the gospell, will haue his church gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after this sort: and therefore praiers to bee made for All.</p>
               <p>To this point commeth that, that we haue hitherto set down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in both these chapters. First the proposition is made plaine and proued: that praiers, supplications, intercessions, and giuing of thanks, is to be made for all mankind.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the reason of the Apostle is expounded to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2747:21"/>
maintaine the proposition, in such ample sort as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: and that God will haue al men to be saued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, the reasons of the learned gathered herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are added also: As, that such praier is to be made for all: that there may be made a change of them: that of persecutors, they may be made cherishers: seeing hee hath made vs to his image, we should exercise our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity one towards another: we must haue compassion on the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of infidels: we must follow the example of God that giueth his sun and his rain to the vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and we must follow the example of Christ his son, that praied for his persecutors: wee must hope well, because they are created to Gods image. We were in the way of damnation, God may do as much for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he did for vs: we may not despaire of them: the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all is well pleasing to God: we are in this world to set forward the good will of God: our loue must not be a straitlaced loue, but a gospell-like loue, to loue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the wicked. If God gaue his son for all: If Christ offered himselfe for a redemption for all, we must inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour by all meanes, that his death may be auilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all. And therefore I conclude, that such a praier is neither superstitious nor superfluous, nor more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable then God requireth; but most holy, accepted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and agreeable to the mind, purpose, and will of God.

               <p>I find concerning praier for others, two grounds or foundations from whence they flow, and wherunto they haue respect and relation, that is:</p>

               <p>When the great shepheard of the sheepe, the Lord Iesus walked on earth, and chose vnto himselfe his twelue disciples: these he taught, these he instructed, he shewed vnto them his works, his secrets, his glory. They heard the voice of God aucthorising his Christ. If they were weake, he strengthened them. If they were world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he reproued them. If they were ignorant he opened their wits: he reproued their enemies, excused his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, shewed them the readinesse of the tempter, armed them against temptations, teacheth them to watch and to pray, confirmeth them with his spirit and grace: So of all sides prepareth them to the seruice and worke, wherevnto it was his good pleasure to send them (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written) You haue not chosen me,<note place="margin">Io. 15.16.</note> but I haue chosen you, and ordained you, that ye goe and bring foorth fruit, and that your fruit remaine, &amp;c.

And as the Lord instructed &amp; taught them, so also this bondslaue of Satan, euen <hi>Iudas,</hi> the Lord ceased not to speake vnto, to reproue, and to checke: As to say vnto them, That one of them is a diuell, That one of them should betray him,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.21.</note> That he dippeth his hand with him in the dish: to say, Friend wherefore art thou come, <hi>Iudas</hi> betraiest thou the sonne of man with a kisse?

All which reproouing spoken from him, as hauing authoritie: and not as the Scribes and Pharisies, had beene sufficient to haue pierced the flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and adamant heart, had not Satan so throughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched and possessed him, to that his vile and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous purpose.</p>
               <p>When Iesus knew (therefore) that his houre was come, that he should depart out of the world, vnto the Father.

which thou hast giuen me, for they are thine.</p>
               <p>Consider in this most heauenly and diuine praier, these points and circumstances.</p>
               <list>

                  </item>

               </list>
               <p>He that praieth, is that true shepheard, that laboured painfully, that wrought righteousnesse, that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, that came to be the light of the Gentiles, and the glorie of his people Israel, That giueth vp, as it were in this praier, his account to his Father, that careth for mankind, that prepareth his Disciples to send into all the world, that hath gotten redemption for his people, that worketh the ouerthrow of the kingdome of sinne, and Sathan; euen Christ Iesus, God and man, entring into the secrets of the Godhead: euen he as now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of the worlde, vnto the Father, concerning his office, which he receiued of the Father, thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as man, maketh intercession and praier vnto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because in the world are dayly outragious blasphemies: and that it runneth on headlong into all kind of wickednesse; Death, hell, and damnation it selfe, triumpheth ouer it (for the onelie beleeuers for whom Christ praid doe ouercome:) And for the world he praied not, and therefore it abounded in euill. For which cause this wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld, by the iust iudgement of God, is turned ouer into a reprobate minde, left to his owne lusts and desires: and therefore, as it liueth in horrible sinnes and abhominations, so vnto most horrible, iust, and seuere iudgement, is it turned ouer, throwne down and condemned: for which cause the sonne of God said: <hi>I pray not for the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He praieth then for them which the father had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him. For the wicked world he was not carefull. He was carefull for his owne flocke. These had forsaken
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2747:23"/>
all, and followed him, to these hee had declared the name of the Lord, these had continued with him in his temptations, these he kept, to send into the world, That the world might beleeue by them.<note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> And as thou didst send me into the world, so haue I sent them into the world. Such are they whom thou hast giuen to me. And for these <hi>I pray,</hi> and lift vp mine eies vnto heauen.</p>
               <p>The Reason followeth: For they are thine. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them not onely his Disciples, because hee trained and taught them to his diuine and heauenly purpose: but further entring into the secrets of God, beholdeth the wonderfull iudgements of God, discerneth and pronounceth of them, That those that bee his, are in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed Gods also. We sillie men pray, according to the bare sense, and feeling, of faith and loue: But Christ the sonne of God, God and man, entreth into the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the highest, discerneth betweene Election and Reprobation, sheweth that these his disciples, whome hee hath taken out of the worlde, That they are Gods owne: setteth forth also him, that is none of Gods owne, but a Reprobate, a lost child, as hee saith, Those that thou gauest mee haue I kept,<note place="margin">Iohn 17.12.</note> and none of them is lost, but the child of perdition, That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Herein then, we behold the most wonderfull worke and ministerie of the high Shepherd. He is of God, and came from God he teacheth, he reproueth. In the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of his diuine knowledge he deuideth his sheep, commendeth the elect to God, entreateth his Father, to preserue them in the world: shutteth out, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the Reprobate, the childe of perdition, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied him. A worke, I hope, that will make all sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and people to stand in awe and feare, and not to sute themselues in this worke, with Christ Iesus. And

                  <hi>alia suit quedam specialis ratio, quae in exemplum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi non dedet: Neque enim ex nudo tantum fidei &amp; charitatis sensu, Christus orat, sed adita coelorum ingressus, antè oculos habet arcana patris iudicia, quaenos latet, quamdiu per fiden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ambulamus.</hi> That is, Of the praier which is here spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, there was another speciall reason, which ought not to bee drawne for an example. For Christ praieth not, vpon the bare feeling of faith and loue onely: but entering into the pallaces of heauen, hath the verie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret iudgements of his Father before his eies: which things lie hid vnto vs, so long as wee haue our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and walke by faith.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, let our praiers proceed, according to the commaundement of the Lord, in ordinarie vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and calling: for, to teach so perfectly and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne so deepely, into Gods secretes, or to yeeld vp so exact an account, belongeth not vnto vs: but that wee must let that alone for euer. And thus much for the first part of doctrine: now to the next, which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now followeth the second point. Namely of praier hauing his foundation in calling. Many a one, when they talke of Calling, do thinke that they speake of some vnperfect, easie, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dinarie thing, without strangenes, without deepe conceit, a thing of course, &amp; that may be drawne too and fro, off or on, present or absent, of some effect, or none effect, at their owne pleasure; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as thinking themselues able to handle greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they will enter into Predestination, whether he be a reprobate, whether such a one be elect, I am sure I am chosen and elect I looke into such a man and I see that he bringeth forth the fruits of reprobation. Thus man where he should not iudge, is very quicke sighted; and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2747:24"/>
where he is taught to discerne and iudge indeed, there he will not vnderstand, but is stark blind. For surely Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a most excellent ordinary meane, for man and for the church of God, to know and discerne the things of God which are prepared for them that loue him: on the contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie side, his iudgements and punishments, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that are despisers and contemners of his truth and Gospell. And therefore in vocation, to what thing soeuer he would turne himselfe, whether it be to behold the goodnes or mercie of God towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, either to discerne things concerning himselfe or his brother, he shal find it most plentifully taught in the scriptures, yea most admirablie set forth: if he wil in the spirit of meeknesse and wisdome, imploy himselfe and seeke for the same.</p>
               <p>Such kind persons of such peremptorie persuasions, are like vnto those that say: If I be predestinate to bee saued, I shal be saued, and thinke it sufficient thus to say. They neuer draw neere vnto Christ, they examine not whether they be chosen in him, whether they be vnder his guard and protection: they consider not that they should be holy and without blame before him in loue,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.4.</note> That they are predestinat to be adopted, through Iesus Christ, That they should be to the praise of his glorie. These things they consider not, so in most daungerous sort they intangle themselues, being in a maze, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get out: So likewise these men in predestination, in election, in reprobation, they censure others, thinking most weakly of the state of Vocation (being indeed the only place, where we should behold our selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) &amp; forgetting, That since God hath giuen vs his Christ, how shall not he with him giue vs all thinges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>God euen the most mightie God, for the gathering of the saints together, hath spoken, and inuited the world, from the rising vp of the sunne, vnto the going downe of the same. He being the fountaine and fulnes of all good things, hath prepared marriage for his son, and inuited guests thereunto: whereby is vnderstood, That he tendreth vnto mankind, the holy fellowship of his son Christ Iesus, That he wil in him gather together his people, his saints, his church: and lastly bestow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the most comfortable and heauenly ioies eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in his glorious kingdome.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> For Christ is the end of the law, for righteousnes, to all that beleeue.

And therfore vnto his church he hath giuen by the hand of his only begotten son, a spirituall and heauenly banket, where our Sauiour Christ is vnto vs that bread of life, wherewithal our soules should be fed, to the true and blessed immortallitie, and to haue the end euerlasting life. And therfore at this holy supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so called, of the first institution thereof, the Lord Christ promiseth and sealeth vnto the faithful, That his bodie was broken and offered on the crosse, and his bloud so surely and truly shead, as with my eies I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the bread of the Lord to bee broken, and the cup to be destributed: and therefore so surely is the child of God fed to life euerlasting, by his bodie crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his precious blood shead: as my bodie, is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie fed by the hand of the minister, by the bread and cup which are giuen vnto me, as sure pledges of the same.</p>

               <p>But herein I may say, woe to the world, because of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, yea the offences (I say) against this holy institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord; who are desirous hereof to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers? who applieth and vseth it? as the remembrance of the death of Christ Iesus for his sinnes? who doth oft resort thereunto, to confirme the band of loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst brethren?

               <p>Now (therefore) say: After these examples thus shewed and practised by the Fathers, how should the Church of England, haue set downe her publique prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Truely, to answere vnto God; learnedly, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto others; faithfully, for the edifying of simple ones: How (I say) should they religiously, haue set them downe, for those purposes; if they had not follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the example of Christ, of the Apostles, and of the Fathers, walking in their steppes? And (therefore) I do verily thinke, that the holy and reuerend Fathers, so set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them downe, (as in our common praier booke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth) sawe farre more into the state of the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, and so successiuely in the church of God, then many a one, that reprehendeth or findeth fault in these dayes.</p>
               <p>We end the ministration of the Sacrament of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper of our Lord, and the Sacrament of holy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, with the Lords praier.

                  <p>Let vs suppose that <hi>Esau, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> were aliue: and so first let vs speake of them: Secondly of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates. Of <hi>Esau</hi> first, For yer the children were borne, and when they had done neither good nor euill, &amp;c. It was said vnto her:<note place="margin">Rom. 9.11.12</note> The elder shall serue the yonger. Now after this voice of the Lord concerning the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Let vs see whether the Church cast him off also, as reiected of the Lord, and vnworthie of his house, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of their praier, vnworthie of their companie. First,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.27,</note> it is said, And the boies grew: Then it is said, And <hi>Isaac</hi> loued <hi>Esau</hi>;<note place="margin">28.</note> Then it is said, Make me sauory meat, that my soule may blesse thee or I die.

                  <p>But after manie his wicked fruites: Let vs yet see againe the iudgement of the Church, and how <hi>Iacob</hi> and his people intertained him. <hi>Iacob</hi> saith to his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2747:48"/>
Thus shall you speake to my Lord <hi>Esau,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Gen. 32.4.</note> Thy seruant <hi>Iacob</hi> saith thus. And in his praier,<note place="margin">Verse. 11.</note> Deliuer me from the hand of my brother <hi>Esau.</hi> And againe, For I haue seene thy face as though I haue seene the face of God, &amp;c. And oft he calleth him, My Lord.<note place="margin">Gen. 33, 10.</note> Now then we see, he was not reiected of his parents: the children had one calling outward alike. <hi>Iacob</hi> knowing the fruits of his life, disdaineth him not, calleth him not Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, reiecteth him not: Hee tearmeth him Lord, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Face of God: intertaineth him, as one would intertaine a brother, in the Lord, sheweth the kindnesse of Christian to Christian: Yea, and I doubt not, praied oft, that God would turne his heart; For why should not hee shew that kinknesse towardes his brother, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom he gaue such gracious wordes? And why should not he in charitie, doe that towards his brother, which <hi>Abraham</hi> his grandfather had done towards the Edomites, and was accepted of God. To conclude, In all his discourse concerning <hi>Esau,</hi> I see no cause (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he were a Reprobate) why the Church should deale otherwise in these dayes, then these Fathers did: or should reiect him for a Reprobate, till the Lord had reuealed him, and reiected him (as wee shall see of <hi>Saul.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Seconly, concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> as if he were aliue. Was he not intertained by <hi>Samuel</hi> after this sort:<note place="margin">1.

Did not <hi>Saul</hi> prophesie with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and was he not changed into an other man? Said

And were they not the children of Beliall that despised him? Adde herevnto all the kindnesses of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</hi> It were too long to set downe all, &amp;c. Now looke here: what prince of Israel could be better receiued, and that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>as done, was done according to the mind of God: and that which was perfourmed towardes him, was of the Prophet of God, was of the people of God: and that not in policie; but in Religion. He was anointed, kissed, feasted, he prophesied, was with the Prophets, was at the seruice of burnt offerings, and peace offerings: the people showted, they praied for him, the good ones followed him, the sonnes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial despised him, hee is cherished and reuerenced, for the Lords anointed: And what more would they haue done to <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe?</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Saule</hi> is receiued and intertained as is before, as the instrument of God, the man that shall reigne ouer my people,<note place="margin">1.

And the spirit of God came vpon <hi>Saule</hi>; When he heard these tidings,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 11.6.</note> he heweth the oxen in peeces, numbreth his people, came vpon the enemies in the morning watch, slue the Amonites til the heat of the day. The enemies are scattered, the people greatly reioice, and are knit to their king: <hi>Samuell</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

goe vp to Gilgall, made <hi>Saule</hi> king there before the Lord, offered peace offerings before the Lord, and there <hi>Saule</hi> and all the men of Israell reioiced excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie.</p>
                  <p>And thus far we see the acceptation of <hi>Saule,</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation from the mouth of God, the prophet of God approuing him, God hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, wee find <hi>Samuel</hi> and the king and the people seruing the Lord together, and offering peace offerings before the Lord: and all Israel and they reioicing and triumphing exceedingly:<note place="margin">1.

                     <hi>Samuel</hi> also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his integritie, and innocencie, speaketh before the Lord and his annointed.

                  <p>But now of his fall and reiection. <hi>Saule</hi> had great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the goodnes of the Lord: who chose him, when he was little in his owne eies, and adorned him

And for that <hi>Saul</hi> had destroied a garison of the Philistims, Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell was an abhomination vnto them, the Philistims come vp against them as the sand of the sea: Israel is in distresse, and hide themselues in rockes and holes: &amp;c.

                     <hi>Saul</hi> cast his eie too much on the defection and inconstancie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; God the strength of Israell, was not in all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: the enemie and his cruelty more thought vpon then Gods deliuerance. For he should haue consulted with <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> should haue taught him the Lords will, they both should haue sacrificed and serued the Lord together: and so at the prophets mouth to

haue learned what he should doe, as chap. 10. Verse 8. But his heart being full of infidelitie, hee made a way to his owne reiection:<note place="margin">Verse 13.</note> otherwise (as the prophet saith) For at this time would the Lord haue established thy kingdome vpon Israell for euer, but now thy kingdome shall not continue. And this is the first defection of <hi>Saule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Samuel</hi> said vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> Now therefore hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thou vnto the voice of the words of the Lord,<note place="margin">1.

He bad thee go and destroy the sinners, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malechites,<note place="margin">20</note> thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, but hast turned to the pray, &amp;c. <hi>Saul</hi> euen against God and his owne conscience, answereth, That he hath hearkened to the voice of the Lord, and hath gone the way which the Lord sent him vnto, &amp;c. He is further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the Prophet: To obey, is better then sacrifice; and to hearken, is better then the fat of rammes: Because thou hast cast away the word of the Lord, therefore hee hath cast away thee also from being king. Lastly,<note place="margin">24.</note> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, saying: I haue sinned, for I haue gone further then the saying of the Lord, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeied their voice. Then he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: Thou hast cast away the word of the Lord,<note place="margin">26.</note> and the Lord hath cast away thee, that thou shalt not bee king ouer Israel, and the Lord hath rent the kingdome from thee this day and hath giuen it to a neighbour of thine, &amp;c.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ist.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for comfort, Though there enter into the Church rauening wolues, seeking to deuour the flocke, yea Apostataes and enemies to the crosse of Christ: yea and sometime spring from amongst themselues, That they should be comforted herein: and in pacience pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse their soules, To thinke, it is no new thing, but as also was verified in the Church, and in the time of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, walking on earth, and hauing conuersation among vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the fall of <hi>Iudas,</hi> the blasphemies of <hi>Cerinthus, Arius,</hi> and such like, should be examples vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that we fall not into the like condemnation, that we more firmelie and constantlie regard the truth: And that we heartilie pray, we may be Authours of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of faith, and of good workes, and not of quiddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, cauels, and errours, to intangle the people of God, and the inheritance of Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>So then the Resolution is this, Such as hath beene the behauiour of these Churches towards them in their time: such ought ours to be towards them, if they were aliue amongst vs: and to receiue them as long as God biddeth receiue: and to reiect them, when God reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them: and not to goe before the reuelation of the

And therfore (surely) when wickednes had possessed the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the common weale; when the scourge of God, as pestilence, sword, dearth, hath not reclaimed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thirdly when a nation hath Gods word, &amp; law, and bringeth not foorth the fruits thereof: it is a signe, of reprobation, they are neere vnto reprouing, to be cast

out of Gods fauour, to haue the word, and the mercie, &amp; the fauor, and the prouidence, and the protection of God taken from them, and bestowed on a nation that will bring forth the fruits thereof. When <hi>Scipio</hi> beheld the citie of Carthage, burne sixteene daies together, he wept sorrowfully,<note place="margin">Chronic.

So surely the general contempt of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Christ, the vniuersall reiecting of the louing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Lord, the manifest corruptions in all kinds of sinne and wickednes, doth portend, that it is to be feared, our destruction and confusion is not far off: but that one day we shall tast as Israell hath tasted: wee so resemble hir, we are so like her in all kind of sins, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and infidelitie. The Lord grant vs in time to be a wise and vnderstanding people, to know the waies of the Lord, to discerne the day of our visitation, and to bring forth the fruits of righteousnes: that we may flie from the wrath that is to come, in contrite, humble, and repentant minds, pleasing the Lord; that he may turne away that heauie wrath and iudgement that our sinnes daily grone and crie for, in the sight of God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father. But now to the matter.</p>
                  <p>As in this place of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> so also in the 11. and 14. Chapters before, that the Lord forbiddeth the Prophet to pray for them, The Lord setteth downe their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which was a generall defection and falling away from the Lord, as I haue said, the verie fruit of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batisme. And we see, The Lord saith not here, peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily, or indefinitely, Pray not for Reprobates, nor he vseth not this phrase, Pray not for those, that be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates among them. But first he maketh the Prophet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue: secondly, he sheweth forth and setteth before
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2747:55"/>
the Prophets eies, the abhominations and sinnes of the people. For though the Prophet knew much of their wickednesse of himselfe: yet when the Lord caused him to behold, and set it before his eies, he knew farre more. Thirdly, he saith, Thou shalt not pray for them. As if the Lord should say, Thou seest more now, then thou didst before, behold what a people thou hast praied for. My fauour is ceased, my loue is ceased, let thy loue also cease. Thou shalt not take thee anie wife,<note place="margin">Iere. 16.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That they may know by the mouth of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> the indignation and wrath of the Lord: and that they were neare to confusion and destruction.

For he saith, Hinder me not, or stoppe me not, That is, put not forth thy praier as a barre, and stay vnto my wrath: which wee reade <hi>Moses</hi> to haue done. But least God might seeme, little or nothing to esteeme the praier of holie men; for what cause hee heareth not the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Iewes, hee addeth a reason, saying: But the hard and impenitent heart of the vnbeleeuing Iewes.</p>
                  <p>These expositions teach vs, that the Prophet was not condemned for praying for them, but their abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in sinning, stirred vp the Lord in wrath, That he would neither the praier of the prophet, neither any other thing by his meanes, should stand in the gap: but that the Lord would poure out his wrath vppon the young, and the olde, the Prophet with the Priest, the Prince with the people, the parents with the children. For we see after the first warning, the Prophet prayed stil, and is reproued the second time, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 11.14. And he preached and praied still, and is reproued the third time, as Cap. 14.11. and thus much for the place of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:</hi> But now to the Argument. We will not reason herein by what Logicke this Argument standeth, (for that I reserue to my second booke, wherein I must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to a great manie things) but will suppose it to bee good for this time, and let him tell on his tale.</p>
                  <p>The Argument conteineth a <hi>Maior,</hi> and a <hi>Minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. The <hi>Maior</hi> is this. Whosoeuer God hath cast out of his sight, that is, out of his fauour, and will not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2747:56"/>
be intreated for them: for such we must not pray. This proposition (saith the obiection) must haue his strength from this place of <hi>Ieremie</hi> the 7. but let vs see how.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First then, let vs see and consider what it is, to bee cast out of Gods sight and fauour, that the consequent may follow, that, Not to pray for such, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, whether these were cast out of Gods sight, or no. That this <hi>Maior</hi> proposition, may haue his strong foundation.</p>
                  <p>First then, To be cast out of Gods sight, is said to bee sundrie waies. One way, it is said to be then, when as Gods seruant and child, for a season, is as it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God, and turned ouer to the enemie, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors, yea to himselfe, and feeleth troubles, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and afflictions, sorroweth inwardly, goeth mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the day long, powreth out the dolorous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Sion, The Lord hath forsaken mee, my God hath forgotten me: And yet after these trials and stormes, is visited, refreshed, &amp; comforted by the Lord; and for euer is not forsaken and cast off by the Lord; but for a season, and receiued againe. So the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> And when I made haste, I said,<note place="margin">Psal. 31.24.</note> I am cast out of the sight of thine eies: neuerthelesse, thou heardest the voice of my praier, &amp;c. Likewise <hi>Ionas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iona. 2.4.</note> in the great sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the fishes bellie. Then I said, I am cast away out of thy sight: yet will I looke againe towards thy holie Temple, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> yet hast thou brought vp my life from the pit, O Lord my God. And the Lord said vnto Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>.</note> and not cast thee away, &amp;c. This teacheth then, that there is a wholsome reiecting and casting off, and as it were, a discipline in our God, whereby we are more stirred vp, and whetted to hold fast by God, and to acknowledge his mercies: And this casting off, is not in wrath, but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2747:57"/>
in loue, not of a Reprobate, or bastard, but of a sonne, and beloued child: not for euer, but for a time, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to destruction, but for reformation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a casting out in the wrath of God, open and reuealed to the face of the world, for sinne, and for contempt of the word, and will of the Lord (as is to be feared, shal come vpon vs for our disobedience, and sinnes mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iplied to the heauens) which the Lord threatneth in the Law:<note place="margin">1. Reg. 9.7. 2. Chr. 7.20.</note> as, But if ye and your children turne away from me, Then wil I cut off Israell from the land which I haue giuen them; and the house which I haue hallowed for my name, will cast out of my sight, and Israell shall be a prouerbe, and a common talke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all people,<note place="margin">1. Chr. 28.9.</note> &amp;c. And <hi>Dauid</hi> said vnto <hi>Salomon,</hi> If thou seeke him, he will be found of thee, but if thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him, he will cast thee off for euer. And as God threatneth to the disobedient:<note place="margin">Ier. 7.15.</note> And I will cast you out of my sight, as I haue cast out all your brethren, euen the whole seed of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Thus he speaketh when he threatneth iudgement and captiuitie vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is a casting out of the vnrighteous, froward and reprobate: which are vessels of wrath, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to destruction,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.22.</note> that God mighte shew his wrath, and make his power known: and it is of two sorts: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this life and reueiled, as the casting out of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao,</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> the reueiling of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and such like (as hath beene said before.) Or els it is secret, or not reuealed, &amp; hid in himselfe. For he hath put it in his owne power: and as hee knoweth, who are his owne: So knoweth hee also, who are not his owne: and according to his good pleasure, either reuealeth them, or not reuealeth them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the casting out of Gods sight, being thus distinguished, let vs see, whether these were cast out or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2747:57"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o. Let vs looke on the proposition, and it is thus: Who soeuer God hath cast out of his sight: that is, out of his fauour. If he meane the first way, that cannot be, for that is proper to the holie and righteous. Thy louing correction (saith the prophet) shall make me great:<note place="margin">Psal. 31.8.</note> shall not confound me, but shall make me great.<note place="margin">Psal. 18.35.</note> Thou hast knowne my soule in aduersity: Not forsaken me, or cast me of, but known me: after two daies wil he quicken, &amp; receiue vs, and in the third day, he will raise vs vp, and we shall liue in his sight: yea the Lord is on my side,<note place="margin">Ose. 6.2.</note> the Lord taketh my part,<note place="margin">Psal. 118.6.7 14.</note> the Lord is my strength and my song, and is become my saluation. So that in this casting off, the child of God is excercised. God doubleth his fauour vpon him and forsaketh him not, but for his good; and returneth vnto him, and is his present helpe, in the time of trouble, is his strength, castle and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. And this serueth not the turne. And (therefore) wee must seeke further, that this proposition may bee releeued.</p>
                  <p>The second sence, is a iudgement, a plague, and more bitter, and vniuersall, or generall: and it concerneth prince, people, religion, as before: <hi>Salomon,</hi> Israell, the temple; but this iudgement, is temporall, and in this life.<note place="margin">2.

And when they mocked at the messengers of God and despised his words, and misused his prophets, vntill the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, &amp;c. He brought vpon them, the king of the Caldeans,<note place="margin">Verse 17.</note> who slue their young men with the sword, in the house of the sanctuarie, spared neither yong man, nor Virgin, ancient nor aged, God gaue al into his hand, the vessels the treasures of Gods house, the treasures of the king.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2747:58"/>
Then he burnt the house of God,<note place="margin">20.</note> brake downe the wal of Hierusalem, burnt all the pallaces, and all the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vessels, carried the people away, that were left to Babell, and they were seruants to him and to his sons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Here is a lamentable ruin, and a casting out of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of the sight of God. The king, the people, the temple, religion, their priests, their Virgins, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, their wealth, their seat, their cittie, their old men, their young men: briefely al; in regard of policy, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, peaceable; now by God, shaken, disquieted, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, captiuate, and plunged into great miserie, desolation and obscuritie. So vseth God to set vp in his fauor: and in the kindling of his wrath, thus doth hee deface and pull downe.<note place="margin">Deut. 28.58.</note> Thus if thou wilt not keepe, and doe all the words of this law, &amp;c. And feare this glorious and fearefull name, <hi>The Lord, thy God:</hi> then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderfull, and the plagues of thy seed, euen great plagues, and of long continuance, &amp;c. So great are the plagues of the sinner:<note place="margin">Psal. 32.11.</note> but mercie shall embrace him on all sides, that putteth his trust in the Lord his God.</p>
                  <p>Now our proposition is, Whosoeuer God hath cast out of his sight, that is, out of his fauour, &amp;c. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath God dealt with Israel: (as wee heare in the processe before) but we are to marke two things. The one, whether they were reprobats, or no. The other, whether thy were cast off, finally and for euer, or no. Now if they be reprobates, and that they be cast out, as God vseth to cast out reprobates, then the proceedings in them is, as in <hi>Saul,</hi> to be reiected of God, another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in his place: (for God had chosen <hi>Dauid</hi> a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he) then to be spoiled of all heauenly orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as of the spirit of God, wisdome, the comfort &amp;

countenance of the Prophet, &amp;c. Turned euen to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to abound in most abhominable sins, as, hipocrisie, persecution, bloodshead, destroieng of the church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tment, apostasie, desperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; so running on, til they had made an end of him. So <hi>Iudas</hi> in reprouing and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueting, vntill the deuill entred into him, vntill he tooke the reward of iniquitie, vntill he despaired and hanged himselfe. Such go with a swift enforcer, for they are cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to his will.</p>
                  <p>But in these for whom <hi>Ieremie</hi> praied, it is not so: For in them was repentance, to come vnto the Lord, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. where they say,<note place="margin">Ier. 14.7.</note> O Lord though our iniquities testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie against vs, deale with vs according to thy name.

Yet thou O Lord art in the middest of vs, and thy name is called vpon of vs, forsake vs not.<note place="margin">15.

That is, follow not thou their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, but let them be conformed to thy godly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus they crie vnto the Lord, the Prophet teacheth them a praier, as in the same chapter, Verse. 14.<note place="margin">Verse. 14.</note> And the Lord would haue them conformed to the holines of <hi>Ieremie.</hi> And these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:2747:60"/>Now the third sence is (as I haue said) the casting out of the vnrighteous, froward, and reprobate, being ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of wrath, prepared to destruction.

                  <p>The Maior proposition then, must and ought to bee thus: Whomsoeuer God hath finally, reprobated, and cast out of his sight: and so declared and reuealed them vnto his church: for such we ought not to pray.

                  <p>They that were carried captiues into Babilon, had still mind of returning.

And it followeth:<note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> and seeke the prosperitie of the citie, whether I haue caused you to be carried away captiues, and pray vnto the Lord for it, for in the peace thereof, shall you haue peace.

                     </gap>ment, lastly, a reason.</p>
                  <p>The first precept or commandement, is, Seeke the prosperitie of the citie. God doth (no doubt) scatter his people amongst other nations, that his name might be knowne vnto them, that hee might exercise his people with patience: and that the good conuersation and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of his people, might be an example and a light vnto others, to forsake Idolatrie, and to know the God of Israel. To which end, in my opinion,<note place="margin">Ger. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </am>

                        </gap>ntia posside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> The people were entred into a strange land, they would faine bee returning home as soone as they came thither. The Prophet biddeth them settle their hearts, giue themselues to their seueral vocations, and to seeke the prosperitie of the cittie, where they now were, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2747:61"/>
(saith this writer) that God would haue kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them inuiolablie and sincerely, the right of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement, or abode among that people: and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one (though he were amongst the prowd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent,) should possesse his soule in patience: teaching from the wisdome of God, That innocent life and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in such great oppressions vnder so mightie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, were worthie vertues to redeeme peace, and get fauour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the circumstance of the place is, as the late translation of the bible saith <hi>(Istius ciuitatis) id est to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius regni Babilonici,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tremelius.</note> 
                     <hi>Sinecdochicè.</hi> That is, seeke the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie of the cittie, that is as much to say, of the whole kingdome of Babilon, &amp;c. The part for the whole, so that what the Lord commandeth them here, must to their possible power, reach, and stretch to the whole kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the second precept or commandement is this: Pray vnto the Lord for it, Or, <hi>Orate prò ea Iehouam,</hi> Intreat the Lord for it. The Lord saith not here, Pray for their welfare onely, pray for their peace onely, or for their prosperous estate: but indefinitly, Pray to the Lord for it, for the citie, for the countrey. These two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements thus differ: The first concerneth their manners, and behauiour, in captiuitie: The other, their religion. Therefore as they differ in work, the one ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately respecting man, the other imediately respecting God: So in the verbe commanding, they differ also, as Seeke &amp; Pray; for praying vnto God, no doubt, may be seeking: but all seeking, is not praying. And therefore as in commanding, in matter, in manner, in effect and end, they differ: so by no means they must be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For in the first commandement, it is said, Seeke prosperitie. But in the second, it is not said, Pray for pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2747:61"/>
welfare, or so forth, but, Pray for it. And therfore (surely) this seemeth not a praier, for outward things, or for temporall blessings only: as health and plentie, and peace, but a commandement also, that they should pray for their conuersation, for their amendment, for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the glorie of God amongst them, and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieng of their hearts towards God, to know him: and towards those poor captiues whom they so rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated. And there are three things that persuade it.</p>
                  <p>The first, I remember S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle of the Lord, to approue his ministerie, saith thus to the Corinthians:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> The signes of an Apostle were wrought amongst you, with all patience, with signes and wonders, and great works. So surely, in that captiuitie, The very signes and effects of sighing and groning vnto God, in holy praier for the conuersion of them to know God, were well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in wonderfull matters and great works. For first we see in that captiuitie, how the kings heart inclined, in chusing and calling,<note place="margin">Dan. 13.6.</note> certaine of the children of Israell vnto fauour, as <hi>Daniel, Hananiah, Misael, Azariah,</hi> &amp;c. Then <hi>Daniel</hi> in the exposition of the dream, hideth not the power of God, from <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> and his, as though they were castawaies and reprobates, but saith: For the God of heauen hath giuen thee a kingdome, power and strength and glorie.<note place="margin">2.37.</note> And after the expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those wonderfull things, concerning his dreame, the king himself answereth:<note place="margin">47.</note> I know of a truth that your God is a God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and the reuealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst open this secret. So <hi>Daniel</hi> was aduanced, and by his means also, <hi>Sedrac, Mesac,</hi> and <hi>Abednego.</hi> Now in this notable story,<note place="margin">Verse 13.</note> shall we thinke that the kings heart inclined, that some of the Iews were chosen to fauour, that <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes were sought for to be put to death, and by Gods
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2747:62"/>
good meanes preserued and saued with many moe of their owne wise men: that the dreame was interpreted, that the king confessed the name of God and his great power, that <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellows were aduanced, and so comfort wrought vnto all the captiues, without prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and intercession to God, of the church, of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of the beleeuers of <hi>Daniel</hi> himselfe, for the sauing of their owne liues, for the molifieng and turning of the kings heart, that he might know God, for wisedome from aboue, that releefe comfort and relaxation might come to his people? No doubt, they that know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the order of the church of God in their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, shal easily find, that they had spent not only daies but nights also, in sighing &amp; groning to the Lord their God to this effect,<note place="margin">Verse 18.</note> as the eighteenth verse in this chap. doth import. Also we read in the next storie concerning the three children,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.26.</note> They set forth the power &amp; strength of their God: the king at last confesseth, Blessed be the God of <hi>Sedrac, Mesac,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> who hath sent his angell, and deliuered his seruants, that put their trust in him, &amp;c. Then the king sendeth word into his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons abroad, of the signes and wonders that God hath wrought in his kingdome, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 4.24.</note>Againe in the fourth chapter, <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not say, Hee will talke with the king in those matters, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him: or in worldly affaires: but he giueth him spirituall counsell, and teacheth him religion, saying: Wherfore (O king) let my counsell be acceptable vnto thee, and breake off thy sinnes by righteousnes, and thine iniquities by mercie towards the poore: Lo let there be an healing of thine error. So in the time of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazer,</hi> and of <hi>Darius,</hi> still the glorie and power of God, that he may be knowne, is handled and not forgotten; and shall we thinke that these wise and godly men, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>

And I doubt not but their hearty praiers to God was, for this knowledge, amongst those nations: and therfore praied for them (no doubt) for reformation of the heart towards God: as for the temporall blessings towards the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the words are interpreted of ancient time thus, <hi>Quaerite pacem, &amp;c Vnde Apostolus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

This interpretation teacheth this much: That the rule giuen by <hi>Ieremie</hi> vnto Gods people then, was of such account and force, as the rule giuen by S. <hi>Paule,</hi>

you to mercie, and haue pitie on you.

The knowne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Gods church, must haue our praier, but it is for temporal blessings. If S. <hi>Paul</hi> were aliue, and should hear these diuines thus reason, he would thinke himselfe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beholding to them: For (saith he) was not I a known enemie, did I not persecute the church:<note place="margin">Acts. 8.3.22.4.</note> yea made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke of the church? and entred into euery house, and drew out both men and women, and put them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? did not I persecute this way vnto the death?<note place="margin">5.</note> had not I letters vnto <hi>Damascus,</hi> to take both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? did not I breath out both threatnings and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against the disciples of the Lord?<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> Was I not then a known enemie to the church? What was the report of the church of him.<note place="margin">Vers. 13.14.</note> Lord (saith <hi>Ananias</hi>) I haue heard by many, of this man, how much euill he hath done to thy saints at Ierusalem. Moreouer he hath here authority of the high priests, to bind all that call on thy name. Doe not these things shew that hee was a knowne enemie? and should he be only praied for in temporal blessings? Heare his own confession: When before I was a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer and a persecuter, and an oppressor,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.13.</note> but I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to mercie, for I did it ignorantly through vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe: But the grace of our Lord was exceeding aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, with faith and loue which is in Christ Iesus. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> a knowne enemie to the church of God, an vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer; yet a chosen vessel of God, counted faithful and

put in his seruice. God sheweth mercie, persecutors and infidels are receiued into fauour and we affoord praiers for them, only in temporall blessings. Much far better (saith a learned interpreter) <hi>Et huiusmodi preces fiant, pro omnibus hominibus,</hi>

                  <p>Neither do I thinke that the Babilonians were worse enemies to the church in Babilon, then the Iewes, the Scribes, and Pharisies, rulers and preists were vnto our sauiour Christ, the Apostles, &amp; martyrs: and yet Christ saith, Father forgiue them. S. <hi>Steuen,</hi> Lord lay not this sin to their charge. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Wee are euill spoken of,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4 13.</note> and we pray.

                     <note place="margin">Ier. 7.15.16.</note> where it was said: I will cast you out, &amp;c.

If they were for euer cast out as reprobates, how come they now to be a church? and if they be a church, as it must needs be granted; then that casting out, was some other kind of casting out, then to bee cast out as Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates. The word of the Lord is precious, and ought not to be wrested to the deuices and fantasies of men.</p>
