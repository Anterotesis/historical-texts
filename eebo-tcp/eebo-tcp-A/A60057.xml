            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>THat I have written this Pamphlet, is plain; and the Reaſon of it as plain, in Anſwer to one Printed with His Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham's</hi> Name, wherein I think he hath not rightly informed himſelf, or his Readers. I have no Apology to make for the Printing of it, but only that I think a Sore always wants a Plaiſter till it hath got one. Of how dangerous Conſequence to Religion, and the Peace of the State, ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments may prove, I hope his Grace did not give himſelf leave to conſider. And ſhould he take the pains to do it, it is not to be expected he ſhould draw both Bill and Anſwer, and act for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff and Defendant ſucceſſively one after another.</p>
            <p>How pernicious an Animal this Mountain and Wild Conſcience hath been to <hi>England,</hi> is too well known; and how fatal Toleration would be, I hope in a few words to make evident in the enſuing Papers. And the Nation being in a fair way of Compoſure, the ſtirring of this extravagant Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hath run us into ſo many Fevers of State, ſeems very unſeaſonable at this time, and requires ſomething to precipitate the Lees of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and keeping them from riſing again, and turning the Wine of our Hopes into the Vinegar of Deſpair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101791:3"/>
My Opinion in theſe points having ever been dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to thoſe of his Grace's Paper; and having been long convinced, that nothing could more effectually contribute to the Ruin of this Monarchy, Church and State, than Toleration and Liberty of Conſcience, I have prevailed upon my ſelf to expoſe my thoughts to the publick View and Cenſure upon this Subject and Occaſion, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoroughly perſwaded I am in the Right, as to the main, and not much ſolicitous for the fate of a five or ſix hours Paper, which the Ingenuous will pardon, if it be not exact; and the Rigorous would condemn, tho an Angel had writ it.</p>
            <p>That I do not affix my Name to it, is becauſe I do not deſign to be known. And tho I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to have writ it, or think it will do me any diſreputation, yet I am unwilling to ſeem arrogant in attempting to anſwer a Perſon of ſo Great a Character, and ſo Celebrated a Name; to whom I deſire to be known under no other Name than that of,</p>

            <head>A SHORT ANSWER To His GRACE the D. of <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CKINGHAM</hi>'s Paper, Concerning Religion, Toleration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a pretty odd Adventure, to ſee a Perſon of His Grace's High Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and Parts, enter the Liſts, and advance himſelf the Champion of ſome things ſo much out of Countenance and Reputation, that even thoſe who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly owned them, would take it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly not to be thought wholly to have forſaken and abandoned them. And in truth, <hi>Whiggiſm</hi> in both its dreſſes of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which made her ſo amiable to the <hi>Noble Peer,</hi> and others,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101791:4"/>
in the days of <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> is now with ſorrow become ſo abominably ſuperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, that ſhe looks like a Caſt Miſtriſs, ſcorned and contemned even by the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Footmen: and it can be nothing but pure compaſſion and pity, ſure, that procures her ſuch a Glorious Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</p>
            <p>But is it not as odd an Adventure, to ſee any perſon ſo bold, as to think upon ſuch great diſadvantages, of coping with ſo diſproportionate a Combatant, as a Peer of the higheſt Rate of <hi>England,</hi> whereby he muſt render himſelf liable not only to all the force of Wit and Senſe, but if he does not well guard himſelf with all Decency and Diſcretion, to the fatal and murdering blow of <hi>Scandalum Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum.</hi> And in truth, if I had not put on the Armour of Conſcience, I durſt never have taken up his Grace's Gantlet: But I eſteem my ſelf invulnerable under that Mail, and dare confidently believe my Lord would not for an unwary ſlip
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101791:4"/>
prove himſelf an <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting an innocent perſon, purely for what he believes his Religion exacts from him; eſpecially conſidering, that his Grace's <hi>Maxim</hi> is infallible, which aſſures us, <hi>That no man believes, becauſe he has a mind to do ſo, but becauſe his Judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced, he cannot chuſe but believe it, whether he will or not.</hi> Nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſhould I be criminal in point of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or Good Manners towards his Grace, that he would by animadverting ſeverely upon me, undo what he hath ſo publickly owned, as <hi>an Opinion of which he hath been long convinced;</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the labour of his brain by any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diametrically oppoſite to his <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi> But for fear of the worſt, neither my Nature or Education inclining me to any thing diſobliging, much leſs rude, I will take care of my ſelf: And tho I cannot, in approaching ſo near his Grace, be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul a Jove,</hi> yet I will be ſure to keep my ſelf <hi>procul a fulmine:</hi> And I ſhould be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101791:5"/>
very angry with my felf, if I ſhould ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, which even his Grace may think beneath the Dignity of his High Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, for which I profeſs a moſt profound Veneration and Reſpect.</p>
            <p>And my Lord being the Agreſſor, I know he will not be diſpleaſed, ſince we differ mightily in Opinion about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if I endeavour to defend my Belief, which I cannot help, very warmly, and with ſome <hi>Opinionatrê:</hi> And ſhould I chance to pretend to be Comical and Pleaſant now and then, (a Contagion no man can almoſt eſcape that comes but near his Grace's Pen, which even in this ſerious matter, is very facetious); I hope he will look upon it but as my being ſtung with the <hi>Tarantula</hi> of his Paper, which may make me dance and caper, even contrary to my Nature and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the ſecret ſympathy that is in the unaccountable poiſon of being Witty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101791:5"/>
I confeſs, my Lord writes with that taking air and pleaſantneſs, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible not to be delighted with it. But not to flatter his Grace, 'tis too much of that nimble Contexture, and ſeems to want not only the <hi>temperamentum ad pondus,</hi> but the <hi>pondus</hi> it ſelf; and to make it in any meaſure currant, muſt have many Grains not only of Salt, but of Allowance too. And in truth, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder to ſee a Peer write of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>en Cavalier;</hi> but do as much wonder to ſee a Noble <hi>Cavalier</hi> writing of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I ſhould to ſee a Blew-Apron-Knight correcting <hi>Euclids Elements,</hi> or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-Clown drawing up Maxims of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or Navigation. I cannot be induced to believe our Noble Author hath made Polemical Divinity, or the abſtruſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Schools any one Scene of his diverſion; and therefore his Reaſonings are witty and pleaſant, but not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding; his Notions are very fine, and many of them very natural and true, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101791:6"/>
not too Logical. His Grace ſeems only to have done it as an Eſſay for his own diverſion; and therefore hath not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conſequences which will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and inevitably follow from his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, to the great diſadvantage not only of Religion, which he would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but even the Politick Frame, and Conſtitution, and Government of the World. I was onee acquainted with an airy Gentleman, who would diſcourſe mighty agreeably, and loved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain divers odd Opinions: and if at any time he was run a-ground by Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces drawn from his Poſitions, he would cry, <hi>a Pox upon Conſequences; I hate theſe Conſequences:</hi> But I have more Honour for his Grace, than to believe him to be of that Gentleman's humor.</p>
            <p>I do not deſign to read an Anatomical Lecture upon his Grace's Paper, or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to defect each Nerve and Muſcle. I hate haſhing of Books, and ſerving them up with <hi>Limon</hi> and <hi>Anchovies,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101791:6"/>
ſhall content my ſelf without diſtorting his Senſe, or weighing every Period, and ſcanning every Line, to deliver my thoughts of it in the Lump; and ſhall for the ſake of method, offer theſe things, as being the main matters wherein I take the Liberty to differ from his Grace's Sentiments.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I preſume to ſay, That his Grace has taken a very improper Method in the whole, to confute the witty Atheiſt, or to eſtabliſh Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That his Maxime concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> and the Nature of Perſecution for differences in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is built upon an evident miſtake of the Nature, Reaſon, Intention, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of thoſe humane Laws, which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Diſſenters, and which they and his Grace call Perſecution.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, That the Toleration of ſeveral Opinions, which in his three Queries, he ſeems to preſs as neceſſary, both upon a Religious and Civil account,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101791:7"/>
is utterly inconſiſtent with both thoſe ends.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, in which the whole body of the Book conſiſts, that I may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer conciſely after my Lords method of writing; The Poſition upon which his Grace goes of proving a Deity, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man carving out the meaſure of his own Worſhip, is too ſhort in matter of Argument, and too long in point of Allowance. The changeableneſs of the World falls as much ſhort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving its Eternity, as the ſeveral mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his Grace's Body from his Infancy to this Age, does of proving, that he is not the ſame <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Bucks,</hi> that he was fourty years ago; nor if he takes notice of the whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of the Univerſe, of which this Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Body wherein we are, is but an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable point, he will find no ſuch great Alterations, but that a witty Atheiſt may ſay with St. <hi>Peters</hi> ſcoffers, <hi>All things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as they were;</hi> and it may as well have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101791:7"/>
been always ſo, and continue always ſo as we ſee it does, notwithſtanding that change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs. Now if I were to diſcourſe an Atheiſt about the Worlds Eternity, I would urge him with this Argument; If the World be Eternal, then it muſt of neceſſity be the Supreme and Ultimate Being and Cauſe of its own Exiſtence: for if we ſuppoſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Being before it, it is not Eternal. Now if it be the Supreme Being, it muſt not onely have all the Attributes, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall in with the Conception and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Idea of ſuch a Noble and Glorious Eſſence, but many more than we can imagine or conceive, and not onely ſo, but every part of it muſt have all theſe perfections in the higheſt meaſure, and even beyond the furtheſt flights of Reaſon, Fancy, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; ſuch as are Inviſibility, Impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Juſtice, Power, Mercy, and Goodneſs, and a thouſand others which, no Atheiſt can be ſo loſt to Senſe as to believe the World either in the whole, or in part, can be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of. Can the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Earth, or any of them reward or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh? Are they not all ſeparately and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101791:8"/>
Inſenſible and Inanimate? Nor will the little Story of the <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> come in at a dead life, to help the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer matter. And he who ſuppoſes ſuch a Being, ſeparate and diſtinct from the Heavy Matter, grants what he denies, and ſuppoſes a Superiour Being to the World which Acts, Regulates, and Governs it in all its Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and then the difficulty will return of the two Eternals, which ſhall have the upper hand? Whether they Act freely or neceſſarily? If neceſſarily, they muſt have ſtill ſome Superiour to impoſe that neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and then all is loſt; if voluntarily, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Powers, one may refuſe to Act and then what becomes of the other? They muſt both of neceſſity ceaſe to be; And a thouſand other inextricable difficulties and impoſſibilities will follow, too long to be here trifled upon.</p>
            <p>So that to me, the plain want of that abſolute perfection which muſt be in the Supreme Being, and which is plainly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is not in the World, is a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that it is not the Supreme Being; and if it muſt have a Superiour, it muſt

fall ſhort of that Superiour Being in the eſſential point of Perfection, Eternity. For the mind of Man can by no Art be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to believe the fooliſh imagination of an infinite Series of Cauſes, one hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging like Links in a Chain upon another; but muſt at laſt come to a point, That there muſt be one Ultimate, Supreme, and Abſolutely Perfect Cauſe of all Things; which ſince neither the World, nor the <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> are capable of, or really poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of thoſe perfections, it muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Superiour to them in all Things, and in this of Priority of Exiſtence, which the whole World, with an Univerſal conſent hath owned to be the Divinity.</p>
            <p>But his Grace having I hope to the great diſappointment of our witty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, found out a GOD by his way of Reaſoning; which I do not intend to diſturb, but to improve: I can by no means be induced to be of his Opinion in his Deductions, concerning the Adoration and Worſhip of this Bleſſed Being. For in truth if his Argumentation be allowed ſolid and concluding, here is as fair a Plea for the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101791:9"/>
               <hi>Alchoran</hi> as the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> for <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> his Golden Verſes, to be as good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles.</hi> For if I be not miſtaken in what his Grace calls <hi>that part of us which is nearest a kin to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God and the Inſtinct of a Diety, which is to be our Guide and Director in chooſing the best way for our Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God;</hi> which immediately after he tells us, <hi>highly concerns every man to examine ſeriouſly which is the best way of Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Serving of God; that is, which is the best Religion:</hi> This muſt be Humane Reaſon, and not Humane Reaſon as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by any Publick and Political Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Community, but according as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private perſons Reaſon ſhall dictate to him; and then his conſequence is, <hi>That it is one of the greatest Crimes a man can be guilty of, to force us to Act or Sin against that Inſtinct of Religion; and ſomething a kin to the Sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi> Now did I not believe that his Grace is out of his Minority, I ſhould ſuſpect the <hi>Penſilvanian</hi> had Tutor'd him with this Quakeriſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. But whether it be ſo or not, here
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101791:9"/>
are theſe inevitable Conſequences will follow from this Poſition: Firſt, that Reaſon is the ſole Guide of every mans Religion. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Divine Revelation is not neceſſary to Salvation. Thirdly, that it is a moſt horrid Sin to lead men out of the Errours to which Natural Religion and bare Reaſon muſt of neceſſity lead men, ſince its depravation. Fourthly, That men who believe a God, and follow the dictates of Reaſon in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, may be ſaved in any, in all Religions, provided they know not a better: For Reaſon will never, can never lead us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the belief of a Trinity, the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; Death, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, or Divinity of the Son of God, the Saviour of the World. And how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifick a Parent of Idolatry, Superſtition, Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, and a thouſand abſurdities in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion Humane Reaſon is, all times, all places, all ages of the World convince us in Fact, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the poſſibility of a Denial.</p>
            <p>Now had I been to follow his Graces blow, upon the gaining of the <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> of the Being of a Supreme and Perfect Power, and his Juſtice, Goodneſs, and Mercy, being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101791:10"/>
ſuch ſuperlative Attributes of his Eſſence, I ſhould have ſent my Enquirer another Road. And firſt upon his granting a God his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and the obligations of Humane Nature to him, I ſhould have told him, that he could not but grant by the ſtrength of his own Reaſon, that this excellent Supreme Being ought to be worſhipped and Adored, as the greateſt Benefactor to Mankind; that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was to be had at any Rate, as the moſt Supreme degree of Happineſs and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: From his Juſtice I ſhould have argued, that ſo great Goodneſs and Juſtice, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of Virtue and Puniſher of Vice, who loves thoſe that love him, and therefore ſerve him, could not poſſibly leave that Noble Creature Man, to whom he had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſomething ſo near a kin to his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without ſome manifeſtation of his will and pleaſure, and how he might be ſerved acceptably. I ſhould have ſent him to inquire if any ſuch thing were to be found, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the variety, recommended thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which have Antiquity, and the greateſt agreeableneſs to the Divine Nature, as the Genuine Reſults of the benignity of that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101791:10"/>
juſt and merciful God. I mean the Holy Writings of the Inſpired Pen-men, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, who give ſuch illuminations to the Soul, and ſuch advances to Reaſon, ſuch Rules of Piety and Devotion, as are no where elſe to be found, and which ſuit ſo exactly with the Idea of a Pure and Perfect Being. And in regard there may be ſome things difficult to be underſtood, I would for the ſence and meaning of thoſe places, have directed him to the Opinion of that Society of Men called Chriſtians, their univerſal ſence and practice, and to the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis, Quod ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que quod ſemper quod ab omnibus, id verè qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Catholicum eſt:</hi> This would have ſhewed him a thouſand Errours of times paſt, and as many of the preſent, in deviating either from the Letter or Publick Interpretation of the Revealed Will of God. This would have taught him to avoid the Errours of <hi>Rome,</hi> in tranſgreſſing an Apoſtolical Canon, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publickly in an unknown Tongue, lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door of Knowledge from the People, forbidding Religious Orders to Marry, which is honourable in all men; denying the Cup
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101791:11"/>
to the Laiety, againſt the Inſtitution and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the firſt and beſt Ages of Religion, and the very Letters of the Command, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> and a many more which I ſhall not inſiſt upon. This would have taught him to avoid the Cruel and Inhumane Divinity of <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> which his Grace laſhes with ſo much Truth and Juſtice; and the barbarous Principles, and horrid Practices of Rebelling, Covenanting, Aſſociating, Excluding, Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Proteſtants, who act ſo directly contrary to the Innocent Religion of thoſe who are Chriſts Sheep, that they are onely a Herd of Wolves and Foxes, Bears and Lions, and the moſt Savage Animals in Proteſtant Skins. And it may be it would have led him into the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the moſt Catholick Society of Men in the world, both in Doctrine and Practice, the beſt Chriſtians, and the beſt Subjects that the Sun ſees in all his Travails round the Univerſe; and here would I leave my Inquirer as in ſafe hands, wiſhing all Mankind in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and capacity of attaining Salvation, and the fruition of the God of love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101791:11"/>
Whereas a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Pagan,</hi> may all according to my Lords Hypotheſis be ſafe, ſo long as they believe in their own either weak or obſtinate Reaſon, which muſt not be impoſed upon, for fear of Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, that they, are in the Right, and Worſhip God; and with his Graces pardon, even <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> himſelf, will lay as good a claim to Heaven, at this rate of arguing, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and therefore I will leave this matter to his ſecond and his better thoughts.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I think the Maxime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Perſecution for Differences in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning Religion, and the fixing the Character of Antichriſtianiſm upon all ſuch Proſecutions of Diſſenters, is built upon a miſtake of the Reaſon, Nature, and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Humane Laws which Diſſenters call Perſecuting.</p>
            <p>Now firſt I take it to be true, That puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the Profeſſors and Practicers of a True Religion purely for that Religion, whilſt they continue ſuch, by living innocently and inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101791:12"/>
in all things to the Civil Government, is real Perſecution, and truely Antichriſtian, as being directly oppoſite to the Spirit of that Religion, and impoſſible to be done by any but ſuch as are Enemies to that Religion: and thus the Heathen Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their ſubordinate Officers, were truely Perſecutors, and the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> truely Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, I take it alſo to be as true, that the puniſhing of Offenders, whoſe Religion is falſe or ſeigned, and who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a colour or ſhew of it, to carry on other Deſignes, is not onely Lawful, but juſt and neceſſary. May not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Government endeavour by Penalties to hinder <hi>Mahometaniſme</hi> or <hi>Paganiſme</hi> from rooting out <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> without being An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian for ſo doing? Certainly this is a very illogical Principle, and ſo far from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> that it is the high Road to eſtabliſh it: And if Magiſtrates are to take care by vertue of their Office to ſupport the Government of the World,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101791:12"/>
the Peace and Happineſs of their People; they muſt do it by Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Methods of Heaven; better than which his Grace would do well if he would oblige us in ſhewing us others, and what and wherein they conſiſt. Now if Men will ſet up Religions deſtructive of Peace, Charity, Order, Government, Obedience, and the Happineſs of Humane Society, not onely all Religion, but Society is come to its <hi>Conclamatum est,</hi> unleſs the Magiſtrate who is <hi>Virtute Officii</hi> Gods Vicegerent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the Good and puniſhing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, interpoſe and ſhew himſelf really a Terrour to Evil doers, and a Rewarder and Encourager of ſuch as do well.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I take it alſo for an undou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bted truth, that by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, no perſon is puniſhed, or as his Grace and the Diſcenters call it Perſecuted, purely for that which he calls his Religion, which is his private Opinion. And it raiſes my admiration to wonder, how his Grace, who hath had his ſhare in the preparation of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101791:13"/>
thoſe Laws for the Royal Aſſent, ſhould be ſo far miſtaken in the nature and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of them. All the Laws of the Land ſhewing the Reaſon of their Penal Nature, to be purely Political, and not Spiritual; and it is the Overt Acts of Treaſon, Sedition, and Rebellion, and the fatal Conſequences of pretended Religion, which the Laws endeavour by Penalties to obviate or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and to puniſh, if men be ſo wicked or ſo fooliſh not to take the fair Caution that is given them. A man may be to himſelf of any Religion; nay, ſo great Indulgence does our Law give, that they may private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe it, provided they exceed not ſuch a number beſides their Family; by which it is moſt evident, that the Quarrel is not immediately at the Opinion, which is pitied becauſe Falſe, and indulged becauſe the Aſſertors are obſtinately Fooliſh, but at the practical Conſequences, which by terrible Experience have been found to be fatal to the Prince and People, to the Peace and Proſperity of the Community: even that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful 35th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> tells us in the Title, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101791:13"/>
it is <hi>An Act to retain the Queens Subjects in their due Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be ſevere Laws againſt Papiſts, Prieſts, and Jeſuites, the reaſon of them was for their Turbulency, and continual Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Machinations againſt the Life of the Prince, and the Peace of the Nation, for their Doctrines of the Lawfulneſs of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, Depoſing, and even Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Soveraign Princes, and diſpoſing of their Realms and Dominions for preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Hereſie or Incapacity: Doctrines able to ruine the whole Earth, and lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Eternal Miſchiefs to mankind. And if the Diſſenters, on the other hand, complain of the ſeverity of Penal Statutes, or ſuffer by them, it is becauſe they have actually been guilty of the moſt horrible Crimes of Rebellion, and the moſt conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated Wickedneſs, in Murdering the Beſt of Princes, and overturning the Beſt of Governments; it is becauſe the lewd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Democracy are inconſiſtent with Monarchy, and contain in them the Seeds
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101791:14"/>
of Sedition, Rebellion, Anarchy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: And though in Charity we may conclude, that all Diſſenters of different Perſwaſions, are not ſo tainted with the worſt of Principles, as to become Rebels and Regicides; yet there being an abſolute impoſſibility to diſtinguiſh the Innocent from the Criminal, ſince none will acknowledge themſelves ſuch, the Innocent muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſuffer with the Criminal, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their Puniſhments, unleſs they can make us <hi>Momus</hi> his Windows, to ſee into their Hearts and Souls, not onely what they are, but what they will or may be. And to conclude this particular, I dare confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aver, That neither the Intention of the Laws was to puniſh men for their different Opinions, or that any have been puniſhed by virtue of any Penal or Capital Law, but upon the account of the Political, not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious neceſſity, to ſecure the Peace and Safety of the Government. And if a Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal puniſhing the Diſturbers of publick Peace, Order, and Government, be ſo great a Crime, as in his Graces Opinion, to be near
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101791:14"/>
a kin to the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and to render men Perſecutors and Antichriſtian; the whole World, and all Ages, Places, Times, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Governours, muſt have been, are, and will be Antichriſtian and Perſecuting to the World end; even <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> not excepted, the one the Wiſeſt, and the other the Beſt King, being a man after Gods own Heart. And how his Grace will eſcape the laſh of his own Cenſure, I cannot imagine, who hath, I preſume, often given his <hi>Conſent</hi> to penal Bills, and may yet to others, for the ſecuring the Perſon of his Prince, and the Peace of his Country from Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Rumbalds,</hi> and Conventicling Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſſes, as he is in duty bound, as well as from any other Irreligious Rebels. And upon the whole, if all thoſe who proſecute Diſſenters are Perſecutors, and all Perſecutors Antichriſtian; his Grace will be at a great loſs where to finde any ſort of People in the World that call themſelves Chriſtians, who by this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101791:15"/>
Logick may not be proved Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. And certainly this is a notable way of Arguing Men and Athieſts into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to lay that down as a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Maxim, which if admitted for Truth, will infallibly prove there never was any true Religion in the World; ſince it is impoſſible to finde any Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety or Government, which hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to preſerve it ſelf by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, by Penal and Capital Laws, againſt Uſurpers, Rebels, and Seditious Perſons and Principles, though never ſo fairly gilded over with fine and glittering Titles of Holy Leagues, Holy Covenants, Gods People, and Saints; Vizors, with which ill men have endeavoured to conceal the moſt Flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crimes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:101791:15"/>
Having thus ſhortly run over the two main things, I hope we ſhall with more eaſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the third, which ſeems, by being put as the Sting in the Tayl, to have been the efficient Cauſe of the Book, which Logicians tell us, is always firſt in Intention, though laſt in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; and that is, the neceſſity of a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For in truth, if Perſecution be really An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, and no Man ought to be forced in Religious Matters, then Toleration is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary in order to the very Eſſence of being a Chriſtian, a good Man, and able Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian.</p>
            <p>Now if I be able to ſhew, that Toleration of all Religions, is neither good Politicks nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity in a Monarchy, I think I ſhall have done with his Graces Paper; and this I belive to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced or undeſigning Perſons will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear either difficult, or impoſſible to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, therefore, It is ill Divinity, unleſs my Lords new Scheme of the Poſſibility of being ſaved by the conduct of Humane Reaſon in any Religion which acknowledges a God, and teaches Morality, be granted for a Truth. And if it ſhould, I cannot ſee any manner of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Faith, or Chriſtian Religion, nor, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Divinity, was the Incarnation of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101791:16"/>
Son of God ſo great a kindneſs to the World, as all Pious Men believe, if Men might go to Heaven before this Stupendious Mercy was known to them, or may ſo ſtill by the help of that Inſtinct which his Grace tells us is ſo near a-kin to God; and we muſt now after al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 1700 Years come to queſtion the truth of Canonical Scripture, which aſſures us, there is no other Name under Heaven by which Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be obtained, but the glorious and the bleſſed Name of Jeſus, the Saviour of the World.</p>
            <p>Again, It is moſt certain, that as there is but one God, ſo there is but one Faith, and one Truth. Whereas there are many Errours, and Doctrines of Devils in all dreſſes, even that of Chriſtian Religion. Now theſe will all plead as ſtrongly for Toleration and Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as the true Religion, and upon my Lords Hypotheſis will have as undoubted a Right to it. So that the whole World muſt be ſuffered to continue in damnable Errours and Hereſies, which they call Religion; and no Perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Penalty of being guilty of one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Crimes, and being Antichriſtian, muſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for their blaſphemous Tenents, or charitably indeavour by the fear and terrour of Humane Laws and Penalties, as well as by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101791:16"/>
Reaſons and Arguments, to oblige them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a better information of their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a clearer Notion of theſe neceſſary Truths wherein they have been, by their folly and obſtinacy, mightily, and it may be long miſtaken, for want of the Rod of Correction to cure them of that folly which is naturally bound up in the Hearts of the Children of Men.</p>
            <p>Now if it be true as it muſt, if we believe every Word of God is true, That no Man can be ſaved, but by comming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth by Supernatural Revelation, and that they muſt all be damned who believe a lie; that there is but one Name to give Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and one Truth to be believed: Is it not a very fine way of leading Men to that glorious Truth and Light, to tell them, all who pretend to it have it, how far remote from it ſoever; and to render it almoſt morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, among ſo many authoriz'd Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, to find the real Truth! And is it not a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Doctrine to give Men Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to go headlong to the Devil for God's ſake, without endeavouring to ſtop their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, when we ſee them mounted upon the blackeſt and moſt furious Steeds of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Errours and Hereſies? Will his Grace think it convenient to Tolerate the Conſcience of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101791:17"/>
a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> who rides Whip and Spur upon the <hi>Pegaſus</hi> of his Sanguinary Divinity, and has the blaſphemous impudence to compare Almighty Mercy, which he ſays Gods Revealed Will ſeems to offer to all, to be only like the Artifice of a little Vermin-catcher, who baits his Trap with it, only that by their refuſal, to which they are precondemned, by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will, he may have ſomething to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them? And were I at leiſure to write, or his Grace to read, I could furniſh him with a Bill of <hi>Items</hi> of this Nature, in the Opinions of our ſeveral Diſſenters, longer then a Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of the greateſt Faith ever truſted a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Courtier for. But let this paſs only with this Remark, that if it were for my life, that I indeavoured either to make a witty Man an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, or to propagate Atheiſm in the World, I would deſire no other Favour or Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but a Toleration of all Opinions, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience to effect it.</p>
            <p>Nor is Toleration worſe Divinity then Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. I cannot ſay how it may ſtand with the Nature of a Commonwealth, though, becauſe our Republicans are ſo fond of it, one would think it calculated for their Meridian; but certainly, not onely Reaſon, but dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Experience have aſſured us, it is inconſiſtent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101791:17"/>
with Monarchy. Nothing can make a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy Great and Auguſt, but the Love and Union of the People; and if his Grace will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of <hi>Lewis the Fourteenth,</hi> he will inform him, that is his Opinion; and indeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing begets greater Diviſions and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities in a Kingdom, then Religious Feuds, which weaken its Power at home, and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation abroad; but where theſe diverſities in Opinion about Religion, all meet as in a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Point of the Lawfulneſs for the Sake, or Name, or Cauſe of Religion; for Subjects to take up Arms, to Dethrone and Aſſaſſinate privately, or publickly to Murder their Prince, and ſubvert the Government, as the Principles of all Covenanters, Aſſociators, and Excluders do, I appeal to all Crowned Heads, to all Perſons who have any ſhare in Government, to all Miniſters of State and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians, nay, even to his Grace himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch dangerous Principles, and Perſons Poiſoned with them, are not ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Toleration, as to be moſt pernicious and intolerable in any Monarchy, that deſires, or expects to be ſafe.</p>
            <p>But what need we to argue from Reaſon, when Fact is ſo evident? Has not Indulgence,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101791:18"/>
Toleration, and Liberty of Conſcience mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered one King, ſet up a thouſand Uſurpers, made <hi>England</hi> ſuffer a thouſand miſeries, and coſt this Nation many thouſand Lives, many Millions of Treaſure! His Grace had a ſhare, and a large one, in the effects of that Liberty of Conſcience: It was a Conſcientious <hi>Felton</hi> that robbed him of a Noble Father, and the World of a moſt Illuſtrious Life; it was a Conſcientious Rebel that ſlew his Brother; it was Conſcientious Rebels that Sequeſtred his Eſtate, Impriſoned his Perſon, and would have taken away his Life; and if he has a mind to run the Gantlet again through all thoſe Riſques of Fortune, I would recommend him to a Toleration, and Liberty of Conſcience, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his deſires; for I dare aſſure him, a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Coronet is no more a Protection againſt Conſcience, when once it takes the Field, then an Imperial Crown, or a much hated, though Innocent, Mitre.</p>
            <p>Were that late Rebellion onely the ſingle diſmal Extravagance of Conſcience grown Frantick by Indulgence, or wantonly Cruel by too much Liberty, ſomething might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in mitigation of its Crimes: But it is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101791:18"/>
a Wild Creature in Diſſenters, whoſe Chain is no ſooner looſe, but it flies at the Throat of its Keeper. And no Man can doubt of this, who reflects upon the Troubles and Dangers which have befallen our late Sovereign, and His Illuſtrious Brother our moſt Gracious King, which muſt date their <hi>Aera</hi> from the laſt Indulgence; for no ſooner had the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters gained that Point, but they threw at all; and the good and loyal Subjects of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the beſt Supporters of the Crown, being diſcouraged, the Faction grew Rampant to the higheſt Degrees of Inſolence imaginable, and wanted but little of puſhing on a more dreadful Revolution than that of Forty one; For who were the Petitioners, the Addreſſers, the Life and Fortune Men, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociators, the Excluſioners, the <hi>Rye-</hi>houſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, but the great Friends to the Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to Liberty of Conſcience and Toleration? And who were to aſſiſt theſe mighty Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, but the Diſſenters, the Band of Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to this pretended Conſcience? And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Indulges thoſe who plead Conſcience, opens, a ſecret Sally-port to let in Traytors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed under the Name of Tender Conſcience, betrays a Principal Gate of the Government

to his Enemies, and for one Conſcience really Tender, will find a thouſand as hard as Iron, and as ſharp as Steel, and as mortal too, in a Diſſenters Hand. And I cannot but infinitely admire at that Paſſage in the Epiſtle, where his Grace hopes <hi>a Conſideration of the Preſent State of this Kingdon, if it could ſink deep enough into Mens Hearts to make them endeavour, now, to promote a true Liberty of Conſcience, would make the Nation happy;</hi> or at his foreſeeing, without pretending to Propheſie, <hi>that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary will terminate in a general Diſcontent, the diſpeopling of our Country, and the expoſing us to the Conqueſt of a Foreign Nation.</hi> Whereas in Fact, as well as plain Reaſon, the direct contrary is moſt evident. Diviſion hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been the Fore-runner of the Fate of States and Kingdoms, and to give Men leave to divide and ſub-divide into ten thouſand Fractions, is the ready way to ſow the Seeds of Diſcords, Animoſities, and everlaſting inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Quarrels; to expoſe us perpetually to the dangerous Conſpiracies of Ambitious, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, and Factious Republicans, and to put us into the next diſpoſition to become a Prey either to Foreign Invaders, or Domeſtick Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. It is the moſt undoubted way to ruine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101791:19"/>
all Religion, and put us out of the Protection of the Divine Mercy and Goodneſs; It is the moſt compendious way to ruin the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of whoſe ſtedfaſt Loyalty, and of whoſe ability to ſupport the Crown, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable or inconſiderable the Faction have endeavoured to render it, both his late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and our preſent Gracious King have had, and have owned too great Experience of, to be doubted or diſputed; and ſhould that Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar be taken from the Throne by Toleration, a man ſhall not need to Propheſy what the Commonwealth-Conſcience-men would do with the Monarch, and with the Monarchy; nay, ſhould the Church of <hi>England</hi> be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced and diſcouraged by Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as to recede from its active Loyalty in oppoſing the Diſſenting Faction, no knowing or obſerving man but muſt dread the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unavoidable Conſequences of their betaking themſelves to a paſſive Loyalty; and it is eaſie to gueſs how deplorable a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune it would be to the King and Nation to be at the Diſcretion and Mercy of the Conſcience of the Faction. But God be praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who hath conducted his Majeſty to the Royal Throne, through the Tempeſtuous Sea of Aſſotiating, Aſſaſſinating, and Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101791:20"/>
Conſciences, which hath given him a ſufficient Experience how far he may truſt them, and be ſafe. And God be praiſed, we have his Royal word, which we eſteem as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and inviolable as the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> for our comfort and protection; nor is there any perſon, who hath the leaſt ſparks of Generoſity himſelf, or is even at the remoteſt diſtance acquainted with that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Character, which hath rendred him ſo conſpicuous to the whole Earth, as a Prince of the moſt generous Conſtancy and Firmneſs to his word, but will believe it with as much Confidence as humane certainty is capable of.</p>
            <p>I have but three or four Words more to add to his Graces Queſtions, and I ſhall herein follow his Method.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether Jeſus Chriſt, who himſelf taught and practiced Subjection to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did not believe Soveraign Power had Authority to maintain the Order of Society by Rewards and Puniſhmets? and whether my Lord hath conſidered, that ſpiritual Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are far more Rigorous than Temporal; the Chains of Darkneſs, than humane Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments; eternal Damnation, than pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Penalties; Baniſhment from Heaven, than Exile upon Earth; Excommunication, than a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101791:20"/>
petty Fine? And that therefore, whether he who would have men compelled by the greateſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and the Terrors of them, to become Chriſtians, hath not done more to force men to be Religious, than all the Powers of the Earth ever have done, or ever can do? And laſtly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Graces Maxime, he may not incur the horrid Conſequence of proving even the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt, who teach this Doctrine, to be Antichriſtian, and another not fit to be named. For his Grace is to know, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of, neither any Spiritual or Temporal Law, is purely Penal, but intended primarily to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the danger it prohibits, and to puniſh only ſecondarily, where it meets not with that firſt effect; and yet the dread of Puniſhment is the only force that can affect humane Nature; nor do humane Laws pretend to inforce any other way, than according to the Methods preſcribed and practiced by the moſt Wiſe God; and even yet, this force is alſo the higheſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether there being a hundred Monarchies happy without Toleration and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, to one Republick that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it with Reſtriction, and whoſe future Fate we are ignorant of, and whether that may not in time prove its ruin; it be not a hundred to one, that a Monarchy ſhall be more flouriſhing, ſafe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101791:21"/>
and laſting without Toleration and Liberty of Conſcience than with them?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether it be not Croſs and Pile, whether a man who may be of any and of all Religions, will be of any, or of none at all?</p>
            <p>And to conclude with my Friendly advice, Let all men cheriſh, promote and propagate that Religion, which renders them the beſt Subjects to God and the King; and endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince as many as they can by their Reaſon and their Virtue, and by all lawful ways to diſcourage all Rebellion and Sedition, Diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Faction, let their Clamours be never ſo loud againſt Perſecution, and for Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Liberty of Conſcience under pretence of Religion. For aſſuredly this Nation ſhall never be happy ſo long as thoſe, whoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples lead them to cutting of Throats for Conſcience-ſake, make ſuch a ſtir for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience. Nor will any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more to our Peace and Safety, than ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Wiſe mans counſel, <hi>My ſon, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with thoſe who are given to change: for their calamity ſhall come ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</hi>
