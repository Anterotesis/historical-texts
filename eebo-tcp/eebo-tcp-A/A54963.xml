         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the diſeaſes whereunto the body of man is ſubject, the Plague or Peſtilence is the moſt terrible and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and moſt contagious; therefore wee muſt ſeeke all meanes, both Naturall and Artificiall, to preſerve our ſelues and Families from it: Therefore firſt wee will ſpeake of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes of this infection.</p>
               <p>There bee two ſpeciall cauſes of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>An infected, corrupted and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified Ayre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>Evill and corrupt humors ingendered in the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:36307:3"/>The aire is corrupted and infected di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wayes as Aſtronomers ſay, by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, aſpects, conjunctions, and oppoſition of ill planets, the Eclipſe of the Sunne and Moone, through the immoderate heate of the Aire, where the temperature of the aire is turned from his naturall ſtate to exceſsive heate and moiſture, which is the worſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Aire, vapors being drawne up by the heate of the Sunne, remaining unconſumed, doe rot, putrifie, and corrupt, an ſo with the venome, the Aire becommeth corrupted and infected.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ayre is often corrupted by the evaporation of dead carcaſſes lying unburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it often chanceth in the warres, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the evaporation of Pooles, Fennes, Mariſhes, ſtinking and noyſome ſinkes and kenells.</p>
               <p>A man falleth into the Peſtilence by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordering of himſelfe, either in diet, or with other exerciſes.</p>
               <p>Therefore, during the time of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious ſickneſſe, hee muſt have a ſpeciall regard, to keepe himſelfe from all outrages, and ſurfets (to wit) from all exceſſe of meate, drinke, ſweating, bathes, letehery, and all other things that open the pores of the body, and cauſeth the bad ayres to enter, which entring, invenome the lively ſpirits of
<pb facs="tcp:36307:3"/>
man, and infect, and indanger the whole body.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing it is evident, that the Plague or Peſtilence is not cauſed, but through the breathing in of peſtilent and corrupt Ayre; there cannot be a more ſafe and preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to preſerue one, then by flying from that corrupt Aire, there is no other meanes to avoid the peſtilent Aire, becauſe, whether wee will or no, wee muſt draw in ſuch Aire, unleſſe wee get us away into ſome other place where the aire is not corrupted nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but pure and good, neither muſt you returne home againe from that place over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone.</p>

               <head>¶ Obſervations to be uſed, preſerving from the Plague.</head>
               <p>BVt if upon vrgent occaſion of buſineſſe you may not flie: then have a ſpeciall care that the houſe in which you muſt tarry, be cept cleane and ſweete, without all kind of ſtinke, filthineſſe, or ſluttiſhneſſe, let the windowes be kept cloſe, and ſhut eſpecially in clowdy and rainy weather, that the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aire enter not in, but if you will open them, doe it about mid-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:36307:4"/>You muſt come abroad as ſeldome as you can, and not (if you may) except the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be cleere and bright, but before you come abroad you muſt take ſome medicine, which is able to preſerve you from infection, as the roote of <hi>Angelica, Pimpernell,</hi> &amp;c. chewed in the mouth.</p>
               <p>Alſo you muſt make fires daily in your houſes, that thereby the corrupt aire that is in the houſe, may be the better purged and amended; for there is a marvelous great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſtrength in fire, to purge, correct &amp; amend the rottenneſſe and corruption of the ayre.</p>
               <p>Alſo if you burne <hi>Juniper, Tamariſcus, Bay-leaves, Roſemary,</hi> and ſuch like are very good to purge the houſe of all ill aires, and to ſweeten: or take a Chafindiſh of coales, and ſtrow upon it the powder of <hi>Roſemary, Sage, Rew, Betonie, Wormwood, Majoram, Origaen, Juniper-berries, Mirrh, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> and <hi>Maſticke, Cipreſse-barkes, Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> the root or leaves, <hi>Lavander,</hi> wood of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, Gallia Muſchata, Cloves,</hi> or any one of all theſe are very good to aire your houſe withall.</p>
               <p>It is beſt in hore weather to correct and purifie the aire with cold things, as with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Violetts, Water-lillies, Vine-leaves,</hi> and branches of <hi>Willowes,</hi> &amp;c. and to ſprinkle the
<pb facs="tcp:36307:4"/>
floore with cold water mixt with <hi>Viniger, Roſes,</hi> or <hi>Sorrell,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is very good when one goeth abroad, to have ſomething in their hands to ſmell too, the better to avoide thoſe noyſome ſtinkes, and filthy ſavors which are in every corner, therefore it is very good to carry in the hand a branch of <hi>Rew, Roſemary, Roſes,</hi> or <hi>Camphire</hi>; and the ſmell of <hi>Viniger</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, or a Pomander ſomthing like this.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Alſo hee muſt refraine from eating of much fruit, for it doth breede corrupt blood and if he eate any it muſt be ſowre.</p>
               <p>Alſo hee muſt eate little garlike, Onions, or Leeks, for theſe cauſe unkinde heate.</p>
               <p>Alſo ſuffer not thirſt greatly, and when thou doeſt thirſt drinke but meaſurably, and that but ſmall and thinne drinke, or barly water, or clarified whey ſod with coole hearbs.</p>
               <p>Another ſpeciall regard muſt bee had in exerciſes, <hi>vbi quomodo &amp; quando.</hi> The place where, muſt be in a wholſome and pure ayre, and hee muſt uſe them temperately, and moderately, and muſt eſchew all violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, as dancing, running, leaping: and whatſoever ſuch like kinde of exerciſe that cauſeth often breathing in of Ayre, hee muſt refraine in the extreame heate of the day, and in places where is much concourſe of people</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:36307:5"/>As for his ſleepe and watchings, let them bee meane and moderate, onely his ſleepe muſt bee ſufficient to ſuffice Nature, and in a cloſe Chamber, well ſtopped, and the windowes and doores cloſe ſhut, left the ill ayre enter into it, and hee muſt have regard that his ſheetes bee cleane and ſweete, well ayred by the fire, if perfumed or ſweetned they be the better. Therefore that uſe is good of Roſe-cakes and ſweete bagges in cheſts where they keepe linnen.</p>
               <p>It is good alſo at night afore you goe to bed to ayre the chamber with a good fire, or with a chaſing diſh of coles, wherein it were good to ſtrow ſome powder of <hi>Rew, Sage, Betonie,</hi> or of <hi>Iuniper</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>When you walke in the morning, firſt emptie the body of all ſuperfluities and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, &amp; take heed: and beware the body, bee not to coſtive at any time. Therefore, if of thy ſelf naturally at any time thou canſt not voyde out excrements, thou ſhalt take either a potion of pils, or elſe a Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or ſuppoſitary of pils, take <hi>pilulae rufi,</hi> or <hi>peſtilentiales</hi> or <hi>Communes:</hi> or elſe</p>

               <p>Theſe pils do moſt reſiſt putrifaction, and have a very great vertue againſt the infecting of the peſtilent ayre.</p>
               <p>Blood-letting alſo is very wholſome for young folke, and ſuch as have great ſtore of blood, for it doth much coole the ſtate of the body, and bringeth it to a moderate heate, and letteth out the corrupt humours, which doe make the body more ſubject to infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: bloud letting is very neceſſary in the time of infection, and doth much profit, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve health.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is very ill to be too paſsionate or melancholy: for the paſsions of ſadneſſe, Anger, hatred, feare, great cares, and heavie thoughts and ſighing, doe much diſtemper the body and make it more unfit to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the infection: but on the contrary it is very good to uſe joy and mirth with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</p>

               <head>Signes to know the infected.</head>
               <p>HAving before ſhewed the naturall and originall cauſes of the plague and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence,
<pb facs="tcp:36307:6"/>
with the beſt meanes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a mans ſelfe from it, wee will proceed and ſhew, firſt the ſignes whereby a man may beſt judge of himſelfe, whether hee bee already infected, or not, and the meanes to cure the ſicke.</p>
               <p>As concerning the ſignes that declare one to be already infected, they are many.</p>
               <p>Firſt when the outward members are cold, and the inward parts burning hot, when there is a paine and heavineſſe of the head, and a great inclination to ſleepe. A wearineſſe, heavineſſe, and difficulty in breathing. A ſadneſſe and carefulneſſe of the minde: a change of countenance, with a frowning looke of the eyes: loſſe of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make and appetite: immoderate thirſt and often vomiting: a bitterneſſe and drineſſe of the mouth: The pulſe frequent, ſmall and deepe, the Vrine troublous, thick, and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like beaſts urine.</p>
               <p>The ſureſt token of all to know the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of the plague, is, if there doe ariſe and engender botches behind the eares, or under the arme holes, or about the ſhare: or alſo if Carbuncles doe ariſe in any member ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for when they doe appeare they beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſtrength of Nature: Which being ſtrong and mighty, doth labour to drive the poiſon out of the body, but if botches doe not
<pb facs="tcp:36307:7"/>
appeare, it is more perillous and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: for it betokeneth that nature is weak and feeble, and not able to expell and drive out the venemous humours, and then you muſt have reſpect to the ſignes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed.</p>
               <p>Alſo theſe botches which doe appeare, they doe declare which members of the the body bee infected above any other, and doe thruſt out venimous humours from them.</p>
               <p>The infection of the plague entereth into a man in this ſort.</p>
               <p>In a man are three principall parts (that is) the heart, liver, and armes, and each of theſe hath his cleanſing place: Therefore if they doe appeare in the necke, they doe ſhew the braines to be chiefly vexed: if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the arme-holes, the heart, but if they appeare in the ſhare, the Liver is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>For a man having taken ſome venome, it is mingled with the blood, and runnes to the heart, which is the chiefe part of man: and the heart by kinde putteth the venome to his clenſing place which is the arme-holes: and it being ſtopt, putteth to the next principall part, that is the Liver, and it paſſeth it to his cleanſing place, which is the Thigh-holes or ſhare: Likewiſe they being
<pb facs="tcp:36307:7"/>
ſtopt, paſſe it to the next principall place (that is) the armes, and to their clenſing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are under the eares, or under the throate, and they being ſtopped, ſuffer it not to paſſe out, then it is mooved 12, houres before it reſt in any place, and if it bee not let out within the ſpace of foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty houres by bleeding it caſts a man into an ague, and maketh a botch in one of the three places, or neere them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Cure of the infected of the Plague.</head>
               <p>THe beſt way to cure the Plague is this when thou findeſt thy ſelfe to be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and feeleſt the bloud flickering, bleed in the firſt houre or within ſixe houres after drinke not, and tarry not above 12. houres from bleeding, for when thy blood is ſo flickering, the venome is then moving and not yet ſetled, and after it is too late: thoſe that are fat may be let blood, or elſe not.</p>
               <p>If the matter be gathered under the arme-holes, it comes from the heart by the veine Cardiall, then bleed on the ſame ſide: on the innermoſt veine of the arme commonly called <hi>Baſollica</hi>: but bleed not on both ſides,
<pb facs="tcp:36307:8"/>
except it bee in both armeholes for that is dangerous, and loſſe of good bloud.</p>
               <p>And if the botch doth appeare behind the eares, or above the chinne, or in any other part of the face, or neck, you muſt let blood out of veine <hi>Cephalica,</hi> on the ſame ſide: let blood with cupping-glaſſes for that is the beſt, or a horſe-leach, or horſe haire.</p>
               <p>But if the botch appeare in the ſhare, you muſt then bleed in the Ancle of the ſame ſide, and then in any caſe bleed not in the Arme, for it will draw up the matter againe.</p>
               <p>But if there appeare no botch outwardly, you muſt then draw bloud out of the ſame ſide where is felt the greateſt paine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe, and out of which veine the paine and griefe of the members afflicted will declare.</p>
               <p>For if the members above the breaſt bee moſt grieved and afflicted, cut the <hi>Cephalica</hi> veine. But if the parts about the necke bee moſt grieved bleed in the <hi>Baſillica,</hi> or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle veine.</p>
               <p>And if the nether parts bee moſt grieved and vexed, bleed in the hamme or ankles. And if nature bee ſtrong, and other things not letting, draw out bloud aboundantly.</p>
               <p>But if through age or for other cauſes you may not uſe bloud letting, then you muſt faſten cupping glaſſes and uſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:36307:8"/>And if you perceive the peſtilence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or invade you at meate, or upon a full ſtomacke, then vomit ſtraiteway, and when the body and ſtomacke is empty, then take ſome medicine that can reſiſt poyſon, as <hi>Methrydate,</hi> or <hi>Triacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the patient hath taken ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that wil expel the venome, lay him in a warmed bed, being made with ſoft ſheets, and well covered with cloathes, that there he may ſweat well, for the ſpace of foure or 5. houres, or more according to his ſtrength. But if by this meanes you can ſcarſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to ſweate, you may uſe ſome other meanes, as by the heating of tiles, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them hote to the feete of the patient, or with ſtone bottles filled with hot water, and being cloſe ſtopt with corke, that the water ſpill not, and ſo put into the bed to the ſick, they will by their heat provoke him readily to ſweat. And all the time the ſicke doth ſweate, you muſt take heed that hee neither ſleepe, eate, nor drinke.</p>
               <p>And after hee hath ſweat, you muſt wipe diligently off the ſweat, with very cleane and fine linnen clothes. Then afterward let the ſicke riſe from his bed, if he either will or can: But let him not come into the open ayre, but eſchew it aſ much as may bee: Alſo let the Ayre of the Chamber in the which the ſicke
<pb facs="tcp:36307:9"/>
doth lie, be corrected and amended and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with odoriferous things, and with ſweete ſmelling perfumes, ſuch as are before declared.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the principall and whole body being clenſed by bleeding, or cupping and ſweating, the patient muſt be very wary, and meaſurable in his diet, for in the Fever <hi>Acute</hi> which is accidentall to this ſickneſſe; it is good to eate no fleſh but little chickins ſod with freſh water, but it is beſt to give unto him the broath of a chicken two or three houres after he hath ſweat, and often, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſtrength, for the ſicke and weake muſt be noriſhed and refreſhed by little and little: If the broath have in it the juice of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Oranges, veriuice, or viniger, it is the better.</p>
