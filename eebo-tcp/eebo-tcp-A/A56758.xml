            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IEceived yours, wherein you give me an Account of your dangerous Diſaſter, which greatly threatens your Life, <hi>viz.</hi> your frequent Spitting of Blood, proceeding from the Acrimony of that Vital Liquor.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44431:3"/>
Long and frequent Evacuations of that Kind muſt of neceſſity ſpend the Spirits, weaken Nature, and ſhorten Life: I therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you a moſt Excellent Specifick in your Diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Bengala Bean</hi>; which is of a healing Balſamick Nature, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately Stiptick, of a very temperate Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and affords an excellent Soder to the Veins and Arteries, where any breach is made on them by the Defluxions of a ſharp cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding Humour: It mitigates the Acidity of all ſalt Rhumes which invade the Lungs, and threaten a Conſumption. It checks the Violence of Coughing, and eaſeth pains in the Breaſt, it rarely Thickens and incraſſates the Blood, and gives it a good Conſiſtence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it prevents all ſorts of Hemorrages of Blood.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the Author of the Book called <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Pourtraicture of Old Age,</hi> tells of a young Virgin, a Patient of his, who Dyed in twenty four hours Space, of a Violent Flux of Blood, from all parts of her Body; as Noſe, Ears, Eyes, Mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had he been ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44431:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
happy as to have known this Remedy, I don't know but he might have ſaved her, with God Almighty's bleſſing.</p>
            <p>We cannot now Apply our ſelves in our Iſſues of blood, to ſo Happy a remedy as the Hem of our Saviours Garment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt make uſe of the Beſt means we can, and be thankful if we find Relief by any.</p>
            <p>I could tell you a ſtrange Story of a young Gentleman who was troubled with a Hemop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſie, or ſpitting of Blood for many Weeks, ſo that he Deſpair'd of Life. He had open'd a Vein Twice, had uſed all the Common Forms of Medicines, as Frictions, Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Fomentations, Gentle Purgatives, and what elſe could be thought on by the ableſt Phyſicians; but nothing could cure the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Veſſels about the Lungs, untill he applyed himſelf unto the Drops drawn out of this Balſamick Bean, and drinking them ſometimes in Cows Milk, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Aſſes and Goats Milk, was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully Cured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44431:4"/>I knew a Learned Divine, who ſtraining his Voice in Preaching, had broke a Vein in his Lungs; and after the uſe of many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, which proved inſignificant, he at length uſed theſe vulnerary Drops in Wine and Water, and he experienced a mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereby, to the Immortal Praiſe of the Great Phyſician above.</p>
            <p>A Labouring Man about Forty years of Age, who fell from the Top of a Houſe, and bruiſed his Breaſt, which occaſioned Spitting of Blood: I gave him theſe Drops in Mead ſeven days, and all his pains aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and he Spit no more Blood, nor felt any more pain.</p>
            <p>A Child about Twelve Years of Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled with a violent Cough, which cauſed him to Spit and Vomit Blood, a great Quantity, after he had taken many Fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Medicines, as Fryed Mice, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> Bread, ſate with his Naked Buttocks upon a Bears Back, and been Toſs'd ſeven or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44431:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nine times over a Bramble-Buſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at laſt he took theſe Drops in Claret-Wine and Water, and was cured of his Chin-cough, his Whooping ceaſed, and his Spitting went off.</p>
            <p>An elderly Perſon, who was continually bleeding at the Noſe, and other parts, was wonderfully reſcued from the Jaws of Death, by the uſe of theſe Drops in Milk and Water.</p>
