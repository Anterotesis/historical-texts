            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is as it were a certaine lawe in thinges ſubiect to ſence and reaſon. But (O good God) omnipotent, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his heathniſh Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, very abſurdly teacheth, that all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, be bodies ſubiect to no corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that they and their motions be eternall: and he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth to certaine myndes, Intelligentis, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtraunge natures and eſſenties, and ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their ſeuerall and ſinguler motions of the ſayd Orbes: And he aſſigneth one Orbe to the high God, which is moued by him. Whereby he maketh all thoſe eſſenties ſeperated, among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:4661:6"/>
thoſe Orbes are diſtributed to bee equall and like ſubstaunce: but he alloweth that mynde or eſſence which is the elder: that is, God to bee onely ſo much the more excellent then the reſt, by how much the orbe aſſigned to him, is more excellent then the other Orbes. That Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie alſo teacheth, that it is an abſurde thing and againſt reaſon, to ſay that any thing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall had any beginning: therefore becauſe thoſe Orbes be eternal they had no beginning. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it teacheth that God medleth not vnder the Moone, and that he is not the maker nor the creatour of any thing, but onely the mouer of the heauen: and it maketh God to be the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe onely of motions, and not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ech ſeueral thing: neither doth his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie teach any agent cauſe of thoſe thinges which it affirmeth to be eternall. And by this doctrine it muſt needes follow, that becauſe the world is eternall without beginning &amp; ending, and incorruptible, therefore it needeth not thy prouidence, either that it ſhould be, or continue, nor that it needeth thy helpe. And becauſe it hath no other efficient cauſe of any other but of it ſelfe, therefore it needeth none other to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for his being or well being. It alſo teacheth that thou O GOD medleſt not vnder the Moone, but that thou ruleſt vnder the Moone
<pb facs="tcp:4661:6"/>
onely with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon influence and vſuall courſe of ſecond cauſes, though ſome doe vntruely goe about to excuſe this doctrine: in ſaying, that it accompteth Nature to be God, or at leaſt Gods <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar or deputie: which neither needeſt any ſuch, nor yet haſt any deputie. O moſt mightie God, creator of all thinges, ſtrengthen thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt theſe and all ſuch doctrines, tending to the derogation of thine honour, goodneſſe, mercie and wiſedome: and by reaſon it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that no body of it ſelfe is immortall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe each body conſisteth of his partes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be diſſolued: but the ſoule of man is immortall, and the body is made immortall at the laſt reſurrection, by reaſon of the preſence of the ſoule: But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> maketh no mention of the immortalitie of the ſoule, neither doth he attribute any felicitie to it after the death of man: whereby <hi>Alexander Aptrodiſienſes</hi> concludeth, that he denyeth the immortalitie of the ſoule: Alſo reaſon teacheth, that many diuers and contrary thinges can not bee ioyned together by themſelues, without the helpe of an other, and be not brought to one certaine forme, vnleſſe they bee vnited together by the helpe of ſome other. The worlde therefore, conſisting of ſo many diuers and contrary partes: in which, colde, heate, drineſſe, and moysture, are ioyned
<pb facs="tcp:4661:7"/>
together, and other thinges of contrary nature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and vertues, doe agree together in one forme. And the Orbes and celestiall bodies of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motions from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and from the Weſt to the Eaſt, and in retrogradation and direction, and ſtationarij, their motions in the Epicycle, in the <hi>Auſt. &amp; opoſito angis,</hi> doe make no diſcorde, but keepe a regular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in all thoſe contrarieties. Therfore, we muſt bee compelled to confeſſe, that there was and is one that hath coupled, vnited, and ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuch and ſo diuers contrary things: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſuch diuers and contrary things and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by their owne ſwing, courſe and mouing, would bee diſſolued one from an other, vnleſſe they were preſerued by ſome others. Can there be a table painted with diuers colours and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or pots of diuers ſorts and faſhions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a workmaſter? Can any thing that lacketh a gouernour or ruler, be moued by it ſelfe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in a regular or certaine order? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by reaſon it appeareth, that the worlde is gouerned and ruled (O God) by thy diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence: And thou (O God) that ruleſt all the vniuerſall worlde, doeſt alſo gouerne, rule, and prouide for each parte thereof: for he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well, that neglecteth the leaſt parte of that thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4661:7"/>Likewiſe, O almightie God, that heathniſh Philoſopher doth teach, that <hi>homo &amp; Sol ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> whereby (O good God) it muſt needes followe, that man and the Sunne muſt be eternall and infinite. Though heate nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and cheriſheth our bodies, yet for all that it is not the cauſe of generation and begetting, but thy worde, O mercifull God, ſo commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the blood of this or that man ſhalbe made male or female. Reaſon can not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende this worde, therefore it muſt needes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhly trifle off the cauſes of ſuch things. So the Phiſitions following the Philoſophers, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the cauſe of generation (O God) to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient mixture of qualities, which doe worke in the matter ordeyned before, what colour ſoeuer reaſon doth beare herein: yet for all that, they doe not attaine to the firſt cauſe thereof. For, the holy Ghoſt (O God) doth leade vs into a higher cauſe then to nature, then to qualities, and their temperature, when it ſetteth before vs thy worde, O omnipotent God, in which all things are created and conſerued. Alſo, O moſt high God, this heathniſh Philoſophie doth not admit any Metaphiſicall principle in naturall thinges, in which aſcending by the doubtfull care of naturall thinges, being remoued from diuine, mans minde is turned from them. And
<pb facs="tcp:4661:8"/>
ſurely ſuch naturall Philoſophie is the next way to make men forget thee, O God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Atheists: for it teacheth men to cleane and ſticke faſt vnto the nature of thinges, not aſcending nor conſidering the Creator: And ſo it tyeth thee (O God) to the ſeconde cauſes, and doth not attribute to thee any actions, but according to that nature of thinges: whereby it doth bewitch men in ſuch ſorte, and make their mindes ſo mad, that they neither do aske neither looke for any good thing at thy hande: for the euent and ſucceſſe of each thing muſt of neceſſitie bee anſwerable to the naturall cauſe. And by that doctrine thou (O God) doeſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the nature of thinges created: whereas contrariwiſe all thinges created muſt followe thee: ſo that it placeth the effected cauſe in the ſteede of efficient, and the instrumentall cauſe for the agent. And further it teacheth, that matter and forme is the firſt principle of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thinges: which doctrine draweth thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (O God) from true honoring of thee, for the creation and prouidence of thy creatures. It is not enough to confeſſe that thou didſt create all thinges, if it bee ſayd alſo that thou haſt forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thoſe thinges as ſoone as thou haſt created them: as the Carpenter leaueth the houſe when he hath once made it: for ſo ſhould the worlde

For, in thee wee liue, moue, and haue our being: and all thinges be of thee, and in thee, and by thee. For, we can not moue our tongue, which is the lytiſt part of our body, without thy prouidence: Man may prepare the heart, but thou (O God) ruleſt the tongue: neither doth a Sparrowe light vpon the ground, without thy good will O almightie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And all the heires of our head be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, thou c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, O God, graunt we may caſt our care vpon thee, that thou may nouriſh vs: take thou care ouer vs: touch the apple of our eye: be thou our ſhield and braſen wall: Bee thou our helper and wee care not what man may doe to vs. Giue vs a newe heart and a newe ſpirite: as thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs thy Commaundements, ſo make vs to walke in them. By theſe and ſuch like testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of thy moſt ſacred and holy worde, O good God, we learne thy diuine prouidence ouer man and all other thy creatures, and that thou doeſt

Thou art the being and beginning of all other things: Thou art ſilence, thou art quietneſſe, or resting, aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in thy ſelfe: that is, ſecret mouing, or ſecret action.

Thou art omnipotent: thou art all in all in thoſe thinges: whereof thou art the originall and cauſe in vertue and power.

Thou art the vniuerſal word remayning impaſſible and not turning: yet life is before the ſoule: for the life of the ſoule is of the power of liuing: Thou art the ſeede of all thinges that be in operation and made manifeſt: for nothing can come nor proceede from the Elements of parents nor of any ſeede, if thou (O Chriſt) worke not: if thou withdrawe thy working po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from things, they periſh immediatly.

<pb facs="tcp:4661:11"/>
Thou art the ſpirituall voyce of the manifeſt voyce or Sonne, as the Sonne is the voyce of the voyce in ſilence, therefore thou art of the Sonne and of the Father: yet but one voyce, one word: that is, one actiue power agreeing together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it maketh any thing to bee. Thou art the Spirit of God, the power of Chriſt: and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God is God: therefore, all three of one ſubstaunce: All thinges be in thee, as al things be by the Sonne, and of the Father. Thou (O God the holy Ghoſt) art (as it were) the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of God, and doeſt deuide the graces and miniſteries in the operation of life: ſo that by thee the firſt ſeedes of things are nouriſhed and ſustayned, and now alſo be continually moued: and firſt bring foorth rootes and blades: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtalkes, eares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> flowers, bloſſomes, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

knowe or vnderstande, and to liue, is all one: And becauſe they be one, and becauſe to bee, is all one with life and vnderstanding: (for true being can not bee without life and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: neither can life and vnderstanding be without ſuch being) therefore they be three, yet one ſubstaunce and one God. So the ſoule of man, in that it is a ſoule hath his being, giuing life and vnderſtanding, &amp; is there in one. And as God the Father is a Spirite ſubstancially, and the Sonne is a Spirite and motion moued, and working openly: ſo thou the holy Ghoſt art the ſecrete ſpirite and motion: Thou implanteſt and giueſt ſtrength to liue and to moue, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuſtayneſt all things that they may exiſt and liue, and alſo continue and be preſerued.

Much vnlike vnto that which is in man: which operation and tranſmutation, in trueth commeth of thee, (O God) and not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nature of heate: and whereby in ſeeking for like cure in ſuch defects, their Phiſicke muſt needes erre, in not ſeeking helpe at thy handes, nor praying to thee, nor giue thankes to thee: No more doth that heathniſh Philoſophie and Phiſicke acknowledge, that all ſeedes did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by thy diuine worde the power of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, of tranſplantation, the eſſence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: of which, all Philoſophie, Phiſicke, and Alchimie doth conſiſt: Therefore they muſt needes erre, both in the cauſe &amp; effects of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the great worlde and in the little world.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, becauſe the heathniſh Philoſophie doth not knowe out of thy worde, that thou (O God) haſt made all thinges in weight, number, and meaſure, therefore that Phiſicke doth not knowe the cauſe nor cure of thoſe deſeaſes that bee either originally or inflicted into the inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parte of man <hi>Anima</hi> or <hi>Limbus,</hi> nor to helpe them: which error <hi>Plato</hi> reproued in the

Greeke Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s long ago which <hi>Plato</hi> taught, that <hi>Anima curat corpus.</hi> And becauſe the heathniſh Philoſophie doth attribute the cauſe of thinges to dead qualities, of heate, cold, &amp;c. and not to the liuely vertues and powers in thinges, therefore that heathniſh Phiſicke ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by like dead qualities, to cure liuely and mechanicall ſpirites: And becauſe they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, that deſeaſes doe proceede of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall ſpirites and tinctures of impure ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ioyned to the pure by thy curſe, O iuſt God, therefore they ſeeke not their medicines in the pure ſeedes. And becauſe (O merciſull God) the heathniſh Phiſicke and the heathniſh Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie doth not acknowledge, that it is thy power and vertue that bringeth forth all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that growe, and that thy working power doth preſerue and maintaine all thinges: and that it is thy curing vertue that helpeth and cureth all deſeaſes, greeſes and infirmities, by ſuch meanes as it pleaſeth thee, or without meanes: therefore they cleaue faſt to their falſe imagined naturall cauſes and meanes of helpe, forgetting thee: whereby many of them become Atheists. And becauſe the heathniſh Phiſick of <hi>Galen,</hi> doth not knowe how thou (O God) haſt ordeyned all thinges in vnitie peace and concorde, therefore it ſeeketh the cure in duali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

To bee ſhort, becauſe (O moſt merciful God) the heathniſh Phiſick doth not knowe that the pureſt, beſt, and medicina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parte of each thing is in his Center, therfore it neither doth ſeeke, neither haue his fauorers learned, nor doe knowe, how to finde that pure parte, nor to ſeparate the pure from the impure: they cannot digeſt, nor make ripe that is rawe: they cannot chaunge ſower into ſweete: they cannot mittigate the lothſomneſſe of heates, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, ſmelles, coagulations, &amp;c. neither make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny medicine volatile: For which cauſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe they not knowe the power of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall ſpirites, by meanes of their ſubtiltie, fineſſe, pearcing, and moueableneſſe: neither do they knowe the fineſſe and pearcing, by meanes of ſeparation of thinges mixt with them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſeparaetion by meanes of digestion and circulation: wherefore, they doe not knowe how the mechanicall ſpirites of deſeaſes doe differ among them ſelues, and one from an other in power, pearcing, moueableneſſe, fineſſe, groſneſſe, in eaſie or vneaſie reſolution and alteration, and ſuch like tokens: whereby they are ignoraunt of the true cauſes of the pangs, fits, and paſſions of deſeaſes: and how and in what maner, bodies and partes of bodies doe differ one from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and among themſelues. For, ſeedes do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

that one of them can not be without the other.

This phiſicke is founded vpon a contrary Center to the other, therefore a falſe Center. For it conſiſteth in dualitie, diſcord and contrarietie. It maketh warre and not peace in mans bodie. It is not founded vpon the rule of Gods worde, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the authoritie of men reprobate of God, &amp; ſuch as were Idolaters and ignorant of the
<pb facs="tcp:4661:17"/>
trueth, conſiſting onely in God (whome they knewe not) and in his Chriſt the trueth it ſelf, whome <hi>Galene</hi> the prince of that phiſicke, in his workes hath blaſphemed of ſet purpoſe and by expreſſe wordes. And therefore he and the reſt his folowers, were ſeduſed with the ſpirit of contradiction and error. Yet their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers thinke wee doe them great wrong in ſaying, ſuch haue not ſayde nor written the trueth. As though Artes and Sciences may be poſſeſſed and exerciſed by mans braynes and inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions without God that made them. This may well be called blaſphemie. Herein <hi>Plato</hi> may be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t witneſſe againſt them, ſaying that no man can rightly vnderſtande and haue knowledge of things belonging to man, if he be ignorant in things parteyning to God: and doe not firſt know things diuine. For ſeeing Chriſt is the way by the which we ought to begin, proceede, goe onward and to the ende in all our actions, artes and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we ought to walke in this way, aſwell to attaine knowledge, health and life in this world, as life in the world to come. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Phiſitions not walking in this way, muſt needes erre and ſtray, not receiuing the key of wiſdome, which is ſcience of GOD himſelfe, who giueth wiſedome to the wiſe.
<pb facs="tcp:4661:18"/>
And ſeeing that all things which the Father hath, be his ſonnes Chriſtes: and ſeeing wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſcience be the riches of God, and all wiſedome is of him, and the power of God is wiſdome and ſcience, and the working power of GOD is Chriſt, and Chriſt is the trueth, therefore hee that ſwarueth from Chriſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the treaſures and riches of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſcience of God, neither is lead into the trueth by the trueth it ſelfe, therefore hath not trueth. And ſeeing Chriſt is life it ſelfe, which is the power of life to himſelfe and to al others, by whome all things are made and moue, and by whome life is in all things, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things celeſtiall to things in the heauens, ayer, water and earth, and to all matter in the world which hath life, and he is in the life, and is the power of the ſeede of all things, which become and proceede to be manifeſted and come to action, of whom euery body brought forth by touching, and coniunction doth grow and increaſe, and by whome all thinges are one, not as a heape of Corne or graine is one body, onely by lying together, but becauſe all partes doe hang together, and be as it were one chaine. For God, Chriſt, the holy Ghoſt, the ſoule, Angels and all corporall things is as it were this chaine, and the Father is the

principall life and cauſe of life, and al things in the world haue bèing and life of Chriſt, the life it ſelfe which giueth them to all things, and is in the life, and all in all. Who alſo is the light of the light, that is of God which ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the Center of all things that be, from whence with his vniuerſall eye, that is with the light of his ſubſtance, whereby he is their being, and life, doeth behold all things. For from the Center all things are ſeene at once, and alike. Therfore all perſwading ſpeaches and fayre and plauſible arguments, hauing great ſhewe and colour of reaſon, being deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of mans braines, or corrupted or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the leuen of mans inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions, ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from Chriſt or not reſting in him, or leauing nothing or very litle to him, in whoſe power and gouernement all things are: from whome health and life is deriued, in whom all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge are hidde, muſt needes be not onely confuſe and vayne, but alſo erronious, fooliſh, deceitfull, falſe and counterfeit, though they beare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo gay titles of Philoſophie, wiſedome or phiſicke. Such is the Philoſophie whereof S. <hi>Paule</hi> giueth vs warning, <hi>Col. 3.</hi> ſaying, beware leſt there be any man that ſpoyle you through the tradition of men, according to the
<pb facs="tcp:4661:19"/>
rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt: for in him dwelleth al the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed bodily. Such Philoſophie and phiſicke hang not together in the chaine aforeſaid, nor yet bee illuminated from the right Center, nor ſeene from the ſame, but be founded vpon diuers Centers, whereby their Circles doe cut one another, or touch ech other, therefore they doe not conſiſt in vnion, but are contrary to eche other. Such Center is the Center of dualitie, contrarietie and diſcord. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall thereof is worthely called <hi>Binari,</hi> the author of diuerſitie and contrarietie, which alwayes maketh ſedition and diſcord, as vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the band of concord. For concord is the vnion of diuers appetites of thoſe things that doe deſire, whereby they be of one minde. Therefore euery thing in the worlde doth ſo long indure and abide as long as it is one: but it dieth and is diſſolued as ſoone as it ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and leaueth to be one. Vnquietneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth in things, where <hi>Meum &amp; tuum,</hi> is become to be knowen in them: whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth griefe, which is a ſenſe or feeling that can not abide deuiſion or corruption.

<pb facs="tcp:4661:20"/>
which fell from vnitie, and made a dualitie &amp; contrarietie, enuying the ſtate of man, that perſiſted in vnitie, by captious ſophiſticall reaſon did perſwade him to eate of the Apple forbidden, whereby he brake vnitie, and fell headlong into diſobedience, dualitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie. Then was he ſpoyled of perfection, and of the health of his ſoule and body, and purchaſed to himſelf all the filthineſſe of vice, infirmitie and ſickneſſe. Alſo the Seedes of all things of the world, which by vertue of the word of God at the beginning, had receaued power of generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and multiplication, were perfect and ſound without corruption, aud did perſiſt in vnitie, vntill ſuch time as by the ſaid counſel of <hi>Binarius,</hi> man fell into diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and brake vnitie. Whereupon by the curſe of God impure Seedes were mingled with the perfect ſeedes, and did cleaue faſt to them, and doe couer them as a garment: and death was ioyned to life. So imperfection and impuritie, is ioyned to puritie, and death to life, ſickneſſe to health, not onely in man, but alſo in all liuing creatures, Hearbes, Plants, Mynerals: and in the fruites of the Firmament and ayer. By this meanes the Mynerals haue their ruſt and canker, which worke their deſtruction and ende. The vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,

And ſome grounde will make tranſplantation of one ſeede into an other, as from Wheate to Drake or Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell or ſuch like. The beaſtes alſo, Cattell and ſuch liuing creatures, becauſe they liue and be nouriſhed with the vegetables and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reſolutions, haue like impurities as they haue, according to the nature of the ſoyle whereupon they feede, &amp; of the water which they drinke. As appeareth by the Meadowes neere the Riuer <hi>Potheus</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ile of <hi>Candie,</hi> neere the Cittie <hi>Cortina,</hi> wherein groweth ſuch graſſe and hearbes, that the Cattell which be fedde therwith will haue no appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Spleene.

Cattell our forefathers did diligently vewe and ſearch before they layde the foundation of their houſes, townes or Cities, and that they did oftentimes, becauſe they would knowe whether thoſe parts were infected with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with their foode and by the often ſight of them, they iudged whether the Cattell fed there were holſome for their victuall and foode or no. And becauſe man receiueth his nouriſhment out of all the reſt, therefore hee hath infinite ſortes and kinds of diſeaſes, and therefore no other Creature hath ſo many meanes to bring it to ſickneſſe, nor to his death. But the foode and nouriſhments for mans body, though they haue in them ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, venemous, ſickly or medicinable proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet for all that, by reaſon of that mixture with their good ſeedes, as long as vnitie and concord is kept betweene them, they be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, ſeperated, reſolued and expelled out of mans body.

They finde in <hi>Arſenicke</hi> excellent medicine for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers griefes. So Lead hath in it remedie for thoſe diſeaſes which bee cauſed and bread in the Miners of Leade. Out of Tartar alſo is drawen excellent medicines for thoſe diſeaſes which come of the Tartar of Wine, and ſo forth of others. Therefore all diſeaſes do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of their impure Seedes, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſcience and knowledge of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

<pb facs="tcp:4661:22"/>
they be, are cured. It is ſo perfect, temperat, pure and incorruptible, that it is able to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, amende aud conſume all corruptions in mans body, euen as fire doth conſume the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure part, and ſeparateth it from the pure. It increaſeth the vitall ſpirites, and defendeth and preſerueth the body from corruption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſeparated from all corruptible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, from all qualities of heate, colde, &amp;c. It is not moyſt, could, drie nor hotte, but it is <hi>Aethereall,</hi> ſeparated from the inferiour Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and it is of an incorruptible nature in reſpect of the bodie from whome it is taken. And becauſe it is agreeable with our <hi>Anima</hi> (the <hi>Medium</hi> aforeſayd) it nouriſheth, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth and ſtrengtheneth it, whereby it is made able to digeſt, conſume and expell, all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and impedimentes of mans body, wherewith it is ouerwhelmed and let, that it was not able to exerciſe, performe and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his office, duetie and actions. If this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall liuely fire in man like to the <hi>Aethereal</hi> fire, were not continually nouriſhed, it would conſume it ſelfe and alſo that is ingendered of it. Therefore when nature in the ſtomacke hath ſeparated the pure from the impure, of meates which we eate, and of our drinke, hee doth expell the impure partes by their proper
<pb facs="tcp:4661:23"/>
paſſages, but it reteineth and keepeth the fine and pure bodies, that be the cariers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly vertues, for nouriſhments of two ſorts, the one is of all the members of the body, the which nouriſhment alſo is ſeparated into the nouriſhment of the three ſubſtanties, whereon we conſiſt. That is of our <hi>Salt, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi> The other which is the liquor of the heauenly <hi>Luna,</hi> is the nouriſhmeut of our naturall fire or <hi>Anima.</hi> But if this be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſtopped, or let of his operation or working by the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our bodies, then is it to be nouriſhed, holpen &amp; fortified with this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical and <hi>Aethereal</hi> medicine, in which is no groſſeneſſe, impuritie, nor any thing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. And our <hi>Anima</hi> liuely and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fire doth take and receiue to it this <hi>Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall</hi> medicine, vertue, and heauenly power like to it ſelfe, Whereby it is holpen, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and made able to bee deliuered from his impediments and lettes, and to conſume and expell ſuperfluitics of the bodie, whereby the body is compelled to agree and to bee changed into the like nature, voyde and clean from corruption and ſuperfluitie. Becauſe nature delighteth to bee ioined with her like, with peace rather then with warre, with vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and concord, rather then with diſcord. And
<pb facs="tcp:4661:23"/>
all naturall bodies deſire in their kindes to be perfected: which naturall deſire is the cauſe of all perfection. This Medicine <hi>Vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> among the Philoſophers and Chymicall Phyſitions, is called by diuers and many names, and couered vnder diuers parables &amp; darke kinde of ſpeaches, which brought the right vſe of this Arte into obliuion, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued worldly men, and brought many from rich eſtate to extreme beggery. For whereas the Philoſophers were louers of wiſdom and not of the world, nor of worldly riches, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to haue <hi>ternam atque quaternam bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem, vz. mentem ſanam in corpore ſano.</hi> Therefore they vſed this vniuerſall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, wherewith they diſgeſt and expell the corruptions out of their naturall bodyes, wherby the body was ſo prepared, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was made a perfect vnion betweene <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Anima &amp; Spiritus,</hi> and <hi>tranſitus ab extremo perfecto per medium ad imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum.</hi> Whereby the body was made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ſoule, whereof <hi>ſeperatio mentis à corpore</hi> might enſue. This ſurely they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted pureſt Golde and chiefeſt riches, as appeareth aſwell by other Philoſophers, as by them that write of this arte. But they that did write of this Medicine, did it ſo couertly,
<pb facs="tcp:4661:24"/>
that men thought that thoſe Philoſophers promiſed in their writinges mountaynes of Golde, and ſuch a Stone or fixed matter that could conuert and turne al other baſe metals into materiall Gold, wherein (I thinke) they were greatly deceiued. For though ſome ſay that they doe finde by experience, howe to take out of an ounce of Gold, a ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherewith they wyll turne an Dunce of Duick ſiluer or Leade into perfect Golde, yet they get nothing thereby, for by this meanes they make no more Gold, then that weight of Gold was, fto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they tooke their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, becauſe the medicin had no more goldiſh nature, then ſerued onely for an ounce, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could giue no more to others, but may ſlightly colour more metall, but then it is no Golde. The probable and likely reaſons of concockting, digeſting, purging and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the rawe and impure mettals, and ſo to make them pure by arte, as nature in the earth doth make perfect Golde and ſiluer, by conquocting and purging of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> becauſe arte is the folower of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath deceaued and vndon many men. But if there may be ſuch tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſmutation made into gold, as men imagine and hope for, yet I would aduiſe no man, to ſtudy this Arte to
<pb facs="tcp:4661:24"/>
that end, nor yet to aſſay or practiſe that way, leaſt he doe repent to late, as others haue don before. For in my opinion, the Philoſophers Gold is ſuch a temperate medicine as I haue declared, which in deede is <hi>Aſtrum</hi> ſeperated from his impediments and groſſe ſubſtance, and brought to ſuch puritic that it worketh in mans body, euen as the vertue and power of the Starres worke in any matter prepared therefore, by nature. For this cauſe the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers called the Mynerall diſeaſes and inſtrmities of mans body, by the name of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect metals, as of Leade or <hi>Saturne,</hi> of Coper or <hi>Venus,</hi> of Iron or <hi>Mars, &amp;c.</hi> like as the Aſtrologians doe, aſwell by reaſon of their place in mans body, as for their nature and properties. For there be double Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in mans body, the one proceding of his Balme which is his Gold, the other procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of nouriſhment. The excrements com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his Gold be called Myuerall excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the likeneſſe of the droſſe which is about the Gold, before it be fyned with <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> Theſe Mints are as it were Starres or Seedes, therefore they make influencies &amp; blomings, which are the fruites of Starres and Seedes. Therefore they call bealth and ſickneſſe in man, Minerals, that is the fruits
<pb facs="tcp:4661:25"/>
of man. Such diſeaſes in mans Gold are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Mynerall diſeaſes, which be purged one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Mynerall Medicines. For Mynerall excrements are onely purged with Minerall medicins, which conſiſt in the vniuerſall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine and in the tinctures of Gold, <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> &amp; <hi>Antimony,</hi> which purge mans Balme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and remooueth it from all filth, which being purged, all other filth will eaſely be voyded. But if theſe myneral excrements be not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, then they hinder the operation and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of mans Gold or Balme, into the three <hi>Principia,</hi> of mans body aforeſayd. Whereof followeth their corruption, and of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Salts in man, followe Boyles, Vlcers, Impoſtumes &amp; griefes not outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned, moſt paynefull, &amp;c. So that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had any of theſe infirmities, was brought to perfect temper by this vniuerſall medicine, then they ſaid, that thoſe imperfect metals were turned into Golde. And by this meanes, was this great treaſure of medicine hidden, ſo that very fewe Phiſitians and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Philoſophie did vnderſtand it, though the Philoſophere themſelues in their writings exhorted al men that did reade their bookes, that they ſhould not credit the bare letters of their writings, but ſhould rather
<pb facs="tcp:4661:25"/>
make an allegorical expoſition thereof. This ſeeking of materiall golde by this Arte, did bring it out of the right vſe of phiſick, and did (as I ſaid) bryng many rich folke to extreme beggery, whereby they grewe to ſophiſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mettalles, and ſo when they had waſted their owne ſubſtance they proceeded to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe deceite, lying and deuiſes to bring others into like ſtate &amp; caſe vnto them ſelues, which mooued princes in their countreyes to make Lawes agaynſt Multiplyers as they were termed.</p>
               <p>The auncient Chymicall Phyloſophers and Phiſitions, did vſe ſuch darke ſpeeches and parables in their writings, becauſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes are to be reueyled onely to the Godly, and vnto the children of doctrine and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and vnto the wiſe, therefore they did write vnto ſuch, that the ſecrets might be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from the vngodly, fooliſh, ſlouthfull and vnthankefull hypocrites, whereby the wiſe and diligent with trauayle and labour might attaine to the vnderſtanding thereof, as one of them ſayde, it is not meete to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for a man, a Pigion, and to roſt it for him and alſo to put it vnto his mouth, or chawe it for him. The auncient <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did vſe no letters in holy and ſecret matters, but pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="tcp:4661:26"/>
figures and charects grauen of things and beaſtes, leaſt the Secrets and myſteries ſhould be prophaned among the vulgare peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Such was the maner of the wiſe men of the oldeſt age, to deliuer the profund and deep inquiſition and ſearch of wiſedom, by allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories of ſecret Letters, and by Myſteries. Therefore all the wrytings of the auncient Philoſophers and Poets are full of Riddles, darke ſpeeches and parables, to auoyde the contempt of the common people. Such were the often teaching of our ſauiour Chriſt. So in the Primatiue Church, thoſe that were <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techymeni</hi> and <hi>Energymeni,</hi> and thoſe that had penance enioyned them, might heare the Pſalmes and the reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but they might not be preſent at the miniſtration of the Sacraments, nor at the holy workes which were done afterward, but they onely were preſent which were thought worthy.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4661:27"/>
diſeaſes, and in confirming and fortifying the power of our inwarde and naturall Balme. This medicin of <hi>Ternarii</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ties, which are to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in euery body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is to ſay in <hi>Sal, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercuri.</hi> For as eche body is compounded of theſe three, ſo they be cauſes of all diſeaſes and not humors. In theſe three conſiſteth all mans health and ſickneſſe, as long as they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, the body is in health, but as ſoone as they diſagree, and vnitie is broken betweene them, and if any of them be exalted or breake vnitie the body is ſicke. Therefore there be three generall kinds of diſeaſes, and eche of them haue their eſpeciall ſortes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, as there be ſundry ſorts of <hi>Sal, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and <hi>Mercuri</hi> of diuers and ſundry na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. There be like wiſe three kinds of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine required, and eche kinde of ſondry nature to preſerue or reſtore mans body to health. So that if any of theſe three be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to much and paſſe their meane, or breake vnitie, he muſt be amended and reduced to perfect ſtate by his owne kinde, and not by a contrary kind, by way of traſmutation. If the diſeaſe be mixed or compounde of any of theſe (for there is no diſeaſe almoſt but is mixed by ſome meanes, yet it hath one of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:4661:27"/>
three that is chiefe) then muſt ſuch diſeaſe bee holpe with oue or two of theſe taken out of ſome other fit body or ſubſtance. <hi>per propriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad ſuum innatum,</hi> becauſe nature cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As long therefore as the three ſubſtanties afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, doe abide in vnitie peace and concord in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body, and in their owne proper degrees, without pride doing their office, their body continueth in health. But becauſe nothing is perpetual nor continueth in eſtate long, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong creatures conſiſting of fleſhe, therefore by reaſon of the diuerſitie of the giftes, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power which be in them, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the impure ſeedes ioyned with our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, they abide not long in their office, they abide not long in their degrees, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themſelues, they breake vnitie peace and concorde, the badd is ſeperated from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and mixture of the good: which breach of vnitie and ſeperation doth ſhew thoſe ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and deſeaſes in mans body, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by reaſon of the vnitie concorde and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient mixture could not breake forth appeare nor be made manifeſt. The which thinges as they come to paſſe in man, that is <hi>Mycrocoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4661:28"/>
ſo doe they likewiſe in the great world. Which therefore is called <hi>Mycrocoſmus</hi> or the little world, becauſe after God had made all thinges in the great world of nothing, he made man in whom ſpiritually be conteyned all thoſe thinges that is the properties of all thoſe thinges which bee really in the greate worlde, as the auncient Philoſophers haue taught by theſe and like wordes, <hi>homo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliter habet naturam omnium tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum.</hi> Therefore that this <hi>Mycrocoſmus</hi> may bee inwardly knowne to the Phiſition, he had neede to haue <hi>lumen naturae,</hi> that is the knowledge of thinges in the great world, how all of them doe grow increaſe be chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and dye, whereby he may by the inſight of his minde vnderſtand the inward and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den nature of man. Wherefore he that would perfectly knowe what inward thinges be in man, he had need to compare the vertues and properties of the naturall things in the great worlde with the inward thinges of man. As you may perceiue by wine (for this purpoſe) which as long as his ſpirite doth abide in him mingled with the tarte vineger in vnitie and peace, the wine is ſounde pleaſaunt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but as ſoone as the ſpirite of the wine is ſeperated from the mixture of the ſharpe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger,
<pb facs="tcp:4661:28"/>
then the vineger doth appeare is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and may bee taſted. Likewiſe when the vineger is ſeperated from the tartar, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth the tartar appeare. So is it in all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges when they growe to corruption putrifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſſolution, then the good that was in them is ſeperated from the bad ſeedes, the bad doe no longer abide in obedience of the good, but haue broken peace, concord, vnitie and obedience, whereby thinges doe growe to corruption &amp; death. This auncient Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Phiſicke doth teach ſuch ſeperation of the good from the bad out of all thinges, and to make them manifeſt to viſible and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experience, which the Ethnicke Phiſicke hath nothing to doe with, nor his followers hath any ſkill thereof, yet they barke and bite againſt this ſkill through their ignoraunce.</p>

Likewiſe al medicines miniſtred into the body, ought to bee ſuch as haue propertie to bring the ſicke body to vnitie and concord: therfore like is to be miniſtred to that which is like in our nature, which order doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende vpon the true Center of vnion. And contrary thinges are not to be cured by their contraries, vnlike to our nature, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding is from the Center of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, contrary to the Center of vnitie, and therefore a falſe Center. For ſeeing that all thinges doe hang together in one chayne (as is aforeſayd) &amp; man is partell of that chaine,
<pb facs="tcp:4661:29"/>
and <hi>Mycrocoſmus</hi> hauing in it the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the great world ſpiritually, therefore there is in the greate worlde, that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the nature of man, in what parte ſoeuer it be weakened, or not able to reſiſt his enemy, which becauſe of the conueniency and agreement with our nature, doth deſire to be ioyned with it. Wherefore it muſt be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in due order, fineſſe and proportion, it is able to fortifie, comfort and ſtrengthen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and our naturall balme, and it wilbe as it were a weapon for nature againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or diſeaſe, whereby nature by him ſelf wil become and be his owne phiſition. Therefore the Phiſition ought to miniſter ſuch things, which nature in the place afflicted doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the cure that is like to it ſelfe, and not contrary qualities, ſuch as will make peace in the body and not warres, vnitie and not diſcord, ſuch as will helpe nature and not trouble it, and will ſtrengthen it and not weaken it. Such medicines for the loue and liking they haue to our nature afflicted haue a deſire to be ioyned and coupled together, as a hongry and thirſtie man deſireth meate or drinke, which nouriſh well. And as one friend coueteth and deſiereth the company of his deere frends long abſent, which natural loue
<pb facs="tcp:4661:30"/>

And ſuch like are to be ioyned to their like in right <hi>Anotomie.</hi> We ought not to ſeeke helpe in things contrarie and repugnant: who findeth medicine for the Liuer in <hi>Gratian, Agarick,</hi> or <hi>Colocinthis,</hi> or who findeth medicin for the Gall in, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Hony, Sugar</hi> or <hi>Polipody?</hi> therefore like are to be ioyned with their like in right <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,</hi> Miniſtering of contraries perteyneth rather to diet then to medicin, and they may ſerue to mittigate the payne, but not to take away the roote of the diſeaſe. Humors and qualities, to the which the folowers of the Ethnikes doe ſo much cleane, and in the whiche they ſpende their ſtudy and labour, are but onely dead accidents, without power of lyfe. They be conditions, signes, tokens, and as it were onely flowers and colours of diſeaſes and not the very matter, cauſe, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or nature of the diſeaſe, they are cauſed and not the cauſes. Wherefore when they go about to cure the humor or qualitie, they fiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the payne and griefe, but they leaue the diſeaſe vncured. For the ſignes of thyngs are not the matter or ſubſtance it ſelfe. Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:4661:30"/>
he that wil be a perfect Phiſition, muſt know eche diſeaſe by his right <hi>Anatomie,</hi> that is to ſay, by the matter, property and nature of the true ſubſtance of the diſeaſe, as which of the three ſubſtances haue broken vnitie, and not by the ſigne of it. Alſo he muſt haue the right <hi>Anatomie</hi> of all diſeaſes, and of all naturall thynge before his eyes, ſo ſhall he apply to eche infirmitie his apt remedy. For by the concordance and agreement of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the herbe or other naturall thyng for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and of the diſeaſe, the Phiſition know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what things haue affinity together, and ought to be coupled and ioyned together in vnitie. For the right <hi>Anatomy</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth not in cutting of the body, but in the knowledge of the Amitie, concord and nature of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall externe things, with man, which doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, imbrace and receaue eche other, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord together in mutuall agreement, in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, power, propertie and eſſenſe, to defend nature. So that by the right concord of theſe two <hi>Anatomies,</hi> vz. of the diſeaſe and of the medicine, true cure doth proceede and growe, whereby is declared, that lyke are to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ther like, &amp; like are cured with their lyke: and that all health conſiſteth in vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and agreement, in which of neceſſitie

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>y theſe aforeſayd it doeth appeare how the medicines of the auncient Phiſicke doe diſagree with thoſe medicines which be commonly in vſe, which be conteined vnder the third kinde of Medicine called <hi>Binarii</hi> or <hi>vulgaris,</hi> For theſe medicines do more agree with the body (becauſe bodyes are nouriſhed with bodyes) then with <hi>Anima</hi> wherein <hi>Fons vitae</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth. This medicine helpeth little to long life, or to the reliefe of <hi>Anima,</hi> if it be feeble or hindred in his worke. Becauſe theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines bee miniſtred with their bodies, the worke vertue and power in them that ſhould do good is hindered: ſo that it doth litle good, eſpecially in partes of the body, a farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Stomache. For all things that ſhoulde ſerue for medicine, ſhould be purged firſt from
<pb facs="tcp:4661:31"/>
their groſſe ſubſtance, becauſe whileſt the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly vertues be wrapped, hidden and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the matter or ſubſtance of their bodies, they abyde and cleaue faſt to them, &amp; can not eaſely be parted a ſunder, vnleſſe nature haue help thereunto prepared by Arte, which may ſeparate the pure from the impure, otherwiſe the working of that heauenly vertue is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. For it is the vertue of eche thing that is medicinable and not the body. So that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparation of the pure from the impure muſt needes be made in the ſtomache, if it be not made before, becauſe euery thing hath his corruption ioyned with it, and becauſe the vertues of eche thing be ſmall in quantitie, &amp; tyed and clogged with the maſſe of his body, (as is aforeſayd) it is better this ſeperation be made before the medicine come neere to the ſtomache then after, in the ſicke mans Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mache which is to weake to make ſuch ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides this, by ſuch groſſe and rawe medicine, the patient receiueth rather nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment then medicine, centrarie to their owne rules, <hi>Omne medicamentum quod tranſit in alimentum, ceſſant eſſe medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</hi> For when the medicine miniſtred with his body or ſubſtance, commeth into the Stomach, it is ſeparated into treble nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:4661:32"/>
that is of our <hi>Salt, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and into double excrement. So that when theſe medicines be rightly conſidered and compared together, there ſeemeth to bee as great diuerſitie betweene the rawe and groſſe medicines, and thoſe that be purged by fire, as is betwixt the true doctrine of Chriſt and the Romiſh doctrine, For as the doctrine of Chriſt for the health of the Soule, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſpirituall, and the holy Scriptures of God do inſtruct the ſoule of man and ſpeake to it, whereby the euill affections and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and filthy workes of the body be taken away, and amendement of life foloweth. So do theſe auncient medicines for the helth of the body conſiſt in heauenly vertues, which are to be miniſtred and ioyned with the liue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Spirits of mans body, that they may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be fortifyed and made ſtrong, or rectified &amp; brought to vnitie, whereby foloweth the help and cure of the diſeaſes of the body. And as the Romiſh religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is mixed with impurities, &amp; ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in outward ceremonies &amp; traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, corporal exerciſes which be lets to the works of the ſpirite, whyleſt it is occupied about them. So theſe corrporall and groſſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which ſerue for the body, conſiſt in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyly groſſe and rawe ſubſtances, whereby the
<pb facs="tcp:4661:32"/>
worke of the heauenly vertues be let and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. And theſe bodies doe reſiſt digeſtion, which is occupied about them, by meanes whreof the weake and faint partes that deſire reliefe, can not drawe to them theſe vertues for their ſuccour, being bound and faſt tyed to their groſſe ſubſtance. And euen as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh religion teacheth that in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> there is no ſubſtance of bread and wine, but onely accidents, and that our bodies be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the accidents of the Sacrament, euen ſo the Ethnicke Phiſitions and their folowers doe teache, that accidents, vz. heate, cold, &amp;c. be cauſes of al diſeaces. And that by them diſeaſes are cured, and health reſtored, whereby they attribute <hi>vim vitae,</hi> to accidents &amp; dead qualities which are cauſed, raiſed and ſtirred vp, by other things, &amp; bee them ſelues onely <hi>Simptomata morborum.</hi> So that in curing thoſe accidents and qualities, they doe as if a man would goe about to ſtop the flame and ſmoke of the fire, and leaue the hot coles burning.</p>

               <p>2 The Ethnicke Philoſophers aſcribe the efficient chiefe and principall cauſe of thinges vnto nature, which is in them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they tye and bind God to the ſecond cauſe, and take away his prouidence ouer his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>The Chymicall Philoſophers affirme, that all nature of things be onely inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſes, not working of them ſelues nor principally, but depending wholly vpon the power and commaundement of God.</p>
               <p>3 The Ethnicke Phiſitions doe ſeeke with mortall medicines (that is to ſay) ſuch medicines as haue corruption ioyned with immortalitie, whereof muſt needes followe diſſolution, whereof commeth death, to cure and helpe the heauenly and <hi>Aethereall</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in mans body.

So that it appeareth that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Ethnicke Phiſitions in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of their medicines, do as if they would go about to reſtore a fire, where is remayning a fewe ſparkles, vnder greene wood, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on more greene wood, thinking therby to make the ſparkles to kindle and burne, but they will not put more fire to the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, nor yet vſe any meanes to blowe then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make them burne.

wherein he dwelleth, and not to the man that is ſicke.</p>
               <p>4 The Etnick Phiſitions lay their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation vpon the falſe Center of <hi>Binarii</hi> and <hi>dualitie,</hi> which is the Roote of contrarietie diſcorde and diſſention, therefore moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they teache that contrary things are to be cured by their contraries.</p>

But this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine the folowers of the Ethnikes can not digeſt, becauſe they knowe not the three ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanties aforeſayd, though by arte they may be made manifeſt out of eche thing to the eye and touche: neither doe they knowe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance and agreement of the three in one, nor their exaltation.</p>
               <p>5 The followers of the Ethnicke Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be ruled by the doctrine and principles of <hi>Galen, Auicen,</hi> and ſuch other.</p>
               <p>The Chymicall Phiſition in his phiſicke firſt and principally reſpecteth the worde of of God, and acknowlegeth it to be his gifte, next he is ruled by experience, that is to ſay, by the knowledge of three ſubſtanties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of eche thing in the great world and man alſo conſiſteth, that is to ſay, by their ſeuerall <hi>Sal, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> &amp; by their ſeueral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, vertues and natures, by palpable and viſible experience. And when he knoweth the three ſubſtanties and all their properties in the great worlde, then after ſhall he knowe them in man. For man is <hi>Microcoſmus</hi> for this cauſe, that hee might haue the good and bad ſickneſſe &amp; health of the great world. The right way to come to this knowled is to trie
<pb facs="tcp:4661:36"/>
all things by the fire: for the fire teacheth the ſcience and arte of Phiſicke. It is the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions maiſter: it teacheth the Phiſition expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, by digeſting, fixing, exalting, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, reducing, compounding, and ſuch like. By this experience ſhall he find out the three ſubſtanties of all creatures in the worlde, of what nature, facultie, propertie and condition they be of. So ſhall he knowe all things by viſible and palpable experience, ſo that the true proofe and tryal ſhal appeare to his eyes &amp; touched with his hands.

<pb facs="tcp:4661:37"/>
vſe his eyes in thoſe thinges that hee to bee ſeene. This is the ſure way as one of their owne coate ſayth, it is in vayne to leaue the vſe and helpe of ſences for reaſons ſake. And an other of the ſame ſtamp, ſayth: Experience is the mayſteries of thinges.</p>
               <p>6 The followers of the Ethnickes in the nature of Simples, as Hearbes, Plantes, Rootes, &amp;c. father themſelues vpon <hi>Gallen, Meſue, dioſcorides, &amp;c.</hi> and ſay it is written that in their Bookes.

By this meanes bee found eſpeciali thinges euen of one kinde only to differ from an other of the ſame kind. As the Roſine of one Countrey is not of that nature as the Roſine of an other Countrey. Wheate that groweth vpon ſome grounde hath the propertie of Garlicke, or ſome other
<pb facs="tcp:4661:37"/>
propertie according to the nature of the ſoyle or grounde either wholeſome or vnwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. And the things growing vpon Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines doe differ from their like, or from thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ſame kind growing on the plaine. And generally ech Countrey moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath his proper deſeaſe (beſides them that be cauſed of Influencies) by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foode which wee receiue for nouriſhment, either of the vegetables which receiue their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reſolued ſpirites of the Myne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles, or of the Animals which be nouriſhed of the vegetables, in the ſoyle wherupon they feede. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that if a Phiſition do follow the opinion of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of other Nations, or be cunning onely in his owne Countrey and Region, he ſhal erre in his medicine. So that Nature made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by fire and the right applying it to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, maketh a Phiſition according to this Arte.

               <p>7 The Ethnickes themſelues that write

Thereby he learneth what man is, what the medicine is, howe they agree in right Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

So that experience and practiſe ought not to proceede of ſpeculation, but ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be deriued out of practiſe.

So that probabilitie of reaſon onely againſt true and perfect proofe, found out by practiſe and experience, maketh the folowers of the Ethnikes to ſay, that all medycins prepared by this Arte, doe get a fretting corroſiue and hurtful property by the fire. For it by the fire the medicin doth get at the firſt any euill cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſiueneſſe, yet by operation and by degrees of working (to the ſkilful knowen) it ſhal not only loſe that &amp; haue it cleane take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, but alſo it may bee brought to the higheſt degree of operation and working, and made moſt perfect like to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Aethereall fyre, which nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and quickeneth mans body, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is to conſume all corruptions, cauſed hy the elementall fyre, and with his bateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to reſtore the naturall moyſture which was conſumed by the Elementall Fyre.

For he ſelleth all things to vs for the price of our labour: &amp; he willeth vs we ſhould eate our bread in the labour and ſwette of our face.

And they that be in the vpper globe are made mighty and vehement, and harder to be remooued then thoſe that be in the lower globe. Wherfore thoſe <hi>Alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> diſeaſes of the lower Globe, may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Arcana</hi> of vegetables, but if they be in the vpper Globe, they require medicins of higher degrees of preparation. Likewiſe if the cauſe of the diſeaſe proceede of the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals or metals, they muſt be cured with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana</hi> of Mynerals, becauſe ſuch will not
<pb facs="tcp:4661:46"/>
yeeld to <hi>Arcana</hi> of vegetables, that is of hearbes and rootes, &amp;c. But if the diſeaſe bee cauſed by influencies of the heauens, neather of the other <hi>Arcana</hi> will ſerue, but they are to be cured by A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ronomy and influencies. But thoſe Diſeaſes and griefes that come by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall meanes, will not be holpen by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes aforeſayde, but by ſupernaturall meanes. Likewiſe the agreement of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin with the diſeaſe in one degree, is thus by thoſe Phiſitions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that the Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine that hath the pure onely ſeparated from the impare, may agrée in one degree, with the diſeaſes of the loweſt degree, of leaſt danger, and in places of leaſt parrell, and of leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. And Medicins that haue that pure body ſublymed, and a purer thereby ſeparated from it, may agree with diſeaſes more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, of longer continuance, &amp; in place more perilous. And medicins ſo ſublymed, after diſtilled in the Sunne, may agree in degree with diſeaſes, moſt ſtubburne, and of longeſt continuance. For vnleſſe the Mecicine doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the diſeaſe in oue degree, he can not preuayle, becauſe the weaker can not drawe, conſume, nor expell the ſtronger. In this ſort doth the Chimycall Phiſition proceede from medicins fyne and pure, to purer, fyner, and
<pb facs="tcp:4661:46"/>
moſt excellent, and maketh choyſe of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicins as occaſion ſerueth, by the reaſon of the cauſe, place, vehemencie and continuance of the diſeaſe. Such medicins doe not moulde and putrifie, but will continue in the vertue, a mans lyfe. Furthermore, by operation and working according to this Arte, you ſhall ſee with your eye, and perceyue the reaſon, why one diſeaſe is vehementer then an other, why in one place it is more painefuller then in an other, why in continuance of time the diſeaſe is harder to bee remooued then at the firſt: why ſome diſeaſes be vehement and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long: why ſome be ſuddenly vehement and ſeone gonne: Why other bee long in growing: why ſome be extreame: why ſome be not, why in ſome places of the bady they he more eaſely remooued, then in an other, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſhalbe led into the knowledge of that parte of the body wherein the roote of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe lurketh.</p>
               <p>17 The folowers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ethnikes in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Vrin.

               <p>The Chymicall Phiſition affirmeth that ſuch iudgement of vrine is monſtrous, and that the right iudgement is to bee had after due ſeperation thereof be made by fire: ſo ſhal he ſee the matter of ech deſeaſe and his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and touch it with his hande, whereby he ſhalbe able to giue a perfect iudgement if he bee able to iudge as becommeth a Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and a Phyſition.

               <p>18 The followers of the Ethnickes, to purge ſpirituall tyncturs of deſeaſes, doe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter rawe and indigeſted medicines, which drawe from the ſtomacke and other partes thinges neceſſary for them, aſwell as excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And alſo ſuch Purgations do withall purge <hi>humidum radicale,</hi> and thereby doe ſhake the body and weaken it, and leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them much venenoſitie, for lacke of due ſeperation.

And if they doe not followe thoſe olde receiptes of their Authors, but make newe medicines of themſelues, yet they haue none other ſkill, but to trie them, and make their experiment vpon men.</p>

But it ſhould ſeeme by that <hi>Plato</hi> hath written, and <hi>Plinie</hi> alſo, that their Phyſicke was altogether Surgery.

                  <pb facs="tcp:4661:56"/>
in the preſence of his two ſonnes <hi>Machaon</hi> and <hi>Podalirius:</hi> and as they two did to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nataus</hi> whom <hi>Pandar</hi> wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded there, becauſe they thought deſeaſes did commonly come to man, either by externall hurtes, as by pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, cutting, or bruſing, or els did chaunce to him by euill dyet, lacke of exerciſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill order of his liuing: therfore they thought it neceſſary to helpe them that were ſo hurt. But they thought as long as men vſed good dyet, exerciſe, and good order of life, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in health, and prolonged their life at eaſe. Therefore <hi>Phocilides</hi> vſed to ſay, that the liuely vertue and power of the body muſt be exerciſed whileſt wee bee able. But <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, that <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and others were of this opinion, that he which would not liue in the appointed and accuſtomed rule and order of life, but by incontinencie of liuing, did fall into deſeaſes, was not profitable for himſelfe nor for others, and that the Arte of Phyſicke had nothing to doe with ſuch, nor ſerued for them: and that ſuch ought not to bee cured, though they were richer then <hi>Midas.</hi> And that it was againſt reaſon to thinke that men ſhould neede Phyſicke for Rewmes, Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and for the griefes of the ſwellings of the inwarde ſpirites, which come through
<pb facs="tcp:4661:56"/>
delicacy of liuing and ſlouth, and lacke of good order in liuing, and therefore proueth that thoſe deſeaſes were not knowne to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haon</hi> and <hi>Podalirius,</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Troye. Aſclepyades</hi> alſo the Phyſition ſayd, that health conſiſteth in abſtinence of meate and drinke, and in ryding, walking, and running. Then reſteth to conſider what maner medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines they vſed in Surgery. I doe reade in <hi>Plato</hi> in the 31. Booke and 3. Dialogue <hi>de iuſto,</hi> that when <hi>Pandarus</hi> had wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalaus</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Troye,</hi> after <hi>Mahon</hi> and <hi>Podalirius</hi> had dried vp the blood of his woundes with their handes, they did anoynt the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with mitigating Balmes or Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and preſcribed him a certayne order and forme of dyet in his meate and drinke. Wherby it appeareth, that the maner of their Surgery, was like vnto that of the Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Surgions, whoſe maner is with Oyles and Balmes to pacifie nature, and to keepe the wounde defended from accidents, and to leaue the cure to nature which is able then to be his owne Surgion. And more playnly to proue their doctrine, one <hi>Petrus Haſardus</hi> is ſufficient witneſſe, who in his French E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle before the great Surgery of <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> writeth that as he trauailed through the

And that it may appeare, that the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick which <hi>Hypocrates</hi> had learned, was not ſo precious, nor kept ſo ſecret in one kinred, line and family, as we are borne in hand, thou muſt vnderſtand gentle Reader, that <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 29 booke, <hi>cap. 1.</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> in his 8. booke doe write, that from the time of <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> Phiſicke laye hidden and couered in moſt thicke darkeneſſe, vntill the time of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> which did bryng it to light by this meanes. For whereas it was the maner and faſhion of thoſe that were cured and deliuered from any ſickneſſe, to write in the Temple of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> which was in <hi>Cous,</hi> the maner &amp; forme of their remedie, and cure thereof, to the ende, that the like diſeaſes might be by them cured, <hi>Hypocrates</hi> did write out theſe Medicins, and out of them began Phiſicke.

<pb facs="tcp:4661:60"/>
brought them into order. Out of the which afterward he drewe Aphoriſmes and briefe Rules of Phiſicke. Beſides this, it hath bene ſayd of ſome, that <hi>Hypocrates</hi> for enuie that he bare to <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> did ſet a fire his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo conſumed the writings of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Phiſitians. And beſides them that bee folowers with them, it appeareth by <hi>Sudas</hi> and other writers, that before <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> diuers did write of Phiſicke, though we haue not their works extant among vs, as <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Caliphon,</hi> which was <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> his Prieſt. <hi>Nichomachus</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Machaon,</hi> did write ſixe bookes of phiſicke and one of Philoſophie.

<pb facs="tcp:4661:61"/>
might well be called the Sonnes of Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as is before declared. But to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould any man write darkely of that Phiſicke, which is ſo groſſe? whoſe medicins be ſo common to olde wiues, and men and women of all ſorts.

<pb facs="tcp:4661:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whichr <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſayeth bee barberuſſe Tnrckes and Mahumetans. His meaning herein was that all Arts and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie ought of neceſſetie to haue their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in light of the holy Scriptures as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in the 119. leafe of that book and in the 38. leafe and in the 45. leafe, and in the 48. &amp; 84, leafe of the ſame booke, he plainly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and expreſſeth. And to be ſhort in his book <hi>de Vermibus cap 5.</hi> he hath theſe words: In diuinitie eſpecially in the books of Salamon, Prophets, and in the new teſtament al Artes both naturall and ſupernaturall be conteined, out of them we may learne them. For in them is hidden the high treaſure of the whole world though it be hidden from the ſimple men: And becauſe the originall &amp; cauſe of all creatures doeth proſede onely from God, therefore God onely is to be ſought for, in him onely Arte doeth conſiſt, he onely is to bee conſidered, of hym and his worde all Arte is to be learned. Wherefore <hi>Paracelſus</hi> conſidering that the blindneſſe among vs Chriſtians, in the true foundation of Philoſophie (whiche ſeeke it of the Heathen whiche bee onely geſſers at the trueth beeyng not taught by Gods worde) is as great, as the ignoraunce of the <hi>Athenians</hi> was in the tyme of Sainct <hi>Paule,</hi> in the true
<pb facs="tcp:4661:73"/>
worſhipping of God, therefore be calleth vs <hi>Athenians:</hi> And therefore he layeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Philoſophie in the light of the holy Scripture. The effect of that doctrine which Saincte <hi>Paule</hi> did preache to the <hi>Athenians Acts 17.</hi> was that God made the worlde and all thinges therein &amp;c. ſeeyng he giueth to all life and breath and all things: And hath made of one bloude all mankynd to dwell in all the face of the earth and hath aſſigned the tymes whiche weare ordained before, and the bands of their habitation, that they ſhould ſeeke the Lord, if ſo be they myght haue groped after hym, and found him, though doubtleſſe he bee not farre from euery one of vs: for in hym we liue, moue and haue our beeyng, as alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of your owne Poets haue ſaide &amp;c. how the doctrine of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> doeth agree with that of Saincte <hi>Paule,</hi> appereth by that folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth: For in the ſame booke, the firſt wordes of the ſame treatiſe be theſe, All thinges are of God, therfore the power &amp; vertue of herbes be of God. The bringing forth of the Herbes is natural, but the bringing forth of his vertue is not naturall: For as God is not naturall, neither be the vertues naturall. All power and vertue is increate, becauſe God is without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng increate. For all vertues and power
<pb facs="tcp:4661:73"/>
weare in God of heauen and earth, when the ſpirite of God was carried vppon the waters, euen ſo likewiſe when the heauen and earthe ſhall periſhe, all vertues ſhall returne to God againe, becauſe they had no beginning, but the viſible matter of ech thyng is increat for they were not in the begynnyng with God, for he created them of nothing, &amp; endued them with life and vertue.</p>
               <p>Sainct <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his thirde booke <hi>De trinitate,</hi> hath the like doctrine, ſaiyng, <hi>virtus dei in terius operatur iſta creanda,</hi> againt, he ſaieth, <hi>Deus interius creans &amp; formaus.</hi> Alſo the firſt words of the prologe of the ſame booke, be theſe. There be two ſortes of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of thinges, one is of the creatures, as of Heauen. Spirites &amp;c. the other procedeth &amp; commeth to vs emediately from God, whiche is the true influence. The firſt is Nature it ſelfe, and whatſoeuer God hath put in it. Alſo in his booke <hi>de occulta Philoſophia,</hi> he ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teh: The vertue &amp; power of God is the cauſe and originall of all creatures, and gouerneth all things: therefore we ought not to atribute and / giue the power of God to cratures, as the heathen do and, their folowers. And in the ſaid booke dedicated to the <hi>Athenians, fol. 13.</hi> he ſaieth the vertue and power of Stars, Herbes
<pb facs="tcp:4661:74"/>
&amp;c. be of God, yea, the vertue &amp; power is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only of God to al thinges, wherfore he calleth <hi>Annimam</hi> and the ſecretts of Nature which be in <hi>Miſteriis,</hi> whereby a man is healed and ſuche like <hi>Magnalia dei,</hi> becauſe thei procede onely from God. And the influen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

they were ſeperated and deuided in offices, life, eſſenties, and beyngs: We neede not here to imagine that theſe did proceede of <hi>Chaos,</hi> but out of the treaſures of the diuine wiſedome: but euen as the inuizible vertue in a carnell hath a might, ſcience, and power, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to worke and bryng forth diuerſe and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie effectes, which in winter doe not appere but lye quiet, and in appointed and due tyme, bringeth forth the roote, bodie, pith, barke, and bowe, twige, leafe, fruite, and all theſe things, belongyng to the Tree, and deuideth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateth them in iuſt and true order, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, forme, ſigure, and qualitie,: So in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng were all the vertues vnited in God, their fountaine, vntill ſuch tyme as by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the word, they were commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to doe their ſeuerall officies in the worldly miniſte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie.
