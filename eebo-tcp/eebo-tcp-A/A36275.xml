         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear and Tender Children;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHO are of the Seed and Off-ſpring of the Righteous, a <hi>Salutation</hi> of my endeared Love is to you, and my Prayers to the God of Love and Father of Mercy are for you, that he may raiſe you up as Living Monuments of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: and that you that have been brought up in the Way of Truth by your Parents or Friends (that have had a godly Care over you, to diſcharge their Duty, in Love to God, and to your Immortal Souls) may come into the Truth and Fear of God, that they may have cauſe to ſound out Living Praiſes to the God of our Lives on your behalf; for the Cry of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is to the Lord for their Children, as for their own Souls; and as they are near and dear unto them, ſo their Deſire to the Lord is, That they may be near and dear unto him, and that he would give them an Inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified; which is far better than any Outward Portion or Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that they can leave to you, and will ſtand by you when all Outward Riches will fail you: for though you are Young and Tender in Years, you know not how ſoon the Meſſenger of Death may come to call you; then there can be no Reſiſting of that Power that ſummoneth you in, and to Judgment calls you. Oh! therefore whilſt you have a Day, prize it; for Time is very precious to Old and Young; for the Redemption of the Soul is precious. Oh! therefore, dear Children, Remember your Creator in the dayes of your Youth, and anſwer the End of the Lord for which he made you, which was to Serve and Worſhip him: For your Believing Parents, that have born you, and ſuckled you, can have no greater Joy in you, than as <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Mother had, <hi>That ſhe had born and ſuckled a Child for the Lord; and as the Lord had freely given him unto her, ſhe freely gave him up to ſerve the Lord in his Temple all the dayes of his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Dear Children, wait upon the Lord, that your Strength may be renewed in him, and that you may feel the ſame Power at work in you, as ſanctified <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> from the Womb, that you may be ſanctified Veſſels to the Lord, and that your Bodies may be Temples for the Holy Ghoſt to dwell in.</p>
            <p>So the Deſire of my Soul to the Lord for you is, That as you have begun a Teſtimony for the Lord in keeping up the Meeting, that you may hold out to the End, and not fear what Man can do unto you; for the Lord's Care is over you: and as you meet in his fear, his Over-ſhadowing Power will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, though you are but Little Children; he will ſuffer you to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that out of the Mouthes of Babes and Sucklings he ordains Strength that he may perfect his Praiſe; and he will carry his Lambs in his Arms, and gently lead thoſe that are with young. So Dear Children, keep to the God of Strength, and he will be your Strength; though you are Weak, he is Strong, and able to make you more than Conquerors, through him that hath loved you: And as you keep to the Lord, and your Faith ſtands in his Power, the Enemy within nor without ſhall never conquer you, but ye ſhall be like the little Children in the Temple, who cryed <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the Son of <hi>David;</hi> and they feared not, though the Chief Prieſts and Scribes were ſore Offended with them; and as it was in that day, ſo it is now; not many Mighty, nor of the Noble Men of the Earth, that believed in his Low Appearance, becauſe he came too Low for them; they deſpiſed him as the Carpenter's Son, and ſaid, <hi>that he was one that they knew from whence he came;</hi> but they did not; for to them his Viſſage was more marred than any man's, and they could ſee no Comlineſs in him, and who ſaid to them, <hi>They dyed in their Sins; whither he went, they could not come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So bleſſed be the Name of the Lord for evermore, that hath hid theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and hath revealed them unto Babes. So Dear Hearts, let us forever wait upon the Lord, and hearken to Wiſdom's Voice, that we may be kept low in his Fear; for, <hi>The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and to depart from Evil, that is a Good Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Dear and Well-beloved Friends, the Deſire of my Soul is, That we may paſs the Time of our ſojourning here with Fear, and that we may keep to the Unerring Way, that a Wayfaring Man, though a Fool cannot err therein: And as we keep to the Light, and bring our Deeds to it, they ſhall be made manifeſt, whether they are wrought in God or no; and ſo we ſhall come to know that Living Faith that gives Victory over the World; for, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; for the Juſt lives by Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Dear Friends, Keep to the juſt Principle of Life, that God hath placed in you, to Redeem your Souls from Death, that ſo whilſt you are in the World, you may know the Preſerving Power, that keeps his Children from the Evil of the World.</p>
            <p>And there is one thing more that lies upon me to you Diſobedient Children, that live not in an Heavenly Subjection to the Lord and to your Parents; Ceaſe to grieve the Spirit of the Lord, which is given to you to profit withal; and ceaſe to grieve your Honeſt Parents; and do not do as <hi>Abſalom</hi> did, who cauſed his Father to Lament over him with a ſad Lamentation, becauſe he Dyed in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience againſt the Lord and his Father; and he could not be Comforted in his Death, as he was in his other Son; when he heard of his Death, he aroſe, and waſhed and anointed himſelf, and eat Bread, and ſatisfied himſelf, in that <hi>he ſhould go to the Innocent Child, though it ſhould never return to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Dear Children, Watch againſt that Diſobedient Nature, which keeps you in Diſobedience to the Lord, and to your Parents; and as you wate upon the Lord, in his Fear, you ſhall know the Mighty Power of the Lord to work out that Nature in you that is ſubject to Vanity, and to ſet up his Heavenly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in you, that you may order your Converſations aright in the Sight of God, and all men: And then, when you are gathered together to wait upon the Lord; and cannot be content with the Form of Godlineſs Without the Power, nor with a bare Formality of coming to Meeting, the God of Power and Life will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear amongſt you, and his Preſence will be in the midſt of you; and though there may be No Words ſpoken amongſt you, yet keep to the Word of God, which is Quick and Powerful, that that may dwell plentifully amongſt you, and forever preſerve you.</p>
            <p>So Dear Children, Preſs forward, that you may be Confirmed and Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the Faith that once was delivered to the Saints, and that you may be made able to Contend earneſtly for it, and then nothing ſhall move you; yea, though the Earth may be moved, and the Powers of Darkneſs ſhaken, yet you ſhall have a Sure Habitation in the Lord, and be gathered into the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant, where you ſhall be hid with the Lord while he is raining down in his Di<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
