         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

upon the new Propoſitions of Peace, and the foure bills to be ſent to his Majeſty,</hi> is as much

their ſcriblings for the meridian of fooles, which makes no obſervation of by-gone

their trading with them, <hi>will be all for their good in the latter end.</hi> Brethren though the nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

of our owne countrey, rendering them a little light-headed, and making them ſpeake
like Engliſhmen on the otherſide <hi>Tweed;</hi> yet are wee not infected therewith: We have read

plaine dealing, and that others may ſee as well as our ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let impartiall ingenuity examine

            <p>If you <hi>haue uſed your beſt endeavours</hi> to theſe ends,<note place="margin">Reply</note> it was <hi>in purſuance of the Covenant,</hi> and ſo
you were bound to it, nevertheleſſe we thanke you for it being concern'd in it: onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

by religion you meane diſcipline (for that's all the <hi>religion</hi> ſome men mind) then you know we
have many Religions contended for amongſt us: we have the Kings religion, and that is <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy:</hi>
we have the Parliaments religion (we meane in the ſenſe delivered, though wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
they do not place their religion in diſcipline) and that is <hi>Presbitery:</hi> we have the Scotch
religion, and (to give its proper name) that is <hi>Independencie;</hi> for they call upon us like Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
from heaven to heare them, though they themſelves will be Independent as to us. Which
of theſe religions have you <hi>uſed your endeavours to ſetle amongſt us?</hi> If any of you (after <hi>Moſes</hi>
example) have been taken up into the mount of God, and have talked with our Lord and
Maſter mouth to mouth, and immediatlie received the law of Church Government, from the
hands of Chriſt written by his finger in Tables of ſtone, and have Comiſſion from him to charge
the people to <hi>hearken to you,</hi> upon pain of being <hi>cut off from the people;</hi> we ſhall acknowledge
your peculiar favour with the moſt high God, and that you are the onely independent people
of God in the world, and that all Iſrael muſt <hi>hearken to God,</hi> we repent of our former deafnes,
and ſhall henceforth ſubmit to your judgments <hi>for conſcience</hi> ſake; but if it <hi>hath never bin with
you after this manner;</hi> we have no cauſe to fear the guilt of Rebellion, though we ſay to you as
was ſaid to Moſes <hi>who made you rulers over us?</hi> it is not our ambition to ſubject our ſelves to
a rod of iron, a golden Scepter will better pleaſe us, your Scotch Independency is as diſtaſtfull

to us, as that in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> If you ſay it is the COVENANTED <hi>Religion,

Engliſh Presbyterians, and not Scotiſh Independents. If your <hi>endeavours</hi> have been in
truth for the <hi>ſetling</hi> not onely of <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>a happy peace,</hi> you will take heed of wrangling
with your peaceable brethren, we have no minde to fight, nor yet to be beaten, and therefore
we <hi>obteſt you</hi> (your own words in your ſeverall Letanies) <hi>by the coniunction and parity</hi> (that
word ſtickes, except with an Engliſh interpretation) <hi>of intereſts, by the treaty between the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
by the ſolemne league and covenant,</hi> by all your promiſes, profeſſions, and declarations, by
the dreadfull threatnings of Gods judgments upon trucebreakers, by the anatomizing of all
your hearts at the great day, by the juſt retribution of the righteous judge to every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his wayes, by the everlaſting ſeperation between the upright &amp; the hypocrite in the day
of the Lord, by the indeliable blot that will fall upon you and your poſterity, by the ſcandall of
religion, &amp; the juſt vindication of the diſhonour of God, by the prejudice of the Goſpel, by the
grief of the godly, by the intollerable conſequences of the enemies blaſphemie, by the offence of
the Jewes, by the rejoycing of the Turks, by the animation and encouraging of Antichriſt, by the
cry of all the blood that hath been ſhed in the juſt defence of this kingdomes intereſt, by all
the bonds of truth and righteouſneſſe, that you do not engage us in another warre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You tell us in the front of your papers, that</hi> Propoſitions were agreed on, Anno. 1644 with
advice and conſent of the Parliaments of both kingdomes, preſented to his Majeſty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by
commiſſioners of both, and treated upon at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> 1645. that you did earneſtly and frequently
preſſe the ſending of theſe Propoſitions again to his Majeſty, wherein the Houſes would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
with you: but on the contrary, after very long delay, thought fit to make ſeverall alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
therein, which were principally in matters that did concern the neare union of the Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Propoſitions were ſent to the King long before the time you ſpeak of,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> ſo that ſurely the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

them upon it, you would make us beleeve that you alone minde the peace &amp; ſafety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>England,</hi> as if your own intereſt was forgotten, and ours remembred, pure love, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
friendſhip, if the Houſes would not ſo ſuddenly <hi>concurre</hi> with you to ſend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
again, we do preſume they had reaſon for it; neither do we conceive that the Scotch
Commiſſioners have cauſe of offence, if the Houſes did not preſently act upon their firſt motion,
being not Commiſſioners to direct the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> if they thought fit, to make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall

               <hi>you urge, that</hi> it was agreed upon betwixt the Kingdomes, that the ſame Propoſitions

delayed by the Houſes for divers moneths, you did wair patiently, yet upon a ſudden they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a peremptory day for ſending the Propoſitions to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you had notice of the day, and were earneſtly preſt unto the thing, and the cauſe of
your delay,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> your owne conſciences can tell better than we, whether it was not by way of deſigne;

               <hi>Again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 3.</note> 
               <hi>in the ſame page you affirm thus, that</hi> finding no ſucceſſe in that way of ſending Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
to the King, and inſiſting upon his poſitive anſwer thereunto, without giving any reaſon for
the juſtice of our deſires, or hearing any Propoſition from his Majeſty, we did in November laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to the Honourable Houſes, and with much earneſtneſſe deſire that their might be a perſonall
Treaty with his Majeſty here at <hi>Lond.</hi> it being in all probability the beſt meanes to obtain a peace.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> whereas you appropriate the ſucceſſeleſneſſe of ſending Propoſitions to the King,
to your <hi>not giving reaſons for the juſtice of yours deſires,</hi> we demand, Did not one of your
ſelves rally a whole army of arguments and reaſons againſt the Kings refuſall to ſigne the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in a Rhetoricall ſpeech before him to that purpoſe,<note place="margin">See the Chancellor of Scotlands ſpeech to the Kings Majeſty at Newcaſtle.</note> profeſſing (among
many other motives) that <hi>upon his Majeſties refuſing the Propoſitions, both kingdomes will be
conſtrained (for their mutuall ſafety) to agree and ſettle religion and peace without him.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
there was added, <hi>If your Majeſty reject our faithfull advice, and loſe</hi> England <hi>by your
wilfulneſſe, your Majeſty will not be permitted to come and ruine</hi> Scotland. Further preſſing him
thus: <hi>We know no other remedy to ſave your Crown and Kingdomes, than your Majeſties aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Propoſitions.</hi> Yet now you are pleaſed to ſay, that not any reaſon hath been given
for the juſtice of your deſires. If your deſires were not juſt, why did you preſs him to grant them.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, is the caſe thus indeed? you were not alwayes of this opinion, as you confeſſe,
page 6. Brethren, let's make a little uſe of this: We ſee now what reaſon there is of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
forbearance of varieties of judgment, yea and of the ſame perſons, though changing
their judgments over and over, yea even in things civill, much more religious, being more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igmaticall
than theſe by farre: you <hi>were</hi> againſt the Kings perſonall treaty with the Parliament
at <hi>London now</hi> you are for it. Suppoſe the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> hath not yet attained to your
<hi>new light,</hi> beare with them a while, till your reaſons prevail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You tell us, that indeed heretofore</hi> his Maieſties preſence might have bred diviſions, and
continued our troubles; and when his Maieſty deſired to come hither from <hi>Oxford,</hi> with freedom
and ſafety, it was thought unfit, and denyed by the Houſes, and the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
but that argument now hath no force at all; for the caſe of affaires, the Kings condition
and ours (which were given for reaſons in that anſwer to his Maibſty) are quite altered from
what they were, then the King had Armies in the fields, and Garriſons, and ſtrong holds to returne
unto: now he hath none of theſe.</p>
            <p>Brethren,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> were theſe all the reaſons <hi>then</hi> given, why you could not admit of a perſonall
Treaty with his Majeſty at <hi>London?</hi> viz. becauſe <hi>then the King had Armies in the field, and
Garriſons and ſtrong holds to returne unto?</hi> had it been our aſſertion as it is yours, we ſhould
have feared that divine hand of Juſtice which met with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 6.</note> Acts 5. And that
all might ſee your dealings herein, we have here added your owne words.</p>
            <p>Concerning the perſonall Treaty deſired by your Majeſty, there having been ſo much innocent blood
of your good Subiects ſhed in this Warre by your Maieſties Commands and Commisſions, Iriſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
brought over into both Kingdomes, as alſo forces from forreigne parts, &amp;c. There being alſo
forces in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the Parliament and Kingdome by your Majeſties Commisſion; The Warre
in <hi>Ireland</hi> fomented and prolonged by your Majeſty, whereby the three Kingdomes are brought
neer to utter ruine and deſtruction. We conceive that untill SATISFACTION and SEC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RITIE be

            <p>Now let God, Angels, and men judge of your proceedings in the preſent caſe; Brethren,
your lines doe ſeem to carry a Chriſtian Dialect, and you oftentimes ſeem to be ſerious with

becauſe <hi>then his Majeſtie had Armies in the Field, Garriſons and ſtrong holds to return

pretending to nothing elſe? Brethren, what doe you make of Religion, a meere
piece of State-policie, or ſomewhat elſe? Brethren, we would perſwade you that
integrity and uprightneſſe are <hi>jure divino,</hi> and that Brethren ought to ſpeak the truth
from their hearts each to other. Shall we minde you of ſome other zealous paſſages

            <p>The troubles of our hearts are enlarged, and our feares encreaſed, in your Majeſties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
perceiving that your peoples patience is above meaſure tempted, and is like a
Cart preſſed downe with ſheaves, and is ready to break, while as beſides many former
deſignes and endeavours to bring deſolation and deſtruction upon us, &amp;c. our Countrey

and horrid cruelty excerciſed by the curſed crew of Iriſh Rebels, and their
complices in this Kingdome, under the conduct of ſuch as have commiſſion and warrant
from your Majeſtie; and unleſſe we prove unfaithfull both to God, and to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
we cannot conceale another danger which is infinitely greater than that of your

moſt loyall Subjects, in the humilitie and griefe of our hearts fall downe before
your Throne, and in the name of our Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge

            <p>How did the glory and luſtre of theſe plaine, honeſt, and chriſtian proceedings

your <hi>zeale provoke many</hi> to plead your cauſe againſt thoſe which did but whiſper jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies

their addreſſes to his Majeſty? and can we ſuppoſe they will owne with you this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of yours, wherein you tickle the hearts of the malignant party, plead for their
deſigne a perſonall Treaty, and that at <hi>London,</hi> without any mention of <hi>Satisfaction

much innocent blood of his beſt Subjects in his three Kingdomes yea or no? If no,
why is it charged on his ſcore, repreſenting him in ſuch horrid, black, and bloudy
colours, in the eyes of his Subjects? If he be guilty as <hi>the words</hi> have expreſſed, what
<hi>Satisfaction for blood,</hi> what <hi>Security</hi> hath beene given as yet (at leaſt to the two

not to treat with his Majeſty untill he had recalled his Proclamations and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt his Parliament, they have made that one of the foure Bills which were

ſhould they now be againſt it, and hide from the people the termes upon which they
were for it; have the Parliament forſook their primitive principles, or your ſelves?

            <p>In the next place you begin methodically to ſpeak unto two heads:</p>

for ſetting Religion, and a laſting Peace.</p>
            <p>And next, of the Propoſitions, which are to be the foundation of the peace and ſafety of
both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not take upon us to ſpeak unto every particular expreſſion of yours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you ſeeme to reflect upon the Parliament, our daily imploiments, and buſines of our
callings, not affording us thoſe opportunities of knowing and underſtanding the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
tranſactions which it is very likely have paſſed between the Parliament and you,
and we doubt not but an anſwer to ſatisfaction will be given by that Honourable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
whom you have blemiſhed by your writings, and the publication thereof; but
ſuch things which are of moſt plaine and obvious obſervation (whereof there is plenty
ſufficient to take away thoſe ſcandals which are caſt upon the Parliament) are theſe that
we ſhall inſiſt upon:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt then in your method you begin with that which you call,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 5.</note> The beſt and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
meanes to procure a good agreement with the King for the ſetling Religion and a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

Treaty with the King; and that his Majeſty for that end be invited to come to <hi>London</hi>
with honour, freedome and ſafety.</p>
            <p>If you are of that <hi>opinion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reply.</note> we pray you tell us, what ſatisfaction for bloud, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as to peace, you have received from his Majeſty, that this Kingdome (if poſſibly)
may be of your <hi>opinion:</hi> Have you concluded a peace with his Majeſty, without the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England?</hi> Then have you broken your Treaty: If you have not, ſay ſo. You
know they are not of your opinion for a perſonall treaty: but we would gladly weigh
your reaſons for it; we can better beare your reaſons then blowes: you tender us your
reaſons by the halfe dozen. Let us ſee your Poſition, and your reaſons: your poſition is
this:</p>
            <p>The beſt way to procure a well-grounded Peace, is, by a perſonall treaty with the King at
LONDON.</p>
            <p>Here we are to conſider firſt the thing, <hi>a perſonall Treaty,</hi> ſecondly the place, at
<hi>London.</hi> We ſhall looke upon your reaſons with reference to both. Firſt for the thing,
your firſt reaſon is;</p>
            <p>The ſending of Propoſitions without a Treaty,<note place="margin">1 Reaſon</note> hath been oftentimes aſſayed without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
and the new Propoſitions are leſſe advantagious to the Crown than the former were.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:29636:6"/>
1.<note place="margin">Reply.</note> What if Propoſitions have been ſucceſſeleſſe heretofore? Doth it follow they will
be ſo ſtill? Engliſh ſpirits (to ſpeake without vanitie) are more noble and generous, then
to deſpaire becauſe of repulſe. So many Garriſons had not been taken by ſome, and ſo
few by others, if this Argument had prevailed with all, as it hath with ſome.</p>
            <p>2. Theſe foure Bills were ſo model'd, as might have adminiſtred hopes of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
concurrence, being in order to a Treaty, had you not anticipated by charging the
new propoſitions to be leſſe advantagious to the Crown than the former were; and which
we have cauſe to ſuſpect, hath made this laſt addreſſe to his Majeſty, through your
means, as ſucceſſeleſſe as the former hath been, contrary to the hopes and expectations
of many. And the truth is, his Majeſties anſwer and your lines doe ſo conſimilate, that
a man would thinke that Sir <hi>John Cheiſly</hi> was the <hi>Scribe</hi> to both.</p>
            <p>Your next reaſon is this,<note place="margin">2 Reaſon.</note> 
               <hi>The Kings removall from the Parliament, was the cauſe of the

               <hi>Your third reaſon is this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Reaſon.</note> In a perſonall Treaty, the Commiſsioners of both Kingdomes

            <p>
               <hi>Your laſt reaſon is this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6 Reaſon.</note> we cannot expect his Majeſty will grant <hi>in terminis,</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
propoſitions ſhall be ſent unto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither will the Houſes of Parliament give full po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

            <p>He is to paſſe Bills <hi>in terminis,</hi> why not propoſitions, being matter for Bils? Confident
we are, had he wreſted the ſword out of the Parliaments hands, as it is wreſted out of his

it may be the axe in ſtead of the halter, heading in ſtead of hanging: for traitors hath he
proclaimed them without recalling it to this day.</p>
            <p>2. Was not this alſo as valid when you did concurre, as now it is?</p>

            <p>

            <p>Brethren, we ſhall not ſo much prejudge the weakneſſe of our countreymen, as to
ſhew them the difficiencie of theſe ſtarved ſuggeſtions. Engliſhmens eyes are in their
heads, and they need no ſpectacles to ſee mountaines, only we would gladly know your
meaning by <hi>the advantage of the Crown,</hi> and <hi>motions of the Crown,</hi> which ever and anon
you hint out to us (if our judgements faile us not) as poſſibly they may; (for we are no
Stateſmen, but as the late times have made us all enquire into State-caſes,) we ſay, if
our judgements be right, both the King and the Crown, and all things belonging unto
them, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> are for the Kingdomes advantage, and for no perſonall intereſt whatſoever
in prejudice of that, we have had many things which they call <hi>Aphoriſmes,</hi> divulged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

CHIEFEST LAW, THE KING IS ABOVE EVERY PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICULAR
MAM, BUT LESSE THAN THE WHOLE KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOME,
that THE KING IS THE KINGDOMES, BUT THE
KINGDOME IS NONE OF THE KINGS, (except with a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
and twenty more ſuch ſayings, which are our ordinary diſcourſe, and we thinke
there is a great deale of equity, juſtice, and reaſon in them, and a light to inſtruct us to
give unto the Magiſtrates their due, and to preſerve our ſelves from tyranny, and by
theſe things were we rallied by the Parliament together, to maintain the truth of theſe
ſayings, and we have paid for our learning, it hath coſt us deare, and we would not
quickly forget all like dunces, untill we are knockt into our former leſſons: your talking

what eſtimation will the world have of them who will not ſuffer him to returne

            <p>The plaine Engliſh whereof is this,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> to inſinuate into the people, that the Parliament
of England being againſt the Kings treating at London, are the Kingdomes enemies,
and ſo to ſtirre up the people againſt their Parliament: Is this like Commiſſioners of
State? Would you ſuffer ſuch things in your owne Kingdome? Is this <hi>according to your

            <p>3. The beſt ſort of Engliſh-men loves Religion in the bottome, to have it in deſigne,

            <p>4. We have generally obſerved that the emptieſt zelots are the greateſt advocates
for the circumſtances of Religion, time, and order, mighty matters in ſome mens eyes.</p>
            <p>You commend the King for mentioning Religion <hi>in the firſt place</hi> in his addreſſe to
the Parliament,<note place="margin">Page 7.</note> and to charge the Parliament with profaneſſe for poſt-poning Religion.</p>
            <p>But wherein doth the piety of the King ſo much conſiſt?<note place="margin">Reply.</note> is it in aſſerting the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,

you have not a tittle of <hi>the word of God;</hi> but all your crie is <hi>the ſolemne League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>

               <hi>you fall upon

inſtead of the Propoſitions which they have omitted, ſo farre as concernes Religion,
You</hi> find nothing but a meere ſhadow of Presbytery Government: and inſtead of unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Religion, a vaſt deformity, or multiformity of Hereſies and Sects. A liberty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for all ſorts of ſervice and worſhip of God, an opening a doere to Atheiſme, to all
Religions, to liberty of conſcience, being indeed liberty of errour, ſcandall, ſchiſme, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
diſhonouring God, oppoſing truth, hindering Reformation, and ſeducing others.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Page 18.</note> do you <hi>find</hi> no more in the Propoſitions as concerning Diſcipline and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

the Parliament ſuppoſeth it ſuch a <hi>Presbiterian</hi> government in the very ſubſtance
thereof, as they can imagine, to be moſt agreeable to <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and according

their eares are open? ſhall they receive the patterne of the houſe of God from their

in Diſcipline, with a ſmall ſtocke of Scripture to maintaine the ſame? did all men tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>ſee</hi> what they act, and act what they <hi>ſee,</hi> we ſhould have more love, and leſſe wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
more truth, and leſſe ſhew, men would not be ſo forward in pretence of zeale
for government in the houſe of God, with the neglect of the government of their owne
tongues and pens, in reproaching and ſlandering whole States and Kingdomes: you
<hi>ſee little but the meere ſhadow of GOVERNMENT</hi> in the Parliament; we <hi>ſee little but
the meere ſhadow of RELIGION</hi> in ſome others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Perhaps the <hi>KINGDOME</hi> ſees little as yet, <hi>but the meere-ſhadow of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterian

then <hi>commanded.</hi> The Parliament are <hi>Engliſh men</hi> themſelves, who know the diſpoſition
of their own Country-men to be ſuch, that they will freely run when they are drawne
with the <hi>cords of men,</hi> viz. reaſon and love: but are extreame head-ſtrong in caſe of

            <p>Thirdly, It may be the Parliaments deſigne may be firſt to feed the Kingdome with

<hi>Canaan, viz,</hi> the great Doctrines of <hi>faith towards God,</hi> and <hi>repentance from dead works;</hi>
and untill the time of ſome proficiency therein, the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of Diſcipline may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> whereof is but a <hi>meere ſhadow</hi> in compariſon of theſe, our late Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
whilſt they ſo hotly contended for Diſcipline and government in pretence of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing

God, oppoſing the Truth, bindering Reformation, and ſeducing others:</hi> and all
this is aggravated; in ſo much as it is done, after a moſt ſacred and <hi>ſolemne League and

            <p>Secondly, You ſhould have proved the methods and waies, the rules and directions
of the Word of God for the ſuppreſſion of theſe, and the Parliaments practice in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

though they ſhould enter into a ſoleme League and Covenant, that they would only
help us to disband our Armies, and eaſe the people of the oppreſſions therof. You tel

that it's thought you will quickly bring it out of date; the word <hi>Covenant</hi> is your <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleth:</hi>

            <p>Secondly you adde, that the Houſes have rejected all that concerns-unity and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>It is but a temporary Suſpenſion,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> becauſe of their former ſucceſſeſnes (your own an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for your rejecting propoſitions, &amp; preſſing for a treaty contrary to your promiſe)
and not a rejection of thoſe things: Did they preſume the religion of Scotland in the
principles thereof to juſtifie your practices in abuſing our Parliament as your Papers
have done, they would have reaſon enough to reject all that concerns unity and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
with you in matters of religion. But confident we are, as they have no reaſon,
ſo the leaſt jealouſie thereof is not within the confines of their thoughts.</p>
            <p>Next you complaine of the omiſſion of ſeverall things even in heapes, all which
you ſummon up in this, <q>That generally throughout the Propoſitions all expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

meaning only of the ſolemn League &amp; Covenant, and treaties between the kingdoms,
will ſerve your turn, and the expres letter of theſe, is too ſhort for your ſatisfaction,
the Parliament of England have reaſon upon reaſon, that generally throughout the

in the obſervation of our due diſtance from, and obliged duty to them, we

obteſt them by all their vowes, covenants &amp; promiſes, by all their votes, orders &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
by all their declarations, proclamations &amp; proteſtations, by all our bloud,

doings and ſufferings for our kingdomes intereſts, by the ſad effects of tyranny and
ſlavery, by the great truſt committed to their charge, by our confidence of their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
therein, by the honour of Engliſh men, by the ſtain of their poſterity, kindred
and progeny, by their principles of humanity, juſtice and integrity, by their great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
at the laſt day, that they doe preſerve our rights, lawes &amp; intereſt, our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
liberties and immunities intire, diſtinct and whole, and that they neither ſell
them, give them, nor grant them, nor yet ſuffer them to be ſold, given, or granted by
any compact Covenant or Treaty (as we are moſt aſſured hitherto they have not) to
any Nation, Kingdome, or people; and more particularly, that in all their tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
between themſelves and our Scotch brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they maintain the diſtinct intereſt of
England, without confounding it with the intereſt of Scotland? and that in all their
neighbourly, friendly and brotherly Aſſociations for the jojnt benefit of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
they never aſſociate in that which is their ſeveral diſtinct and particular rights.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas you complain that formerly Propoſitions of both kingdoms were drawn
up together in one body; now for ſeparating the intereſts of the kingdoms, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
for England are drawne, up apart, upon the obſervation whereof, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things you deſired a conference and it would not be granted.</q> We reply.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what mean you by one body? mean you the Commiſſioners of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
making that up one body? or ſecondly the Parliament of England in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Scotch Commiſſioners? doubtles we cannot thinke that the Parliament of
England and Scotch Commiſſioners were ever known yet to be one body? we hope
that never ſuch a monſter ſhall be ſeene in England; neither can we imagine that the
Commiſſionets of both kingdomes in one body were to draw up propoſitions for
peace; therefore mean you thirdly, that this one body was not made up of men, but of
propoſitions; and though they were Propoſitions of both kingdomes, yet they were
ſent together in one body; this doth not argue but that care was had by the Parliament
that though the Propoſitions were ſent in one body or paper; yet there was a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and no confuſion of intereſts: we perfectly know, that as it would be contrary
to the Parliaments truſt, ſo is it againſt their jugdements and conſciences to confound
the intereſt of England with the intereſt of Scotland; we truſt they will never be ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the leven of Levelling; but in the promotion of unity, they will beware of
the Doctrine of Community.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what if Propoſitions for peace were formerly drawne up together in one
body, muſt all other Propoſitions whatſoever, which the Parliament of England will
pleaſe to tender to the King, be drawn up together in one body with Scotlands Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions?
No, it is time now to ſeperate all colour of intereſt of the kingdomes, and not
to ſuffer the leaſt appearance, or occaſion of ſcruple, that the Parliament of England
did ever intend participation of intereſts with the kingdome of Scotland, though Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of both kingdoms were formerly ſent in one body of writing; yet now their
wiſdomes may think fit not to adminiſter ſo much as a paper advantage, or the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
ground of jealouſie and miſtake about their intentions concerning the intire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the kingdoms diſtinct intereſts, and therefore our obligations are the
greater unto our Parliament, for that they would not ſo much as grant a conference
with you about this buſines, that the confuſion of intereſts between England &amp; Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
ſhould never procure ſo much advantage as the grant of a Conference would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:29636:11"/>
And had the principles of an unlimited prerogative power, been as timouſly obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and declared as your preſent principles of confounding intereſts are now by our
Parliament, it had as probably prevented the ſad calamities and miſerable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of our late wars, as their preſent care we hope will doe; if the fault be not your
owne, which if it happen (as God forbid) we make noe queſtion but all Engliſh men
of honour and intereſt, and common ingenuity, will joyn together as on man, and
ſo preſerve the intereſt of their native Countrey diſtinct and whole, as that all the
guilded ſpecies, and devout pretences of piety and love which ſhall be uſed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull

            <p>Your grand objection is the expres letter of the eight Article,<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> wherein it is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

the Dutch Embaſſadour (as you ſay) ſent hither to mediate between the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
as the chiefe parties at variance; doe not all the expreſſes, Proclamations and
Declarations both from the King and from the Parl. relate to the differences between
the King, the Parl. the King and his People, &amp;c. Did not the King proclaim the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

might be ſpeedily thought upon by the Parliament for the comfortable incouragment
and maintenance of faithfull Paſtors, yea and their widows and children, that they
may be delivered from that ſnare of dependence upon the benevolence and charity of
their dull hearers, and ſometimes vitious patrons and benefactors. But we referre the

in Scotland have made any mention in their addreſſes to their Parliament,
of the opprobrious tearms of Red-ſhanks, or Blew-caps, it had reflected no ſmal diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement

            <p>For the concluſion of all,<note place="margin">Page 25.</note> you ſee down moſt of your deſires, and tender them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Parliament.</p>
            <p>If you have any deſires concerning your own kingdome,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> wherein the Parliament of
England may gratifie you without prejudice to the proper intereſt of England, you
may do well to tender them; but we ſh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll not trouble you to mediate for us with our
own Parliament; we deſire you brethren, once more before we leave you, that you
would remember that peace preſerving paſſage in the Covenant, <hi>Our ſeverall places and
callings:</hi> you are ex<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ream apt to forget it, therefore are we ſo bold to put you in mind
ſo often of it: you have ſet downe moſt of your deſires, but not all, keepe the reſt
within you, perhaps it is better (at leaſt for us) that your deſires ſhould bee in your
Hearts, then in your Hands.</p>
            <p>As for your intermedling with the four Bils ſent by the Houſes unto the King; we
ſay no more, but had you been mindful of the bounds and limits of our ſolemn league
and covenant, <hi>viz. our ſeverall places and callings,</hi> you had ſpared your paines in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and your fig. leaves to cover that nakedneſſe,<note place="margin">See Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pency of England, &amp;c. lately ſet forth, pa. 18, 19.</note> hath been totn from you by a better
hand. Here we had thought to have taken our leaves, but before we part, we have three
or four Queries to propound unto you, and one requeſt to make, wherein if you will
ſatisfie us in your next, it will be an addition to our former engagements.</p>
            <p>Firſt, whether that your publiſhing to the people the tranſactions between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and your ſelves, without the Parliaments conſent, nay contrary to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
commands concerning printing and publiſhing; yea, with maligne reflection
upon them, be not contrary to the practiſe of all publique Miniſters, yea and directly
repugnant to all principles of common juſtice, and infinitely unworthy that profeſſion
of love, friendſhip, and brotherly reſpects which you have ſo ſolemnly made in the
face of heaven and earth unto them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:29636:13"/>
Secondly, tell us, <hi>bona fide,</hi> whether you think in your conſciences (for you pretend
to be very religiouſly conſcientious) that the Parliament of England, &amp; people therof,
did ever intend any ſuch ſenſe of the ſolemne League and Covenant, either concerning
the intereſt of the kingdom, or government of the Church, as you have endeavoured to
extort from it in your ſeverall papers, or that they did intend (when they took it) any
otherwiſe by it, than the promotion of holineſſe in the general (though with difference
of judgement about diſcipline) and the uniting us together in our mutuall aſſiſtance
againſt, and the diſcovery of the common enemies of both kindomes?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, tell us, <hi>bona fide,</hi> whether you deſire, or rather would permit that the King
ſhould have the ſame power in Scotland, the ſame negative voyce, the ſame abſolute
command and authority every way, as you would he ſhould have in England, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if he ſhould refuſe to take away Epiſcopacy to eſtabliſh Presbytery, to recall thoſe
proclamations and declarations whereby you are declared traytors and rebels, to give
ſatisfaction and ſecurity to your kingdome, yea, or whether upon the performance of
theſe things, you would let him have ſuch a power yea or no?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whether you think in the ſecrets of your hearts, it be agreeable to the
principles of religion, rules of equity, juſtice and policy, an acceptable ſacrifice in the
ſight of Almighty God, and comfortable for his people, to advance the King, <hi>in ſtatu
quo prius,</hi> untill he hath according to the pious advice, and Chriſtian exhortation of
the generall Aſſembly of the Kirk of Scotland, <hi>viz. Fallen down at the Footſtoole of
the King of glory, acknowledging his ſinnes, repented of them, and made his peace with God in
Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe blood is able to waſh away his great ſinnes.</hi> And whether you thinke in
your conſciences he is a changed man, yea or no?</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, whether it would not be moſt agreeable to the will of God, the
declarations, proteſtations, promiſes and profeſſions of love betwixt the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
the true intent of the ſolemne League and Covenant, and moſt conducing to
the glory of God, and the mutuall ſupport, ſecurity, ſafety and benefit of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
united together, that you and we be true, faithfull, conſtant, and ſingle hearted
each to other, aſſiſting each other according to <hi>Our ſeverall places and callings,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of each others <hi>Peculiar, proper, and diſtinct intereſt:</hi> And whether it would not
be as great a diſhonour to God, ſcandall to the Goſpell, ſcorne to Religion, rejoycing
of the wicked, grieving of the godly, gratifying the Devill, and the affaires of his
kingdome among Jewes, Turks, Infidels, Papiſts, Prelats, and all ſorts of prophane
men, that You and We ſhould be at variance? Should we not make our ſelves therby
an abomination to the Lord, a hiſſing to all nations, a prey unto our enemies, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the wrath and curſe of God and men, and bring upon our ſelves ſwift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
for the prevention whereof, let us both bow our knees to the Father of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt night &amp; day, that we being rooted and grounded in love, may grow
up together in Chriſt, perfecting holineſſe in the feare of the Lord; and by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
forbearance and wiſdome, may keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>
            <p>OUr requeſt is onely this, that you would either giue a Reply unto the Anſwer of
the Commons aſſembled in Parliament to the Scotch Commiſſioners papers of
the 20. and their letter of the 24. of <hi>October,</hi> 1646. or elſe to ceaſe any further to
trouble Englands eares with what you call the ſenſe and meaning of the ſolemne
League and Covenant, Treaties, &amp;c. for if you doe, you will but ſow the winde, and
reap the whirlwinde for your paines.</p>
