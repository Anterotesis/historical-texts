            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT may ſeem very improper to addreſs a Tranſlation out of French to Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> who have ſpent ſo many years to the greateſt advantage in <hi>France,</hi> and who is not only a Great Maſter of that Gentile Language, but of all the more eminent modern Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of <hi>Europe.</hi> But thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:48366:3"/>
who have the Honour to know any thing of Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> muſt needs allow, that no Dedication of what is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful to the world, or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any kind, can be more properly tendered than to a Perſon who being born in the Higheſt Rank of our Nobility, has Power to Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize whatſoever he takes into his Protection, and who being fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with all the admirable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, which a mighty Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, a penetrating and vigorous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, an early and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Virtue and Piety, and all ſorts of Foreign and Domeſtick improvements could beſtow; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to render Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> either a Great Miniſter in affairs of State,
<pb facs="tcp:48366:3"/>
a Compleat Courtier, an Eminent Patriot in the time of Peace, a Valiant and Judicious Commander in the time of War, or an excellent Judge both of Men and Books. <hi>My Lord,</hi> the Treatiſe I now offer You, is not writ after the uſual way of ordinary Chymiſts; it has none of the bombaſtick expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor ridiculous pretences, none of the Melancholick Dreams, and wretched Enthuſiaſms, none of the palpable falſities, and even impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities wherewith the common rate of Chymical Books has been ſtuff'd heretofore. The Author is no Believer in that great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſtumbling-block, the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Projection, nor at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb facs="tcp:48366:4"/>
to the Tranſmutation, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Adulteration of Metals. He is an excellent Operator, his Reaſonings are cloſe and pertinent to the matter in hand, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from matter of Fact; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that I think he may be ſaid to have Purified and Refined Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry from the many dregs and feculencies, which by other mens over-refining, and over-curious diligence it had been tainted with before. I ſhall not trouble Your Lordſhip too much with things ſo unſuitable as theſe are, conſidering that Your Noble Soul, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirit is hourly engaged in ſerving, and becoming highly uſeful to your Countrey upon the
<pb facs="tcp:48366:4"/>

Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had a conſiderable ſhare in the happy concluſion of this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Campaign, with Your moſt Illuſtrious Father, his <hi>Grace</hi> my Lord <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> who did maintain, by his Preſence, and Wiſe Conduct, that great Poſt of the utmoſt importance, the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> againſt the power of the Rebels, who confidently gave out that they were ſure of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and doubtleſs might have been ſo, unleſs prevented by the Wiſdom and Courage of His <hi>Grace,</hi> and Your <hi>Lordſhip.</hi> Theſe things, <hi>My Lord,</hi> are but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of what the World is to

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Shall eaſily acknowledge that the world is in no want of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Books; <hi>Germany</hi> alone can ſufficiently furniſh thoſe who are much inquiſitive after them, with as great variety as their heart can wiſh. And yet in this great plenty, or rather ſuperfluity of Books of Chymiſtry, when we have weighed things a little maturely, we ſhall find that ſomething very material is ſtill wanting, in order to render Chymiſtry of good uſe to the World; and that is, to give a juſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judgment of the benefits and the miſchiefs, the ſafety and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of many great and common, but
<pb facs="tcp:48366:7"/>
thoſe very Active Chymical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins, according to the proper uſe, or irregular application of them, and according to the innocence, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructiveneſs of their compoſition. In order to this end, I do conceive that this Author's plain and natural way of examining every Operation by Reaſon and Experience together, his ſingular perſpicuity in his Diſcourſes and Remarks, and his univerſally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all Imaginary Notions in the explication of the accidents and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which do attend the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, may be a good foundation upon which ſome Judicious Practiſers may hereafter raiſe cautions &amp; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of excellent uſe to mankind.</p>
            <p>This Author is one of the firſt through-pac'd Chymiſts who has had the ingenuity and ſagacity to ſuſpect the influence of Fire on the chief Preparations made with it. For
<pb facs="tcp:48366:7"/>
though Chymiſtry has by ſome been called <hi>Pyrotechnia,</hi> or the ART of FIRE, and Fire has ſeemed to be as much deified by moſt Chymiſts, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> tells us, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 258. it was by the barbarous <hi>Lybians,</hi> who did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it as a God; yet this worthy man has in many places of his Book abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly acknowledged, or at leaſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently hinted at the hurt, as well as the good, which medecins may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from its violent nature.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 21. <q>
                  <hi>If we conſider impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially how Fire does act, we ſhall be forced to acknowledge, that it rather deſtroyes, and confounds the greateſt part of the bodies it opens, and does not leave them in the natural ſtate they were in before, and eſpecially when it is driven with that force which is neceſſary to draw them.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He proves all Alkali Salts, whether Volatile or Fixt to be changed from their Natural ſtate, by the means of
<pb facs="tcp:48366:8"/>
Fire, and alſo to have received, and to retain the very particles and ſubſtance of Fire in its full activity; and ſhews how the great ebullition which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens upon the mixture of Acid and Alkali is or may be preſumed to be wholly or in great part owing to the fire contained in them. The heat, and fume, and ebullition, the noiſe and detonation, which do attend the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> Dulcified, do ſhew what a Fire is drawn into the body of that Corroſive Spirit that can make ſo remarkable a conflict and buſtle, that it is even ready to take flame of it ſelf, though the operation or Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification be made without coming near the fire, and though there is no appearance of Alkali contending with Acid, to cauſe the aforeſaid tumult, ſee the Remarks on <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> Dulcified, <hi>p.</hi> 302, 303. The ſame thing happens upon mixing <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48366:8"/>
(another Corroſive Acid) with <hi>Oil of Turpentine,</hi> which is no Alkali; the mixture grows ſo hot, through the Fire contained in the Acid, <hi>that it ſometimes breaks the Viol, and often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a conſiderable ebullition,</hi> ſee <hi>p.</hi> 342.</p>
            <p>He obſerves, that water thrown upon <hi>Tartar</hi> newly Calcined, does heat and cauſe ebullition, after the manner as it does with <hi>Quicklime,</hi> the Fire that was entred into it making a violent eruption.</p>
            <p>He is the firſt perhaps who has taken ſuch particular notice, what an augmentation of weight is added to many Preparations by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and incorporation of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Fire into their compoſition, as you may ſee in the Calcination of <hi>Lead, p.</hi> 107. in the Diſtillation of <hi>Spirit of Saturn</hi> from the <hi>Salt of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, p.</hi> 116. in the Calcination of <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony, <hi>p.</hi> 208. and even
<pb facs="tcp:48366:9"/>
in the Calcination of <hi>Antimony</hi> by the heat of the Sun with a burning-glaſs, <hi>p.</hi> 228. which few inſtances may poſſibly lead the way to Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive perſons to diſcover the ſame augmentation in divers other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.</p>
            <p>His addiction to Chymiſtry has not heated his head with fond and groundleſs hopes of attaining Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, nor led him to abuſe the world with Counterfeiting the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Metals, but he has candidly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the impoſtures of <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> at large, in the Chapter of <hi>Gold, p.</hi> 49, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing of his deſcription of the <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> and divers other new matters delivered in this Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I dare preſume the Judicious Reader will not diſlike many things in the Book, when he has a little conſidered them.</p>
            <p>Therefore although we may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="tcp:48366:9"/>
be overſtockt with Books that pretend to Chymiſtry, yet I hope the diſcerning Reader will think it no diſ-ſervice, that I become an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of adding one more good Book of this kind to the number of our bad ones: the kind reception which the former Edition met with, when comparatively ſhort and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, has already in ſome meaſure beſpoke the welcom, which this may reaſonably hope for, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, and very much inlarged by the ingenious Author, and when compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the former Edition will be found to bear the proportion of a Man in his full ſtrength and vigor, to that of a growing hopeful Youth.</p>
            <p>I will not detain you from the work it ſelf, only would adviſe young Students, for whoſe inſtruction it is principally deſigned, not to be too bold in the uſe of ſuch Medicins as
<pb facs="tcp:48366:10"/>
have undergone great Fires, nor to be over-credulous in believing the ſtrange wonders, and moſt mighty Cures which too many other Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have extravagantly boaſted, and moſt ſolemnly, but groundleſly aſſured us. The wiſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> will acquaint them, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And <hi>Galen</hi> frequently teaches, that Nature is abundantly wiſer in her works than Art can be; and that the Works of Nature are far above our greateſt praiſes, and deſerve our higheſt admiration, as may be ſeen more at large in his 7. and 11. Books of that excellent Tract, <hi>de uſu partium.</hi>

               <head>Of Chymiſtry in General.</head>
               <p>THE Word <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is derived from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Juyce, or from <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to melt; becauſe it teaches us to ſeparate the purer ſubſtances of Mixt bodies, which are ſometimes called <hi>Juices;</hi> and becauſe it ſhews us how to melt things that are of the moſt ſolid nature. The Chymiſts have added the Arabian particle <hi>Al,</hi> in the word <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy,</hi> intending to give it a ſublime ſignification, as particularly when the <hi>Tranſmutation</hi> of <hi>Metals</hi> is underſtood by it, though otherwiſe <hi>Alchymy</hi> ſignifies no more than <hi>Chymiſtry.</hi> It is called the <hi>Spagirick Art,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and to gather together, becauſe it teaches how to ſeparate the uſeful parts of a body from the unuſeful, and how to joyn them together again. 'Tis called the <hi>Hermetick Art,</hi> from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48366:15"/>
                  <hi>Hermes,</hi> one of the firſt Inventors of it. Laſtly, it has been called <hi>Pyrotechnia,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifying the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Fire;</hi> for in effect it is by <hi>Fire</hi> that we bring all Chymical Operations to paſs. Other names have been given to this Art, but becauſe the knowledge of them is to no great purpoſe, we will be contented with having related ſome of the chief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is an Art that teaches how to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the different ſubſtances which are found in Mixt bodies: I mean by a Mixt body thoſe things that naturally grow and increaſe, ſuch as Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals. Under the name of Minerals, I comprehend the Seven Metals, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Stones, and Earths; under Vegetables, I underſtand Plants, Gumms, Roſins, Fruits, the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Fungus,</hi> Seeds, Juyces, Flowers, Moſſes, and whatſoever elſe comes from them. Among theſe alſo I reckon <hi>Manna,</hi> Honey, and thoſe that are called imperfect Mixts. And under Animals I contain both the Animals themſelves, and whatſoever belongs to them, as their parts and excrements. But before I begin to ſpeak parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of all theſe things, I believe it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to ſay ſomething of the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,</hi> and give a general <hi>Idea</hi> of Furnaces, Lutes, the degrees of Fire, and Terms that may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion any obſcurity.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Principles of Chymiſtry.</head>
               <p>The Firſt <hi>Principle</hi> that can be admitted for the compoſition of Mixts, is an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Spirit,</hi> which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48366:15"/>
being diffuſed through all the world, produces different things according to the different Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trixes, or Pores of the earth in which it ſettles. But becauſe this <hi>Principle</hi> is a little <hi>Metaphyſical,</hi> and falls not under our ſenſes, it will be fit to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſome ſenſible ones; wherefore I ſhall relate thoſe that are commonly held.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Chymiſts in making the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of Mixt bodies have met with five ſorts of Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they therefore concluded that there were five <hi>Principles</hi> of Natural things, <hi>Water, Spirit, Oil, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> Of theſe five, three of them are Active, the <hi>Spirit, Oil,</hi> and <hi>Salt;</hi> and two Paſſive, <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> They called them active, by reaſon they do cauſe all manner of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the others paſſive, becauſe being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves, they only ſerve to ſtop and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the quick motion of the actives.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> which is called <hi>Mercury</hi> is the firſt of the Active principles, that appears to us, when we make the Anatomy of a mixt body. 'Tis a ſubtile, piercing, light ſubſtance, that is more in motion than any of the others. It is this which cauſes all Bodies to grow in more or leſs time, according as it abounds in them more or leſs. But it happens that the Bodies wherein it abounds are more liable to corruption, by reaſon of its too great motion, and this is obſerv'd in Animals and Vegetables. On the contrary the greateſt part of Minerals, as containing but a very ſmall quantity of it, do ſeem to be incorruptible. It cannot be drawn pure, no more than the others I am going to ſpeak of. But either it is involv'd in a little <hi>Oil,</hi> that it carries along with it, and then may be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48366:16"/>
called a Volatile Spirit, ſuch as the Spirit of Wine, of Roſes, of Roſemary, of Juniper; or elſe is detained by ſome Salts, which check its Volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and then may be called a <hi>fixt Spirit,</hi> as the Acid Spirits of Vitriol, Alum, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Oil</hi> which is called <hi>Sulphur</hi> by reaſon of its inflammability, is a ſweet, ſubtile, unctuous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that riſes after the <hi>Spirit.</hi> This is ſaid to cauſe the diverſity of Colours and Smells, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its diſpoſition in Bodies: this gives them their Beauty, and Deformity, uniting together the other <hi>Principles:</hi> this alſo ſweetens the acrimony of <hi>Salts,</hi> and by ſhutting up the Pores of a mixt, hinders it from corrupting, either through too much moiſture or cold. Wherefore many Trees and Plants that have a great deal of <hi>Oil,</hi> are wont to laſt green much longer than others, and can reſiſt the extremity of ill weathers. It is always drawn impure. For either it is mixt with Spirits, as the <hi>Oils</hi> of Roſemary, of Lavender, which ſwim above the water; or elſe it is fill'd with Salts, that it draws along with it in the diſtillation, as the <hi>Oil</hi> of Box, <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> Cloves, which do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate to the bottom of the water by reaſon of their weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salt</hi> is the laſt of the Active Principles, which remains diſguiſed in the <hi>Earth,</hi> after the other <hi>Principles</hi> are extracted. It is drawn by pouring water upon the earth to imbibe its <hi>Salt;</hi> then fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the diſſolution, and evaporating all the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, a <hi>Salt</hi> is found at the bottom of the Veſſel. It is a fixt, incombuſtible ſubſtance, that gives Bodies their conſiſtence, and preſerves them from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.

                  <hi>Water,</hi> which is called <hi>Phlegm,</hi> is the firſt of the Paſſive Principles: it comes in diſtillation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Spirits</hi> when they are <hi>fixt,</hi> or after them when they are <hi>volatile.</hi> It is never drawn pure, but always receives ſome impreſſion from the Active Principles.

                  <p>The word <hi>Principle</hi> in <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> muſt not be underſtood in too nice a ſenſe: for the ſubſtances which are ſo called, are only <hi>Principles</hi> in reſpect of us, and as we can advance no farther in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of bodies; but we well know that they may be ſtill divided into abundance of other parts, which may more juſtly claim, in propriety of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48366:17"/>
ſpeech, the name of <hi>Principles:</hi> wherefore ſuch ſubſtances are to be underſtood by <hi>Chymical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> as are ſeparated and divided, ſo far as we are capable of doing it by our weak imperfect powers. And becauſe <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is an Art that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates</hi> what it does, it receives for fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal only ſuch things as are palpable and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable. It is in truth a great advantage to us, that we have <hi>Principles</hi> ſo ſenſible as they are, and whereof we can have ſo reaſonable an aſſurance. The fond conceits of other <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Natural Principles,</hi> do only puff up the mind with grand <hi>Idea's,</hi> but they prove or demonſtrate nothing. And this is the reaſon that going to diſcover their <hi>Principles,</hi> we find ſome of them do frame one Syſteme, and others another. But if we would come as near as may be to the <hi>true Principles</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> we cannot take a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain courſe than that of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> which will ſerve us as a Ladder to them; and this diviſion of ſubſtances, though it may ſeem a little groſs, will give us a very great <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the firſt ſmall particles which have entred into the compoſition of mixt bodies.</p>
                  <p>Some modern Philoſophers would perſwade us, that it is altogether uncertain, whether the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which are ſeparated from bodies, and are called <hi>Chymical Principles,</hi> do effectually exiſt and are naturally reſiding in the body before: theſe do tell us that the <hi>fire</hi> by rarifying the matter in time of diſtillation is capable of beſtowing upon it ſuch an alteration as is quite different from what it had before, and ſo of forming the <hi>Salt, Oil,</hi> and other things which are drawn from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48366:17"/>This objection does at firſt ſeem to have much weight and reaſon in it, becauſe it is certain (as hereafter ſhall be ſhewn) that the <hi>Fire</hi> does give a very conſiderable impreſſion to the preparations, and that very often it does put ſuch a new face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things, that they are very hardly to be known when compar'd with what they were before. But it is eaſie to ſhew, that though the <hi>Fire</hi> does ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifie and alter ſubſtances, yet it does not make thoſe <hi>Principles;</hi> for we ſee them and ſmell them in many bodies, before ever we bring them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the <hi>Fire.</hi> For example, it cannot be denied, but that there was exiſtent <hi>Oyl</hi> in <hi>Olives,</hi> in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,</hi> in <hi>Nuts,</hi> and in many other fruits and ſeeds, becauſe it is drawn, only by beating and preſſing them. <hi>Turpentine,</hi> which is a thickned <hi>Oyl,</hi> and many other fat, or unctuous liquors, are drawn by meer inciſion into the trunk, or root of trees; and what elſe I pray is the <hi>fat</hi> of animals but an <hi>Oyl,</hi> or <hi>Sulphur coagulated?</hi> Nor can it be denied, but that there is <hi>ſalt</hi> actually in mixt bodies, ſince that by bruiſing a Plant, and making expreſſion to draw out its juyce, and then leaving the juyce to ſettle in ſome cool place for a few daies, a <hi>ſalt</hi> will be found fixt about the veſſel in form of little <hi>Cryſtals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know that ſome doubting Scepticks (who make it their buſineſs to doubt of every thing) will ſtill ſay that by beating the Almonds, and then preſſing them, and by making inciſion into Trees, the parts which compoſe the plant are agitated and put in motion after ſuch a manner as they are by <hi>Fire,</hi> and that this agitation of parts is capable of ranging them ſo, as to make the <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Salt.</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48366:18"/>
But ſuch reaſonings as theſe do deſtroy themſelves by too much niceneſs, and there is no ſober under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man but eaſily perceives the falſhood; for can a man well perceive that meer trituration or inciſion are able to make <hi>Salt, Oyl, Earth?</hi> it is abundantly more probable, nay, and it may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demonſtrated, that thoſe ſubſtances did exiſt in the bodies before, and that by inciſion and tritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the gate has only been opened to let them come freely out.</p>
                  <p>Others again do attack the <hi>Principles</hi> of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry after another manner a little differing from this, theſe do acknowledge that the foreſaid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are naturally in the Mixts, much as we draw them by Art, but they aſſert that we have no proof that the Mixts are <hi>compounded</hi> of theſe ſame ſubſtances, called <hi>Principles,</hi> and that they are not drawn from the juyce of the earth in ſuch a form; that <hi>Salt, Sulphur, &amp;c.</hi> may indeed have been formed in the natural Fermentations, and other elaborations, which happen in the Mixt during its growth, and therefore they conclude that thoſe ſubſtances cannot properly be called <hi>Principles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not know ſufficiently whether the Mixt was <hi>compoſed</hi> of them at firſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſince we are ſatisfied that the <hi>earths</hi> which ſerve for a <hi>matrix</hi> to Mixt bodies, are impregnated with <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and other ſubſtances of the nature of thoſe which we do find in the bodies, and ſince we can perceive nothing elſe which can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their compoſition, it remains beyond all doubt that they are even <hi>compounded</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be granted that the <hi>Fermentations,</hi> or other Elaborations which come to paſs in mixt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48366:18"/>
bodies, have given the <hi>Principles</hi> a certain order of parts, or ſome diſpoſitions they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but they do by no means <hi>form,</hi> or compoſe them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>five Principles</hi> are eaſily found in <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables,</hi> but not ſo eaſily in <hi>Minerals.</hi> Nay there are ſome <hi>Minerals,</hi> out of which you cannot poſſibly draw ſo much as <hi>two,</hi> nor make any ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at all (as Gold and Silver) whatſoever they talk, who ſearch with ſo much pains for the <hi>Salts, Sulphurs</hi> and <hi>Mercuries</hi> of theſe metals. I can believe, that all the <hi>Principles</hi> do indeed enter into the compoſition of theſe Bodies, but it does not follow that they muſt remain in their former condition, or can be drawn as they were before; for it may be theſe ſubſtances which are called <hi>Principles</hi> are ſo ſtrictly involved one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to ſuffer no ſeparation any other way than by breaking their Figure. Now it is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their <hi>Figure</hi> that they are called <hi>Salts, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs,</hi> and <hi>Spirits:</hi> For example, if you mix an Acid Spirit with the <hi>Salt</hi> of Tartar or ſome other Alkali, the edges of the Acid will ſo inſinuate into the pores of the <hi>Salt,</hi> that if by diſtillation you would ſeparate the Acid Spirit again from the <hi>Salt,</hi> you'l never be able to effect it, the <hi>Acid</hi> will have loſt almoſt all its ſtrength, becauſe the edges of theſe <hi>Spirits</hi> are ſo far deſtroyed or changed, that they no longer preſerve their former Figure.</p>
                  <p>Every body knows that <hi>glaſs</hi> is made of <hi>Salt,</hi> but becauſe the Fire hath wrought ſo great a change up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Texture, or Figure, it can do nothing at all that <hi>Salt</hi> is uſed to do; nay, and it is in a manner impoſſible to draw any <hi>true Salt</hi> from it by <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48366:19"/>There are three ſorts of Liquors that are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the name of <hi>Spirit</hi> in Chymiſtry; the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> the <hi>Burning ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> and the <hi>Acid ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt of them, as the ſpirit of Harts-horn, is nothing but a <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> diſſolved by a little <hi>Phlegm,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew when I treat of Animals. The ſecond, as the Spirit of Wine, the Spirit of Juniper, and the Spirit of Roſemary, is an exalted <hi>Oyl,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew ſpeaking of Wines. And the laſt, as the Spirit of Vinegar, Tartar, and Vitriol, is an Acid Eſſential ſalt, diſſolved and put in fuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the fire, as I ſhall prove, when I ſpeak of Vinegar, and the diſtillation of Tartar: this laſt is called a Fluid ſalt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three ſorts of liquors comprehending all that can any way be called <hi>Spirit,</hi> this may paſs for one <hi>Principle</hi> very well; for ſeeing that the <hi>Spirit</hi> which is drawn from Animals is nothing but a Salt diſſolved by a little Phlegm; that Spirit of Wine is only an Oyl exalted, and that the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> is a <hi>Salt</hi> become <hi>fluid,</hi> we can obſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in theſe liquors but an <hi>Oyl, Salts</hi> of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature, and <hi>water.</hi> Wherefore it muſt be concluded, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> which Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have talk'd of is a meer <hi>Chimaera,</hi> that ſerves only to confound mens minds, and render Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry unintelligible; for men might if they would, have called theſe liquors by more proper names: thus what hindred them from calling the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> by the name of a <hi>Volatile ſalt diſſolv'd?</hi> the liquors which come from <hi>Oyls</hi> might have been called an <hi>exalted Oyl;</hi> and the <hi>Acid ſpirits</hi> a <hi>Fluid ſalt;</hi> and hereby we ſhould not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48366:19"/>
have been troubled about an imaginary <hi>Principle,</hi> and Chymiſtry would have been better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>But it is impoſſible to change a name that has been ſo long fixt and appropriated to theſe liquors. All that I can do is to explicate, as I have done, what is meant by the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> in order to avoid Equivocations.</p>
                  <p>Nothing but the <hi>Oyl,</hi> can properly be ſaid to be <hi>Inflammable,</hi> and the <hi>Oyl</hi> is ſo much the more ſo, as the Salts, with which it is cloſely united, have been more or leſs ſpiritualized. For that which I call <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Oyl,</hi> is nothing but an Eſſential or Volatile Salt; this <hi>Salt</hi> is not of it ſelf <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable,</hi> but ſerves to Rarifie and Exalt the parts of the <hi>Oyl</hi> to render them the more ſuſceptible of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently of <hi>Flagration;</hi> after the ſame manner as when <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is put to mix with ſome Oily ſubſtance, this Oily matter fires much more eaſily than when it is alone; though <hi>Salt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of it ſelf is not at all <hi>Inflammable,</hi> as I ſhall prove hereafter. We have examples of the truth of what I ſay in <hi>Spirit of Wine, Oyl of Turpentine,</hi> and all other Inflammable Liquors; for they are only <hi>Oyls</hi> ſubtilized and refined by the Volatile Salts they contain. Vegetables have a great deal of Salt much like to Salt-peter; this Salt being ſtraitly united with their Oyl makes them the more apt to flame, than if they had been deprived of it. The Fat of Animals as well as their other parts, is full of a Volatile Acid ſalt; Wax, Roſine, and all other matters that are inflammable, are impregnated with an <hi>Acid Salt, Eſſential</hi> or <hi>Volatile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48366:20"/>I ſay the <hi>Salt</hi> which cauſes the flagration of <hi>Oyls,</hi> muſt be either <hi>Volatile</hi> or <hi>Eſſential,</hi> for if it were a <hi>fixt Salt,</hi> 'twould have a contrary effect, it would allay in ſome meaſure the quick motion of the parts of an Inflammable body; and this we ſee happens when <hi>Sea-ſalt</hi> is flung into the fire, it ſerves to put it out. <hi>Common Sulphur</hi> yields us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other inſtance of the ſame kind: conſiſting of one part Sulphureous or Oily, and another Saline or Acid fixt, which plainly appears in the opening of it, the Oily part fires, and would ſoon riſe like other Oils into a great white flame, but that the Acid part being a load to its activity hinders it from riſing, and ſo forces it to caſt but only a ſmall blue flame; and a proof of what I affirm may be had from mixing <hi>Salt-peter</hi> with <hi>Sulphur;</hi> for the <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> does <hi>Volatilize</hi> the <hi>Salts</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and cauſes a white flame to burn violently, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter in the Operation of <hi>Salt Polychreſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many things are called Oils very improperly, as the Oyl of Tartar made <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> the Oyl of Vitriol, and the Oyl of Antimony. The firſt is nothing elſe but a Salt diſſolved, the ſecond is the ſtrongeſt, and moſt cauſtick part of the ſpirit of Vitriol, and the laſt is a mixture of Acid Spirit, and Antimony.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Salt,</hi> I am apt to think, that there is one chief, of which all the reſt are compounded, and do conceive it to be made of an Acid liquor ſliding through the veins of the Earth, which doth inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly inſinuate and incorporate in the Pores of ſtones, which it does dilate and attenuate: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by a long fermentation and concoction of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48366:20"/>
ſeveral years, a <hi>Salt</hi> comes to be formed, that is called <hi>Foſſile;</hi> and this Opinion is the more likely to be true, becauſe from the mixture of <hi>Acids</hi> with ſome <hi>Alkali</hi> matter we always draw a ſubſtance very like unto <hi>Salt.</hi> Now ſtones are an <hi>Alkali.</hi> I add, that the long fermentation, and concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is made in the ſtone, ſerves to digeſt, and perfectly unite the <hi>Acid</hi> with the ſtony parts, for the making of <hi>Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Foſſile ſalt,</hi> which is called <hi>Gemma,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its tranſparency, is found in many high Mountains of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſuch as thoſe in <hi>Poland, Catalonia,</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> and in the <hi>Indies;</hi> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together like that we uſe for nouriſhment, which is called <hi>Sea ſalt,</hi> inſomuch that the Waters of the Sea may be ſaid to receive their ſaltiſhneſs from nothing elſe but this <hi>Salt</hi> diſſolved in them.</p>
                  <p>Is it not likely enough that the bottom of the <hi>Sea,</hi> or its ſhores, may be much like the ſurface of the Earth we inhabit, and that there may be Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Rocks, different ſorts of earth, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>inexhauſtible Mountains of Salt</hi> in a Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of places at the bottom of the Sea, whence it receives its brackiſhneſs?</p>
                  <p>And it may be there are Waters, which after taking Salt from ſeveral earths, do at laſt diſcharge themſelves into the Sea through an infinite number of ſubterranean channels, which do much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute likewiſe to making Sea-water ſalt.</p>
                  <p>That which confirms me in this opinion is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are <hi>Lakes</hi> in <hi>Italy, Germany, Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> and many other places, which are as <hi>Salt</hi> as the <hi>Sea,</hi> and can have no other cauſe but that their <hi>waters</hi> have hapned to run through <hi>Mines of Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48366:21"/>I doubt not but many will be apt to object againſt my opinion, that the <hi>Sea</hi> being of ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious boundleſs an extent, all the <hi>Salt</hi> I have ſpoken of, would not be able to ſalt it as it is; but if they pleaſe to conſider, that this great extent of the Ocean may meet with <hi>Mines of Salt</hi> in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of places, and that what is once diſſolv'd can never be ſeparated from it, I am perſwaded their doubt will ſoon vaniſh. Add to what is ſaid, that <hi>Sea water</hi> does not contain ſo great a quantity of Salt as is commonly imagined: and this is eaſily prov'd, if you take the pains to evaporate ſome of it over the fire, or diſſolve ſalt in that water; for it will receive a conſiderable quantity into it, which is a certain ſign, that the water was not ſo ſalt before, as it might have been, for if it had been impregnated with as much as it could, it would have diſſolv'd no more.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we have good reaſon to believe, that the <hi>Sea,</hi> which may be called a large <hi>Lake,</hi> becomes ſalt through the <hi>Mines</hi> that are therein, and the <hi>Salt Currents</hi> that in ſeveral places empty into it. Some Fountains are alſo ſeen to yield a <hi>Salt</hi> like this; becauſe their waters having paſſed through places fill'd with this <hi>Salt,</hi> have diſſolved and carried along with them ſome of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salt-peter</hi> differs from theſe ſalts I ſpeak of, in that it contains more <hi>ſpirit;</hi> ſo that when you take the pains to exalt a part of it, what remains is like unto <hi>Sal Gemme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be objected that <hi>Salt peter</hi> is found in places where no <hi>Acid</hi> liquor can be thought to come; but no body can doubt but that there is an <hi>Acid</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> which though a very inſenſible
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48366:21"/>
body, is able enough to enter into <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Earths,</hi> the truth whereof is ſeen every day in <hi>Earths</hi> that have loſt their <hi>Salt</hi> as much as could be drawn by Art, which upon being expoſed ſome time to the open air get new additions of <hi>Salt,</hi> and encreaſe their weight conſiderably. Now the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that I ſpeak of, which runs in ſome places of the earth, receives its <hi>Acidity</hi> from this <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> which condenſes in ſome places better than in others, by reaſon of the coolneſs, or ſome other diſpoſition it finds there.</p>
                  <p>I conceive therefore that <hi>Salt peter</hi> is form'd in <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Earths</hi> by the <hi>Acid ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> after the ſame manner as <hi>Sal Gemme</hi> in <hi>Mines</hi> by an <hi>Acid</hi> liquor, and that this <hi>Aerial acid</hi> entring inſenſibly into the body of <hi>ſtones</hi> produces a Salt at firſt much like <hi>Sal Gemme;</hi> but afterwards new <hi>Acid ſpirits</hi> ſtill coming and mixing with it makes it of a middle nature between <hi>Volatile</hi> and <hi>fixt.</hi> And it is for this reaſon that a great deal of <hi>Salt peter</hi> is taken from old ruined buildings, for the <hi>ſtones</hi> there continuing a long time expoſed to the air, receive greater quantity of <hi>ſpirits</hi> than other ſtones; it is likewiſe to be found in Cellers and other places where the Sun caſts no heat, becauſe the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the air does there eaſily condenſe by reaſon of the coolneſs and moiſture. But I ſhall diſcourſe more amply of that, when I come to treat of the Preparations that are made upon <hi>Salt peter.</hi>

                     <hi>Vitriols, Alums,</hi> and all other <hi>Salts,</hi> that are naturally found in the Earth, may be explicated upon the ſame Principle; for according as <hi>Acid liquors</hi> do meet with different earths, they produce different <hi>Salts.</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48366:22"/>
thing with other Fermentable matters as it is with Earths, they come to ferment by means of a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate quantity</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> mixed with them; for if you add too much, the Fermentation will be ſpoil'd.</p>
                  <p>Again, every kind of <hi>Salt</hi> is not fit to <hi>fertilize</hi> lands, it muſt be a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> or approaching to the nature of <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> to ſerve for Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a <hi>Salt</hi> too fixt would rather ſpoil it, and it has been obſerv'd that places which ſhould fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, have brought forth nothing, when <hi>Sea-ſalt</hi> has been ſprinkled upon them; the reaſon of which is for that this <hi>fixt Salt</hi> hinders the Fermentation that was neceſſary to fertilize.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs it ſometimes happens, that the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> though full of a <hi>fixt ſalt,</hi> do ſerve to <hi>fertilize;</hi> and this Countrey-men are well acquainted with, who in ſome places where they find their Lands too poor and barren to yield any thing without aſſiſtance of Art, do uſe at certain ſeaſons of the year to burn <hi>Fern</hi> and <hi>Turfs</hi> upon them, and ſpread about the aſhes. Now it is by reaſon of a <hi>Lixivious ſalt</hi> in the aſhes, that the <hi>Lands</hi> are hereby improv'd.</p>
                  <p>But this happens for the ſame reaſon as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the <hi>fixt Salt</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> that lies in the aſhes is very <hi>porous,</hi> as I ſhall prove hereafter; and ſo does very well mix with the <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>acid Salts</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> and turns eaſily into <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> as when <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is mixt with an <hi>Alkali ſalt,</hi> it makes a good <hi>Salt-peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>ſea-ſalt,</hi> poſſibly it might happen, that if it were left in the Earth for ſome conſiderable time, it would impregnate with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> and ſo being at length <hi>Volatilized</hi> would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48366:23"/>
render a place fertile. But becauſe it is a very compact body, and its parts cloſely united, the Volatilizing of it would be a tedious buſineſs, and ſo the preſent requiſite Fermentation failing, the place would remain barren too long to gratifie our expectations.</p>
                  <p>It is very likely that the <hi>Volatile</hi> or <hi>Nitrous ſalt</hi> meets in the Earth with ſome <hi>Sulphureous</hi> or fat matter, that is continually raiſed by the ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean heat toward the ſurface of the Earth, and unites with it. This <hi>mixture</hi> of a <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> together may much contribute towards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating the manner of <hi>Vegetation;</hi> for juſt as the mixture of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt-peter</hi> does excellently diſpoſe to an <hi>Exaltation</hi> by heat, which will not happen while they are ſeparated; ſo the Bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous or fat part of the earth mixing with Salt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which all Earths have, the ſubterranean heat exalts them much more eaſily, than if the Salt were alone. And now let us ſee what happens from this <hi>Exaltation</hi> to the production of Plants.</p>
                  <p>Some part of this <hi>Sulphureous ſalt,</hi> meeting with <hi>ſeed</hi> in the earth proper to grow, does enter into the <hi>ſeed,</hi> and cauſe a Fermentation, that is to ſay, ſuppling the parts of the <hi>ſeed,</hi> diſpoſes it to open it ſelf. Now 'tis very certain, (and what has been ſenſibly demonſtrated by Microſcopes) that each <hi>grain</hi> of <hi>ſeed</hi> contains in little the <hi>whole Plant</hi> with all its parts. Wherefore this opening the body of the <hi>ſeed</hi> is by reaſon that the <hi>ſulphureous ſalts</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring at the pores of the <hi>root</hi> of this ſmall <hi>Plant,</hi> and by their Volatile quality inſinuating along the Fibres which conſtitute the <hi>Plant,</hi> do orderly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play before us what was before but very confuſed in reſpect of us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48366:23"/>Theſe <hi>ſalts</hi> do never enter at the head of the Plant, and ſo deſcend to the Root, though often the Root of the Seed lies uppermoſt, and the head or ſtalk downwards, becauſe the Pores of the ſtalk are not of ſuch a Figure as is proper to receive them, whereas thoſe of the Root have a proper contexture.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Volatility</hi> of theſe <hi>Salts</hi> does alſo cauſe the ſtalk, though ſeated downwards, to riſe upwards, and follow their tendency, which is always up; and this is that which by extending and enlarging the Fibres of the Plant, makes it grow to that height which their nature requires.</p>
                  <p>'Tis probable that this fat part of earth inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the <hi>ſalt,</hi> as I have ſaid, does make the <hi>Oyl</hi> of a mixt body; for we find that thoſe matters which help beſt to fertilize, are full of <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> and <hi>Oyl,</hi> as <hi>Dung, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and <hi>Plants</hi> corrupted.</p>
                  <p>'Tis fit to obſerve here, that the <hi>ſalt</hi> does act after another-guiſe manner than the <hi>Oyl</hi> in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Fermentation or corruption of the matter it is mixed with; for it does not only ſtop the pores, and hinder the air from entring, but fixes it likewiſe by its hooked parts, that it can neither have motion nor rarefaction, for which reaſon it is that <hi>meat</hi> is ſalted in order to keep it ſweet, and does thereby remain firm and compact for ſome time.</p>
                  <p>Three kinds of <hi>ſalt</hi> are drawn from <hi>Vegetables,</hi> an <hi>Acid ſalt</hi> called Eſſential, a <hi>Volatile,</hi> and a <hi>Fixt ſalt.</hi> The firſt is ſometimes like <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and ſometimes like <hi>Tartar,</hi> according as it contains more or leſs earth; this <hi>ſalt</hi> is drawn from the <hi>juice</hi> of the <hi>Plant,</hi> as I ſaid before; for after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48366:24"/>
and purifying this <hi>juice,</hi> it is ſet in a veſſel in ſome cool place a few daies without ſtirring, and the <hi>ſalt</hi> ſhoots into <hi>Cryſtals</hi> every way. This <hi>Acid ſalt</hi> may be ſaid to be the <hi>true ſalt</hi> that was in the <hi>Plant,</hi> becauſe the means that are uſed in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it are <hi>Natural,</hi> and ſuch as cannot change its nature; but this can't be ſaid of thoſe others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the violent fires that are uſed about them make impreſſions of another nature, and their effects are very different, ſo that the fire ſeems to alter and diſguiſe them, as I ſhall ſhew in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>ſalt,</hi> or the <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> is uſually drawn from <hi>ſeeds</hi> or <hi>fruits</hi> Fermented. While it remains in the <hi>Vegetable,</hi> it differs from the <hi>Eſſential ſalt</hi> only in this, that being driven up higher by <hi>Spirits,</hi> it becomes more <hi>Volatile.</hi> The <hi>Fermentation</hi> that is cauſed in fruits by beating and bruiſing them, does very much aſſiſt us in <hi>Volatilizing</hi> the <hi>ſalt;</hi> for it ſets the particles at work, and diſpoſes them for an eaſier ſeparation; but it happens that in the great circulation, or continual motion this <hi>ſalt</hi> is in, it unites ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the <hi>Oyl,</hi> which Fruits and Seeds are full of, that they can't be ſeparated by <hi>Cryſtallizing</hi> the <hi>juice,</hi> as they can in drawing them from other parts of the <hi>Plant.</hi> We muſt therefore have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the help of fire. The <hi>fruit</hi> or <hi>ſeed</hi> which contains the <hi>Volatile ſalt,</hi> as I ſhall prove in its proper place, is Diſtilled by a <hi>Retort,</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> comes forth in the firſt place, then an <hi>Oyl,</hi> and laſtly a moſt keen ill ſcented <hi>ſalt</hi> (that eaſily flies away) upon encreaſing the fire to purpoſe, is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the <hi>Receiver.</hi> Now it is plain that fire has
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48366:24"/>
chang'd, or elſe added ſomething to this <hi>ſalt;</hi> for when it was in the <hi>Plant,</hi> it had no manner of ſmell like that it gets by <hi>diſtillation.</hi> But to ſhew there's a ſtrange <hi>alteration</hi> in this <hi>ſalt,</hi> as ſoon as it is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an <hi>Acid,</hi> there preſently appears an <hi>Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>Efferveſcency,</hi> which remains until the <hi>Acid</hi> has throughly entred into the <hi>ſalt.</hi> Which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance does not happen to it in its <hi>Natural</hi> ſtate, it is this <hi>Ebullition</hi> that gave it the name of a <hi>Volatile Alkali,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from a <hi>Fixt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. The <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> will needs have this <hi>Volatile Alkali</hi> to be in the <hi>Plant,</hi> juſt the ſame as when it is drawn; that is to ſay, they make this a different <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>ſalt,</hi> lying hid under the <hi>acid,</hi> until it is laid open by the force of fire. But this opinion is founded on no credible experience, for <hi>Anatomize</hi> the <hi>Plant</hi> how you think fit, without uſing fire, and you ſhall never find any other but an <hi>acid ſalt.</hi> Doubtleſs it will be ſaid, that all other ways of diſſecting <hi>Plants</hi> even into their <hi>ſalts,</hi> prove too weak without the aſſiſtance of this grand diſſolvent fire. But if we conſider impartially how fire does act, we ſhall be forced to acknowledge that it rather deſtroys, and confounds the greateſt part of the bodies it opens, and does not leave them in the <hi>natural</hi> ſtate they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and eſpecially when it is driven with that force which is neceſſary to draw this <hi>ſalt.</hi> So that I ſee no reaſon why the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things ſhould be <hi>multiplied</hi> without neceſſity, by admitting many kinds of <hi>ſalts</hi> in Plants, and I conceive with much more probability, that the <hi>Volatile Alkali ſalt</hi> is a part of the <hi>Acid Eſſential ſalt</hi> I ſpoke of, which having been firſt diſpoſed to a <hi>Volatile</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48366:25"/>
and afterwards driven by the force of fire, draws along with it a portion of <hi>Empyreumatical</hi> Oil, that gives it ſuch a diſagreeable ſmell, and ſome terreſtrious calcined matter, with which it is ſo ſtrongly united, and which changes its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by breaking the <hi>Saline</hi> points, and rendring them <hi>Porous,</hi> ſo that any <hi>acid</hi> liquor being caſt upon it, enters into the Pores, and violently divides the parts, whence follows the <hi>Efferveſcency.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance likewiſe this <hi>Calx</hi> or Calcined earth may have retained igneous particles, and ſo the edges of the <hi>acid</hi> beginning to open the pores of <hi>ſalt,</hi> theſe little igneous bodies being in a violent motion do ſtrike about, and break open all their ſmall priſons, and from thence it may be, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Ebullition</hi> happens. Such as are prejudiced with the Sentiments of ancient <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> will relliſh very hardly this new Opinion of mine; but I am perſwaded if any one will take the pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter near at hand, and make ſome <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments</hi> on the <hi>ſalts</hi> of Plants, he will find my Diſcourſe come near enough to truth.</p>
                  <p>The laſt <hi>ſalt</hi> or the <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> of Plants remains mixed with the earthy part after <hi>Diſtillation</hi> of the other ſubſtances; the matter is taken out of the <hi>Retort,</hi> and calcined in an open fire, for to free it from the <hi>ſoot</hi> that blackens it; afterwards the <hi>ſalt</hi> is drawn by a <hi>Lixivium</hi> as I have ſhewn before. This <hi>ſalt</hi> is called fixt, in compariſon with others, becauſe this cannot <hi>ſublime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that becauſe a great quantity of this kind of <hi>ſalt</hi> is drawn from a plant called <hi>Kali,</hi> the name <hi>Alkali</hi> has been given to the fixt ſalt of all plants; and that becauſe an efferveſcency
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48366:25"/>
does riſe upon mixing an <hi>acid</hi> liquor with this Salt, all Volatile or fixt ſalts, and all <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrious</hi> matters which ferment with <hi>acids,</hi> have come to be called <hi>Alkali's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chymiſts</hi> do aſſure us, but with little foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for it, that in Terreſtrious bodies, in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, Coral, Pearl,</hi> and generally in all bodies that Ferment with <hi>acids,</hi> there is an hidden <hi>Alkali</hi> in them, which is one of the Principles of <hi>Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> wherefore they give them the names of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali's;</hi> but becauſe no manner of <hi>Salt</hi> can be drawn from them, to prove their Opinion, and they have no other rational Argument to perſwade me, they muſt give me leave to think otherwiſe than they have done, and I conceive that the contrary to what they have eſtabliſhed will ſerve me better to explicate the truth.</p>
                  <p>Following therefore the <hi>Principle</hi> I have laid, I believe that thoſe Terreſtrious bodies are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Alkali's,</hi> rather than that the <hi>Ebullition</hi> of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali</hi> proceeds from a <hi>ſalt</hi> ſuppoſed to be contained in them; and further that the <hi>ſalts</hi> are never <hi>Alkali's</hi> until they have undergone the force of fire, and been reduced into a <hi>Calx.</hi> I have proved, ſpeaking of the nature of <hi>Volatile ſalt,</hi> that the fire did very much change the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things; and as I have ſhewn there is good reaſon to think there is but only one <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>ſalt</hi> in Plants, and the <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> is but a change wrought by fire; I ſhall proceed upon the ſame <hi>Principle,</hi> and affirm that there is no fixt <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali ſalt</hi> in Plants, but that by <hi>Calcination</hi> the fire has fixt a part of the <hi>acid Eſſential ſalt</hi> with the earthy part that has ſerv'd to break the keeneſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48366:26"/>
of its points, and rendred them Porous, like a <hi>Calx.</hi> It is by reaſon of theſe Pores that this kind of <hi>ſalt</hi> grows humid, and melts ſo eaſily when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Air; and the Terreſtrious parts do turn it into an <hi>Alkali,</hi> for if they were not mixed with it, it would continue ſtill an <hi>acid ſalt,</hi> and oppoſed to <hi>Alkali.</hi> But to clear up this point the better, we muſt conſider as nicely as may be the nature of an <hi>Acid</hi> and an <hi>Alkali.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas the nature of a thing ſo obſcure as that of <hi>ſalt,</hi> cannot better be explicated, than by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to its parts ſuch figures as are anſwerable to the effects it produces; I ſhall affirm, that the <hi>acidity</hi> of any liquor does conſiſt in keen particles of <hi>ſalts,</hi> put in motion; and I hope no body will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to diſpute whether an <hi>acid</hi> has points or no, ſeeing every ones experience does demonſtrate it, they need but taſte an <hi>acid</hi> to be ſatisfied of it, for it pricks the tongue like any thing keen, and finely cut; but a demonſtrative and convincing proof that an <hi>acid</hi> does conſiſt of pointed parts is, that not only all <hi>acid ſalts</hi> do <hi>Cryſtallize</hi> into edges, but all Diſſolutions of different things, cauſed by <hi>acid</hi> liquours, do aſſume this figure in their <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallization;</hi> theſe <hi>Cryſtalls</hi> conſiſt of points differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in length and bigneſs one from another, and this diverſity muſt be attributed to the keener or blunter edges of the different ſorts of <hi>acids;</hi> and ſo likewiſe this difference of the points in ſubtilty is the cauſe that one <hi>acid</hi> can penetrate and diſſolve well one ſort of <hi>mixt,</hi> that another can't rarifie at all: thus <hi>Vinegar</hi> diſſolves <hi>Lead,</hi> which <hi>aqua fortis</hi> can't: <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> diſſolves <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> which <hi>Vinegar</hi> will not touch: <hi>Aqua
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48366:26"/>
Regalis</hi> diſſolves <hi>Gold,</hi> whenas <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> cannot meddle with it; on the contrary <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves <hi>Silver,</hi> but can do nothing with <hi>Gold,</hi> and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Alkali's,</hi> they are ſoon known by pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>acid</hi> upon them, for preſently or ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there riſes a violent <hi>Ebullition,</hi> which remains until the <hi>acid</hi> finds no more bodies to rarifie. This effect may make us reaſonably conjecture that an <hi>Alkali</hi> is a terreſtrious and ſolid matter, whoſe <hi>pores</hi> are figured after ſuch a manner that the <hi>acid</hi> points entring into them do ſtrike and divide whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever oppoſes their motion; and according as the parts of which the <hi>Alkali</hi> is compounded, are more or leſs ſolid, the <hi>acids</hi> finding more or leſs reſiſtance, do cauſe a ſtronger or weaker <hi>Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So we ſee the <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> that happens in the diſſolution of <hi>Coral</hi> is very much milder than that in the diſſolution of <hi>Silver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are as many different <hi>Alkali's,</hi> as there are bodies that have different pores, and this is the reaſon why an <hi>acid</hi> will Ferment with one ſtrongly, and with another not at all; for there muſt be a due proportion between the <hi>acid</hi> points, and the <hi>pores</hi> of the <hi>Alkali.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The nature of <hi>Alkali's</hi> being thus eſtabliſhed, there will be no need of flying to an imaginary <hi>ſalt</hi> in Plants for explication of the <hi>Efferveſcency;</hi> and 'twill be eaſily conceived that if an <hi>Alkali ſalt</hi> is full of a terreſtrious matter that renders it porous like other <hi>Alkali</hi>'s, it muſt cauſe an <hi>Ebullition.</hi> That which I ſaid, ſpeaking of Volatile <hi>ſalts,</hi> may here be added, that the Igneous particles breaking in through the Pores of the Alkali <hi>ſalt,</hi> wherein
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48366:27"/>
they became impriſoned by the Calcination, do much contribute to the raiſing this <hi>Efferveſcency.</hi> And really when the Acid Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is caſt upon an <hi>Alkali ſalt,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens as ſtrong an <hi>Ebullition,</hi> as when this liquor is flung into the fire it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Acid Salts do rarely cauſe any efferveſcency with Acid liquors, becauſe their pores being very ſmall, the common acids are not able to pierce into them; but we do ſometimes meet with Acids whoſe points are ſo fine and ſo proportioned to the pores of the Salts, that they will find an entrance even into the exceeding little pores of theſe Acid Salts, and thereby cauſe a commotion. And then theſe Salts, although they be Acid, yet may be called Alkali's in reſpect of ſuch keen Acids. This does happen to Sea-ſalt, which is an Acid, for though it will make no Ebullition, neither with Spirit of <hi>ſalt,</hi> nor with Spirit of <hi>Niter,</hi> nor with Spirit of <hi>Alom,</hi> nor with Spirit of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> yet if you mix it with the ſtrongeſt Oil of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> there will riſe an Efferveſcency. Wherefore it may be ſaid that one Acid Salt is an Alkali in reſpect of another, becauſe there being few bodies without ſome pores, few of them will prove to be impenetrable, when they meet with Acids of an extraordinary ſubtlety.</p>
                  <p>The Fermentation that happens to <hi>Dow,</hi> to new <hi>Wine,</hi> and ſuch like things, differs from that I now ſpoke of, in that it is more gentle, and ſlow; this is cauſed by the Natural Acid <hi>ſalt</hi> contained in them, which expanding and exalting it ſelf by its motion, does rarifie and raiſe up the groſſer and ſulphureous part which endeavours to allay its
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48366:27"/>
motion, from whence it comes that the matter ſwells up.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why an Acid does not make Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous things Ferment, with ſo much noiſe and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs as Alkali's, is, becauſe that <hi>Oyls</hi> conſiſt of pliant parts that yield and make no reſiſtance to the points of Acids, as a piece of <hi>Wool</hi> or <hi>Cotton</hi> will yield and give way to needles that are thruſt into it. Thus methinks two ſorts of <hi>Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> may be admitted of, the one of an Acid with an Alkali, which may be called <hi>Ebullition,</hi> and the other, when an Acid does by little and little rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſome ſoftiſh matter, as <hi>Dow,</hi> or clear and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous, as <hi>Muſte, Syder,</hi> and all other juices of Plants. This laſt ſort may rather be called <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is further remarkable that the Acid and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali do ſo deſtroy one another in their conflict, that when as much Acid has been by degrees pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as is neceſſary to penetrate the Alkali in all its parts, it is then no more an Alkali, nor can it be ſo again, though you waſh it to carry off the Acid, becauſe it has no longer that <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of <hi>Pores</hi> which is requiſite in an Alkali; and the Acid breaks and loſes its points in the conteſt, eſpecially when the Alkali is pretty compact and ſolid; ſo that if you would recover your Acid again, you'l find it has in a manner loſt all its acidity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains only a ſharpneſs. But the <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Oyl</hi> conſiſting of ſupple yielding parts does only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome Acid impreſſion, and no ſuch cloſe union, ſo that it can be drawn from Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous bodies much the ſame as when it was mixt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48366:28"/>Animals do yield us two ſorts of <hi>Salt,</hi> the one Volatile, and the other Fixt; of the firſt ſort they yield greater quantity than of the ſecond, becauſe they do abound much in Spirits, which by their continual circulation do Volatilize it. This <hi>Salt</hi> differs but little from the Volatile ſalt of <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> both which are drawn in a <hi>Retort;</hi> they have the ſame kind of ſmell, taſte, and other virtues. The Volatile ſalt of <hi>Animals</hi> keeps dry a longer time than the others, becauſe it carries away with it more <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> than thoſe others. As for fixt ſalt, <hi>animals</hi> do yield but a very little of it, and in ſome <hi>animals</hi> you ſhall find none at all; it is drawn as the <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> of Plants; they are both Alkali's.</p>
                  <p>There is no <hi>ſalt</hi> that can be called alkali, to be found in the parts, or humors of <hi>Animals,</hi> until they have paſſed the fire; a Saline ſeroſity may be obſerved in them, but that ſalt is <hi>acid;</hi> and it proceeds doubtleſs from the Aliments that are taken for nouriſhment. Now as I have ſhewn that there is only an <hi>acid ſalt</hi> in <hi>Earths</hi> and <hi>Vegetables,</hi> ſo I may ſay the ſame of <hi>Animals,</hi> and the rather becauſe no other kind of Salt can be found in them in their Natural ſtate; the alkali ſalts that are drawn from them, are only ſeveral mutations of an acid ſalt, made by fire, which mingles with them earthy particles after the manner I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of treating of the Alkali's of Plants. But it is obſervable, that whereas there is a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Spirits in Animals than Seeds, theſe Spirits do ſerve to exalt all the Salt; which is the reaſon that leſs fixt ſalt is to be found in Animals than Plants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48366:28"/>As for what many do ſay that <hi>Choler</hi> cauſes an Efferveſcency like an Alkali, when an <hi>acid</hi> is caſt upon it, 'tis a miſtake through want of right Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, for no Ebullition at all happens for ſome time. Nevertheleſs I will not ſay, that an <hi>acid</hi> produces no Fermentation in <hi>Choler, Bloud,</hi> and other parts of the body, for it does very often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do that; but that is no more than uſes to be done in new <hi>Wine, Beer,</hi> and other liquors of the like nature. I have already explicated this ſort of <hi>Fermentation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ought not to omit ſpeaking of the <hi>Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that's made in Milk after a <hi>Fermentation</hi> cauſed either by <hi>Heat,</hi> or ſome <hi>Acid</hi> put into it.</p>
                  <p>Methinks here is no need at all of ſuppoſing an Alkali ſalt, that ferments with the <hi>Acid</hi> of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as many ſuppoſe for explicating this Effect, ſince if we conſider but the natural compoſition of <hi>Milk,</hi> we ſhall find it to be nothing but a Creamy ſubſtance ſwimming on the <hi>Serum,</hi> and mixed only ſuperficially with it, by the intermixture of ſome ſalt; ſo that it is in a fitting ſtate of ſeparation, as ſoon as the ſalt gains a little more motion than it had, whether it be by <hi>Fermentation,</hi> or by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing its activity by an <hi>acid</hi> of its own nature. Thus when the heat of the Summer, or fire has ſtirred up the <hi>acid</hi> that is in the Milk, or elſe ſome <hi>acid</hi> is poured into it, the edges of the <hi>acid</hi> do cut and divide the Creamy part, to gain a free moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>Serum,</hi> and ſeparate into <hi>Curd</hi> all the Butter and Cheeſe. Now there's nothing ſtrange in the <hi>Precipitation</hi> of the <hi>Curd,</hi> eſpecially when an <hi>acid</hi> has been poured upon the Milk, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the weight it gains by thickning, ſome part
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48366:29"/>
of the <hi>acids</hi> do mix with it, and encreaſe its weight; for according as the <hi>acid</hi> that was ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led is ſtronger or weaker, the <hi>Curd</hi> does <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> more or leſs.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome will ſay, for as much as <hi>acid</hi> is always the cauſe of <hi>Coagulation</hi> in Milk, there's no great likelihood that a ſalt of the ſame nature ſhould be the inſtrument of uniting the ſeveral parts of <hi>Milk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it muſt be conſidered, that although there is an <hi>acid</hi> in <hi>Milk</hi> (as no body can doubt, ſeeing it ſowres of it ſelf, when ſtale) this <hi>acid</hi> is as it were imbodied in the ramous parts of the <hi>Oyl,</hi> ſo that there is loſes all its motion and cannot come to action but by rarifying the <hi>Oyl,</hi> and making it fit to mix with the <hi>ſerous</hi> part; it is the due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of this <hi>ſalt, Oyl,</hi> and <hi>ſerum,</hi> that makes the <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheeſy</hi> part of Milk.</p>
                  <p>Now I hope I have ſaid enough to eſtabliſh what I have affirmed, that there's no ſalt in nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>acid,</hi> out of which all other Salts are made, and that the Alkali ſalt has no <hi>Natural exiſtence</hi> in mixt bodies. My diſcourſe will be the better reliſhed when I ſpeak of the Operations of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, and you'l find that by this <hi>Principle,</hi> which I may call the moſt Natural and impartial of all that have been laid till now, I ſhall be able to give account of many <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> that have never been explicated by common Principles.</p>

               <head>Of Chymical Furnaces and Veſſels.</head>
               <p>It is not my deſign to relate here exactly all the kinds of Veſſels and Furnaces that Artiſts have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to uſe in Chymiſtry. I ſhall deſcribe only thoſe with which you will be able to perform all Operations, and ſend curious perſons, who would be more particularly inſtructed in them, into the Laboratories, where they may learn more on this ſubject than ever they will be able to do by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting all the Books in the world. Theſe then are the principal.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Furnace</hi> which is moſt in uſe among Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts is that which is called the <hi>Reverberatory;</hi> it muſt be large enough to hold a great Retort, for the Diſtillation of acid Spirits, and other things. This Furnace muſt be fixt, and made of Brick, joyned together with a Lute compounded of one part of Potters earth, ſo much Horſe-dung, and twice as much Sand, the whole kneaded together in Water; let it be two Bricks breadth, that the Furnace being the thicker, the heat may be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the longer: let the Aſh-hole be a Foot high, and the Door contrived, if poſſible, on the ſide that the air comes, that when you have a mind to open it, the Fire may be lighted or encreaſed the more eaſily; the fire room need not be quite ſo high; you muſt lay a-croſs it two Iron-bars of the bigneſs of your thumb, which will ſerve you to ſet your Retort upon; and the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace muſt be ſtill raiſed near about a Foot higher, to cover the Retort; fit to it a Dome, or Cover,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48366:30"/>
that may have a hole in the middle with its ſtopple, and a ſmall Chimny a foot high, for to place upon this hole, when the ſtopple is taken out, and when you would raiſe a great heat; for the flame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving its ſelf by means of this little Chimney, it reverberates the more ſtrongly upon the Retort. This Cover may be made of the ſame Paſte, that I ſhall preſently deſcribe, ſpeaking of Portable Furnaces.</p>
               <p>It will be neceſſary to have ſeveral Furnaces of this ſame faſhion; but they muſt be of different ſizes, to work conveniently according to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Veſſel you would place in it. For that the Fire may act more vehemently upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, there muſt be left but only the ſpace of a fingers breadth all round between the Furnace and the Retort. Theſe Furnaces may alſo ſerve for Diſtilling by the Refrigeratory, in the Sea-Bath, the Vaporous and the Sand-bath; for you may place the Copper body upon the Iron bars, when you would diſtil by the Refrigeratory. It is eaſie to do the ſame with the <hi>Balneum Mariae.</hi> As for the Sand-bath, lay an iron or earthen pan on the bars, and put ſand enough into it for to cover the bottom and ſides of the Veſſel you deſire to heat.</p>
               <p>As for Fuſions, you muſt build a Furnace of the ſame matter and form as thoſe ſpoken of before; only you muſt forbear laying the two Iron bars in it, that you did in the others, for ſupport of the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>Moveable Furnaces are made of a paſte that conſiſts of three parts of broken pots in powder, and two parts of clay temper'd together with Water. Their ſtructure is juſt like that of the</p>

               <p>You muſt be ſure to put ſand, or broken pots, or ſuch like things into the Paſte that you uſe for the building Furnaces, either fixt, or moveable, to hinder them from cracks, when they come to dry; for theſe matters rendring the clay more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, the wet breaths out much the more eaſily.</p>
               <p>Again, Lime and Sand tempered together, might ſerve for the building your fixt Furnaces, and ſtones might be uſed inſtead of bricks; but becauſe it is neceſſary to increaſe and leſſen the Furnaces, to proportion their ſize to the veſſels you would place in them, the deſcription which I gave before is the more convenient, for that a man may very eaſily break them, and build them again, without the help of a Brick-layer.</p>

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48366:35"/>A ſmall Iron Furnace with its iron pot, and a cover to it, is convenient for performing many operations; this pot may ſerve for a <hi>Balneum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> and for a Vaporous Bath, when there is no other. It may be likewiſe uſed to diſtil by an Alembick, in a Bath of Sand, Aſhes, or of filings of Iron. See the deſcription of it in the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>A great Iron Furnace ſhould likewiſe be had, whereon to place a Copper <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> for to diſtil with four bodies at once. In the middle of this Bath there ſhould be a pipe raiſed, the top of which muſt be made like a Funnel, into which you are to pour hot water, in place of that which conſumes away in vapour. See its figure in the third Table.</p>
               <p>As for Veſſels chuſe them as much as may be of Earth or Glaſs; for it is to be feared that thoſe which are made of Metal will communicate ſome particular impreſſion to the Liquors you put into them: but becauſe ſometimes you may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſtil a great many things in a little time, you may uſe the Copper-Cucurbit, or Body Tinn'd, becauſe that Tinn is not ſo ſoluble as Copper, and beſides hath no ſuch pernicious quality: upon this Cucurbit place a fit head, round about which muſt be made a kind of baſon to hold the water that cools and condenſes the vapours which riſe from the Matter contained in the <hi>Veſica</hi> ſo ſoon as it is heated. See its deſcription in the ſecond Table.</p>
               <p>You may likewiſe provide a Copper pipe tinn'd o'th' inſide, which may paſs ſloping downwards through a veſſel fill'd with water; and when you would diſtil Eſſences with it, you muſt fit the upper
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48366:35"/>
end of it to the noſe of the head, and the lower end of it to the mouth of the Receiver; but you muſt remember to empty the water out of the veſſel, according as it grows hot, for to cool the liquor that is diſtilling; and to this end there muſt be a hole made at the bottom of the veſſel, to be ſtopt with a wooden ſtopple, which may be taken out, and put in again, as often as you would let out the water.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moor's head</hi> is a Copper cap tinn'd on the inſide, made like to a head. See the figure of it in the firſt Table.</p>
               <p>Many Retorts of different ſizes are neceſſary in a Laboratory; thoſe which are of Earth are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the diſtillation of Acid Spirits, becauſe they are able to endure the utmoſt degree of Fire, and will not melt as glaſs do. The Veſſels made of Earth have their pores as cloſe as glaſs it ſelf, and preſerve the Spirits as well. They who want Earthen Veſſels may coat their glaſs Retorts with the Lute that I ſhall deſcribe hereafter, that if the glaſs ſhould melt, when they are diſtilling Acid Spirits, the Lute may preſerve the matter ſafe.</p>
               <p>Earthen, and Glaſs Cucurbits, with their heads, do ſerve for a great many Operations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matraſſes</hi> both great and ſmall, when they are fitted to the noſe of a Limbeck, are called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers;</hi> at other times we put things into them to digeſt: and they are alſo fit for ſublimations. When the neck of one <hi>Matraſs</hi> is put into the neck of another, they are called a <hi>double veſſel,</hi> and this is done when we deſire to circulate Spirits, but then the junctures muſt be very well luted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48366:36"/>You muſt alſo provide many large capacious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipients</hi> for the Diſtillation of Acid Spirits by a Retort. They muſt be ſo very large, that the Spirits may have room to Circulate the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lingots</hi> are Iron molds of divers ſhapes, into which melted Metals are wont to be poured, in order to harden in the form that we would have them. That which is uſed for the making <hi>Lapis infernalis</hi> muſt conſiſt of two pieces joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with two little Iron rings, and the melted matter is poured into the upper part of it. See its figure in the ſecond Table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coppels</hi> are porous veſſels made in form of a cup, to be uſed for the trying and purifying of Gold and Silver. They are made of Aſhes well waſht, or of bones calcined. See their figure in the ſecond Table.</p>
               <p>Aſhes deprived of their ſalts are rather uſed than others, for the compoſition of this ſort of veſſels, that they may be made the more porous, by ſuch deprivation. See the Chapter concerning Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Silver by the Coppel, and the Remarks upon it.</p>
               <p>Many glaſs Funnels great and ſmall, Viols of glaſs, Crucibles, Pans, Mortars of glaſs or ſtone, or Marble or Iron, muſt not be forgotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aludels</hi> muſt alſo have a place there; they are Pots without a bottom, joyned together, and are placed over another Pot with a whole in the middle, to ſerve for Sublimations.</p>

               <head>Of Lutes.</head>
               <p>The Fire is often raiſed to ſo high a degree as will melt glaſs Retorts in a Reverberatory Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, wherefore it will be convenient to coat them over with ſuch a Lute, as when dry is able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and contain the matter that is put into them to be diſtill'd. This Lute may be made after the manner which follows.</p>
               <p>Take Sand, the droſs of Iron, Potters earth in powder, of each five pounds, horſe-dung cut ſmall a pound, glaſs beaten into powder, and Sea-ſalt, of each four ounces, mix them all, and with a ſufficient quantity of water make a Paſte or Lute, with which you muſt coat the Retort all round, to half its neck, and ſo ſet it a drying. This ſame Lute will ſerve to ſtop cloſe the junctures of the neck of the Retort with the Recipient; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when it dries, it grows exceeding hard, and it proves difficult to unlute it, it is needful to wet it with wet clothes, when you would take the Retort aſunder from the Receiver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lute</hi> that I commonly uſe my ſelf for ſuch occaſions, is compounded only of two parts of Sand, and one of clay tempered together with water.</p>
               <p>As for the conjunction of Limbecks, ordinary Glue upon paper will ſerve turn: but when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very ſpirituous is diſtilled, ſuch as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, uſe a wet Bladder, which carries a Glue along with it, that ſticks very well. But if the bladder happens to be eaten or corroded by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48366:37"/>
the Spirits, have recourſe to the following Glue.</p>
               <p>Take Flower, and Lime ſlackt, of each an ounce, Potters-earth in powder half an ounce, mix them, and make a moiſt Paſte with a ſufficient quantity of the Whites of Eggs well beaten before hand with a little water. This Paſte may likewiſe ſerve to ſtop the cracks that happen in glaſs veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, there muſt be three lays of the Paſte bound on with paper.</p>
               <p>To Seal Hermetically, is to ſtop the mouth or neck of a Glaſs-Veſſel with a pair of Pincers heated red hot. To do this, the neck is heated by little and little with burning coals, and the fire is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and continued, until the Glaſs is ready to melt. This way of ſealing a Veſſel is uſed, when you have put ſome matter within it that is eaſie to be exalted, and you have a mind to make it Circulate.</p>

               <head>Of the Degrees of Fire.</head>
               <p>To make a Fire of the Firſt Degree, two or three coals lighted will ſuffice to raiſe a moſt gentle heat.</p>
               <p>For the Fire of the ſecond degree, three or four coals will ſerve, to give ſuch a heat as is able ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to warm the Veſſel, but ſo as a hand may be able to endure it for ſome time.</p>
               <p>For the Fire of the Third degree, you muſt cauſe heat enough to make a Pot boil, that is fill'd with five or ſix quarts of water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48366:37"/>For the Fourth Degree, you muſt uſe Coals and Wood together, enough to give the moſt extream heat of all.</p>
               <p>The Fire of Sand, of the filings of Iron, and of Aſhes, is made, when the Veſſel that contains the matter that is to be heated is covered underneath and on all ſides with Sand, or the filings of Iron, or with Aſhes; this is done to heat the Veſſel the more gently.</p>
               <p>All theſe Fires have their Degrees, but the Aſh-fire is the mildeſt, becauſe the Aſhes cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo great a heat as the others.</p>
               <p>The Reverberatory Fire is made in a cloſe Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, that the heat or flame which always tends upwards, may reverberate or return upon the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which is placed on two Iron bars. This fire hath its Degrees, but may be raiſed to a greater violence than the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Wheel fire, for Fuſion, is made when with lighted coals you encompaſs all round a Crucible, that holds the matter you deſire to melt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Balneum Mariae</hi> is, when an Alembick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the matter that is to be heated, is placed in a Veſſel filled with Water, under which the Fire is made; thus the water growing hot, heats the matter contained in the Alembick.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Amalgamate</hi> is to mix Mercury with ſome melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Metal; this Operation ſerves to render the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fit to be extended on ſome Works, as Gold, or elſe to reduce it into a very ſubtile powder, which is done by putting the <hi>Amalgame</hi> into a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible over the Fire: for the Mercury ſubliming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air leaves the Metal in an impalpable powder; neither Iron nor Copper can by any means be <hi>Amalgamated.</hi>

                  <hi>Cement</hi> is a manner of purifying Gold.

               <p>
                  <hi>Circulation</hi> is a motion given to liquors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a double veſſel, excited by fire, and cauſing the vapours to aſcend and deſcend to and fro.

                  <hi>Coagulate,</hi> is to give a conſiſtence to liquids, by evaporating ſome part of them over the fire, or elſe by mixing liquors together that are of a different nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cohobate</hi> ſignifies to repeat the Diſtillation of the ſame liquor, having poured it again upon the matter that remains in the Veſſel. This Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is uſed to open Bodies, or to Volatilize the Spirits.</p>

               <p>To Diſtil <hi>per aſcenſum,</hi> is, when fire is put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Veſſel that contains the matter which is to be heated.</p>
               <p>To Diſtil <hi>per deſcenſum,</hi> is, when fire is placed over the matter that is to be heated; for then the moiſt parts being rarified, and the vapour which riſes from them not being able to ariſe away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as it would do if not hindred, it precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and diſtils at the bottom of the veſſel.</p>

            <p>The growth of <hi>Minerals</hi> proceeds from an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation, or from ſeveral veins of congeled Waters, that do as it were glue together, and theſe veins are the cauſe that all the adjacent parts have their <hi>Sinus,</hi> and meetings a travers one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not running directly downwards.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Sinus,</hi> like ſo many joints, are of great help to Labourers to cut in the Quarries; for by thoſe cavities the ſtones are in great meaſure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated before hand, whereas 'twould be extream hard working them out, if nature had not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.</p>
            <p>The growth of <hi>Minerals</hi> is very different from that of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and <hi>Animals;</hi> for whereas the

            <p>
               <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> have conceited that there was ſo great an affinity and correſpondence between the Seven <hi>Metals</hi> before named, and the ſeven <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> that nothing hapned to the one, but the others ſhared in it; they made this correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to happen through an infinite number of little bodies that paſs to and from each of them; and they ſuppoſe theſe corpuſcles to be ſo figured that they can eaſily paſs through the pores of the <hi>Planet</hi> and <hi>Metal</hi> they repreſent, but cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into other bodies becauſe their pores are not figured properly to receive them; or elſe if they do chance to get admittance into other bodies, they can't fix and ſtay there to contribute any nouriſhment; for they do imagine that the <hi>Metal</hi> is <hi>nouriſhed</hi> and perfected by the <hi>Influence</hi> that comes from its <hi>Planet,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Planet</hi> again the ſame from the <hi>Metal.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee in ſhort what ſome of the moſt <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Aſtrologers</hi> do fancy concerning <hi>Metals,</hi> and they draw conſequences from hence, which 'twould be too long here to relate. I have told you what the ſobereſt among them ſay; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſo abſurd as what ſome of them would have us believe.</p>
            <p>'Tis no hard matter to diſprove theſe conceits, and ſhew how groundleſs they are; for no body ever yet got near enough to the <hi>Planets,</hi> to ſatisfie himſelf whether they are really of the ſame nature with <hi>Metals,</hi> or whither any <hi>Effluviums</hi> of bodies do fall from them to us.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs if we could be ſatisfied that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience did confirm what theſe perſons have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to maintain, we might then have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think there were ſome likelihood in their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48366:42"/>
doctrine, although their principles were found to be altogether falſe; but in truth there's nothing to confirm their Opinion, and we find it every day plain enough, that the Faculties and Virtues are utterly falſe, which they do attribute to the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> and <hi>Metals;</hi> the <hi>Metals</hi> indeed are of good uſe in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and excellent <hi>Remedies</hi> may be drawn from them; but their effects may better be explicated by Cauſes nearer at hand than the <hi>Stars.</hi>

                  <hi>GOLD</hi> is moſt eſteemed among the ſeven Metals, becauſe it is more perfect, more weighty, and is thought to receive the influence of the moſt glorious body among the Stars, which is the <hi>Sun.</hi> It is alſo called the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> for the ſame reaſon; it is a matter the moſt compact of any, malleable, unequal in its parts; inſomuch that Pores of different figures are obſerved in it, when it is viewed with a good Microſcope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gold</hi> is found in <hi>Mines</hi> in ſeveral places, both in <hi>Europe,</hi> and other parts of the world; it is uſually attended with <hi>Water</hi> and very hard <hi>ſtones,</hi> ſuch as are extream hard to dig; there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48366:42"/>
with ſeveral <hi>ſtones</hi> that contain particles of <hi>Gold,</hi> ſuch as are called <hi>Golden Marcaſſites,</hi> the <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> and <hi>Lapis Armenus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gold</hi> will ſpread under the hammer more than any other Metall; it is beaten into leaves exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fine, for the uſe of <hi>Gilders,</hi> and to be uſed occaſionally in Phyſick; they will eaſily mix in compoſitions, and with powders.</p>
               <p>Covetouſneſs that has always prevailed on the minds of mankind has not left the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out continual hopes of making <hi>Gold</hi> by their Art, they have conceited that the production of <hi>Gold</hi> was the <hi>End</hi> that <hi>Nature</hi> always aims at in all her <hi>Mines,</hi> and that ſhe's <hi>hindred</hi> in her deſign, as oft as ſhe produces other <hi>Metals</hi> which are called <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon this fancy they have ſpared no time, nor pains, nor coſt, in exalting and perfecting theſe other <hi>Metals,</hi> and turning them into <hi>Gold;</hi> this is that which they call the <hi>Grand Operation</hi> of all, or the ſearch after the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of them to compaſs their <hi>end</hi> do make a mixture of theſe metals with ſuch other matters as ſerve to purifie them from their groſſer parts, and work their <hi>Preparations</hi> with great fires, others do put them a <hi>Digeſting</hi> in <hi>Spirituous</hi> liquors, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Nature</hi> that always uſes a gentle Heat in her Operations, and ſo do reduce them into a ſtate of <hi>Corruption,</hi> to draw thereby their <hi>Mercury,</hi> which they think to have the apteſt diſpoſition to make <hi>Gold.</hi> Others again do ſearch after the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> in <hi>Gold</hi> it ſelf, and theſe make no doubt to find it there, as the <hi>ſeed</hi> of a <hi>Vegetable</hi> is more likely to be found in the <hi>Vegetable</hi> it ſelf
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48366:43"/>
than otherwhere; in order to this they open the body of <hi>Gold</hi> by proper <hi>Diſſolvents,</hi> then ſet it a <hi>digeſting</hi> either by a <hi>Lamp-fire,</hi> or the <hi>heat</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> or that of <hi>Dung,</hi> or ſome other degree of Fire, to be kept all along at an equal height, and ſuch as is neareſt to a <hi>Natural</hi> heat, and this to draw out the <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Gold;</hi> for they are perſwaded that if they could once obtain this ſame <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſowing it in the Earth, it would bring forth <hi>Gold,</hi> as certainly as a <hi>ſeed</hi> does a <hi>Plant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another ſort of theſe men do take wonderful pains to find out the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> in <hi>Minerals,</hi> as in <hi>Antimony</hi> for example, thinking there's a <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in it as like to thoſe in <hi>Gold</hi> as can be. Others hope to find it out in <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and things that come from them, as in <hi>Honey, Manna, Sugar, Wine, Roſa ſolis, Roſemary, Spleen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort.</hi> And others purſue after it in <hi>Animals,</hi> and in their Gums, Bloud, Urin. But the moſt Curious and delicate of all, who think all the reſt but Fools in compariſon with them, do hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> in the <hi>Sun,</hi> and in the <hi>Dew;</hi> for the wiſdom of <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> has found out that the <hi>Sun</hi> is a Body all of <hi>Gold</hi> melted in the Center of the World, and <hi>Coppel'd</hi> by the fire of the <hi>ſtars</hi> that environ it about; nay they dare affirm that this ſame <hi>Gold</hi> when it was a purifying did ſparkle as Gold does in the <hi>Coppel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould never make an end of this ſubject, if I ſhould ſpeak of the labours, and pains, watchings, vexations and frettings, and eſpecially the coſt theſe unfortunate men do plunge themſelves into, in following their ſeveral fancies; they are ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48366:43"/>
extremely prepoſſeſſed with the conceit of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Rich</hi> all of a ſudden, that they are altogether uncapable of any ſober admonition, and they ſhut their ears to any thing that can be ſaid to diſabuſe them; ſo that all other <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> that are not beſotted with their fantaſtical opinions, are by them thought and called <hi>Prophane,</hi> reſerving to themſelves the name of the only <hi>True Philoſophers,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophers paramount.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſaddeſt conſideration of all is, to ſee a great many of them, who have ſpent all the flower of their years, in this deſperate concern, in which nevertheleſs they pertinaciouſly run on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all they have, at laſt inſtead of recompence for their miſerable fatigues, reduced to the loweſt degree of poverty. <hi>Penotus</hi> will ſerve us for an inſtance of this nature, among thouſands of others, he died a hundred years old wanting but two, in the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of <hi>Yverdon</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and he uſed to ſay before he died, having ſpent his whole life in vainly <hi>ſearching</hi> after the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone, that if he had a mortal Enemy he did not dare to encounter openly, he would adviſe him above all things to give up himſelf to the</hi> Study <hi>and</hi> Practice <hi>of</hi> Alchymy.</p>
               <p>This man did indeed at laſt perceive his error and folly, and did acknowledge that he had ſpent his time moſt unfortunately and idly; but there are few men who prove ſo ingenuous as to do ſo; for they think that their honour is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in maintaining whatever error they have once openly defended, and they are quite aſhamed to have it believed, that they had laboured in vain, ſo long, and ſpent their ſubſtance in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48366:44"/>
that had not good probability of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>Many of them to avoid ſuch reproaches, and to make the world believe that they have found out ſome realities, and eſpecially to engage ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, they have deſigns upon, to joyn with them in the purſuit of their projects, have contrived a great many cheating <hi>Legerdemain</hi> tricks, ſome with the pretended <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> others with their <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> ſome by fixing <hi>Mercury</hi> with <hi>Copper,</hi> or <hi>Verdegreeſe,</hi> laſtly others with <hi>Cinnaber,</hi> which they turn into <hi>Silver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay for themſelves that their <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Projection</hi> is the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> it ſelf, which <hi>ſeed</hi> has the faculty of multiplying or encreaſing the <hi>Gold,</hi> when ſome ſmall quantity of it is uſed. And to give a proof of their skill, they put ſome <hi>melted Gold</hi> over the fire, then they caſt a little of their <hi>powder</hi> into it, they ſtir about the matter with a rod of <hi>iron,</hi> or ſome other <hi>metal,</hi> then they caſt their <hi>Gold</hi> into an <hi>iron mold,</hi> and it proves to have received a conſiderable augmentation. At firſt this Experiment ſurprizes ſtrangely the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, and they are ready to cry out, a Miracle, a Miracle. Then ſome are greedy to buy this <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Projection,</hi> but the Artiſt will not part with it, unleſs he is paid dearly for it. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer thinks he has now got the Bird ſure in the neſt, he runs in haſte home to make <hi>multiplication</hi> of his <hi>Gold,</hi> he melts it, flings in the <hi>powder,</hi> ſtirs the matter about, laſtly, he obſerves the ſame circumſtances he had ſeen obſerved before, but at laſt finds that his <hi>Gold</hi> has made no increaſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48366:44"/>
of its weight. Then he thinks he failed in ſome thing that was to have been done, and ſo begins the Operation again, once, or twice, but all in vain, he poor man can make no Augmentation, and finds too late that he has been wretchedly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon. Now the myſtery of this egregious knavery was thus:</p>
               <p>He that ſtirs the matter, is privately provided with ſeveral ſmall pieces of <hi>Gold,</hi> to convey dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly into the <hi>Crucible,</hi> or <hi>Coppel,</hi> at different times, ſo cunningly that none of the Aſſiſtants does at all perceive it; but when he finds that he is too narrowly obſerved, and foreſees that it will be too hard for him to ſlip in any more <hi>Gold</hi> to that which is melted, without being diſcovered, he then takes a rod of <hi>iron</hi> or <hi>copper,</hi> in the end of which he has inlaid <hi>Gold</hi> ſo as it may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and then ſtirs about the <hi>melted Gold</hi> with this artificial rod. The <hi>copper</hi> or <hi>iron</hi> melts, and with it the other <hi>Gold</hi> mixes with the reſt, and ſo makes an <hi>Augmentation.</hi> Now if any body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands what is become of the end of the rod, he anſwers as plainly enough appears, that it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated into droſs, for <hi>copper</hi> cannot mix with the body of <hi>Gold.</hi> And if we ſhould examine further into the <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Projection,</hi> we ſhould find that it is only <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> in <hi>Powder,</hi> or ſome ſuch matter, that conſumes away by the heat of the fire, or elſe turns into droſs.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> which they crack with ſo loud, and which they ſell at ſo dear a price, is commonly nothing elſe but a tincture of ſome <hi>Vegetable</hi> or <hi>Mineral,</hi> whoſe colour comes near to that of <hi>Gold,</hi> and becauſe this <hi>Tincture</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48366:45"/>
with ſome ſpirituous <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſes a <hi>breathing ſweat.</hi> Now this <hi>diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick</hi> effect they never fail to attribute unto <hi>Gold,</hi> which yet generally is no occaſion of it. This ſame cheat of theirs is none of the leaſt that they uſe to get by, for in point of Medicins, abundance of people prove extreme credulous, and eſpecially when an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal medicine</hi> is talk'd of, ſuch as they pretend their <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> to be. Now I ſhall ſhew in the ſequel, that the buſineſs of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Potabile</hi> is in reality a mere <hi>Chimaera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They prepare their <hi>Mercury</hi> by fixing its body with <hi>Verdegreeſe,</hi> and thus they prepare a matter that comes very near to the colour of <hi>Gold;</hi> for the <hi>Verdegreeſe,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Copper</hi> does give the <hi>Mercury</hi> a yellow colour, and for fear it ſhould not be coloured high enough to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they colour it with <hi>Turmerick,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing of the like quality: and now they will needs perſwade the world that they have performed the <hi>feat,</hi> even of <hi>making Gold;</hi> but if a man will never ſo little examine this pretended <hi>Gold</hi> by the <hi>Coppel,</hi> the whole flies away in <hi>fumes,</hi> as <hi>quicksilver</hi> does commonly uſe to do. Now if after ſuch trial a man tells them, that their <hi>Gold</hi> is all gone into the air, they anſwer for themſelves, that indeed this <hi>Gold</hi> had not received its laſt <hi>Fixation,</hi> but that the main buſineſs of it being thus atchieved, they make no doubt by working a little longer upon it they ſhall ſoon find out the way of fixing it wholly, and bringing it to its laſt perfection.</p>
               <p>But again, if they could fix their matter ſo as to make it reſiſt and undergo the <hi>Coppel</hi> (which is a thing in a manner impoſſible) ſtill they would
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48366:45"/>
not be able to maintain their Aſſertion that they had <hi>made Gold;</hi> for there are ſeveral other <hi>trials</hi> that their matter muſt be able to paſs, ſuch as the diſſolution by <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> the <hi>Depart,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>malleable,</hi> the <hi>weight</hi> of its ſubſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all which qualifications it can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover they have a way of turning <hi>Cinnaber</hi> into <hi>Silver,</hi> and this contrivance is full of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. And thus they uſe to do it:</p>
               <p>They ſtratifie <hi>Cinnaber</hi> groſly bruiſed in a <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,</hi> with <hi>Silver</hi> in grains: they ſet the <hi>Crucible</hi> in a great fire, and after ſome time for its <hi>Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> they take it off, and pour the matter into a baſon, and then they ſhew the <hi>Cinnaber,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be turn'd into <hi>true Silver,</hi> although the forefaid grains do remain in the form they had before. Hence they conclude the poſſibility of <hi>Tranſmutation</hi> of <hi>metals,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Mercury</hi> of the <hi>Cinnaber</hi> is turned into <hi>Silver,</hi> whereas the <hi>Silver</hi> did remain as it was before.</p>
               <p>This Experiment amazes people much, and it is hard to ſee thoſe ſame pieces of <hi>Cinnaber,</hi> which were put into the <hi>Crucible</hi> before them, chang'd from <hi>Mercury</hi> into <hi>pure ſilver,</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to believe an <hi>Augmentation</hi> of this laſt <hi>metal;</hi> nay, many conclude that there remains no longer doubt of it. And men continue poſſeſt with this error, until ſome body has the curioſity of examining the <hi>granulated ſilver,</hi> and then the abuſe begins to be diſcovered, for it is found to be exceeding light, and if it be preſt between the hands, it cruſhes in pieces as eaſily as <hi>membranes.</hi> The <hi>Augmentation</hi> comes to be no longer believ'd,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48366:46"/>
when the <hi>grained pellicles</hi> are weighed with the pieces of <hi>Cinnaber,</hi> for the whole weighs no more than the <hi>ſilver</hi> in <hi>grain</hi> did before it was put into the <hi>Crucible.</hi> Laſtly, it muſt of neceſſity happen (which appears very ſtrange) that the <hi>Mercury</hi> does firſt <hi>Amalgamate</hi> with the <hi>ſilver,</hi> that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs this <hi>ſilver</hi> into the pieces of <hi>Cinnaber,</hi> and then being evaporated over the fire, it leaves the <hi>ſilver</hi> all alone.</p>
               <p>I could here relate divers other ſubtle inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Alchymiſts,</hi> by which they too often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on ſuch as have plenty of mony, to make them become fellow-partners with them in their Operations; but I ſhould prove too tedious on this ſubject, I have only toucht upon them by the by, in order to diſabuſe ſuch men as are prepoſſeſt with an opinion of the <hi>Tranſmutation</hi> of <hi>metals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although I cannot abſolutely deny, but that ſome certain Artiſt, by a particular method, might have got the way of making <hi>Gold</hi> heretofore, nor that ſome body may be as lucky in time to come; yet there is more appearance of <hi>Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> than <hi>poſſibility</hi> in the caſe, becauſe of the ſmall knowledge that any of us have of the <hi>Natural Compoſition</hi> of this <hi>mixt;</hi> for ſeeing that <hi>Gold</hi> as well as <hi>Silver</hi> is drawn from <hi>Mines</hi> environed with <hi>Waters,</hi> it is very probable that theſe <hi>Waters</hi> do bring along with them ſome <hi>Saline Principles</hi> that congele and incorporate in Earths of a particular compoſition, and whoſe Pores are diſpoſed in ſuch a manner as 'tis impoſſible for <hi>Art</hi> to imitate. Nevertheleſs in order to make <hi>Gold,</hi> a perfect knowledge of the <hi>Salts</hi> that the <hi>Waters</hi> of the <hi>Mines</hi> do convey, is very requiſite as well as the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48366:46"/>
diſpoſition of the <hi>Matrixes</hi> or <hi>Earths</hi> in which they do congele. Wherefore a man muſt be ſoundly prejudiced, before he can believe that by the help of <hi>artificial fires,</hi> he can concoct <hi>metals</hi> ſo as to turn them into <hi>Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Mercury</hi> which men pretend to draw out of <hi>Minerals</hi> and <hi>Metals,</hi> and which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be the <hi>ſeminal principle</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> it is a thing meerly imaginary; for firſt of all, it is a great queſtion and may be doubted, whether there be any <hi>Mercury</hi> in thoſe <hi>metallick</hi> matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is ſought after, but if we ſhould ſuppoſe it in them, what reaſon ſhall we have to make it be the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Gold?</hi> we can no ways find that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> is able to produce <hi>Gold,</hi> nay further, as I ſaid before, the growth of <hi>metals</hi> and <hi>minerals</hi> is quite of another nature than that of <hi>Vegetables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſay they, the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> is communicated unto all bodies, and that it does abound in the Univerſal Spirit. And becauſe <hi>Manna, Dew, Hony,</hi> are impregnated with this Spirit, that <hi>Gold</hi> may by Art be drawn out of thoſe ſubſtances.</p>
               <p>We grant unto them, that the Univerſal Spirit does contain an <hi>Acid</hi> which ſerves towards the production of <hi>Gold,</hi> becauſe the <hi>acid waters</hi> or <hi>ſalts</hi> which do enter into the compoſition of this <hi>metal,</hi> do proceed from the Univerſal Spirit; but if you go to call this <hi>acid</hi> a <hi>ſeed,</hi> it will prove to be the <hi>ſeed</hi> of all other <hi>mixt</hi> bodies as well as that of <hi>Gold,</hi> and there's no more reaſon for thinking that the Univerſal Spirit does abound in the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> than in the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the groſſeſt <hi>metal,</hi> or the moſt unuſeful <hi>plant,</hi> or the moſt contemptible of <hi>animals;</hi> ſo that we may conclude, that to ſpend
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48366:47"/>
ones time in making of <hi>Gold,</hi> ſeems properly to loſe it by working in the dark, and I find that <hi>Alchymy</hi> has been very well defined to be, <hi>Ars fine arte, cujus principium mentiri, medium laborare, &amp; finis mendicare,</hi> an Art without any Art, whoſe beginning is Lying, whoſe middle is nothing but Labour, and whoſe end is Beggery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gold</hi> is a good Remedy for thoſe who have taken too much <hi>Mercury;</hi> for theſe two Metals do eaſily unite together, and by this union or <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamation</hi> the Mercury fixes, and its motion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted. This is plainly enough perceived in ſuch as have received the Frictions with <hi>Mercury;</hi> for if they do but hold a piece of <hi>Gold</hi> in their mouth a little, it will grow white by the vapour of the <hi>Quicksilver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gold</hi> taken inwardly is thought to be a moſt potent <hi>Cordial,</hi> becauſe <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> tell us it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its Influence from the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is as it were the <hi>Heart</hi> of the world, and by the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of thoſe <hi>Influences</hi> to the <hi>heart,</hi> it ſerves to fortifie and cleanſe it from all impurities; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ground a great many Operations have been invented in order to open this <hi>Metal,</hi> and ſeparate its <hi>Sulphur</hi> from its <hi>ſalt.</hi> Moreover this Operation by way of bravery is called <hi>Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> becauſe this <hi>ſalt</hi> or this <hi>Sulphur</hi> diſſolving in a Liquor, can be taken by way of <hi>Potion:</hi> And becauſe this <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> can be thought to be diſtributed into all parts of the body, they fancy it can drive out every thing that interrupts the Functions of Nature, that it can free him that takes it from all fear of any Diſeaſes for a long time, and can prolong life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:48366:47"/>But this Opinion is built upon a weak founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Experience does not confirm any of theſe glorious effects; for what aſſurance can we have, or what Evidence is there, that the <hi>Sun</hi> is ſuch a great friend of <hi>Gold,</hi> or that it beſtows more <hi>Influence</hi> on it, than on other mixt bodies; it is a thing that can never be prov'd, and we fee that the <hi>Sun</hi> caſts its light and heat in general upon all bodies, without making any difference. Who can underſtand, that the <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, as to have a greater facility of retaining the <hi>Suns Influences,</hi> than other <hi>metals</hi> or things? This will be full as hard to prove as the other.</p>
               <p>But though we ſhould grant <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> this ſuppoſition concerning the <hi>Suns Influence</hi> on <hi>Gold,</hi> the conſequence they draw from it, that therefore it <hi>Fortifies</hi> the <hi>heart,</hi> would be ne're a-whit the truer; for all that we are able to apprehend in <hi>Gold</hi> is, that it is a moſt compact and weighty body, the union of whoſe <hi>Principles</hi> is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cloſe; which is proved from hence, that no Art can inſtruct us to diſſolve it <hi>Radically,</hi> ſo as to ſeparate its <hi>ſalt,</hi> and its <hi>ſulphur.</hi> This <hi>Gold</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten into the thinneſt <hi>Leaves</hi> that can be imagined, and taken inwardly receives not the leaſt change in our bodies, and is voided the very ſame it was before, excepting when <hi>Quicksilver</hi> has been taken beforehand, for it unites with that, as I have ſaid.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt conclude, that if <hi>Gold</hi> has received more <hi>Influence</hi> from the <hi>Sun</hi> than other <hi>Metals,</hi> yet it is never the fitter to diſſolve in our Bodies, nor to produce thoſe rare effects that are talkt of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48366:48"/>I know that ſtories are told to prove, that <hi>Gold</hi> does communicate virtue to the bodies of thoſe who have taken it, and that it loſes in the body ſome of its quantity; and among other <hi>ſtories</hi> 'tis ſaid, that ſeveral perſons, who had fed upon <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,</hi> nouriſhed with a <hi>Paſte</hi> made of a mixture of <hi>Vipers</hi> fleſh and <hi>Gold</hi> together, have been cured that way of ſeveral <hi>Diſeaſes;</hi> but there's a great deal more reaſon to attribute this effect rather to the <hi>Vipers</hi> than <hi>Gold;</hi> for we know by experience that <hi>Vipers</hi> taken inwardly without any thing elſe, do uſe to produce divers ſenſible effects, whereas we obſerve none at all in <hi>Gold,</hi> when 'tis given alone.</p>
               <p>As for the diminution they imagine of <hi>Gold</hi> in bodies, they prove it by their gathering together all the <hi>Excrements</hi> of thoſe <hi>Capons,</hi> and <hi>Calcining</hi> them, for they could obtain again but the fourth part of the <hi>Gold</hi> that was uſed in the <hi>Paſte</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi> had fed upon. But this proof is as weak as the former; for the <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>Capons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> that <hi>Salt</hi> may have <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiliz'd</hi> and carried away the greateſt part of the <hi>Gold</hi> during the <hi>Calcination,</hi> after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we ſee ſeveral <hi>Volatile</hi> liquors to <hi>ſublime Gold.</hi> I know well enough by my own Experience, that there are ſuch <hi>Volatiles</hi> as are able to <hi>ſublime Gold;</hi> for having one day mixed three ounces of <hi>Gold</hi> with about three pounds of matter conſiſting of divers <hi>Volatile ingredients,</hi> I put the mixture about a month afterwards into the <hi>Coppel,</hi> and the <hi>Gold</hi> appeared very reſplendent in the middle of the mixture; but blowing, as we uſe to do, in its purification, I was aſtoniſhed to ſee it <hi>Exalt</hi> away by little and little into the <hi>air,</hi> until there was not a <hi>grain</hi> of it left.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48366:48"/>Thus no body can be aſſured that <hi>Gold</hi> did nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh thoſe <hi>Capons;</hi> but beſides, though ſome of it ſhould be diſſolved in the body, as it does in <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> which is very hard to conceive; though ſome of it ſhould <hi>exalt,</hi> nay though ſome ſhould plainly glitter in the <hi>Chyle,</hi> here's no proof never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs that it produces ſuch wonderful effects.</p>
               <p>Now although I have aſſerted that <hi>Gold</hi> taken alone does not receive any change as for health, yet I value very much ſeveral preparations of <hi>Gold</hi> made with <hi>Spirits;</hi> for 'tis theſe <hi>Spirits</hi> that give certain determinations to <hi>Gold</hi> according to their nature, and make it operate as it does.

                     <p>Melt three parts of Silver with one part of Gold, in a Crucible over a good Fire, and when this mixture is in Fuſion, caſt it into cold water, and it condenſes into <hi>Grains,</hi> which being dried, a ſeparation of the Silver from the Gold is made by the means of <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> for this <hi>Menſtruum</hi> diſſolves Silver very well, but the Gold remains in powder at the bottom of the Veſſel, for the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48366:49"/>
reaſon that I ſhall relate in the Chapter of <hi>Aqua Regalis.</hi> The Diſſolution of Silver is poured off by Inclination, then the Powder of Gold is waſhed to be made ſweet.</p>
                     <p>But it often happens that ſome particles of the Silver do ſtill remain united with the Gold, ſo that this Purification cannot be ſaid to be altogether perfect.</p>
                     <p>There is another method of <hi>Purifying Gold,</hi> to wit, <hi>Cementation,</hi> which is thus performed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Stratifie</hi> in a Crucible thin plates of Gold, with a dry paſte, that is called <hi>Cement,</hi> in which the Salts <hi>Gemma</hi> and <hi>Armoniack</hi> do enter; cover the Crucible, and having made a fire round about it, Calcine the matter for ten or twelve hours with a violent heat, that the <hi>Salts</hi> may eat and conſume the impurities of the Gold: but nevertheleſs they often leave it ſtill impregnated with other Metals.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Purification</hi> at Gold by the means of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> is better than any other; for there is nothing but Gold that is able to make reſiſtance againſt this devourer; it often eats ſome portion of it, but never leaves it in any other Metal.</p>
                     <p>You muſt remember to lay a Tile under the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, for fear that the air which comes by the Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole, ſhould happen to cool the bottom of the Crucible.</p>
                     <p>Gold preſently melts as ſoon as <hi>Antimony</hi> is caſt into the Crucible, by reaſon that <hi>Antimony</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſome Saline Sulphurs, which do encreaſe the force of the Fire, and do ſeparate the parts of this Metal; it is then that the more porous and volatile part uniting with the <hi>Antimony,</hi> one part evaporates away in Smoke, and the other remains fixt in the Droſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:48366:50"/>The ſparkles which toward the end do fly out of the matter do proceed from ſome Particles of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> which finding themſelves intangled in the Gold do uſe violence to get out.</p>
                     <p>Then take your matter off the Fire that it may loſe none of its ſubſtance, and pour it into an Iron Mortar as I ſaid before. After this the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gule</hi> is melted once more, and <hi>Salt-peter</hi> caſt into it to abſorb or receive all the <hi>Antimony</hi> that may yet remain, and ſo by this means you have a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gule</hi> as well <hi>purified</hi> as may be, and even that of four and twenty <hi>Caratts,</hi> if there be any ſuch Gold.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Carat</hi> of Gold is properly the weight of one Scruple, or four and twenty grains, and four and twenty <hi>Caratts</hi> make an ounce.</p>
                     <p>If you take an ounce of <hi>Gold,</hi> and find that it loſes not a jot in the <hi>Purifications</hi> that may be made of it, this is called <hi>Gold</hi> of four and twenty <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratts;</hi> if it be found to have diminiſhed but one <hi>Caratt,</hi> then it is ſaid to be <hi>Gold</hi> of three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Caratts;</hi> if it loſes two <hi>Caratts,</hi> then it is <hi>Gold</hi> of two and twenty <hi>Caratts,</hi> and ſo of the reſt.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Red Gold</hi> is the leſs valuable, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the more <hi>Copper,</hi> which gives it this colour; the <hi>Yellow</hi> is the better, and it ought to remain <hi>Yellow,</hi> even whilſt it is in the fire.</p>

                     <p>The Plates of Gold are made uſe of in this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that its diſſolution may be more eaſily performed.</p>
                     <p>You muſt pour the <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> by little and little, to avoid the great efferveſcency that might be able to drive it out of the Matraſs. The effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency proceeds from the violent diviſion of the particles of Gold by the <hi>Aqua Regalis;</hi> for when it finds no more bodies to act upon, having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Gold into as many parts as 'tis poſſible, the ebullition ceaſes, and though the Gold doth all remain in the <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> it becomes ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible to us, as it ſeems the Water hath not changed from what it was before, it appears ſo very clear and tranſparent. Indeed the ſolution has received a Golden colour, and becomes yellow.</p>
                     <p>The diſſolution of Gold is a ſuſpenſion of this metal in Phlegm, made by the edges of <hi>Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galis.</hi> For it is not enough that the <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> does divide the Gold into ſubtle parts, but it is further requiſite that its edges do hold up the Gold, as if it were like ſo many Finns, otherwiſe it would always fall to the bottom in a powder, though it were never ſo ſubtle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48366:52"/>Now 'tis objected that the particles of Gold ſhould fall to the bottom of the liquor, becauſe they being joined to the points of the <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> they are become more heavy than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for the union or adhaeſion of two bodies does cauſe a greater weight, than when the two bodies were ſeparated one from the other.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that we ought to conceive the particles of Gold being ſuſpended or held up in the Phlegm by the <hi>acid</hi> points, much after the manner as we do conceive very well, that a ſmall piece of metal fixed to a ſtaff or a plank, will ſwim with the wood in the water; for although the ſmall piece of metal ſinks to the bottom when it is alone, yet it ſwims when it is affixed to the wood; the <hi>acid</hi> edges are bodies exceeding light in compariſon with the particles of Gold, and they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their ſuperficies, more extended, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently do take up more room in the phlegm; this is that which holds them up, and cauſes them to ſwim.</p>
                     <p>The Oyl of Tartar, or the Spirit of Salt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack is uſed for the Precipitation of Gold, becauſe both thoſe Liquors do contain an Alkali Salt, which being mixed with Acids muſt cauſe a Fermentation. Now in this Fermentation the parts of <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> that held up the particles of Gold do grow weak, and having no more force to retain them longer, they muſt needs precipitate by their own weight.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps ſome may find a difficulty in compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending how the Volatile Spirit of Salt Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack ſhould come to weaken the <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> that is it ſelf compounded of Salt Armoniack; but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48366:52"/>
there will be no difficulty at all, when they ſhall conſider that the force of the <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> doth not ſo much depend on the volatile part of the Salt Armoniack, as on the Sea-ſalt, that is in good ſtore in it united with the <hi>Aqua Fortis;</hi> for Sea-ſalt, or <hi>Sal Gemma,</hi> may be ſubſtituted very well in the place of Salt Armoniack for making <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> as I ſhall obſerve hereafter, ſpeaking of the compoſition of this Water. It may be alſo enquired here, why the Diſſolvents do quit the bodies they held before in Diſſolution, to betake themſelves to ſome other: for example, why the <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> leaves the Gold it was impregnated with, to give way to the Alkali Salt. This que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is one of the moſt difficult to reſolve well, of any in Natural Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, I'le give you my opinion of what can be ſaid moſt ſenſibly on this Subject.</p>
                     <p>I do ſuppoſe that when the <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> hath acted upon the Gold, ſo as to diſſolve it, the points or edges that enabled it to do ſo, are fixed in the particles of Gold. But ſeeing that theſe little bodies are very hard, and conſequently hard to penetrate, theſe points do enter but very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, yet far enough to ſuſpend the particles of Gold, and hinder them from precipitating. Wherefore if you would add never ſo much Gold, more, when theſe points have ſeized upon as much as they are able to joyn with, they cannot poſſibly diſſolve one grain more; and it is this ſuſpenſion that renders the particles of Gold imperceptible. But now if you add ſome body that by its motion and figure is able to engage the <hi>acids</hi> enough to break them, the particles of Gold being left at
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48366:53"/>
liberty will precipitate by their own weight. And this is what I conceive the Oyl of Tartar, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Alkali Spirits are able to do. They are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with very Active Salts, which finding bodies at reſt do preſently move them, and by the quickneſs of their motion do ſhake them ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, as to break the points by which they were ſuſpended; theſe fragments of little points being thus diſengaged from the Gold, are ſtill keen enough to act, and they have action enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to pierce and divide violently the parts of Alkali Salts, which are much more ſoluble in their nature than Gold, and this occaſions the Ebullition which preſently happens when theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are poured upon the Diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>Theſe edges then being thus broken, two things muſt follow thereupon. The firſt is that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> is rendred uncapable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving any more Gold, becauſe it hath no more power left of making a penetration. The ſecond is, that the precipitated Powder of Gold is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with ſome part of the Diſſolvent, by reaſon that the ſharpeſt part of theſe edges remains within it.</p>
                     <p>Experience teaches us both the one and the other: to wit, the force of the <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> is quite deſtroyed for diſſolving any more Gold, and the precipitated Powder hath drawn along with it ſome Spirits that are ſo cloſely lockt up, that though it be ſeveral times waſht in warm Water, they cannot poſſibly be diſengaged from their hold. And this is evident, when it is put upon the Fire; for the great Detonation, or noiſe that it makes, cannot proceed from any thing elſe, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48366:53"/>
Spirits which violently divide the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact body of Gold to get out quickly, when they are forced to it by the action of Fire.</p>
                     <p>I can here explicate by the by, after the ſame manner, the action of a certain Powder, conſiſting of three parts of Niter, two parts of Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and one part of Sulphur. This Powder being heated in a Spoon to the weight of a Drachm, gives as Thundering a noiſe as a Cannon it ſelf. Now the fixt Salt of Tartar cauſes in this Powder what the Gold did in the other; that is to ſay, it retains the Spirits of Niter and Sulphur ſo lockt up, that they cannot be ſeparated without violently breaking their Priſon; and this is that which makes ſuch a noiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> taken inwardly cauſes ſweat, becauſe the heat of the Body volatiliſes it, and drives it through the Pores. Now if the Pores are very open, it will only cauſe an inſenſible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration: but if they are cloſed up by the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the weather, ſo that it muſt remain ſome time before it paſſes; the vaporous humidity which bears it company, diſſolves upon the skin into what we call ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Some think the Gold contributes nothing at all to theſe tranſpirations, and that the ſpirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone being forced by the heat of the body to paſs through its Pores cauſes all the action. But I conceive it is more likely that theſe ſpirits do carry along with them ſome parts of the Gold, with which they are ſo intimately mixed. And by this explication may be better comprehended, how ſo ſmall a quantity of ſpirits is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſweat; for ſuppoſe there paſſes through the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48366:54"/>
Pores one grain of Gold, and two grains of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, theſe ſpirits being as I may ſo ſay, armed with the groſſer parts of Gold, will be better able to conquer the reſiſtance that ſhall oppoſe their paſſage, than if they were ſeparate; after the ſame manner as a good piece of Timber that is driven along by the ſtream of a River will ſtrike with much more violence againſt the Arch of a Bridge, and endanger it much more, than a ſingle Wave would be able to do, though never ſo ſwift.</p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of inſenſible Tranſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one hapening at all times, as well in health as ſickneſs, and the other in a Burning Feaver, or elſe ſometimes upon the taking a <hi>Sudorifick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Tranſpiration is inſenſible, becauſe the vapour which paſſes continually through the pores is yet in ſo ſmall a quantity, that though it does diſſolve in a moiſture upon the skin, it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at all.</p>
                     <p>The other is cauſed by a great motion of the Spirits which drive the humours through the pores of the body after a rapid manner, and whereas at that time the pores become very open, and the skin is heated more than ordinarily, the vapour paſſes away through the skin without condenſing upon it.</p>
                     <p>But if once the rapid motion of humours begins to ſlacken, then the ſweat appears, and begins to be felt; and this does happen in <hi>Agues,</hi> for during the great heat of the <hi>Ague,</hi> men do not ſweat at all, but only in the declination of the fit; becauſe then the skin ſomewhat cools, the vapour conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into a moiſture, which we call ſweat; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſweat may be ſaid to iſſue from a middle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat, between the firſt inſenſible Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:48366:54"/>Moſt men think that there goes out more moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in the time of the ſweat, than by the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Tranſpiration which is made during the height of the hot fit; but they ſeem to be miſtaken very likely, for it may eaſily be conceived, that there ſhould be a greater diſpoſition in the vigour of the fit, than afterwards in the declination, by reaſon that at that time the heat is greater, and ſo more able to impel forth <hi>effluviums.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Diſtillation in a Retort will confirm what is here maintained. For if you make only a moderate fire under the Retort, the moiſture which riſes out of the matter will diſtil drop by drop, becauſe the vapours cooling and condenſing in the neck of the Retort do reſolve into a liquor; but if you make a great fire in the Furnace, ſo that the neck of the Retort comes to be heated too much, all the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is driven in a meer vapour, and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not the leaſt humidity in the neck of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort.</p>
                     <p>I have already ſaid, that Gold doth repreſs the violence of Mercury, becauſe it doth <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamate</hi> with it; but <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> doth it much better, for being Volatile it is more eaſily carried through all the body, and fails not to find out the Mercury, whereſoever it lies.</p>
                     <p>We need not fear leſt <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> taken inwardly, and heated by the ſtomach, ſhould cauſe ſuch a <hi>Detonation</hi> there, as it does when ſet over the fire in a ſpoon; for ſo much the more moiſture as comes to it, ſo much the leſs noiſe does it make. Now it can't be queſtion'd, but there is liquidity enough in the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> beſides the liquid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle 'tis uſually given in. There is no need
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48366:55"/>
then of calling in the <hi>acids</hi> of the ſtomach, as ſome do, to unite with the <hi>ſalts</hi> of <hi>Aurum Fulminans,</hi> and drive them out of the body of this Metal: for beſides that the moſt clear and diſintereſted Explications and ſuch as fall moſt under our ſenſe, ought always to be preferr'd, 'twould be too hard a matter to maintain that; 'tis true if you wet <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> with the <hi>ſpirit of Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Sulphur,</hi> the <hi>Fulmination</hi> is thereby hindred, but this happens from the <hi>acids</hi> fixing by their weight the <hi>Volatility</hi> of thoſe <hi>Salts</hi> that remain in the pores of the <hi>Gold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Chapter of <hi>Gold</hi> I could reckon up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Preparations that have been invented, but becauſe they are out of uſe, I ſhall not ſwell this Book with an account of them.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Purification of Silver.</head>
                  <p>To <hi>Purifie Silver</hi> is to ſeparate from it the other metals with which it is mixed. This operation is done by the <hi>Coppel</hi> after the manner following:</p>
                  <p>Take a <hi>Coppel</hi> made of the aſhes of Bones or Horns, cover it and heat it gently in the coals, until it grows red-hot, then caſt it into four or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48366:56"/>
five times as much <hi>Lead</hi> as you intend to purifie <hi>Silver:</hi> let the <hi>Lead</hi> melt, and fill the ſides of the Coppel, which is ſoon done; then caſt your <hi>Silver</hi> into the middle, and it will preſently melt. Lay wood round about the Coppel, and blow it that the flame may reverberate on the matter, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities will mix with the <hi>Lead,</hi> and the <hi>Silver</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main pure and clean in the middle of the Coppel, while the <hi>Lead</hi> being fill'd with the droſſie parts of <hi>Silver</hi> lies on the ſides like a ſcumm, that you may gather up with a ſpoon, and this is that which is called <hi>Litharge,</hi> which according to the degree of Calcination it hath endured, becomes of divers Colours, and ſometimes is called <hi>Litharge</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Litharge</hi> of <hi>Silver.</hi> If you leave it in the Coppel, it will paſs through its Pores.</p>
                  <p>For you muſt obſerve that the Coppel being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly made of aſhes deprived of <hi>Salt,</hi> is very Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; you muſt continue the Fire till there riſe no more Fumes.</p>
                  <p>This Preparation cleanſes <hi>Silver</hi> from all other Metals, except <hi>Gold,</hi> which reſiſts the power of the Coppel. You muſt therefore have recourſe to the Operation I deſcribed, when I ſpoke of the Purification of <hi>Gold;</hi> for <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> diſſolves <hi>Silver,</hi> but not being able to penetrate <hi>Gold,</hi> leaves it in a powder at the bottom.</p>
                  <p>Pour off then by Inclination the diſſolution of <hi>Silver</hi> into an Earthen pan, wherein you ſhall have laid before-hand a plate of Copper, and ten or twelve times as much common Water. Let this mixture lie ſtill for ſome hours, and when you find the Copper covered all about with the Powder or Precipitate of <hi>Silver,</hi> and the water becomes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48366:56"/>
blue, Filtrate it, and you have that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aqua Secunda:</hi> It is good to make the Eſchar fall in Chancres, and to conſume proud fleſh. Dry the powder of <hi>Silver,</hi> and if you deſire to keep it in an <hi>Ingot,</hi> melt it in a Crucible with a little <hi>Salt-peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ſteep a plate of Iron ſome hours in the <hi>Aqua Secunda,</hi> the Copper which made it look blue will precipitate according as the Iron diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves. If you Filtrate this diſſolution, and put a piece of the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> into it, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd Iron will fall to the bottom in powder, and the Stone will diſſolve it. If you Filtrate this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and pour upon the Filtration drop by drop the water of fixt <hi>Niter,</hi> the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> will precipitate. Laſtly, if you Filtrate this water too, and having evaporated a part of it, ſet the reſt a Cryſtallizing, you'l meet with a <hi>Salt-peter</hi> that burns like the ordinary ſort.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Coppel is an Earthen Veſſel that reſiſts the Fire, made like a diſh: it is fill'd with a Paſte made of aſhes that have loſt all their Salt, ſuch as thoſe of Bones; which loſe all their Salt while they are a burning, becauſe it is ſo Volatile: a hole is made in the middle to let in the matter that is to be Coppel'd, and ſo the Veſſel is ſet a drying.</p>
                     <p>You muſt put <hi>Lead</hi> into the Coppel, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the impurities that are in the <hi>Silver;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they put four times as much. That which is here called Impurity is nothing elſe but ſome
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48366:57"/>
parts of other Metals, that ſuperficially adhered to the <hi>Silver,</hi> when it was taken out of the Mine. Theſe Metals do mix much better with <hi>Lead</hi> than <hi>Silver,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Lead</hi> is full of Sulphureous porous parts which readily engage and receive other Bodies. On the contrary <hi>Silver</hi> hath Pores exceeding cloſe and ſtrait, and can neither be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated nor unite with theſe Matters but only ſuperficially; ſo that in the Fuſion they do ſeparate and only ſlide over this Solid body. It is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that the hardneſs of <hi>Silver,</hi> and ſtrait contexture of its parts do hinder the Fire from melting it after the ſame manner as other Metals, that are more porous; and this is the reaſon it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unmixt among them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silver</hi> melts much ſooner by being put into melted <hi>Lead,</hi> than if you had endeavour'd to melt it alone in the Crucible, becauſe <hi>Lead</hi> contains many Sulphureous parts that are very ſerviceable for the Fuſion of Metals. The flame is made to Reverberate on the <hi>Silver,</hi> to drive all Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous ſubſtances towards the ſides.</p>
                     <p>That which is called a <hi>Caratt</hi> in <hi>Gold,</hi> is a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,</hi> or penny weight in <hi>Silver,</hi> and thus an ounce of <hi>Silver</hi> well purified is of four and twenty penny weight, which make 24 times 24 grains. Now this ounce of <hi>Silver</hi> muſt loſe nothing at all upon trial; but if it ſhould loſe one penny weight in the Coppel, the <hi>Silver</hi> then is ſaid to be that of 23 penny weight, and if it loſes two ſcruples, or penny weight, it is but of 22 <hi>Deniers,</hi> and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>There is no <hi>Silver</hi> to be had of 24 <hi>deniers,</hi> no more than <hi>Gold</hi> of 24 <hi>Caratts,</hi> becauſe there is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48366:57"/>
always ſome mixture with it, uſe what diligence and application you pleaſe in its purification.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plate-ſilver</hi> contains one part of <hi>Copper</hi> to 24 parts of <hi>Silver,</hi> and the <hi>Coppel-ſilver</hi> contains but a quarter of a part of <hi>Copper</hi> to four and twenty parts of <hi>Silver.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Depart,</hi> or parting of Metals, is when a Diſſolvent quits the Metal it had diſſolved, to betake it ſelf unto another. Thus when <hi>Copper</hi> is put into the Diſſolution of <hi>Silver,</hi> the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> leaves the <hi>Silver,</hi> to fall upon Diſſolving the <hi>Copper;</hi> and the reaſon of this is, becauſe the <hi>Copper-particles</hi> do ſo ſtir and ſhake the edges of the Diſſolvent, as to make them let go their hold. <hi>Iron</hi> precipitates <hi>Copper, Lapis Calaminaris</hi> preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates <hi>Iron,</hi> and the Liquor of fixt <hi>Niter</hi> doth ſo to the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> for the ſame reaſon; but you muſt obſerve, that <hi>Iron</hi> does not precipitate all the <hi>Copper,</hi> nor the <hi>Calaminaris</hi> all the <hi>Iron,</hi> no more than the <hi>Copper</hi> did precipitate all the <hi>Silver:</hi> and the reaſon of this is, that the points of the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> having entred more deeply into the great pores of <hi>Copper</hi> and <hi>Iron,</hi> are much the harder to be broken by bodies of this nature; but becauſe the liquor of fixt <hi>Niter</hi> does contain an Alkali much more active than the others, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates all the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> and all the <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Copper</hi> which did remain diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall in the ſequel of this Book deſcribe the manner of preparing the Liquor of fixt <hi>Niter:</hi> the Salt that it contains reunites with the Volatile Spirits of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> that were in the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> inſomuch that the <hi>Salt-peter</hi> revives again.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Diſſolve one or two ounces of <hi>Coppel-ſilver</hi> in three times as much Spirit of <hi>Niter;</hi> pour forth your diſſolution into a Glaſs-Cucurbite, ſet in a gentle Sand-fire; evaporate about the fourth part of the moiſture, and ſo let the reſt cool without ſtirring it, it will turn into <hi>Cryſtals,</hi> which you muſt ſeparate from the Liquor, and after you have dried them, keep them in a Viol well ſtopt. You may again fall to Evaporating half the remaining Liquor, and ſet it a <hi>Cryſtallizing</hi> as before. You may repeat theſe Evaporations and Cryſtallizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons till all your <hi>Silver</hi> has turned into <hi>Cryſtals.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Cryſtals</hi> might be prepared with <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> for inward uſe.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>You muſt put your <hi>Silver</hi> purified by the <hi>Coppel</hi> into a Viol or <hi>Matraſs</hi> large enough, and pour upon it only as much <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> as will ſerve to Diſſolve it; now that comes to about three
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48366:58"/>
times its weight. Indeed you may uſe <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> inſtead of <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> if you pleaſe, in this Operation; but I rather chuſe <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> becauſe it is found to act with more celerity than <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> You may read in their proper places the deſcription I have given you of them both, and the Remarks I have made upon them. Place your Veſſel in Aſhes or Sand, a little warm for to haſten the Diſſolution. When the <hi>acid Spirits</hi> begin to work upon the <hi>Silver,</hi> an Ebullition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently riſes accompanied with a very conſiderable heat, becauſe theſe ſharp edges do break thoſe obſtacles that hindred their entrance, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force their paſſage. It is this great motion, and impetuous diſperſion of parts, that produces the heat and ebullition, and by rarefaction of the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> ſends forth through the neck of the Veſſel a Red fume or vapour, that you muſt be very careful to avoid, as a thing very unwholſom, and prejudicial to the Breaſt. The Smoke and Ebullition do remain until the <hi>Silver</hi> is all of it diſſolved, after which the Liquor becomes clear and tranſparent but a little bluiſh. If the <hi>Silver</hi> which is diſſolved, were perfectly purified from <hi>Copper,</hi> the ſolution would no more be tinged than <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> but becauſe there is none to be found ſo perfectly pure, it always tinges a little. The ſolution of <hi>Plate-ſilver</hi> is much bluer than that of <hi>Silver</hi> purified by the <hi>Coppel,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Plate-ſilver</hi> contains more <hi>Copper</hi> than the other, as I ſaid before. So that the purer the <hi>Silver</hi> is, the leſs blue is the ſolution. A little of it is evaporated, that the reſt may <hi>Cryſtallize</hi> the eaſier, for that which evaporates is little better than a kind of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48366:59"/>
inſipid water, the <hi>Silver</hi> ſtill retaining the <hi>Acid fixt Spirits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now you muſt obſerve in all Cryſtallizations not to leave too much moiſture, for fear of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too much the <hi>Salts,</hi> and ſo hindring their Coagulation. Nor muſt you leave too little moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; for the Cryſtals not finding room enough to extend themſelves in, would confuſedly fall one upon another.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Cryſtals can be diſſolved in Water like Salt, their ſtrength depends on the <hi>Spirits of Niter</hi> that are incorporated with them: wherefore they weigh more than the <hi>Silver</hi> did that was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it is theſe <hi>Spirits</hi> which pierce and gnaw the fleſh on which theſe Cryſtals are applied, when an <hi>Eſchar</hi> is to be made. It is likewiſe they which cauſe that Fermentation of humours by which they purge, when theſe Cryſtals are given inwardly. The Liquor in which they are diſſolved to be taken, and the moiſture of the <hi>Stomach</hi> do ſerve to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their <hi>acrimony.</hi>
                     </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Diſſolve in a Viol what quantity of <hi>Silver</hi> you pleaſe, with three times as much <hi>Spirit of Niter;</hi> ſet your Viol in a Sand fire, and evaporate about two thirds of the moiſture; pour the reſt as it is hot into a good <hi>German</hi> Crucible, that muſt be large enough by reaſon of the Ebullitions that are made in it. Place it over a gentle fire, and let it alone till the boiling matter ſinks quietly to the bottom of the Crucible. Then encreaſe your fire a little, and it will come to be like Oyl: pour it out into an Iron mould a little oil'd and heated, it will preſently coagulate or harden; after which you may keep it in a Viol well ſtopt. It is a <hi>Cauſtick</hi> that will remain for ever, provided you don't let it be expos'd to the Air. This <hi>Stone</hi> may be made of <hi>Copper</hi> inſtead of <hi>Silver,</hi> but will not keep ſo well; becauſe the <hi>Copper</hi> being very porous doth ſuffer the Air to enter eaſily and diſſolve it.</p>

                     <p>The Effect of this <hi>Stone</hi> proceeds from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive <hi>Spirits of Niter,</hi> which do remain incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the <hi>Silver.</hi> It is more <hi>Cauſtick</hi> than the <hi>Cryſtals</hi> I now ſpoke of, though compounded
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48366:60"/>
of the ſame ingredients. The reaſon of it is, that in the Evaporation of the <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> the ſharpeſt part remains at laſt; and it is that which gives this ſtrength to the <hi>Infernal ſtone.</hi> But in the <hi>Cryſtal</hi> there's a much weaker Spirit, as being impregnated with watry parts.</p>
                     <p>When you boil the ſolution of <hi>Silver,</hi> you muſt take care to keep but a gentle fire, for the matter eaſily rarifies, and riſes over into the fire; or elſe it ſpirts ſome drops upon the hand of the Artiſt, which make it ſmart grievouſly, and fetches off the skin, becauſe this liquor is not only very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive in it ſelf, but has the aſſiſtance of fire to make it the more burning. You muſt likewiſe often caſt your eye into the Crucible, eſpecially towards the end, that ſo ſoon as the matter is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to ceaſe boiling, and gets the form of an Oyl, you be ready to caſt it into the mould, for if you ſhould then leave it longer in the fire, the ſtrongeſt Spirits would evaporate, and the ſtone would not be ſo corroſive.</p>
                     <p>If you would melt the <hi>Cryſtals</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> in a Crucible, and boil the Liquor till it come into the conſiſtence of Oyl, and afterwards caſt it into the Iron mould, you would have an <hi>Infernal ſtone</hi> like this I have deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Plate ſilver</hi> is uſed to the making the <hi>Infernal ſtone,</hi> an ounce of <hi>Silver</hi> gains but three drachms in augmentation, but uſing fine <hi>Coppel-ſilver,</hi> you'l get five drachms. This augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of weight does proceed from the ſharp <hi>acids</hi> of <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> adhering to the body of <hi>ſilver,</hi> but the difference of the increaſe lies in this, that the <hi>Coppel-ſilver</hi> having narrower pores than the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48366:60"/>
other does retain the <hi>acids</hi> better, and the <hi>ſtone</hi> is thereby the ſtronger, as I have found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

Let it lye a while that all the Powder may fall, and then pour off the water by Inclination. Waſh your Powder ſeveral times with Fountain-water to take away the Acrimony of the Salts: dry it upon paper, and put it into a Matraſs. Pour upon it an Ounce of the Volatile Salt of Urine, and four and twenty Ounces of the Spirit of Wine Rectified with the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ſhall ſhew hereafter. Stop this Matraſs with another: that is to ſay, let the mouth of the one enter into the neck of the other, and this is that which is called a <hi>Double-Veſſel.</hi> Lute well the junctures with a wet bladder, and digeſt the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in horſe-dung, or ſome ſuch gentle heat, for a Fortnight, during which time the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> will have got a bright Sky-colour. Unlute your Matraſs, and Filtrate the Liquor through a Coffin of Brown paper, and ſo keep it in a Viol well ſtopt.

You may uſe this <hi>Tincture</hi> for the Epilepſie, Palſie, Apoplexy, and other diſeaſes of the Head. It is alſo uſed in Malignant Feavers, and all other Diſeaſes wherein it is requiſite to drive out the humours by Perſpiration. The Doſe is from ſix to ſixteen drops in a convenient Vehicle.</p>
                  <p>There will remain at the bottom of the Matraſs a <hi>Calx</hi> of Silver that may again be revived by means of the following Salts.</p>

                     <p>This Operation ſeems at firſt to favour the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe who hold there can be a ſeparation of the Principles of Silver: for, ſay they, what is it can give this blue colour, after that the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath been a long time digeſted with the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt of Urine, and the <hi>ſpirit of Wine Alcoho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized,</hi> but an inward ſulphur of the Silver that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48366:61"/>
ſeparates from it by the means of this ſulphureous Liquor, and mixes with it, much after the ſame manner as we find theſe ſorts of <hi>Menſtruums</hi> uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſſolve the ſulphur of Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, and let alone their terreſtrious and ſaline parts? But when we conſider this Tincture a little nearer, we ſhall find it to be nothing but a diſſolution of ſome part of the Silver it ſelf, that hath been volatilized by the ſalt of Urine, and afterwards united with the ſpirit of Wine; ſo that if you draw off, or revive this diſſolved Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there will remain no longer a Tincture, and this is the way for you to do it.</p>
                     <p>Pour your <hi>Tincture</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> into a Glaſs Body, cover it with its head, and fit a Receiver to it, lute the junctures cloſe, and diſtil in a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous Bath, about half the moiſture, and you'l have a Liquor as clear as ſpirit of Wine. Put your Cucurbit into a cool place, and leave it there two days without ſtirring it, you'l find little Cryſtals on the ſides, pour off the Liquor gently, which hath now loſt much of its Sky-colour. Gather your Cryſtals, and continue to diſtil and cryſtalize the reſt of the Liquor, till you have recovered all that is in it. Mix all your Cryſtals, dry them, and weigh them; and if you have half an ounce of them, powder them, and mix them with ſix drachms of the matter I deſcribed for reviving the <hi>Calx</hi> of Silver remaining in the Matraſs: put this mixture into a Crucible, and covering it with a tile, light a ſtrong fire about it, to put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into fuſion; then taking it off the fire, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it cool, break the Crucible, you'l find the Silver at the bottom, which will be fit for the ſame
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48366:62"/>
Operation again, when you pleaſe. Note that all the Liquor which was drawn by Diſtillation, is as clear as common water: wherefore I conclude that the Colour did conſiſt in the diſſolution of Silver it ſelf, and not of its ſulphurs, as ſome have thought.</p>
                     <p>You muſt cut the Silver into little pieces or plates, that it may diſſolve the more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>The Salt-water muſt be made of an ounce and a half of Salt diſſolved in a quart of water: this ſalt precipitates the Silver, becauſe it engages the points of the diſſolvent, and ſhaking them vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently about makes them let go the hold they had with other bodies. I ſhall ſpeak more at large concerning theſe kinds of Precipitations in the Remarks which I ſhall make upon White Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, and ſhall then explicate the reaſon why Sea-ſalt, which is an <hi>acid</hi> does precipitate that which another <hi>acid</hi> had diſſolved. I ſhall likewiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the objections which have been raiſed on this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silver</hi> may be alſo precipitated by means of a Copper-plate, as I have ſaid already.</p>
                     <p>It is very indifferent which way you pleaſe to Precipitate it, for it is done for no other end, but to reduce the <hi>Silver</hi> into a very fine powder, for an eaſier diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>The Precipitate of <hi>Silver</hi> made with ſalt, or Copper, waxes brown in the drying, and though dried in the ſhade, which doubtleſs is by reaſon of ſome ſmall proportion of Copper that it contains.</p>
                     <p>If you have diſſolved an ounce of <hi>Coppel-ſilver,</hi> and precipitate it with Salt or Copper, you'l draw an ounce and three drachms of Precipitate well waſht and dried; this augmentation does proceed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48366:62"/>
from a remainder of the points which were broken in pieces, and yet do ſtill remain in the pores of the metal; for theſe pores being very ſmall, they do but hardly let go what they have received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                     <p>There is no need of diſtilling a part of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, that the Tincture may be the ſtronger, as ſome have preſumed to write: for on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it cauſes a Cryſtallization, which diminiſhes both its colour and ſtrength, for the reaſon I have given before.</p>
                     <p>The effect of this <hi>Tincture</hi> for Diſeaſes muſt rather be attributed to the Salt of Urine, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, than to the <hi>Silver;</hi> for they are not only able to fly into the Head, and open obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions there, but aſſiſted with the Natural heat do open the pores of all the body, and drive out ill humours by tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>The portion of <hi>Silver</hi> which remains at the bottom of the Matraſs being impregnated with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile parts would fly into the Air, if it were melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alone without the addition of ſomething elſe; wherefore the abovementioned matter is added to it, that being of a very fixt nature may weigh it down, and hinder it from flying away.</p>

                     <p>Theſe branches do proceed from the ſpirit of <hi>Niter,</hi> which being incorporated with the <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> do form divers Figures, according to the room and moiſture it hath to expatiate it ſelf in. For if you ſhould put to it but ten or twelve ounces of water, nothing but a kind of Cryſtals in great confuſion would be able to appear. On the contrary, if you ſhould uſe too much water, nothing would then be ſeen beſides a little preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated powder. You muſt let the mixture lye ſtill for forty days together, becauſe the ſpirit of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> being very much weakned by common water is able to work but very ſlowly. If the matter ſhould happen to be removed, the figure would quickly fall into confuſion, but would recover it ſelf again, if you let it lye ſtill long enough. This Preparation is beſt performed in a cool place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly a Cryſtallization.</p>
                     <p>This Operation may be fitly compared with the manner of Generation and Nouriſhment of Plants in the Earth; for if the ſeed abounds with too much moiſture, the ſpirits which ſerve to ferment and dilate its parts, will be rendred ſo weak, as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48366:63"/>
not to be able to act, and ſo nothing can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; if on the contrary there ſhould prove too little moiſture, the ſpirits not finding room enough to expatiate in, would either continue impriſoned or evaporate into Air, and ſo be ineffectual. But when there happens to be a fit proportion of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Earth, then the ſpirits gently moving about do inſenſibly expatiate themſelves, and do rarifie and ſublime along with them the ſubſtance of the ſeed, from whence Vegetation doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. But to return unto our Operation.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould deſire to ſeparate the <hi>Silver</hi> from the <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſhake the whole together, and having poured it out into an earthen Veſſel, make it boil for half a quarter of an hour, then let it cool a little, till it becomes little more than luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm; pour upon it a quart of water by little and little, in which you have diſſolved two ounces of Sea-ſalt, and a white <hi>Precipitate</hi> will fall down; pour off the water by Inclination, and dry the Powder. Then put it in a Retort placed in a Sand-furnace, and having fitted to it a Receiver fill'd with water, give a ſmall fire at firſt, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it by degrees till the Retort grows red-hot, and your Quick-ſilver will diſtil drop by drop into the water; continue the fire till nothing more will diſtil; let the Veſſels cool; pour the water out of the Receiver, and having waſht the <hi>Mercury,</hi> dry it with linnen, or the crum of bread, and keep it for uſe.</p>
                     <p>You'l find your Silver in the Retort, which you may reduce into an Ingot, by melting it in a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible with a little Salt-peter in a great Circular fire.</p>

It will not all of it quite diſſolve in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> as ſome have affirmed, but ſome part will remain undiſſolved, which ſhews it is compounded of different parts, and that its Pores are of a different figure.

                  <p>Melt in a Crucible what quantity of <hi>Tinn</hi> you think fit, and caſt it into a round wooden box, that has been rubb'd within on all ſides with a

                     <p>The wooden box muſt be round, becauſe that figure is the moſt proper to ſhake a thing in; and the clefts of the box muſt be joyned together as cloſe as may be; and but little of the <hi>Tinn</hi> muſt be put into the box at a time, that the parts may be the better able to ſeparate and fall into a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by means of the motion or agitation. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the thing may be done without rubbing the box with chalk, but by this means the melted <hi>Tinn</hi> is hindred from burning the box, as it otherwiſe would.

But becauſe the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Tinn</hi> is lockt up in other ſubſtances, it remains quiet for ſome time to unite with the <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> before it raiſes a detonation.

               <p>There is another ſort of <hi>Marcaſſite,</hi> called <hi>Zinch,</hi> that much reſembles <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> and on which the ſame preparations may be made that I am going to deſcribe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Magiſtery</hi> of <hi>Biſmuth</hi> is a <hi>Tinn-glaſs</hi> diſſolved, and precipitated in a very white powder.</p>
                  <p>Diſſolve in a Matraſs an ounce of <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> groſly powdered with three ounces of Spirit of Niter. Pour the Diſſolution into a clean White-ware Veſſel, and pour upon it five or ſix pints of Fountain-water, in which you ſhall have diſſolved before-hand an Ounce of Sea-ſalt, you'l ſee a White powder Precipitate to the bottom. Pour off the Water by Inclination, and waſh this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery</hi> ſeveral times, then dry it in the ſhade. It is an excellent <hi>Coſmetick,</hi> called <hi>Spaniſh White,</hi> that ſerves to whiten the complexion. It is either mixed in <hi>Pomatum,</hi> or Lilie-water.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>You muſt uſe a large <hi>Bolt-head</hi> to diſſolve the <hi>Biſmuth</hi> in, becauſe the great <hi>Ebullition</hi> that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, as ſoon as <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> is caſt upon it, requires room to move in. You muſt likewiſe have a care as much as you can, of receiving the <hi>Vapours</hi> at your Noſe or Mouth, for they are very offenſive to the breaſt.</p>
                     <p>This quick and violent <hi>Ebullition</hi> proceeds from the <hi>acids</hi> immediate penetration of the large pores of <hi>Biſmuth</hi> ſo ſoon as thrown upon it, and the <hi>acid</hi> violently divides all that oppoſes its motion. It happens alſo that the <hi>Bolt-head</hi> grows ſo hot, that a man can't endure his hand upon it, becauſe the points of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> do chafe againſt the ſolid body of <hi>Biſmuth</hi> with ſuch force, that you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from thence much the ſame heat, as when two ſolid bodies are rub'd againſt one another. Add to this, that the great ſtore of igneous particles contained in <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> may much increaſe this heat.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> becomes turbid through ſome impurities in the <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> you muſt pour into it about twice as much <hi>Water</hi> and filter it; for if you ſhould go to filter it without water, it would <hi>coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> like <hi>ſalt</hi> in the <hi>Filter,</hi> and not paſs through. This <hi>Coagulation</hi> proceeds from the <hi>acid ſpirits</hi> of <hi>Niter</hi> that are included in the particles of <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> which finding too little liquor to ſwim in and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe, do gather together into <hi>Cryſtals</hi> when the <hi>diſſolution</hi> is cold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:48366:70"/>The impurity which commonly ſwims upon the ſolution of <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> is a fat or bituminous matter which will not diſſolve in the <hi>ſpirit of Niter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Magiſtery</hi> may be made by pouring in great quantity of Fountain water without any <hi>ſalt,</hi> into the <hi>diſſolution,</hi> but it is made the quicker, when you uſe <hi>ſalt,</hi> and the <hi>Precipitation</hi> is the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>ſalt</hi> does encounter and break ſome of the <hi>acids</hi> that <hi>water</hi> alone was not able to weaken ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently.</p>
                     <p>Now ſome difficulty appears in conceiving how plain water alone comes to <hi>precipitate Biſmuth, Lead,</hi> &amp; <hi>Antimony,</hi> which the <hi>acid</hi> had diſſolved, and yet can do nothing at all to the <hi>precipitating Gold, Silver,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of ſome <hi>ſalt</hi> or other body; I do imagine that the former having large <hi>Pores,</hi> the <hi>acids</hi> cannot ſtick ſo cloſe in them but that <hi>water</hi> is able to force them out; but <hi>Gold, Silver,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> having finer <hi>pores</hi> in compariſon than the other, do retain the <hi>acids</hi> ſo very cloſely that the weak impulſes of water alone can make no <hi>ſeparation;</hi> ſome more active body is requiſite to do it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Augmentation</hi> which happens to <hi>Biſmuth</hi> when made into a <hi>Magiſtery,</hi> does proceed from ſome part of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Niter</hi> that remains ſtill in it, notwithſtanding the <hi>Precipitation</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Commonly one Drachm of this <hi>Magiſtery</hi> or <hi>Precipitate</hi> is mixed with Four ounces of Water, or in an ounce of <hi>Pomatum.</hi> It ſoftens the skin very much, and is alſo good againſt the Itch, becauſe it feeds upon thoſe <hi>acids</hi> or <hi>Salts</hi> which cheriſh this Diſeaſe.</p>

                  <p>If you put this Powder to Calcine in a Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratory Fire for three or four hours, it will be of a red colour, and is that which is called <hi>Minium.</hi>

                     <p>There happens an obſervation in the <hi>Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi> as well as ſeveral other things, which very well deſerves ſome reflection. 'Tis that although the <hi>Sulphureous</hi> or <hi>Volatile</hi> parts of <hi>Lead</hi> do fly away in the <hi>Calcination,</hi> which loſs ſhould indeed make it weigh the leſs, nevertheleſs after a long <hi>Calcining</hi> 'tis found, that inſtead of loſing it increaſes in weight.</p>
                     <p>Some trying to explicate this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> do ſay, that as long as the violence of the flame does open and divide the parts of the <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi> the <hi>acid</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> or other matter that burns, does inſinuate into tha pores of this <hi>Calx,</hi> where 'tis ſtopt or fixt by the <hi>Alkali;</hi> but this reaſon will not hold, when 'tis conſidered that this Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation comes to paſs as well when <hi>Lead</hi> is <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd</hi> with <hi>Coals</hi> as <hi>Wood,</hi> for <hi>Coals</hi> contain only a fixt <hi>Salt</hi> that riſes not at all.</p>
                     <p>'Tis better therefore to refer this effect to the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>pores</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> in ſuch a manner, that part of the fire inſinuating into them does there remain imbodied, and can't get forth again, whence the weight comes to be encreaſed.</p>
                     <p>If you would revive this <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> by way of <hi>Fuſion,</hi> its parts do ſqueez and expreſs the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous particles that were incloſed, and the <hi>Lead</hi>

Mix all your Impregnations together, in an earthen or glaſs Veſſel. Evaporate in a Sand-fire with a gentle heat, about two thirds of the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, or 'till there riſes a little skin over it. Then transfer your Veſſel into a Celler or ſome ſuch cool place, without jogging it; there will appear white Cryſtals, which you muſt ſeparate, and Evaporate the Liquor as before, and ſet it again in the Cellar. Continue your Evaporations and Cryſtallizations, 'till you have gotten all your Salt. Dry it in the Sun, and keep it in a Glaſs.</p>

                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48366:72"/>If you would make it exceeding white, you muſt diſſolve it in equal quantities of diſtill'd Vinegar, and common water, then Filter it, and Cryſtallize it, as I ſaid before.

                     <p>I do commonly uſe <hi>Ceruſſe</hi> for preparing the Salt of <hi>Saturn,</hi> becauſe I find it to be more open, and eaſier to diſſolve, than the other Preparations of <hi>Lead,</hi> by reaſon of the Vinegar it is already impregnated with.</p>
                     <p>The Ebullition, that is obſerved, doth proceed from the violent entrance of the <hi>acids,</hi> which do forcibly ſeparate the parts of the Matter. But it is remarkable that the Efferveſcency which happens upon pouring a like quantity of <hi>acids</hi> on any other preparation of <hi>Lead,</hi> is a great deal ſtronger; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the <hi>acid</hi> meets with a body not ſo open as <hi>Ceruſſe,</hi> it muſt uſe greater endeavour to enter into it, and conſequently raiſes up the Matter higher.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:48366:73"/>In theſe Efferveſcences as well as many others, you cannot perceive the leaſt Degree of Heat, nay ſome preſume to aſſert that Cold is increaſed in them. Vinegar loſes all its force in the penetration of <hi>Lead,</hi> and acquires a kind of ſweet or ſugar'd taſte.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not imagine that a true <hi>Salt of Lead</hi> can be drawn. It is nothing but a diſſolution of its ſubſtance by <hi>acids,</hi> which do very cloſely unite with it, to form a kind of Salt. For if by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation you ſhould draw off the humidity of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, you'd find it to be nothing but an Inſipid water, and conſequently deprived of all its <hi>acids.</hi> I ſhall prove that better hereafter, when we come to revive our Salt into <hi>Lead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Salt</hi> called <hi>Sugar</hi> by reaſon of its ſweetneſs is good for many Diſeaſes that are cauſed by <hi>acid</hi> or ſharp humors, becauſe it aſſwages them, and mitigates their keenneſs. This is particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in <hi>Quinzies,</hi> whoſe cauſe doth ordinarily proceed from a ſaline or acid ſeroſity, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling too abundantly on the <hi>Muſcles</hi> of the <hi>Larynx</hi> raiſes a fermentation that dilates their <hi>fibers,</hi> and cauſes the Inflammation we ſee. Thus what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is able to dull the edge of Acids is good for the cure of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Menſtrual Purgations, Flux of the Hemorrhoids and Dyſenteries are uſually cauſed by ſharp cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Salts which fall into the Veſſels. Wherefore the <hi>Salt of Saturn,</hi> as all other matters that abſorb Acids, do ſerve to cure theſe diſtempers; for take away the cauſe of a diſeaſe, and the effect will ſoon ceaſe.</p>

                     <p>When good ſtore of Water is poured upon the Impregnation of <hi>Saturn,</hi> it turns white like Milk, and is commonly called, <hi>Virgins milk;</hi> it is uſed in Inflammations, and to Pimples in the face: if you let this Milk ſettle, it becomes as clear as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a White powder ſinks down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; this Powder does proceed from the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Lead</hi> which were held up by the acidity of the Vinegar, and were made let go their hold, by the acceſs of Water diluting the acid. This Magiſtery being well waſht may ſerve like the other that I now deſcribed; but becauſe Water alone has not ſtrength enough to deſtroy the acid ſo, as to make it quit every particle that it held diſſolved, ſome part of the <hi>Lead</hi> ſtill remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernable in the liquor, and does not precipitate. Wherefore it is better to follow my deſcription, in the making <hi>Magiſtery of Saturn.</hi> You muſt uſe an equal quantity of Water and Vinegar to diſſolve the <hi>Salt of Saturn,</hi> for if you ſhould uſe Water alone, it would rather cauſe a precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>The Oil of Tartar, or rather the Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar diſſolved being an Alkali deſtroys the edges of the Vinegar that ſuſpended the <hi>Lead,</hi> whence it comes to precipitate; for finding nothing in the Liquor that is able to hold it up, it falls down by its own weight.</p>
                     <p>Now in this Operation there happens no effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency at all, becauſe the edges of the Vinegar
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48366:74"/>
being broken, the fragments of them which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main have not activity, and are not keen enough to enter into the pores of <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> with a ſufficient penetration. And it is the ſame thing with all other precipitations of matters which have been diſſolved by Vinegar: but when the ſolution has been performed with ſtronger acids, the precipitations are made with ebullition, for the reaſon that I gave in my Remarks upon <hi>Aurum Fulminans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Powder being waſht and dried is nothing but a <hi>Ceruſſe</hi> rendred exceeding fine.

                     </p>
                     <p>It is evident from this Operation that an ounce and ſix drachms of the more Acid parts of <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> are ſufficient to impregnate four ounces and two drachms of <hi>Lead,</hi> to reduce it into <hi>Salt;</hi> but the ſtrangeſt thing that happens to it, is the great change that <hi>acids</hi> do give it, inſomuch that it is not to be known again in the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Augmentation</hi> that the <hi>Lead</hi> in the Retort does here receive, is as evident as may be; for ſix drachms are taken out of it at laſt, more than were put in of <hi>Salt of Saturn,</hi> beſides an ounce and ſix drachms of liquor that were drawn out. So that we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that the four ounces and two drachms of <hi>Lead</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed two ounces and an half.</p>
                     <p>It is probable enough that the more rarified the <hi>Lead</hi> becomes, the more capable it will be of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous particles; for although the <hi>Salt of Saturn</hi> is not ſuffer'd to remain long in the fire, yet the <hi>Lead</hi> encreaſes apace.

                     <p>When this <hi>Calx</hi> is <hi>Calcined</hi> in an open fire in a <hi>Crucible,</hi> without ſtirring it, the parts of <hi>Lead</hi> cloſe together and expel the fiery particles, ſo that the <hi>Lead</hi> revives as it was before, and recovers its <hi>Natural</hi> gravity.</p>
                     <p>The matter when ſhut up in the Retort would never be able to revive, let the fire be made never ſo ſtrong, becauſe the igneous particles would have no liberty to get out.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Yellow earth</hi> that's found in the <hi>Crucible</hi> ſeems to be of a Golden colour, it is a terreſtrious and bituminous impurity that the <hi>Lead</hi> is purified from.

                  <hi>COpper</hi> is a Metal that abounds in Vitriol and Sulphur: it is called <hi>Venus,</hi> becauſe this <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> was thought to govern it particularly, and beſtow its Influences upon it: and for this reaſon there hath been attributed unto it the virtue of encreaſing ſeed, and curing the diſeaſes of thoſe parts that ſerve for Generation.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Copper</hi> contains in it a <hi>Corroſive</hi> quality, I would adviſe no body to uſe it <hi>inwardly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Copper</hi> takes Ruſt very eaſily, for if you leave but a drop of Water ſome hours upon a piece of it, it makes a <hi>Verdegreeſe.</hi> Have a care of <hi>drinking</hi> water, that has lain in <hi>Copper</hi> veſſels, for it always diſſolves ſome portion of it, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears eaſily from the taſte it leaves in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:48366:77"/>It will not be altogether amiſs to make mention here of an effect that is no leſs ſtrange than uſual. 'Tis that <hi>Water</hi> or any other liquor that's heated or boil'd in a <hi>Copper</hi> veſſel for a whole day toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſavours not at all, or not ſo much of the <hi>Copper,</hi> provided that it be not removed off the fire all that time, as other water warm'd in a like veſſel, and put from the fire but an hour; for whereas water alone can diſſolve ſomething of the <hi>Copper,</hi> it would ſeem that being aided with the heat of fire, it ſhould partake of its nature the more. Now in my opinion this is the moſt rational explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be given of this matter.</p>
               <p>Every body may perceive that when the <hi>water</hi> begins to heat in a <hi>Copper</hi> veſſel, that's ſet over the fire, little <hi>Atoms</hi> do riſe at bottom like the ſtirring of a powder, and theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> do encreaſe according as the water receives more heat, ſo that at length they make it boil on high; theſe little <hi>Atoms</hi> can have no other cauſe than the <hi>fiery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> which paſſing through the veſſel, do drive the water upwards apace, and rarifie its parts; for this reaſon it is that the water is not able to diſſolve any of the <hi>Copper,</hi> for being continually raiſed upwards, it can make no impreſſion upon the bottom of the veſſel.</p>
               <p>Perhaps ſome will tell me, that the liquor might take the impreſſion of the <hi>Copper,</hi> at the ſides of the Baſon; but it is eaſie to imagine that though there don't paſs through the ſides ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fiery particles as do at the bottom, there do paſs nevertheleſs enough to hinder the liquor from ſticking to or diſſolving any particles of the veſſel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:48366:78"/>But now on the contrary the veſſel being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from off the fire, and the motion of the igneous particles being quite ceaſed, the liquor partakes eaſily of the <hi>Copper,</hi> and ſo much the more eaſily as the fire has rarified the metal, and rendred it more proper for diſſolution.</p>
               <p>Every thing ſeems to confirm this Opinion, for if any liquor is put to boil over a ſtrong fire in a <hi>Copper</hi> veſſel, it will not impregnate in the leaſt, but if you place it upon a ſmall fire, and leave it ſo for ſome time, then becauſe there will not paſs enough fiery particles, to cover all the ſurface of the veſſel, and raiſe up the liquor, it will take ſome taſte of the <hi>Copper;</hi> but this taſte will not be ſo ſtrong as if you had left it the ſame length of time in ſuch a veſſel off the fire, after it had been warm'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liquors</hi> that are full of <hi>Salts</hi> do take the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Copper</hi> much more eaſily than thoſe that are not. Thus <hi>Confectioners</hi> do obſerve what I have mentioned; for though they boil their <hi>Confections</hi> in veſſels of <hi>Copper</hi> for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, they find them taſte nothing of the <hi>Copper,</hi> but they know that if they ſhould leave them but half an hour in the veſſel taken off the fire, they would be tainted with a moſt loathſom <hi>Copper</hi> taſte.</p>
               <p>We may learn from this Diſcourſe, not to uſe a <hi>Copper</hi> veſſel, when we have a mind to boil or heat a liquor gently, and when we do think fit to uſe it, to be ſure to keep a good brisk fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, and not to let what we have boil'd, cool afterwards in a veſſel of this nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48366:78"/>Another difficulty does here offer it ſelf on this ſubject, and it is to know why a <hi>Kettle</hi> that has been taken off the fire, is not ſo hot at <hi>bottom</hi> as at the <hi>ſides,</hi> ſo that as ſoon as it is removed from off the fire, one may touch it at bottom without burning ones finger, which can't be done at the ſides without preſent ſcalding.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of which is, that the fiery particles tending upwards through the bottom of the <hi>kettle,</hi> which is flat, in a direct line, don't make any ſtop in paſſing through, having but a little diſtance to conquer before they come into the liquor; but thoſe that riſe on the ſides, finding a longer ſpace to make upon the <hi>kettle,</hi> do many of them ſtop in the Pores of the <hi>Copper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not the ſame thing in veſſels that are made in another form, whoſe bottom is Globular, becauſe the fiery particles riſing up in an indirect line, do find more to do to paſs through it, than in a flat bottom, and ſo by conference more of them do ſtop.</p>
               <p>But it is objected, that if igneous bodies do paſs through the bottom of the <hi>kettle</hi> without any ſtop, they would not be able to heat it any more when it is empty than when it is filled with water; nevertheleſs it is plain, that when an empty veſſel is ſet over the fire, the bottom does heat and grow red-hot, eſpecially if left ſo a good while.</p>
               <p>I anſwer to this, that when the <hi>kettle</hi> which was ſet in a great fire is full of liquor, the fiery parts having paſſed through the bottom in a ſtrait line, as I ſaid, are in a manner abſorbed by the liquor, and have no more ſtrength or action left to reflect again upon the bottom of the veſſel,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48366:79"/>
and ſo to beat it; but now when it is empty, the fiery parts which paſs through the bottom, finding nothing to drown them and check their motion, many of them do return back upon the bottom, and that way heat it ſo much as they do.</p>
               <p>And the ſame reaſon holds, why an empty <hi>Tinn</hi> or <hi>Leaden</hi> veſſel being ſet in the fire does quickly melt, but when filled with liquor they will not melt, make what fire under them you pleaſe; for the fiery parts finding nothing that is able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their activity in an empty veſſel, do paſs to and fro through its pores often enough to melt it. But theſe ſame fiery parts finding moiſture to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them in a full veſſel, they cannot return upon the bottom ſo as to melt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Copper</hi> does not melt ſo eaſily as many other matters, becauſe it contains more terreſtrious parts than thoſe others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Braſs,</hi> or <hi>Yellow Copper</hi> is a mixture of <hi>Lapis Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminaris</hi> and <hi>Copper,</hi> and veſſels that are made of it give leſs impreſſion to liquors than the others.</p>

                  <p>To <hi>Calcine Copper,</hi> is to purifie it from its more Volatile parts, by the means of common <hi>Sulphur</hi> and fire, in order to render it the more compact.</p>
                  <p>Stratifie plates of <hi>Copper</hi> with powder'd Sulphur in a large Crucible, cover the Crucible with a Cover that hath a hole in the middle, to give the Vapours vent.

                     <p>You muſt put the <hi>Copper</hi> into a large body, placed within the Chimney, and pour to it by little and little the <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> there does preſently riſe a great efferveſcency, and a red cloud from

it, which would be very miſchievous to the breaſt, if it were not avoided. Then the veſſel grows ſo hot that a man cannot keep his hand upon it, and the heat continues until the ſolution be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for then the liquor clears up, and becomes of a fair <hi>blue</hi> colour.</p>
                     <p>The great efferveſcency that happens, does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſutable Pores of <hi>Copper</hi> to the edges of <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> ſo that they can make their entrance and joſtles with a good force; for when theſe edges, which did before ſwim with all liberty in a liquid, do find their motion checkt in the body of the metal, they do ſtrive to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves, and do thereby ſeparate the parts of the <hi>Copper.</hi> It is this violent ſeparation which cauſes the ebullition and heat; for the <hi>acid</hi> edges ſtriking ſtrongly againſt the ſolid parts of <hi>Copper,</hi> do cauſe a great agitation in the liquor, and by that means do excite a heat, much after the manner as when two ſolid bodies are beaten againſt one another violently, they grow ſo hot as even to ſtrike <hi>fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The red cloud is derived from the <hi>Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which upon rarefaction does always acquire that ſame colour.</p>

                  <hi>IRon</hi> is called <hi>Mars</hi> from the <hi>Planet</hi> of that name, whoſe Influence it is thought to receive; it is a very Porous Metal compounded of a Vitriolick Salt, Sulphur, and Earth, ill digeſted together; wherefore the diſſolution of its parts is very eaſily performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iron</hi> is found in many <hi>Mines</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> in form of a <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Marcaſſite,</hi> which much reſembles the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> but this laſt is more heavy and brittle than <hi>Iron.</hi> The <hi>Loadſtone</hi> is alſo found in Mines of <hi>Iron,</hi> and may be reduced into <hi>Iron</hi> by a ſtrong fire. <hi>Iron</hi> for its part does eaſily acquire the virtue of the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> as every body knows, ſo that theſe bodies do ſeem to differ only in the figure of their Pores, as has been very well obſerved by our modern Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>

intent than <hi>Steel,</hi> becauſe it is more Soluble; for if the action of <hi>Iron</hi> proceeds from nothing but its <hi>Salt,</hi> (as there is no reaſon to doubt,) the Salt of <hi>Iron</hi> muſt be much more eaſily ſeparated in the ſtomach than that of <hi>Steel,</hi> becauſe as I have ſhewn before, the Pores of <hi>Steel</hi> are more cloſe than thoſe of <hi>Iron,</hi> and therefore this muſt have quicker ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; beſides that <hi>Steel</hi> being harder to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved doth ſometimes paſs away with the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without beſtowing any impreſſion on the <hi>Chyle.</hi> The reaſon that hath induced People to believe that <hi>Steel</hi> is better for uſe than <hi>Iron,</hi> was its being thought to be deprived of many impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Calcination, but that which is called Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity is the more open part of the <hi>Iron,</hi> and conſequently the more wholeſome.</p>
                     <p>This Preparation of the <hi>Saffron of Mars</hi> is out of the common road, and longer a doing than the others; but it is the beſt of all that ever were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. The Dew is impregnated with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent that opens very much the Pores of <hi>Iron,</hi> and incorporating with it renders it more active and ſoluble than it was before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iron</hi> doth open Obſtructions by its <hi>ſalt,</hi> which being aſſiſted with the ſolid parts of the Metal, penetrates further than other <hi>Salts.</hi> But you muſt always purge and moiſten the Perſon you give it to with broths before you preſume to give it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if it ſhould find the paſſages of the ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels filled and obſtructed with groſs matters, it ſtops and ſometimes cauſes Inflammations that create pains like to thoſe of the Colick.</p>
                     <p>Many do uſe the <hi>filings of Steel</hi> without any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration at all.</p>

                        <hi>Iron</hi> doth frequently open Obſtructions by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbing, as an Alkali, the Acid that fomented them.</p>
                     <p>Seeing that ſome perſons have indeavoured to contradict the <hi>Remarks</hi> I have made upon the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>Mars,</hi> and particularly concerning the preference I have given <hi>Iron</hi> to <hi>Steel</hi> for Phyſical uſes, I have thought it not convenient to end this Chapter, before I have laid down and Anſwered their Objections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> then they ſay, that becauſe the different ſubſtances of <hi>Mars</hi> cannot be ſeparated, as thoſe of <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables</hi> can, it is in vain that an <hi>Aperitive</hi> virtue is attributed to its <hi>Salt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I grant, all the ſubſtances of <hi>Mars</hi> can't be ſeparated ſo eaſily as thoſe of <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables;</hi> but becauſe we find <hi>Salts</hi> to be <hi>Aperitive,</hi> and commonly Remedies that are ſo, are full of <hi>Salts,</hi> and that <hi>water</hi> in which <hi>ruſt</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> has ſteeped for ſome time, is proper to open by way of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> it ſeems to me rational enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this effect of <hi>Mars</hi> principally to its <hi>Salt;</hi> for if the <hi>water</hi> has carried off any taſte or pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating quality from <hi>Iron,</hi> there's nothing at all in <hi>Mars</hi> that is able to contribute ſuch a virtue to it, beſides the <hi>Salt</hi> therein diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> they ſay, the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> being united and in a manner become <hi>inſeparable,</hi> cannot act but by conſent of both, and receive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether joyntly the good or bad impreſſions, that may happen to them.</p>
                     <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> there's no reaſon to think the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> abſolutely <hi>inſeparable</hi> from the <hi>Earth,</hi> for the <hi>water</hi> in which this Metal has ſteeped or boiled,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48366:85"/>
after <hi>Filtration</hi> does contain a <hi>Vitriolick</hi> taſte, and <hi>Aperitive</hi> quality. Now it is the effect of <hi>Salt</hi> to diſſolve imperceptibly in Water and drive by <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> as I have ſaid; but if any body would take the pains to ſteep and boil gently the <hi>ruſt</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> a good while in <hi>water,</hi> then <hi>Filter</hi> it, and <hi>Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> the liquor over a ſmall fire to a <hi>Pellicle,</hi> he'l by <hi>Cryſtallization</hi> or by an entire <hi>evaporation</hi> of the humidity, gain a ſmall quantity of <hi>Salt;</hi> and it is probable enough that there was much more in the <hi>water,</hi> as may be collected from the ſtrong taſte it had of <hi>Mars,</hi> but it being ſomething of a <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> nature, it fum'd away in the <hi>Evaporation.</hi> I do not ſay nevertheleſs, that the cloſe connexion of <hi>Earth</hi> with the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> is altogether unuſeful for this effect; on the contrary, I do conceive that this <hi>Earth</hi> rendring the <hi>Salt</hi> more heavy than otherwiſe it would be, does help to drive it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and cauſes the <hi>Mars</hi> ſometimes to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate as much by its gravity as by its <hi>Salt;</hi> but we muſt attribute the principal virtue to the Vehicle which is <hi>Salt,</hi> ſince without that, the <hi>Earth</hi> would be a dead matter, and would have no more action than other <hi>Earths</hi> bereaved of their <hi>Salts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They ſay that in all probability <hi>Mars</hi> does act only according to the preparations which the different juices it meets with in the ſtomach do make; for theſe acid juices not failing to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with, and to diſſolve it, there reſults from this diſſolution a liberty to the parts of the body on which theſe juices did act, and conſequently their reſtauration a-new.</p>
                     <p>I am willing to believe that ſometimes <hi>Mars</hi> may act in the body like an <hi>Alkali,</hi> by abſorbing and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48366:86"/>
ſweetning the <hi>acid</hi> humour which it meets with, as it does abſorb and ſweeten the <hi>acid</hi> liquors which are poured upon it; but it muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from hence, that its Aperitive faculty does always conſiſt in this effect, becauſe as I before hinted, the water in which <hi>Mars</hi> has been put to boil, is Aperitive, and yet there is no Alkali in it to ſweeten the <hi>acids</hi> of the body, when it is drunk.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They object, that we muſt not think the <hi>hardneſs</hi> of the parts of <hi>Steel</hi> above <hi>Iron,</hi> whoſe <hi>Pores</hi> are more open, does render it leſs proper for all ſorts of Preparations, ſeeing <hi>Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> and many other <hi>acids</hi> are found to diſſolve with the ſame eaſe both <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Steel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, that if <hi>Corroſive ſpirits</hi> do diſſolve <hi>Steel,</hi> they can diſſolve <hi>Iron</hi> more eaſily; and whereas a ſmaller quantity of them can operate upon <hi>Iron</hi> than <hi>Steel,</hi> a better effect does thence follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> 'Tis <hi>objected</hi> that the ſolidity of <hi>Steel</hi> may be an advantageous circumſtance to it, for the better fixing the diſſolving <hi>Juices</hi> that are in the ſtomach, and that for <hi>Metals</hi> the pure are to be choſen before thoſe that are not ſo.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, that inſtead of the ſolidity of <hi>Steels</hi> being helpful to the ſtomach, it is certainly of great prejudice to it, as well as to thoſe other parts it is diſtributed into; for the juices that are found in the ſtomach being but weak diſſolvents, are not able to penetrate nor rarifie this metal, if it be too hard; ſo that they leave it crude and indigeſt, heavy and troubleſome to this part: Wherefore it paſſes away by Stool, without any
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48366:86"/>
good effect, as it often happens. But now if a little of this <hi>Steel</hi> does happen to paſs along with the <hi>Chyle,</hi> it rather cauſes than takes away <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,</hi> for by inſinuating into ſmall veſſels, it ſtops in the narrow paſſages, and cauſes grievous pains.</p>
                     <p>For what is ſaid concerning the <hi>Purity</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, it is of great uſe to Tradeſmen, for they by Purifying metals from their more rarified and <hi>Volatile</hi> parts, do make them the leſs <hi>Porous,</hi> and ſo the leſs liable to ſuffer prejudice from Air or time. Thus <hi>Steel</hi> is much fitter for Utenſils than <hi>Iron,</hi> becauſe its <hi>Pores</hi> are cloſer laid together, and it takes not <hi>ruſt</hi> ſo ſoon as <hi>Iron;</hi> but in <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> it is not the ſame thing, for thoſe Metals that are more rarified, and are more eaſily diſſolved in the Body, are ſuch as we find beſt effects from, for the reaſon I have given. So that what <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> call <hi>Purity,</hi> is often but an <hi>impurity</hi> in <hi>Remedies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> They ſay, that if one would hope to find a diſtinct <hi>Salt</hi> in <hi>Mars,</hi> it would be more likely to find it in that which is <hi>Purified,</hi> than in the <hi>Faeces</hi> which are ſeparated from it, and which are indeed but the <hi>Impurities</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> that <hi>Steel</hi> is made of.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, there would be ſome reaſon to think that <hi>Salt</hi> might be more eaſily found in <hi>Steel</hi> than <hi>Iron,</hi> if in the making of <hi>Steel, Iron</hi> were ſimply <hi>Calcined,</hi> without adding <hi>Nails</hi> and <hi>Horns</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> in the <hi>Calcination;</hi> for then it might be ſaid that the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> being in part evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, its <hi>ſalt</hi> would be the more <hi>Soluble:</hi> but we muſt conſider that the <hi>Volatile ſalts</hi> which come from theſe parts of <hi>Animals,</hi> being piercing <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali's,</hi>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48366:87"/>
do deſtroy the <hi>acid ſalts</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> and do thereby render the <hi>Steel</hi> more compact, and unfit to take <hi>ruſt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſalts</hi> which by their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did rarifie the <hi>metal,</hi> are fixed, and as it were <hi>mortified,</hi> and have not the capacity of acting as they did. This is the reaſon why a plate of <hi>Steel</hi> that has infuſed in Water will not give ſo great Impreſſion to it, as a plate of <hi>Iron</hi> Calcined, of the ſame weight, infuſing the ſame time, will do.</p>
                     <p>Another thing remarkable in the <hi>Calcination</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> to turn it into <hi>Steel,</hi> is, that it is thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its more <hi>Volatile ſalt,</hi> which ſhould have moſt effect with it, in hopes to free it from <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi> and that which is called the <hi>Scories,</hi> is the better part of <hi>Iron</hi> that has been rarified by its <hi>ſalt.</hi> Thus for the ſame reaſon that ſome are pleaſed to call the <hi>ruſt</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> its droſs, the whole metal may deſerve the ſame appellation, all of it being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>ruſting,</hi> if it be but laid in the open air.</p>

                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:48366:88"/>A Paſte is made of the mixture, to the end that the <hi>acidity</hi> of the Sulphur being diluted by Water may inſenſibly penetrate the Iron, and open it the better; and it is very eaſie to obſerve this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration, ſeeing that the matter does grow ſo hot of it ſelf, that a man can hardly endure his hand upon it. It is the ſame thing whether you make a ſmaller quantity, or make five and twenty or thirty pounds of this Preparation at a time, it flames, and half calcines before it is put upon the Fire, which cannot be explicated but by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent action and frication of the <hi>acid</hi> part of the Sulphur againſt the ſolid body of this metal.</p>

                     <p>Becauſe <hi>Mars</hi> is an impure <hi>Vitriol,</hi> the more it is Calcined, the more aſtringent it is.

                     <p>Not that I expect by this means to ſeparate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely all that is Aperitive in <hi>Mars</hi> from that which is aſtringent; that is a thing in a manner impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by reaſon of the ſtrict union of its Salt and earth in the Mine; but I do believe it very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay, that if there be any thing aſtringent in this metal, as it cannot be denied, it muſt needs be the more terreſtrious part,</p>

                  <p>It is an admirable Remedy for all Diſeaſes that proceed from Obſtructions: the Doſe is from four to twelve grains, in Broth, or ſome appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Liquor.</p>

                     <p>The Spirit of Wine ſerves here to moderate the too great force of the Oil of Vitriol, which if alone would indeed in a little time penetrate all the parts of the Iron, and cauſe a very impure Salt; but the ſpirit of Wine hinders its ſo quick diſſolution; ſo that nothing but the more ſoluble part incorporates with the Oil, to make a Salt or Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Frying-pan</hi> is more proper for this Operation than another veſſel leſs flat, becauſe the liquor ſpreads it ſelf about, and incorporates the better; you muſt uſe a Pan that is new.</p>
                     <p>If you uſe two ounces of Spirit of Wine, and the ſame quantity of Oil of Vitriol, in a ſmall <hi>Frying-pan,</hi> you'l obtain five ounces of <hi>Mars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may put your liquor a thumbs height in the Pan, and leave it there a day and a half, or two days without ſtirring it.</p>
                     <p>The Oil of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is improperly called Oil, being nothing but the more cauſtick Spirit, as I ſhall prove in its proper place.</p>

                  <p>Put eight ounces of clean <hi>filings of Iron</hi> into a large Matraſs, and pour upon it two pounds of common water heated a little; add unto it a pound of good <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> ſtir it, and ſet your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs in hot Sand, leave it in Digeſtion four and twenty hours, during which time the pureſt part of the Iron will diſſolve; ſeparate the Liquor by Inclination, and fling away the earthy part that remains in a ſmall quantity at the bottom.

                     <p>The Spirit of Vitriol is weakned by the Water, to the end that it may be incapable of diſſolving but only the purer part of <hi>Mars.</hi> Moreover if it were uſed alone, it would incorporate with the very ſubſtance of <hi>Mars,</hi> but would not be able to diſſolve any of it, becauſe there would be wanting ſufficient moiſture to ſeparate its parts.</p>
                     <p>During the diſſolution the liquor heats and boils conſiderably, becauſe the acidity of Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol doth violently enter the body of this metal, and makes a ſeparation of its parts.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>Evaporate</hi> unto a <hi>Pellicle,</hi> doth ſignifie to conſume the Liquor until a kind of thin skin is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to ſwim upon it, which always happens when ſome part of the moiſture being evaporated, there remains but little more than is neceſſary to hold the Salt in <hi>Fuſion.</hi>

                     <p>An Acid Spirit may be drawn from this <hi>Vitriol of Mars</hi> by diſtilling it in a Retort in a Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory fire, like common Vitriol; this Spirit hath been thought to have the ſame virtues as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spirit of Vitriol, but it can't be near ſo good, becauſe it hath much blunted or broken ſome part of its edges againſt the body of <hi>Mars,</hi> in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and diſtillation.

                     <p>Thoſe who do attribute the aperitive effect of <hi>Mars</hi> only to its ſweetning (as an Alkali) the

                     <p>This Preparation is Sudorifick by reaſon of ſome particles of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> that remain in the Precipitated <hi>Mars;</hi> for when theſe Saline parts are actuated by the heat of the Body, being of a very Volatile nature, they do inſenſibly diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute themſelves rather into the Pores of all the Body, than follow the courſe of ſixt Salts by way of Urine; whence a Sweat does come to follow, or ſometimes an inſenſible tranſpiration, becauſe it rarifies and gives vent to abundance of Humors that were not able to paſs, by reaſon of their viſcoſity. Sometimes alſo finding the Pores too much obſtructed, it is forced to become fixt, and follow the ordinary courſe by way of Urine, and then it opens the <hi>Lymphatick veſſels,</hi> and evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates ſeveral matters that were contained in them.</p>
                     <p>People often find greater benefit from much Urine than Sweat, becauſe the way of Urine is more natural and weakens leſs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of Mercury.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ick-Silver</hi> is a prodigy among Metals; for it is fluid like water, and though a very heavy body, yet it eaſily flies away when ſet over the fire.</p>
               <p>It is probable, that the parts of this Metal are all of a round figure, for divide it how you will without adding to it, and it always keeps a globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form to every part; and if you look a little near it, when it diſſolves in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> you'l ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an infinite number of little round bodies, which riſe up in the liquor, like ſmoke.</p>
               <p>Now the parts of <hi>Mercury</hi> being ſuppoſed round, it may be explicated how this metal does remain fluid, and why it Volatilizes ſo eaſily by fire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſo exceeding heavy, for the round figure being no ways proper for the connexion or union of parts, the little bodies which do compoſe the <hi>Quicksilver,</hi> cannot adhere together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they muſt roul one upon another, as we ſee happens to all round bodies; and this is that which cauſes the fluidity of this metal.</p>
               <p>As for its Volatility, it proceeds from this, that the round parts being only <hi>contiguous,</hi> and having no proper union together, nothing hinders its parts from riſing by the force of fire; for that which makes the other metals to be more <hi>fixt</hi> than
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48366:95"/>
                  <hi>Mercury,</hi> and to remain in the fire without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming wholly, is becauſe their parts are <hi>continued,</hi> and ſo faſtned together that fire has no power to diſunite them in order to Volatilize them.</p>
               <p>It may be objected that the parts of <hi>Quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> being granted round, they ſhould for the ſame reaſon be light, becauſe the round bodies which approach one another, do leave many empty ſpaces between them.</p>
               <p>But though there are ſuch vacuities, the little balls are maſſive and compact, and this cauſes their gravity.</p>
               <p>There's another objection, that is, the parts of <hi>Mercury</hi> are heavy, how come they to be vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized by fire?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that when theſe parts are ſaid to be heavy, it is in compariſon with other little bodies that are lighter: but you muſt not imagine that every part of <hi>Mercury</hi> ſhould be heavy enough to reſiſt the rapid nature of fire. But beſides, theſe little <hi>Mercurial</hi> bodies, which we ſuppoſe to be compact, may have their Pores of ſuch a texture, that the igneous parts being once gotten within them, may not be able to find a way out again, and ſo they and their ſmall priſons may fly up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>It is called <hi>Quicksilver</hi> from its fluidity, and <hi>Mercury</hi> becauſe it changes into different ſhapes, like the <hi>Celeſtial Mercury,</hi> from whom it is thought to receive its Influence.</p>
               <p>It is to be found in many places in <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Hungary,</hi> and even in <hi>France;</hi> for a few years ſince there was diſcovered near St. <hi>Lo</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> a Mine abounding in <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> from whence good ſtore of <hi>Mercury</hi> is drawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:48366:96"/>Some of it is alſo found <hi>running</hi> in the Mines, and this is paſſed through a Shammey skin to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it from ſome Earth that it may be joyned with; but becauſe it doth ſometimes prove very difficult to ſeparate it from the Earths with which it is in a manner incorporated, they are forced to diſtil it through Iron Retorts into Receivers filled with water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Natural Cinnabar,</hi> called <hi>Mineral,</hi> is a mixture of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> that ſublime together by the means of a Subterraneous heat, and this is done near after the ſame manner as <hi>Artificial Cinnabar</hi> is made, of which I ſhall ſpeak anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quicksilver</hi> by reaſon of its fluidity is hard to tranſport, wherefore a great quantity of it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> (in the places whence it is taken) after the manner following.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Artificial Cinnabar.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cinnabar</hi> is a mixture of Sulphur and Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſublimed together.</p>
                  <p>Take a quantity of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and melt it in a great earthen pan, then mix by little and little thrice as much <hi>Quick-ſilver;</hi> you muſt ſtir about and preſerve the Matter in Fuſion, till all the <hi>Mercury</hi> diſappears. Then powder your mixture, and ſublime it in pots in an open fire well govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you'l have a hard Maſs, and of a very red colour. If any heterogeneous Metal ſhould have been mixt with the <hi>Mercury,</hi> it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at the bottom of the Pots.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:48366:96"/>Beſides the convenience of eaſily tranſporting <hi>Mercury</hi> by this means, it is very uſeful in Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is alſo uſed in <hi>Pomatums</hi> for the Itch, and to make Fumes withal to raiſe a Salivation.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>A pound of <hi>Sulphur</hi> is able to incorporate three pounds of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and to make a Maſs together.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this mutation of <hi>Mercury</hi> into <hi>Cinnabar</hi> does proceed from the penetration which the more acid part of <hi>Sulphur</hi> does make into the <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the intangling its parts whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is now checkt. And being raiſed by the fire it volatilizes as it does, but the Saline or acid Spirits of <hi>Sulphur</hi> do fix it, ſo as that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſtop its volatility, and ſettle in the upper part of the pot, which is called <hi>ſubliming;</hi> whereas when it is all alone, or elſe joyned with ſome matter that cannot fix it, it evaporates quite away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cinnabar</hi> is ſhaped like needles, by reaſon of the acid Spirits of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which have entred into its body, and have impreſſed ſuch a figure; its red colour may proceed likewiſe from the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is of this colour when it is well rarified.</p>
                     <p>This Red appears brown while the <hi>Cinnabar</hi> is in the Maſs, but if you powder it very fine, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a good while, it becomes of a ſhining, and that ſo high a colour, that it has been called <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million.</hi> Some women do rub their Cheeks with it, when they have mixt it in <hi>Pomatum,</hi> but they don't conſider that ſo dangerous an accident may happen from it, as a <hi>Salivation.</hi>

                  <head>Reviving of Cinnabar into Quick-ſilver.</head>
                  <p>This Operation is performed in order to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the <hi>Sulphur</hi> which is in the <hi>Cinnabar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take a Pound of <hi>Artificial Cinnabar,</hi> powder it, and mix it exactly with three pounds of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime alſo powdered; put the mixture into an earthen or glaſs Retort, whoſe third part at leaſt remains empty. Place it in a Reverberatory Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and after having fitted to it a Receiver filled with Water, give your fire by degrees, and at laſt encreaſe it to the height, the <hi>Mercury</hi> will run drop by drop into the Receiver; continue the fire until no more will come; the Operation is commonly at an end in ſix or ſeven hours. Pour the Water out of the Receiver, and having waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Mercury</hi> to cleanſe it from ſome little portion of earth it might carry along with it, dry it with Linnen, or the crum of Bread, and keep it for uſe.</p>
                  <p>You muſt draw thirteen ounces and a half of flowing <hi>Mercury</hi> out of each pound of <hi>Artificial Cinnabar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may again <hi>Revive</hi> the <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> by mixing it with equal parts of <hi>filings of Iron,</hi> and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the Operation, as I have taught.</p>

                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48366:97"/>
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>When <hi>Mercury</hi> is thus <hi>revived,</hi> you may be ſure of its purity, becauſe if any Metal ſhould have mixed with it in the Mine, it would remain, as I have ſaid, at the bottom of the Pot you ſublime it in: and if the <hi>Cinnabar</hi> were adulterated, that which had been uſed in the adulteration, either would not riſe with the <hi>Mercury,</hi> or elſe would ſeparate from it in the Receiver.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cinnabar</hi> being nothing but a mixture of <hi>acid Spirits</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> together, if you mix it with ſome Alkali, and drive it upwards by fire, the Acids, for the reaſon I have already ſpoken of concerning the <hi>Depart</hi> of Silver, muſt leave the Bodies they were joyned to before, for to enter into the Alkali, and this is what happens here, for the Acids finding the Quick-lime very porous, do leave the <hi>Mercury,</hi> and adhere to the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime; ſo that this <hi>Mercury</hi> being diſengaged from what held it fixt before, and forced by the fire, comes forth of the Retort in form of Spirit, but the coolneſs of the Water that is in the Recipient, condenſes it, and reſolves it into <hi>Quick-ſilver.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A third part of the Retort is left empty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the rarified <hi>Mercury</hi> comes forth with ſuch violence as would otherwiſe be apt to break the Retort.</p>
                     <p>You muſt leave the mixture to ſettle a day or two, before you put the fire under it, to the end that the Quick-lime may ſlake the while, for if you ſhould not obſerve this circumſtance, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48366:98"/>
would burſt. You might alſo uſe ſuch a Quick-lime as has been already ſlak't in the air, and then you might begin your diſtillation imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the mixture, but I do think that the <hi>Revivification</hi> will be the more exact, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlak't Lime is uſed, becauſe the Alkali will act more ſtrongly upon the Sulphureous acids.</p>
                     <p>When the diſtillation begins, abundance of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous fume is ſeen to come out of the Retort; the juncture of the Receiver with the Retort muſt not be luted, becauſe it is better to let this <hi>Sulphur</hi> fly away; for if it had no vent, we might have reaſon to fear leſt ſome part of the <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> would joyn and unite with it in the Receiver, and ſo we might be obliged to make a ſecond <hi>Revivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>If by way of curioſity you weigh the Lime which remains in the Retort after diſtillation, you'l find three pounds and half an ounce of it, this little augmentation of weight proceeds from a remainder of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> and the matter does ſmell of <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> is one of the greateſt remedies we have in Phyſick, when it is uſed as it ſhould be, but is full as dangerous, when it happens into the hands of <hi>Quacks,</hi> who uſe it upon all occaſions for all ſorts of Diſeaſes, and give it indifferently to all ſorts of perſons without any reſpect to the Temperament they are of. Thoſe who draw it out of Mines, or work much with it, do often fall into the Palſie, by reaſon of <hi>Sulphurs</hi> that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſteam from it; for theſe <hi>Sulphurs</hi> conſiſting of groſs parts do enter through the Pores of the Body, and fixing themſelves rather in the Nerves
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48366:98"/>
by reaſon of their coldneſs, than in the other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, do ſtop the paſſage of the Spirits, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their courſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercury</hi> is given in the Diſeaſe called <hi>Miſerere,</hi> unto two or three pounds, and is voided again by ſiege to the ſame weight; it is better to take a great deal of it than a little, becauſe a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity might be apt to ſtop in the circumvolutions of the Guts, and if ſome Acid humours ſhould happen to joyn with it, a <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> would be there made; but when a large quantity of it is taken, there's no need of fearing this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, becauſe it paſſes quickly through by its own weight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercury</hi> mixes ſo well with roſinous and fat Bodies, as to remain imperceptible; all <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguents, Pomatums,</hi> and <hi>Plaiſters</hi> in which it enters, are good againſt the Itch, and Tetters, and do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve cold tumours, becauſe it opens the Pores, and drives by perſpiration. Furthermore, ſeeing theſe Diſtempers are fomented by Acid humours, it breaks their edge, and hinders them from cauſing any further Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto there is no Remedy found out to be ſo ſoveraign for the cure of Venereal Maladies, as <hi>Mercury;</hi> wherefore its greateſt enemies have been forced to fly to it, after they had tried a long time to no purpoſe to drive out the poiſon by other Remedies. And in truth if we knew any milder ones that were able to terminate the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of the Pox as well as this does, 'twould argue much raſhneſs to make uſe of <hi>Mercury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not always conducted according to our deſires, and ſometimes very ſcurvey conſequences
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48366:99"/>
do happen upon it; but we know no other that can be eſteemed to approach it in virtue for all Venereal Diſeaſes, and eſpecially the Univerſal Pox. It is killed in Turpentine, then with Suet an Ointment is made of it, that ſerves to rub the parts of the Body, and particularly the joints with, ſeveral days together, after the Patient hath been prepared by Baths, Broths, and Purges. The Friction is continued until the <hi>Salivation</hi> riſes, which is cauſed by a great many Shancres in the mouth; for theſe Shancres by an exceeding great acrimony do open exceedingly the ſalivating Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and give way to a tickling Phlegm, that runs down abundantly. A Flux is alſo raiſed by applying <hi>Mercurial Plaiſters</hi> upon all the Body, and alſo by <hi>Fumigations</hi> by making one receive the Fume of <hi>Mercury.</hi> Again it is raiſed by taking inwardly <hi>white Precipitate,</hi> or ſome other Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Preparation, without uſing it outwardly. Let us now come to reaſon a little upon it.</p>
                     <p>The effect of <hi>Mercury</hi> hath puzled almoſt all Chymical Philoſophers; and thoſe Moderns who have explicated with much probability and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood many other Natural things that lay hid to our Forefathers, have declared thoſe of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to be ſome of the moſt difficult. I know very well that ſeveral Perſons governed by falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, have not forborn to give us their Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; but when their diſcourſes come to be examined by Chymiſtry, which alone is able to give us Demonſtrations on this matter, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come to nothing. I ſhall here preſent you with a Thought of mine, that ſeems more probable than any thing I ever met with, and is maintained by Chymical Experiments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:48366:99"/>You muſt firſt take notice, and it is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable among all Phyſicians, that the Nodes, Tumors, and other effects of the Venereal Poiſon are fomented by Saline or Acid humours which make a certain Ferment, and that this diſeaſe can never be cured, until this Poiſon is quite deſtroyed. This being ſuppoſed, we muſt examine the nature of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and ſee what will become of it, if we mix it with Salts or Acids. I have ſaid that <hi>Mercury</hi> is a Volatile, and we ſhall find hereafter that in the making of <hi>Sublimate Corroſive, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is mixed with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which are Acids; that upon the encreaſing the fire, the Spirits ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering unto <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is an Alkali, do <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime</hi> along with it to the top of the Veſſel, and make together that which is called <hi>Sublimate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive;</hi> Let us now ſee in the cure of the Pox, how <hi>Mercury</hi> is uſed.</p>
                     <p>It is mixed, as I have ſaid, with Suet, and with this Unguent the parts of the Body are rubbed a long time, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> may pierce and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through the Pores; which it does, as every Body muſt grant; and this hapning, there's no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction at all in thinking that ſome part of it mixes with the Saline or Acid Ferment of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal matter, after the ſame manner, as it doth with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Acid Salts of the Venereal Poiſon fixing in the Pores of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is, as I have ſaid, a Volatile Alkali, do ſublime together, being driven by the heat of the body, up to the head, which is the top of the veſſel, and the cooleſt place, and ſo moſt proper to condenſe them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:48366:100"/>At the ſame time it is that the Head ſwells, and the inſide of the mouth is full of Shancres, which cauſe a pain much like unto that a man would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> were applied ſome time upon an excoriated part. Moreover the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livating Veſſels</hi> being prickt and corroded with this ſharp humour, do open, and let fall abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Phlegm, and this cauſes the involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Salivation, that uſes to accompany theſe Shancres, and remains ſometimes a longer, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a leſs time, according as the Shancres are more or leſs acrimonious; for the Phlegm trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down continually, cleanſes them from their keen Salts, and mitigates the pain, whence it comes to paſs that they are often cured of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then the <hi>Salivating Veſſels</hi> cloſing up again, the Flux doth ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>It ſometimes happens, when a man is not well prepared to receive a Flux, or that it is raiſed too ſoon; that the Sublimation being too violent, ſome part of the <hi>Sublimate</hi> ſticks to ſome one or more of the veſſels, and coroding their membrane, cauſes grievous Hemorrhagies, as I have ſeen to happen ſeveral times, and among others to a man in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedock,</hi> who voided in half an hours time twelve pints of blood by mouth, without dying of it not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, becauſe he was a very ſtout luſty man.</p>
                     <p>As for what may ſtill remain of the Venereal Poiſon, after the Salts are driven out, its diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is then a very eaſie buſineſs, becauſe nothing but thoſe Salts was able to hold it coagulated; ſo that it is eaſie to conceive, that the ſubtiler part of it may paſs through the Pores, and the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48366:100"/>

                     <p>Perhaps you'l object, that <hi>Mercury</hi> will raiſe a Flux in Perſons who never had ſuch a Diſeaſe as the Pox, and who never had any of thoſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that contain Acid Salts; but it is an eaſie matter to anſwer, that there is no man whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let him be never ſo ſound, but hath ſtore of Saline or Acid humours in his body; the <hi>Serum</hi> which runs into every part is full of Salt, and all the Ferments that preſerve the Oeconomy of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do it by nothing elſe but Salts or Acids; Now there is no more difficulty in comprehending that <hi>Mercury</hi> may joyn with the Acids of a ſound Perſon, than thoſe of an impure tumour: for I don't think that <hi>Mercury</hi> goes immediately and ſeeks out the Acids in the tumours of impure Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it muſt have an underſtanding to do that; but being rarified and moved by the heat of the body, it circulates every where, until it comes to find a Salt that is able to fix it in ſome meaſure, and hinder its motion.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes this <hi>Mercury</hi> not meeting with ſalts enough to detain it, paſſes off by tranſpiration, and carries along thoſe that were united to it; whence it comes to paſs that many have been cured of the Pox without a Flux.</p>
                     <p>At other times it meets with Alkali ſalts which force it to quit its hold of theſe Acids, and then it precipitates downwards, and purges by way of ſtool, whence it comes to paſs that thoſe who have a looſeneſs in the time of their taking <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> are exceeding hard to receive a Flux.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:48366:101"/>Upon the ſame Principle may be given the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of many other Accidents which follow the uſe of <hi>Mercury.</hi> But let us ſee whether any thing of uſe may be drawn from this Diſcourſe for the cure of Venereal Maladies.</p>
                     <p>Although the <hi>Poulains, Phymoſis, Shancres, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhoea's,</hi> and other <hi>Precurſors</hi> of the Pox, may be cured without a Flux, yet nevertheleſs you muſt not neglect the uſe of <hi>Mercury;</hi> for theſe Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do contain in them a Poiſon that is not at all different from that of the Pox, but only in that it hath not fermented enough to be rarified and carried by the Circulation into the Habit of the body; ſo that there will remain ſome Salts which cannot be carried away clear by any thing but <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> which when given in a ſmall quantity on theſe occaſions, drives only by perſpiration or by ſtool, without a Flux. <hi>Sweet ſublimate,</hi> of which I ſhall ſhortly ſpeak, is very much uſed in theſe Diſtempers, among other general Remedies.</p>
                     <p>When you undertake the cure of one in the Pox, you muſt bathe him a good while, purge, and bleed him for Preparation of the humours, to the end that <hi>Mercury</hi> finding them more fluid, may be able to unite with them the more eaſily, and ſo carry them off. This <hi>Mercury</hi> muſt be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by little and little at firſt, afterwards the Doſe is augmented according to the ſtrength of the Patient, and when the Jaws begin once to ake, you muſt give no more, unleſs it be now and then for continuation of the Flux. They ſpit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly three Weeks together, but if it doth not by that time ſtop of its own accord, you muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtop it with Deterſive Gargariſms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:48366:101"/>It happens ſometimes that the Salivating veſſels dilate and open ſo extreamly by the Corroſive Salts which cauſed the Salivation, that they cannot be cloſed again by any kind of Gargariſm, and then the Brain dries up by little and little, and Death is the conſequent of all; wherefore you muſt have a great care of not letting the Flux run too long.</p>
                     <p>I could attribute the invention of this diſcourſe to my ſelf, being the firſt who have thus treated of this matter in <hi>France,</hi> and maintained it in <hi>publick meetings;</hi> but I am not poſſeſſed with that vanity of <hi>Authors,</hi> I leave it to thoſe who love it: I had no affectation to make a <hi>Book on purpoſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, but have only mentioned it as a thing incident to the Subject I treated of. I ſhall only ſay by the by, that thoſe who make pretence of firſt finding it out, have hapned to make their complaints a little too late, having <hi>Printed</hi> their <hi>Book</hi> a year after mine, and three years after I held a <hi>Publick Diſcourſe</hi> of it at <hi>Monſieur de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay's,</hi> not to ſpeak of what I taught a long time before in the firſt <hi>Courſes of Chymiſtry</hi> that I ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>Some thinking to invalidate what I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon eſtabliſhed, do ſay that <hi>Mercury</hi> cannot be abſolutely called an <hi>alkali,</hi> becauſe the <hi>alkali</hi> that is in <hi>Mercury</hi> is but one part of its Compoſition, and is not to be ſeparated from its other parts.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>Anſwer</hi> this difficulty, you need but only read in the <hi>Remarks</hi> that I have made upon the <hi>Principles,</hi> how it is that I do explicate the nature of an <hi>alkali,</hi> and you'l find that although the name <hi>alkali</hi> comes from the <hi>Salt</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> called <hi>Kali,</hi> that is, <hi>ſoapwort,</hi> yet all bodies that cauſe a ſudden
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48366:102"/>
Efferveſcency with <hi>acids</hi> are called <hi>Alkali's,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any need of their containing any <hi>Alkali ſalt</hi> within them. So that I have no need to enlarge this <hi>Book</hi> without reaſon, by Anſwering all the little <hi>Objections</hi> that have been made to me upon the ſuppoſition of <hi>Mercury</hi>'s being a pure <hi>Alkali.</hi> It is likely enough that thoſe who have rais'd them, have not read with attention what I have ſaid in my <hi>Remarks</hi> upon <hi>Mercury.</hi> For there they might find Solutions enough. I ſhall ſpeak never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to ſome of the Principal ones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is Objected that if <hi>Mercury</hi> be an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi> and the Venereal venom an <hi>acid,</hi> this ſame <hi>acid</hi> ſhould certainly fix it, whereas the Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it that are made by the Juices, do only ſerve to encreaſe its <hi>Volatility,</hi> and render it <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive,</hi> inſtead of being at all ſweetned by it.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, it is as falſe to ſay, that <hi>Mercury</hi> is <hi>Volatilized</hi> by the Acid juices of the Venereal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, as it is that <hi>Mercury</hi> mixed with Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to render it <hi>Corroſive,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Volatilized</hi> by the ſame Spirits. On the contrary, <hi>Mercury</hi> alone does eaſily <hi>Volatilize</hi> by the heat of the body, and nothing but Acids are able to fix it at all. I thought I had ſufficiently explicated my ſelf as to this, when I ſaid that ſometimes <hi>Mercury,</hi> finding not in the body enough Acid Spirits to fix it, does paſs by <hi>Tranſpiration, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Corroſive</hi> nature that the <hi>Mercury</hi> aſſumes, we muſt attribute it to the Diſpoſition of its Pores, and the abundance of Acid points it is impregnated with; and ſeeing it will not ſweeten the Acidity of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> with which it is mixed to make <hi>Sublimate Corroſive,</hi> why ſhould
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48366:102"/>
we expect it to ſweeten the Acid juices of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? I do not pretend nevertheleſs that it never Dulcifies at all; for I do conceive it may deſtroy much of their force by dividing and breaking their points, when the Acids are but few, as does happen in <hi>Mercurius dulcis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is Objected that if the venom of the <hi>Pox</hi> were an Acid, it might then be Cured by the uſe of <hi>Alkali Salts,</hi> either fixt or Volatile, as by <hi>Crabs-Eyes, Pearl,</hi> or <hi>Coral,</hi> and ſuch like bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as are wont to kill and ſweeten Acid humours.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, we often find that <hi>Volatile ſalts</hi> do give ſome eaſe to thoſe that are troubled with the <hi>Venereal diſtemper,</hi> whether it be by opening the Pores, and ſo making the ſubtiler part of it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire away, or that by being <hi>Alkali's,</hi> they do abſorb ſome part of it. For this reaſon ſome do uſe to give their Patients the <hi>Volatile Salt of Vipers</hi> ſeveral mornings together, but theſe <hi>Alkali's</hi> are in truth of too weak a nature to carry off ſuch an <hi>Acidity,</hi> after they are impregnated with it, as <hi>Mercury</hi> is able to do without loſing its nature. They are <hi>Nets</hi> of too fine a make, to catch ſuch keen and active bodies; if theſe <hi>Salts</hi> do deſtroy ſome part of the <hi>Acidity,</hi> they deſtroy themſelves likewiſe in the conflict, ſo that they can have no further operation, wherefore there's need of a more powerful <hi>Volatile Alkali</hi> than theſe <hi>Salts</hi> are, to eradicate the <hi>Acidity</hi> of the <hi>Venereal poiſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Fixt Salts,</hi> and <hi>Alkali</hi> bodies, as <hi>Pearl, Coral, Crabs-eyes,</hi> whereas they have no <hi>Volatile</hi> quality in them, and their tendency is wholly downwards, it is very uncertain whether ever they reach to <hi>Venereal tumours</hi> (which commonly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48366:103"/>
riſe in the <hi>Joints,</hi>) by reaſon of the long way they have to paſs thither, and the <hi>Juices</hi> they have to encounter with in their paſſage, which may in all likelihood change their nature; but ſuppoſe they were carried to thoſe <hi>Tumors</hi> with the ſame quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications with which they were taken, they would only ſerve to weaken a little this <hi>Acidity,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to carry it off, and ſo they would only give a little eaſe, without removing <hi>Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> the <hi>Ferment</hi> of the Diſtemper, as <hi>Mercury</hi> is able to do.</p>
                     <p>It may be further asked why <hi>Sublimate</hi> does not fill the ſubſtance of the <hi>Brain</hi> with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> as well as it does the <hi>mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer that this <hi>Sublimate</hi> being in the <hi>Brain,</hi> finds it ſelf ſo clog'd with a Mucilaginous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, that it is fain to loſe there ſome part of its <hi>Acidity;</hi> ſo that it can do nothing elſe but cauſe a <hi>Fermentation,</hi> which makes the <hi>Phlegm</hi> purge away through the <hi>Salivating veſſels,</hi> and this it is that cauſes the <hi>Spittle</hi> of thoſe who have a <hi>Flux,</hi> to be ſo ſharp and ſtinking.</p>
                     <p>This ſharp <hi>Phlegm</hi> may alſo, as it paſſes in the <hi>mouth,</hi> encreaſe the number of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> for the <hi>mouth</hi> is as it were the <hi>ſink</hi> of the whole body upon this occaſion.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>There needs not half the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving a pound of <hi>Mercury,</hi> as there does for the ſame weight of <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> although the pores of this laſt be much the larger, and the parts more diſpoſed for ſeparation; the reaſon of which is, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> being <hi>Volatile,</hi> and very diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in its parts, it will divide almoſt of it ſelf, and is held up more eaſily by <hi>Acid Spirits,</hi> than another body can be whoſe parts are more united, and whoſe tendency is downwards, ſuch as <hi>Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> is.</p>
                     <p>When the diſſolution of <hi>mercury</hi> is a making, there appears a great ebullition in the Matraſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Red vapours; alſo the heat is ſo very ſtrong, that a man cannot endure his hand upon it: all this great ſtir proceeds from the Acids, which meet with reſiſtance in their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of this body; for joſtling one againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, they heat the liquor, and cauſe ſome part of the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> to evaporate away in red clouds, as it uſes always to do when it rarifies. When the <hi>mercury</hi> is all diſſolved, the diſſolution clears up and cools, becauſe the edges of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are all ſheathed in the <hi>mercury,</hi> whence their motion comes to be interrupted and ceaſe; and this is a thing ſo true, that if you ſhould by way of curioſity diſtil this diſſolution, you would draw off only a weak <hi>acid,</hi> for the greateſt part of the edges do remain involved with the <hi>mercury</hi> in a white maſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:48366:104"/>That which proves this <hi>Remark</hi> is this, that the white maſs which is drawn from the Solution of ſixteen ounces of <hi>Quicksilver</hi> in eighten ounces of <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> does weigh at leaſt two and twenty ounces, that is to ſay, ſix ounces more than the weight of the <hi>Quicksilver.</hi> Now this augmentation cannot proceed from any thing elſe but the <hi>acid Spirits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This maſs is exceeding <hi>Corroſive,</hi> by means of the ſame <hi>acid Spirits,</hi> which become very active whereever they are met with.</p>
                     <p>If inſtead of <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> we ſhould uſe <hi>Aqua, fortis</hi> to diſſolve the <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Solution would become clear like the other, but there would be this difference between them, that when we have eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated about a fourth part of the liquor in a glaſs-body in Sand, the remainder would be as red as <hi>Claret wine,</hi> and if we ſhould let the liquor cool, there would appear in it white Cryſtals in form of long needles, and the liquor would ſtill retain its red colour.</p>
                     <p>I conceive that the Solution acquires this colour from the Sulphurs which remain in the <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> for the Sulphureous parts being in great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may often turn and whirl about the inſenſible parts of <hi>Mercury</hi> round their center. Now it is eaſie to Remark by abundance of Experiments, that the red colour is a conſequence of the great attenuation, or diſpoſition to circulary motion, which the matter has received. But the Solution which is made with <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come red, becauſe there is no Sulphur in this Spirit, or elſe there is not enough to do it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:48366:105"/>You might perform this Operation by only mixing crude <hi>Mercury</hi> with Salt and Vitriol, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking the pains to diſſolve it with <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> but you would be an intolerable while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating them together, ſo as to make the <hi>Quicksilver</hi> imperceptible. Moreover there riſes up a duſt to the Noſe that is very unwholſom: that which we aim at therefore by diſſolving it, and reducing it into a white Maſs, is only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it for an eaſier mixture.</p>
                     <p>In the Sublimation I have deſcribed, the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> loads it ſelf with as many Acid Spirits as it is able to contain; theſe Spirits are a kind of load to it, and reſtrain its great Volatility, ſo that it doth not evaporate quite away, as it would do if there were nothing to withhold it, but it only <hi>Sublimes</hi> to the upper part of the Veſſel in fair white Cryſtals that are called <hi>Sublimate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive;</hi> the Maſs that remains at the bottom of the Matraſs is nothing but a mixture of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrious parts of Salt and Vitriol; it weighs eight and twenty ounces.</p>
                     <p>Some will needs blame this preparation of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate Corroſive,</hi> by ſaying, that when it is uſed to the making <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ought to be ſuſpected by reaſon of its acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and particularly its <hi>Saline</hi> Sulphureous parts.</p>
                     <p>But by performing this Operation, the way that I have deſcribed, there will be no need of retaining any ſcruple upon this account, becauſe the <hi>Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> can't be made, without an evaporation of many red vapours through the entrance of the Matraſs, for three hours time at the leaſt, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48366:105"/>
theſe vapours can be nothing elſe but the <hi>Spirits of Niter,</hi> for ſo ſmall a fire is not able to ſeparate and raiſe ſo high the Spirits of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vitriol.</hi> Thus there is no need of fearing theſe <hi>Saline</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Spirits, with which <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> is thought to be well ſtored, becauſe they being of a Volatile nature muſt neceſſarily come before the others. But ſuppoſing that <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> did ſtill remain in the <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> of which we make our <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould apprehend more hurt from their acrimony than from the other <hi>Corroſive</hi> Spirits, becauſe few men ſcruple to give this Spirit itſelf inwardly, in potions for the <hi>Colick</hi> and other diſeaſes, and they give divers Preparations made with this diſſolvent, ſuch as <hi>white Precipitate,</hi> and many <hi>Precipitates</hi> of Gold and Silver, without any viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble harm. But that which is moſt remarkable, is, that even thoſe who cry out upon this Preparation for being made with <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> do never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs themſelves recommend and uſe much a <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> which they make by <hi>Subliming</hi> white Precipitate, that is prepared with <hi>Spirit of Niter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Corroſion</hi> of <hi>Sublimate</hi> does proceed from the edged Acids which do fix in the body of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and it may be ſaid with great probability, that this metal always retaining a round figure, (let it be divided never ſo ſubtily) does rarifie by the heat of fire into an abundance of little balls which the <hi>acid</hi> Spirits do fix into on all ſides, and ſo interlace themſelves in it, that they hinder its riſing higher, and do together make one body that is called <hi>Sublimate.</hi> But when this <hi>Sublimate</hi> is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48366:106"/>
applied to fleſh, the heat and moiſture of it do ſet in motion the <hi>Mercurial</hi> parts, and the motion of the little balls being once raiſed, they rowl about with great fury, and tear the fleſh with the edges they contain, which are like ſo many little knives cutting whereever they touch; from whence it comes to paſs, that if the <hi>Sublimate</hi> ſhould be taken inwardly, it kills in a very little time; the humidity which does always accompany and ſoften our fleſh, gives it a greater hold than otherwiſe it would have, which is the reaſon why <hi>Sublimate</hi> does act with that celerity it does upon a ſoft moiſt part rather than a dry: nay it is often wetted with a little water, to make it work the more quickly.</p>
                     <p>By this Remark may be explicated, why the <hi>Lapis infernalis,</hi> which is a Silver filled with the edges of <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> has not ſo violent an effect as <hi>Sublimate Corroſive;</hi> becauſe the parts of Silver have no ſuch aptitude to rowl to and fro, and to riſe, as thoſe of <hi>Mercury</hi> have; for which reaſon it is likewiſe, that it does not make ſo great an Eſchar as the <hi>Sublimate,</hi> although it does contain at leaſt as much <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> as the other.</p>
                     <p>And thus a reaſon may be given, why even ſix grains of Cryſtals of Silver may be given by mouth without any danger, whenas not two grains of <hi>Sublimate</hi> can be given without a manifeſt danger, becauſe the Cryſtals of the Moon have not that circulary motion in their parts, as <hi>Sublimate</hi> has, all their tendency is only downwards, and all that they can do is to purge by their Acidity.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> is diſſolved in Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, the water preſently turns yellow, as is ſeen in the <hi>Phagedenick water,</hi> and it loſes ſo
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48366:106"/>
much of its Corroſive quality, that it may be given inwardly after that, without fear of poiſoning; and the reaſon of this is, that the greateſt part of the acid points ſtrike off from the <hi>Sublimate</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>alkali</hi> of Lime which is a more porous body; ſo that the <hi>Mercury</hi> loſing ſome of its moſt keen acids, becomes the leſs <hi>Corroſive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will not be amiſs to acquaint you here, that you'l often meet in the Shops of Druggiſts with a <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> made of <hi>Arſenick.</hi> Now to know the truth of it, you muſt only rub it with a little <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> and if it turns black, there is <hi>Arſenick</hi> infallibly in it; on the contrary if it turns yellow, it is good.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who have thought fit to Criticize upon what I have ſaid about the effects of <hi>Mercury,</hi> would methinks have ſpoken more to the purpoſe than they have done, if they had objected to me one difficulty that I have made my ſelf ſince the firſt Edition of my Book, and which has ſeemed to me to be the greateſt that can be made on this ſubject. It is this: If the <hi>Mercury</hi> that is given in order to raiſe a Flux, does joyn with the acid ſalt of our humors, and ſo does make a <hi>Sublimate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive,</hi> after the ſame manner as it does in the Matraſs, when it is mixt with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vitriol;</hi> this <hi>Sublimate</hi> of the body cannot be well made, ſo long as there is any watry humor in the part, wherein the <hi>Mercury</hi> is mixt with the acids; juſt as none of it can be made in a Matraſs, until all the Phlegm that's in it, is evaporated away. Now it is not to be conceived, that there ſhould ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſuch a Deſiccation of humours to the body, for it would be <hi>Corroded</hi> by the <hi>Mercury</hi> ſo
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48366:107"/>
loaded with acids, before it could <hi>Sublime.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To anſwer this Objection I ſay, That although I have made a compariſon between the <hi>Sublimation</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> that's made in the body, and that which is done in a Matraſs; nevertheleſs there is this difference between them, that the firſt is not only made with <hi>Salts</hi> extremely volatile, but is likewiſe aſſiſted or carried on by the motion of the humours with all their humidity up to the head, whereas this other is made with <hi>fixt ſalts,</hi> whoſe acidity is ſo ſtrongly rooted in the Earthy part, that it cannot be ſeparated from it, without a very conſiderable fire.</p>
                     <p>Nor muſt we think that the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the body is loaded with as many and as ſtrong acids, as that in the Matraſs; for if it were ſo, it would carry deſtruction, and cauſe a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it came; but it is enough, that its <hi>Pores</hi> are in part impregnated with them, ſufficient to diminiſh a little of its volatility, and cauſe thoſe prickings and pains which do happen during the <hi>Salivation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you diſſolve <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> in Water, then Filtrate, and ſeparate the filtred liquor into two Viols, and caſt into one of them ſome drops of the <hi>Oil of Tartar</hi> made <hi>per deliquium,</hi> you'l preſently have a <hi>Red Precipitate,</hi> that you may dry and uſe. Then if you drop into the other Viol the volatile Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> you'l have a fine <hi>white Precipitate,</hi> of the ſame virtues with that I ſhall deſcribe anon.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> is ſo great a <hi>Poiſon,</hi> I have thought it not amiſs to ſpeak here of the <hi>Counterpoiſons</hi> that may be given to ſuch perſons
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48366:107"/>
who by misfortune have taken it. But leſt ſome may imagine that <hi>one and the ſame Antidote</hi> can ſerve for all ſorts of <hi>Poiſons,</hi> as the <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> and <hi>Sellers of Orvietan</hi> do pretend, and indeavour to perſwade; I ſhall ſay ſomething of Poiſons, and their differences.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever is able to break and deſtroy the Oeconomy of the body, and the orderly connexion or derivation of humours, or elſe to hinder the natural courſe of the Spirits, is really a <hi>Poiſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be taken, or received two ways; the one outward, as when the Peſtilence and many other Malignant diſeaſes (which do proceed from an infected air) do ſeize upon a man; or when one is bit or ſtung by venemous beaſts. The other inward, as when a man takes <hi>Arſenick, Sublimate, Hemlock, Woolfsbane, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame Poiſon does not kill all ſorts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; as for example, the <hi>Nux Vomica</hi> is a Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to dogs, and yet does many other beaſts no hurt at all. The ſmoke of <hi>Tabaco</hi> does kill <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> in a very little time, although there is hardly a creature that has more life than the <hi>Viper,</hi> and that this ſmoke will only give a little purging to other creatures. The water in which <hi>Quickſilver</hi> has been infuſed will kill Worms, and yet does good to other animals. <hi>Arſenick</hi> ſoon kills a man, and many other creatures; and it will only purge a <hi>Wolf,</hi> and render him more lively than he was before.</p>
                     <p>All theſe different effects can only proceed from a diverſity of natures, and a difference of humors; for that which is able to tear and deſtroy one ſort, will cauſe only a light Fermentation in others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:48366:108"/>We muſt conſider two ſorts of effects in Poiſons; the one does coagulate the bloud by degrees, as that of the <hi>Viper,</hi> the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> Hemlock, Wolfs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whereas theſe do hinder the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits by this coagulation, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal falls into Convulſions, and dies ſoon after: much after the ſame manner as it happens when ſome acid liquor is ſyringed into a Vein, or Artery.</p>
                     <p>The others, ſuch as <hi>Sublimate,</hi> and <hi>Arſenick,</hi> do tear and excoriate the <hi>viſcera</hi> by their pungent Salts, until they come to gangrene, and then they dye.</p>
                     <p>The Medicines which are very properly given to obviate the accidents cauſed by the firſt poiſons I now mentioned, are volatile Salts, Treacle, Mithridate, Orvietan, and an infinite number of other remedies of this kind. <hi>Vipers</hi> fleſh, and the fleſh of <hi>Scorpions</hi> do cure the poiſon themſelves do give, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of the <hi>Viper.</hi> And hereupon the Reader will not take it amiſs, if I give him a ſhort ſtory that is very pertinent to this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>One day I put two living <hi>Scorpions</hi> into a glaſs-bottle, and then added a little Mouſe to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Which Mouſe runing over the <hi>Scorpions</hi> provoked them to bite her till ſhe cried out. Half a quarter of an hour after, I ſaw her dye of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. Some hours after this, I threw in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mouſe (a little bigger and more active than the firſt) to the ſame <hi>Scorpions.</hi> She leapt upon the <hi>Scorpions</hi> as the other had done before, and was bit by them in like manner, ſhe cried aloud, and was ſo provoked to revenge her ſelf, that ſhe eat up both the <hi>Scorpions,</hi> leaving only the head and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48366:108"/>
the tail. I would needs obſerve the end of this Tragedy; I left the Mouſe in the bottle, four and twenty hours, and during all that time ſhe had not the leaſt appearance of being hurt, and was only concerned at the being impriſoned. I intended to have diſſected her, in order to ſee whether there were no change in the parts, or in the blood: But a ſtander by hapning to take up the bottle too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly let it fall, and broke it, ſo the Mouſe eſcaped. Now the Volatile ſalts which were in the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions</hi> fleſh, might be ſaid by their active power to hinder the coagulation of the blood, which would ſoon have <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>een in the veins of the Mouſe, after ſhe was bit; but let every body explicate this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment according to his own principles, I ſhall reſume the thread of my diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>The remedies which ought to be given to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the effects of <hi>Arſenick, Sublimate,</hi> and other corroſive poiſons are of a contrary nature to thoſe I now mentioned; for inſtead of agitating the maſs of blood, and adding new heat to all the body, as thoſe do, theſe muſt calm and quiet the violent agitation of humors, and ſweeten the acrimony of its ſalts.</p>
                     <p>Therefore you muſt, ſo ſoon as you can, make the Patient take a porringer of old Oil of Olives, in order to make him vomit; freſh butter, fat, and all unctuous things will very properly be given, becauſe they do not only purge away the poiſon both upwards and downwards, but likewiſe (which is a thing very conſiderable) they conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of unctuous ſlimy parts do blunt and dull the edge of thoſe ſalts which remain of them in the body. You muſt afterwards make him drink warm
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48366:109"/>
milk, and continue the uſe of it ſeveral days, after which you muſt purge him.</p>
                     <p>The effect of <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> is much quicker than that of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> becauſe its acids being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet to work by the heat of the body, and by the volatility of <hi>Mercury,</hi> do tear and cut in pieces all that is in their way. Wherefore if remedies be not immediately given, after the poiſon is taken, the perſon is in a moſt deplorably dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p>What has been here ſaid does ſhew, that it is exceeding neceſſary for a man to underſtand the nature of the poiſons which are taken, before he preſume to give a Counter-poiſon, or Antidote, and that a box of <hi>Orvietan</hi> muſt not be eſteemed a ſure Antidote in all caſes.</p>
                     <p>And hence it is plain, that if the Quacks and Mountebanks, who ſhew upon ſtages, ſhould offer to take <hi>Sublimate,</hi> or <hi>Arſenick</hi> by mouth, in order to try the virtue of their remedies, as they pretend to do, all the <hi>Mithridate</hi> they have would never be able to ſave them. And ſuppoſing they did not underſtand their <hi>Legerdemain</hi> tricks well enough, but ſhould be conſtrained to ſwallow ſuch poiſons as theſe, you muſt not think them ſuch fools as to keep to the remedy they recommend, which would be ſure to do nothing elſe but increaſe their miſery by its acrimonious heat. They would have recourſe to the Oil, and other fat ſubſtances, to avoid death, which otherwiſe would certainly follow.</p>

Its uſe is for all ſorts of Venereal diſeaſes, it opens obſtructions, and kills the Worms, the Doſe is from ſix unto thirty grains in Pills; it purges gently by Stool.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve never to powder <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> in a mortar made of metal, becauſe it would corrode it, and carry off ſome part, which would ſpoil the operation; glaſs, marble and ſtone mortars are more convenient, becauſe they can communicate no ill impreſſion to the matter.</p>
                     <p>Many have written that we ſhould uſe equal parts of <hi>Sublimate</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> but they did not conſider that ſo great a quantity of <hi>Mercury</hi> could not be here uſed, and that when the <hi>Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> hath received near about the quantity I have appointed, the reſt will remain unmixed.</p>
                     <p>When a matraſs is uſed for this operation, half its neck muſt be cut off before-hand; for when it is performed in common matraſſes, a great part of the Fuliginous matter not being able to riſe high enough falls down again on the <hi>Sublimate,</hi> and hinders it from becoming ſweet, becauſe this Fuliginoſity contains the more acrimonious part, whereas it will eaſily fly out of Viols, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſſes with a ſhort neck. Two thirds of each veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel muſt remain empty, otherwiſe the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which rarefies like a Spirit, would be apt to break them. That which ſticks to the neck of the Viols being too acrimonious to be uſed inwardly may ſerve for Ointments againſt the Itch and Tettars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sweet Sublimate</hi> riſes more eaſily than the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive,</hi> becauſe it is leſs loaded with acids.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sublimate</hi> that is made in a matraſs, loſes half an ounce each <hi>ſublimation;</hi> ſo that an ounce
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48366:110"/>
and a half is loſt in three times, when the operation is done.</p>
                     <p>Six drachms of <hi>Scories</hi> and light earth are found at bottom, and conſequently there is but two drachms of matter carried off each <hi>Sublimation.</hi> But if you try this operation in Viols, the <hi>ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> loſes half an ounce more, as having a larger aperture to fly out at, than in a matraſs, or long neck.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems a little ſtrange at firſt that ſo ſtrong a Poyſon as <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> ſhould be reduced into ſo mild a remedy, by the addition of nothing but <hi>Mercury.</hi> But you ought to wonder no longer, when you conſider that thoſe Spirits which cauſed. the Corroſion were then ſhut up in a ſtrait room, but being now divided and enlarging their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, cannot in reaſon act with ſuch force; beſides that by the repeated action of fire the ſubtler part of their points is blunted againſt the body of <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Purgative quality of ſweet <hi>Sublimate</hi> does conſiſt in the acids that remain; wherefore if you ſhould ſublime it twice or thrice more, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate would not be at all Purgative, but only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifick. And it is then more proper to raiſe a Flux with than it was before; for having loſt thoſe ſalts which by irritating the ſtomach and guts did render it Purgative, it is the more diſpoſed for rarefaction in the body, and ſo to joyn with the ferment of Venereal Tumors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercury</hi> prepared any way whatſoever ought to be taken inwardly no other way than in Pills, but by no means in potion, for fear it ſhould ſtick in the Gums, and ſo ſpoil and looſen the Teeth.</p>

                     <p>Although I do recommend eighteen or twenty ounces of <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> for the ſolution of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ounces of <hi>Mercury,</hi> yet you muſt know that it is not very neceſſary to keep too ſtrictly to this ſame quantity. You may uſe either a little more, or a little leſs, according to the ſtrength of the Spirit, or according as it is more or leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmated. I my ſelf do commonly uſe but an
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48366:111"/>
equal weight of it with the Quick-ſilver, becauſe the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> I do uſe is exactly dephlegmated. You might likewiſe uſe <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> inſtead of <hi>Spirit of Niter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Doſe of <hi>white Precipitate</hi> muſt be leſs than that of ſweet Sublimate, becauſe it retains more acid Spirits; but if you would Sublime this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate</hi> alone in a matraſs, in a gradual fire, you'd obtain a Sublimate as ſweet as the other; becauſe the fire having acted upon it, breaks moſt of its points, and then it may be given in as great a Doſe as ordinary <hi>Mercurius Dulcis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you deſire to make this <hi>Precipitate</hi> exceeding white, you muſt diſſolve the <hi>Mercury</hi> in a veſſel whoſe mouth is very large, that ſo the red vapour of the Spirit of <hi>Niter</hi> may ſly out the more eaſily. When the diſſolution is made without the help of fire, the <hi>Precipitate</hi> is the whiter.</p>
                     <p>The Precipitation of <hi>Mercury</hi> may be made with the Spirit of Salt, as well as the ſalt in ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>This is not ſo eaſily made, as that of <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> becauſe the pores of <hi>Mercury</hi> being ſmaller than thoſe of <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> do retain with more force the acids which are fixt into it. Moreover Quick-ſilver being of a volatile nature does remain ſuſpended in the liquor more eaſily than <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> which is a body altogether fixt.</p>
                     <p>It may well ſeem ſtrange that an acid ſalt, ſuch as ſea-ſalt, ſhould be able to precipitate that which the acidity of Spirit of <hi>Niter</hi> had diſſolved. To reſolve this difficulty, you muſt know that, though our Senſes tell us that acids do all perform the ſame effect, which is to prick and to pierce, yet nevertheleſs they all do differ in the figure of their
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48366:112"/>
points; for according as they have received more or leſs fermentation, they have alſo conſequently their points more ſubtile, ſharp, and light; and this is atteſted not only by taſte, but the ſight alſo; for if you ſhould Cryſtallize the ſame body, by diſſolving ſeveral parts of it in ſeveral veſſels by Spirit of Salt, Spirit of <hi>Niter,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Alom,</hi> and by Vinegar, you'l obſerve ſo many kinds of Cryſtals different in figure, as there were different diſſolutions. The Cryſtals made by Vinegar will be more ſharp than thoſe prepared by Spirit of <hi>Niter;</hi> thoſe made by Spirit of <hi>Niter</hi> will be ſharper than thoſe by the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> thoſe made by Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> will be ſharper than thoſe by the Spirit of <hi>Alom;</hi> but of all theſe Cryſtals none will be found to have groſſer parts than thoſe prepared by the Spirit of <hi>Salt;</hi> for theſe Cryſtals do all retain the figure of their conſtituent parts. This now being ſuppoſed, it will be an eaſie matter to explicate our Precipitation, for the ſalt or its ſpirit containing points more groſs or leſs delicate than thoſe of Spirit of <hi>Niter,</hi> and falling on this diſſolution, do move, joſtle, and eaſily break the points impregnated with the body of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and ſo do make them let go their hold, whence it comes that <hi>Mercury</hi> precipitates by its own weight.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Principle may ſerve to explicate, why <hi>Lead</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Vinegar</hi> precipitates by means of the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or Salt.</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve not to make the water too ſalt, for then the great quantity of ſalt would hinder the <hi>Mercury</hi> from precipitating.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:48366:112"/>The Volatile Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an alkali ſalt, does much help the <hi>Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for its agility carries it into every receſs of the liquor, where the ſea-ſalt, whoſe parts are not of ſo active a nature, was not able to go: which is proved from hence, that if you uſe only ſea-ſalt diſſolved in water to make this <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation</hi> with, it will then happen that if after pouring off the clear liquor, which ſwims upon the <hi>Precipitate,</hi> into another veſſel, you drop the Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> into the liquor, there falls a conſiderable quantity of <hi>Mercurial Precipitate,</hi> which may ſerve like the other. If inſtead of the volatile Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> you'd uſe the <hi>Oil of Tartar</hi> made <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> the <hi>Pricipitate</hi> would then be reddiſh.</p>
                     <p>Two objections have been made againſt my manner of explicating the <hi>Precipitation,</hi> of ſuch matters as Spirit of Niter had diſſolved, made by Sea-Salt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt they ſay, it is not proper to make the joſtles and encounter of ſalt-water with Spirit of Niter loaded with bodies which it had diſſolved, to be the cauſe of its precipitation; whenas the moſt violent jogs that can be given to the ſolution, either from an arm, or with matters much more heavy and ſolid than ſea-ſalt, are not able to cauſe the precipitation.</p>
                     <p>This Objection will raiſe no difficulty to any that are a little skill'd in Natural Philoſophy: for although I have ſaid, that by reaſon the edges of ſea-ſalt are groſſer than thoſe of Spirit of Niter, the ſea-ſalt does precipitate what Spirit of Niter had diſſolved and ſuſpended; I never meant that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48366:113"/>
if theſe edges were as big as a mans arm, they would do it the better. It is ſufficiently known that there muſt be a proportionable ſubtilty of parts between the diſſolvent and that which does precipitate, and that the edges of an acid muſt be otherwiſe treated than with a cuff of the fiſt, in order to make them let go their hold. But I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make it appear that if ſea-ſalt does jog and ſhake the edges of Spirit of Niter, it does it by dividing into very minute parts, and thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the pores of the phlegm, which in would not be able to do if theſe parts were as big as a mans arm, or were like the ſolid heavy matters now ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the groſsneſs of the edges of ſea-ſalt, or the ſhock they give, did make the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation of ſubſtances diſſolved by Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we ſhould expect afterwards to find the firſt, with its groſs edges ſeparated from thoſe of Spirit of Niter; whereas upon evaporating and cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing the liquor, their edges are indeed recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally confounded the one with the other, making together a new body.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that the ſhock and joſtle which the edges of ſea-ſalt do give to Spirit of Niter, when loaded with ſome bodies, does not hinder the edges of Spirit of Niter remaining after the precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from uniting with the ſea-ſalt, by which union the Cryſtals do become confuſed.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here add one preparation more, that is very proper to raiſe a Salivation with.</p>
                     <p>Take an ounce of the ſolution of <hi>Mercury</hi> made in Spirit of Niter, put it into a glaſs-veſſel, and pour upon it three or four and twenty ounces of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48366:113"/>
water, all the liquor will turn white, let it ſettle until it becomes clear, filtrate the liquor, and keep it for uſe.</p>
                     <p>This water may be given from half an ounce to an ounce, in a glaſs of <hi>Ptiſan,</hi> or broth. It vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits gently, and provokes a Salivation; ſome do drink half an ounce of it to cure the itch, but they ought to be purged and bled before-hand.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>This Preparation is improperly called <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> here being no Precipitation at all.</p>
                     <p>Many Authors have thought they could much encreaſe the redneſs of this <hi>Precipitate,</hi> by <hi>Coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating</hi> it, or diſtilling Spirit of <hi>Niter</hi> three times upon the white maſs; but I have found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience both ways, that theſe Circumſtances are of no uſe.</p>
                     <p>The white Maſs which remains after Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humidity is a mixture of <hi>Mercury</hi> with a great many acid Spirits, for it weighs three ounces more than the <hi>Mercury</hi> did which was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; it is extreme Corroſive, and fiery, if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the fleſh, but according as it is Calcined in order to make it <hi>red,</hi> the edges of the Spirit of <hi>Niter</hi> which cauſed the Corroſion do ſtrike off, and fly into the Air; whence it comes to paſs, that the more we deſire to encreaſe its <hi>redneſs</hi> by Calcination, the leſs it weighs, and the leſs it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes. Some Chirurgeons obſerving this effect do chooſe the Precipitate that is not ſo <hi>red</hi> as uſual, when they would make an Eſchar quickly.</p>
                     <p>If you ſtill continue the fire ſome hours under the red maſs, it will ſublime, and ſtill retain its colour; this ſublimate is not ſo Corroſive as the other; which makes me think that the points of Spirit of Salt are neceſſary to make a ſublimate very Corroſive. The reaſon why it ſublimes, is becauſe the <hi>Mercury</hi> being delivered from a great many acid Spirits, which did fix it, has power to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48366:114"/>
riſe with thoſe that remain. But becauſe theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Spirits do moderate a little its volatility, it makes a ſtop in the middle of the Viol.</p>
                     <p>Some do put red <hi>Precipitate</hi> into an Earthen Pot, and pour upon it Spirit of Wine well rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then fire it, and when the Spirit is conſumed, they add more, and burn it as before; they repeat the adding Spirit of Wine, and burning it ſix times, and then call this Preparation <hi>Arcanum Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallinum.</hi> The Spirit of Wine by burning does carry off ſome edges of the <hi>Precipitate,</hi> and joyns it ſelf to the reſt, ſo that this <hi>Precipitate</hi> is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rendred fit to be taken inwardly.</p>
                     <p>If by way of curioſity you pour Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> upon common red <hi>Precipitate,</hi> ſuch as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, a diſſolution will ſoon follow, becauſe Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> joyning with the Spirit of <hi>Niter</hi> that remained in the <hi>Precipitate,</hi> an <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> muſt happen from their union, which is able to diſſolve imperceptibly the parts of <hi>Mercury;</hi> but this diſſolution will happen without any <hi>Ebullition,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Mercury</hi> has been already rarified by an acid, ſo that the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> does only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them without making any commotion. The ſolution is clear like other ſolutions of <hi>Mercury,</hi> without any appearance of redneſs, and the ſame Preparations may be made with it, as are uſed to be by the ſolution of <hi>Quicksilver</hi> in <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If inſtead of Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> you pour Spirit of <hi>Salt</hi> upon the red <hi>Precipitate,</hi> it turns preſently into a curious white, becauſe the Spirit of <hi>Salt</hi> does break the force of the Spirit of <hi>Niter</hi> that was in the red <hi>Precipitate;</hi> and the ſame thing muſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen here as does when Spirit of <hi>Salt</hi> is poured upon
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48366:115"/>
the ſolution of <hi>Quicksilver;</hi> for although red <hi>Precipitate</hi> be a dry body, yet it is nothing elſe but a mixture of <hi>Quicksilver,</hi> and Spirit of <hi>Niter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have given the reaſon why Spirit of <hi>Salt</hi> comes to weaken Spirit of <hi>Niter,</hi> in my Remarks upon white <hi>Precipitate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the ſudden change of colour, it is indeed ſomewhat ſtrange, that a matter which is grown red by <hi>Calcination,</hi> ſhould in a minutes time turn ſo exceeding white.</p>
                     <p>This Effect can be attributed only to the diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which the acid ſpirit of <hi>Salt</hi> does cauſe in the parts of red <hi>Precipitate,</hi> and to the diſpoſition it puts them anew into, ſo that their <hi>Superficies</hi> is put into a capacity of reflecting the light in a right line to our eyes, to give the appearance of a white colour; for if by means of another ſort of liquor, or elſe by fire and ſome alkali body, the diſpoſition of the parts of your <hi>Precipitate</hi> is again changed, it will obtain ſome other colour, or elſe it will return and revive into <hi>Quicksilver.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you pour the volatile ſpirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> upon red <hi>Precipitate,</hi> it turns into a grey powder, but if you throw a great deal of water upon it, it becomes a milk, though none of the whiteſt. The ſame thing happens, when you drop Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> into the ſolution of <hi>Quicksilver</hi> made with Spirit of <hi>Niter;</hi> for ſoon after the efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcency is over, a grey powder is ſeen to <hi>Precipitate,</hi> and if you add to it water, it becomes a milk of the ſame whiteneſs as the other.</p>
                     <p>Common red <hi>Precipitate</hi> then is ſubject to the ſame alterations as the ſolution of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the red colour giving no particular impreſſion to it;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48366:115"/>
which truly is a good proof that colour is no real thing, but wholly depends upon the modification of parts.</p>

                        <hi>Sublimate</hi> being a <hi>Mercury</hi> loaded with acids, common water is able to diſſolve ſome of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe acids do rarefie it, and make a kind of ſalt of it; but becauſe there are not acids enough in it to diſſolve all the <hi>Mercury,</hi> the moſt compact part of it remains at bottom, the liquor is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated to clear and purifie it the more, it is as clear and tranſparent as Fountain water.</p>
                     <p>If by way of Curioſity, you ſhould drop into the Viol of red <hi>precipitate,</hi> that I now deſcribed, ſome ſpirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> and would ſhake the liquor a little, it would preſently turn white, and your <hi>precipitate</hi> would be white; but if inſtead of ſpirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> you would uſe ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> an <hi>Ebullition</hi> would riſe in it, and the red liquor would become clear and tranſparent as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe the Oil of <hi>Tartar</hi> is an alkali ſalt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, it breaks the edges of the acid which held up the <hi>Mercury</hi> imperceptible, and ſerv'd as Finns to make it <hi>ſwim</hi> in the water, ſo that this <hi>Mercury</hi> having nothing left to bear it up, muſt needs <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate</hi> by its own weight. The ſame thing happens when ſpirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> is thrown upon the other part of the ſolution of <hi>ſublimate Corroſive.</hi> For this ſpirit being in like manner an alkali, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſame effect as the Oil of <hi>Tartar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But although alkali's do all agree in this, that they break and deſtroy acids, nevertheleſs there is always ſome difference in their action.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:48366:118"/>And this evidently appears in thoſe differently coloured <hi>precipitates,</hi> for this diverſity can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed only to this, that they having in ſeveral manners wrought upon acids, do diſpoſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie the parts of the precipitated body, ſo as they may be capable of making different Refractions of Light.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>precipitates</hi> are no longer poiſons, though they come from <hi>ſublimate Corroſive,</hi> and there's the ſame reaſon for it, as there is for the <hi>precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> for ſeeing that which gave the <hi>Corroſion</hi> was an acid, when this acid is deſtroyed by ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alkali's as are ſpirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> and Oil of <hi>Tartar,</hi> that which remains muſt become ſweet.</p>
                     <p>When ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is thrown upon the liquor of red <hi>precipitate,</hi> there riſes an Ebullition, becauſe the acid does penetrate the alkali ſalt of the Oil of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and this alkali being deſtroyed, the acid diſſolves what was <hi>precipitated</hi> before, whence it comes that the liquor clears up, and turns into poiſon as it was before.</p>
                     <p>If you would again pour Oil of <hi>Tartar,</hi> then ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> upon it, there would happen new red and white <hi>precipitates,</hi> which might again be diſſolved, and the liquor made clear again, by adding to it more ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> but only a greater quantity of this Spirit muſt be uſed than was before.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of Antimony.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANtimony</hi> is a Mineral conſiſting of a Sulphur like unto common Sulphur, and of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance near approaching to Metallick: it is called <hi>Stibium</hi> in Latin. It is found in many places in <hi>Tranſylvania, Hungaria, France, Germany.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you may meet with ſome of the mineral <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> at the Druggiſts, that is to ſay, juſt as it is taken out of the Mines, but that which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought among us hath been melted, and mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into cakes of a Pyramidal form.</p>
               <p>You muſt chuſe that which is in long ſhining needles, and not expect to find it of a reddiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as many Authors do adviſe; for in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight of this Mineral, you'l hardly find one piece of this kind. The occaſion of this error came from the Alchymiſts, who thought that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> did contain a Sulphur like unto that of Gold, and that the reddiſh ſort had more of it than the black; but this pretended Sulphur is as imaginary as that of gold. This reddiſh colour does doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs proceed either from the heat of the Sun coming to it, or from a participation of the ſubterranean heat, beſtowed more on ſuch pieces, than the reſt; for when the Sulphur of <hi>Antimony</hi> is rarefied, it aſſumes a red colour, as may be ſeen in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, called <hi>Golden ſulphur of Antimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:48366:119"/>
                  <hi>Antimony</hi> will not diſſolve, but with <hi>Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galis,</hi> which has made a great many Alchymiſts think, that this Mineral was an imperfect Gold.</p>
               <p>Although nothing but a metallick ſubſtance mixt with Sulphur can be perceived in the analyzing of <hi>Antimony;</hi> nevertheleſs conſidering its Figure, ſomewhat like that of ſalt-peter, and its <hi>Emetick</hi> quality, which can proceed from nothing but a punction made in the ſtomach, there is reaſon to think that it contains an acid ſalt; but becauſe the edges of this ſalt are ſheathed in a great deal of Sulphur, it cannot exert its activity, without opening a way for it, either by ſalts which divide the Sulphur, or by Calcination which carries off its groſſer part. Notwithſtanding it is not to be underſtood that the <hi>Emetick</hi> faculty of <hi>Antimony</hi> does conſiſt in this ſalt alone; for if it were alone, it would no more produce this effect than other acid ſalts do, but it is aſſiſted by the Sulphur, which ſerves for a Vehicle to exalt it towards the upper Orifice of the ſtomach. Thus <hi>Antimony</hi> may be ſaid to vomit, by reaſon of the Saline ſulphur it contains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crude Antimony</hi> is uſed in Sudorifick decoctions, when we would diſſipate a tumor by Tranſpiration; but great care muſt be had that no acid may enter into the Decoction, for then it would open its body, and render it <hi>Emetick.</hi> It is dangerous alſo to take it in ſubſtance, becauſe it may be apt to meet with an acid in the ſtomach that would open its body, and thereby cauſe a great vomiting to follow.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that <hi>Crude Antimony</hi> cauſes ſweat, is becauſe of ſome Sulphureous Particles that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48366:120"/>
from the <hi>Antimony,</hi> which not being ſtrong enough to make one vomit, do therefore work by tranſpiration.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Common Regulus of Antimony.</head>
                  <p>This preparation is an <hi>Antimony</hi> rendred more heavy, and more metallick by the ſeparation that is made of its groſſer Sulphurs.</p>
                  <p>Take ſixteen ounces of <hi>Antimony,</hi> twelve ounces of crude Tartar, and ſix ounces of Salt-peter pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; powder them and mix them well together, then heat a large Crucible red-hot, throw into it a ſpoonful of your mixture, and cover it with a Tile until the detonation is over, continue to throw into the Crucible ſpoonfuls of this mixture one after another, until all of it is ſpent; then light a great fire about it, and when the matter hath been ſome time in <hi>Fuſion,</hi> pour it into a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or an Iron mould greaſed with ſuet and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then ſtrike the ſides of the ſaid mould or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar with tongs to make the <hi>Regulus</hi> precipitate to the bottom; when it is cold, ſeparate it from the droſs that remains on the top of it with a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and after you have powdered it, melt it in another Crucible, then throw into it a little Salt-peter, there will riſe ſome little flame from it, then pour out the matter into the iron mortar well cleanſed and greaſed, let it cool, and you have four ounces and a half of <hi>Regulus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you melt it over again, and form it into balls of the bigneſs of a Pill, you have a <hi>perpetual Pill,</hi> that is to ſay, ſuch as being taken and voided fifty
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48366:120"/>
times will purge every time, and yet there's hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any ſenſible diminution.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Regulus</hi> is melted in a Crucible, and then caſt into moulds to make Cups and Gobelets. But it is ſomewhat hard to do it, by reaſon of a ſharpneſs in the <hi>Regulus</hi> that hinders its parts from uniting ſo as to ſpread well. If you put White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine into theſe Cups or Gobelets, it becomes Vomitive, like the <hi>Vinum Emeticum</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of anon.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The name <hi>Regulus</hi> ſignifies Royal, and is given to the moſt fixt and hardeſt matters of many minerals and metals.</p>
                     <p>This Preparation is made in order to open the <hi>Antimony,</hi> and purifie it from a great deal of groſs Sulphur that it is impregnated with, and to this end it is Calcined with Tartar and Salt-peter, which do eaſily flame, and carry off with them good ſtore of this Sulphur, the reſt remains in the <hi>Faeces,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew in the following Operation.</p>
                     <p>The mixture is caſt into the Crucible by little and little, for fear leaſt if it ſhould be put in all at a time, the detonation growing too violent, and the matter rarefying too much, it might riſe over the Crucible.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not greaſe the Iron Mortar with Oil, by reaſon of a little humidity that it contains, which would make the matter riſe and tumble out. It is greaſed, to the end that the matter not ſticking to the mortar may ſeparate from it the more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:48366:121"/>The <hi>Regulus</hi> is melted again, and Salt-peter thrown into it, to the end, that ſome little ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſulphur, which remained of the droſs, may fly away, and the <hi>Regulus</hi> may remain the purer.</p>
                     <p>Fifteen ounces of droſs will be found to four ounces and a half of <hi>Regulus,</hi> and there was uſed four and thirty ounces of mixture in this operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that there loſes fourteen ounces and a half during the time it is on the fire.</p>
                     <p>Although good ſtore of the <hi>Antimonial</hi> Sulphurs do exhale, the <hi>Regulus</hi> is notwithſtanding ſtill loaded with them, and it is they which chiefly give it its Vomitive virtue; for the Vomiting doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a very quick motion that theſe Sulphurs do give to the ſtomach, by pricking its Fibres with ſome ſalts that they carry along with them.</p>
                     <p>If you mix this Emetick with an Infuſion of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or ſome ſuch purgative, it works as much by ſtool as by vomit, becauſe theſe Remedies do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate with them ſome part of the Sulphurs.</p>
                     <p>When a man ſwallows the <hi>Perpetual Pill,</hi> it paſſes by its own weight, and purges downwards: it is waſht and given again as before, and ſo on perpetually.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt all Chymiſts have written that this Pill loſes nothing at all of its weight, though taken ſeveral times. 'Tis true indeed the diminution is but very ſmall, yet nevertheleſs it would not be hard to remark it in ſome meaſure. It may be ſaid alſo that in place of the Sulphureous parts which do exhale to cauſe the vomiting, ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous bodies do ſucceed in their place, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when <hi>Antimony</hi> is Calcined in the Sun.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:48366:121"/>When this Pill hath been taken and voided twenty or thirty times, it purges not ſo much as it did at firſt, as well becauſe the more ſoluble parts of the Sulphur are gone, as that what remains doth paſs without any great effect. The ſame doth happen to Cups or Gobelets, which can't make the wine ſo Emetick as before, after they have been filled twenty or thirty times.</p>
                     <p>Some do preſcribe the <hi>Perpetual Pill,</hi> in the diſeaſe called <hi>Miſerere,</hi> but this practice is not without danger, becauſe the ball ſtopping ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the Inteſtines, which are knotted or twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in this diſeaſe, may cauſe an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſo exulcerate the part. It is given in the Colick, and then it does well.</p>
                     <p>Wine draws out the Emetick virtue of the <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> much better than water or ſpirit of Wine, or vinegar can do; the reaſon of which is, that this virtue does conſiſt in a ſaline ſulphur which water could not penetrate; ſpirit of Wine indeed does diſſolve ſome of the more ſulphureous part of it, but does not take enough of the ſalt; the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar by its acidity does fix too much what it has diſſolved; but Wine contains a ſulphureous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and a ſaline Tartar, which do make a moſt convenient <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to diſſolve and to preſerve the ſaline and ſulphureous part of the prepared <hi>Antimony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon conſidering the different ways of evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cauſed by <hi>Antimony,</hi> and many other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins, I do find it very probable, that Emeticks do work as they do, becauſe their operation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quick is exerted in the ſtomach, before the medicin had time to deſcend more downwards,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48366:122"/>
and then this <hi>viſcus</hi> is very ſenſible when irritated, and undergoes commotions ſufficiently violent to make riſe what is within it. But if the medicin proves ſlow in its operation, and deſcends into the gutts before it raiſes a purgative fermentation, it then forces downwards, whence it comes to paſs that thoſe who do not vomit upon taking emeticks, are commonly purged by ſtool.</p>
                     <p>Thus Vomits and Purges do differ only in this, that the firſt do work in the ſtomach, the others in the gutts.</p>
                     <p>Oil, and lukewarm water do vomit, by relaxing the fibres of the ſtomach, and changing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirits which do then act only by ſhaking, or turning the ſtomach to a diſcharge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>If by way of curioſity you would Calcine four ounces of the <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> powdered, in an earthen cup unglazed, ſet in a ſmall fire, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it all the while with a <hi>Spatule,</hi> there will riſe up a vapour for an hour and a halfs time, or there-abouts, and when the matter fumes no longer, it turns into a grey powder, that weighs two drachms and a half more than the <hi>Regulus</hi> did at firſt.</p>
                     <p>This augmentation of quantity is the ſtranger, for that the fume which aſcended from it during the Calcination, ſhould ſeem rather to have dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed its weight. It muſt be therefore granted, that a great many fiery particles have entred into it, in the room of that which fum'd away.</p>
                     <p>This Fume proceeds from ſome groſſer Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, that remained in the <hi>Regulus,</hi> and indeed it ſmells ſtrong of the ſulphur.</p>

                  <p>This preparation is the ſulphureous part of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> diſſolved by Alkali ſalts, and precipitated by an acid.</p>
                  <p>Take the droſs of the <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> powder and boil them with common water in an earthen pot half an hour; ſtrain the liquor, and pour vinegar into the expreſſion, there will preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate a red powder; filtrate and ſeparate your precipitate, dry it and keep it, you will obtain twelve ounces, and two drachms of it, it is called the Golden Sulphur of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and is an <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:</hi> the doſe is from two grains unto ſix in broth or in Pills.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>You muſt put about ſixteen pints of water to boil with the fifteen ounces of the droſs of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> of Antimony, though the liquor does coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late like a Jelly when it is cold, by reaſon of the ſalts and ſulphurs joyning together; for the droſs of the <hi>Regulus</hi> is nothing but a mixture of the fixt parts of Salt-peter, and Tartar, that have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them ſome of the more impure Sulphur of Antimony.</p>
                     <p>Now ſeeing that theſe ſalts do become Alkali by means of Calcination, the acid which is poured upon them, does break or deſtroy their ſtrength, and makes them quit the ſulphur which they held
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48366:123"/>
diſſolved, from whence the precipitation of the <hi>Golden Sulphur of Antimony</hi> does proceed.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as vinegar is poured on the diſſolution of the droſs, volatile ſulphurs do ariſe which are very diſagreeable to the ſmell; the precipitate which is afterwards made, is like to a <hi>Coagulum</hi> or curd, in great quantity.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Sulphur</hi> does operate much like to the <hi>Crocus metallorum,</hi> of which I ſhall ſoon ſpeak. The Chymiſts have called it <hi>Golden ſulphur,</hi> by reaſon of its colour, which is near like unto that of Gold; but it is probable that the Antients did underſtand by the <hi>Golden Sulphur of Antimony,</hi> ſome other ſulphur than this, becauſe almoſt all of them have writ, that there was a groſs ſuperficial ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur in Antimony, like unto common ſulphur, which is this of which our preſent preparation is made, and another more fixt, and like unto that of Gold, which they held to be Sudorifick.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not imagine that our Golden Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sulphur is altogether Pure, it is ſtill loaded with a great deal of earth and ſalt, which it has ſtill retained in the precipitation, and it is this ſalt which by rarefying its parts does give it this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>

                  <p>This preparation is a mixture of the more fixed parts of Antimony, and ſome portion of Iron.</p>
                  <p>Put eight ounces of ſmall Nails into a great Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, cover it, and ſet it on a grate in a Furnace; ſurround it above and below with a good fire, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48366:123"/>
when the Nails are red hot, throw into them a pound of Antimony in powder; cover again the Crucible, and continue a great fire; when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony ſhall be in perfect Fuſion, caſt into it by little and little three ounces of Salt-peter, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonation will happen, and the nails will melt; and when there do riſe no more ſparkles, pour out your matter into a Cornet or Iron mortar, that you ſhall have greas'd with a little Suet, and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before-hand: then ſtrike the ſides of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar with pincers, to make the <hi>Regulus</hi> fall to the bottom; when it is cold, ſeparate it from the droſs with a hammer: melt it in another Crucible, and caſt into it two ounces of Antimony in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; when it is melted, add to it by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle three ounces of Salt-peter, which being burnt, and the matter caſting forth no more ſparkles, pour it into the Iron Cornet greaſed and heated as before, then ſtrike it with pincers, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi> may fall down, and when it is cool, ſeparate it from the droſs as I have ſaid; repeat melting the <hi>Regulus</hi> twice more, and each time caſt Salt-peter into it, but the laſt eſpecially; you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to melt it well, before you caſt the Salt-peter into it, that the <hi>Star</hi> may appear. There is no need of adding any more crude Antimony to the two laſt Fuſions This <hi>Regulus</hi> is uſed as the other, and hath the ſame effects.</p>

                     <p>The Iron in the firſt Fuſion mixing with the Antimony turns almoſt all of it into droſs, becauſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48366:124"/>
it joyns with the more impure Sulphur, ſo that the Reguline part being more weighty falls down to the bottom. Salt-peter is uſed in order to open the Antimony, and cauſe a more perfect Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that a ſeparation of the groſſer parts may be made the better. Moreover it carries off ſome Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs by its volatile parts. The droſs then does conſiſt of Iron, Sulphur, and ſixt Salt-peter.</p>
                     <p>The Fuſion is repeated three times over, becauſe ſome portion of Iron doth always precipitate with the <hi>Regulus;</hi> and a little crude Antimony is added to the firſt of all, to the end the <hi>Mars,</hi> which eaſily joyns with Antimony by reaſon of a groſs Sulphur it contains, may leave the <hi>Regulus</hi> and ſtick to it. The two laſt Fuſions do make a gray or white droſs, and this is a mark, that the Salt-peter can receive no more.</p>
                     <p>After the firſt Purification, ten ounces of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and thirteen ounces of <hi>Scories</hi> do remain; after the ſecond <hi>Purification,</hi> nine ounces and a half of <hi>Regulus</hi> do remain; after the third, eight ounces and two drachms of <hi>Regulus;</hi> and after the fourth you'l have ſeven ounces, and ſix drachms.</p>
                     <p>The Star which appears upon the <hi>Martial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus of Antimony</hi> when it is well Purified, has given occaſion to the Chymiſts to reaſon upon the matter; and the greateſt part of theſe men being ſtrongly perſwaded of the <hi>Planetary Influences,</hi> and a ſuppoſed correſpondence between each of the Planets, and the Metal that bears its name, they have not wanted to aſſert, that this ſame <hi>Star</hi> proceeded from the impreſſion which certain little bodies flowing from the Planet <hi>Mars</hi> do
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48366:124"/>
beſtow upon <hi>Antimony</hi> for ſake of the remaining Iron that was mixed with it; and for this reaſon, they wonderfully recommend the making this preparation upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> rather than another day, between 7 and 8 a clock in the morning, or elſe between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, provided the weather be clear and fair, thinking that day which is denominated from <hi>Mars</hi> to be the time that it lets fall its <hi>Influences</hi> moſt plentiful of any. They have likewiſe conceited a thouſand things of the like nature, which it would be too much trouble to relate here.</p>
                     <p>But all opinions of this kind have no manner of probability, for no bodies Experience did ever evince, that the Metals have any ſuch correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Planets, as I have maintained otherwhere; much leſs can they prove that the <hi>Influences</hi> of the Planets do imprint ſuch and ſuch <hi>Figures</hi> to Metals, as theſe men do determine. It would be no hard matter for me here to ſhew how little reaſon or foundation there is in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of that nature, and how very weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain are the Principles of <hi>Judicial Aſtrology;</hi> but this would be too long a Digreſſion for this place, and ſerve only to ſwell this Book with things that may be found treated of at large elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and particularly in the <hi>Epitome</hi> of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> made by Monſieur <hi>Bernier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My thoughts therefore ſhall not ſoar ſo high as theſe mens do; and though I may ſeem dull and mean in their eyes, I ſhall not ſearch in the <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Bodies</hi> for an explication of the <hi>Star</hi> we now contend about; ſeeing I can find it out in cauſes near at hand. There have been who gazing too
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48366:125"/>
earneſtly upon the Stars above, have not perceived the ſtone at their feet, that cauſed them to ſtumble.</p>
                     <p>I ſay then that the Star which appears upon the <hi>Martial Regulus of Antimony,</hi> does proceed from the <hi>Antimony</hi> it ſelf; for this Mineral runs all into Needles; but becauſe before it is Purified, it is loaded with ſulphureous and impure parts, which do make it ſoftiſh, theſe Needles do not appear but confuſedly. Now when it is purified with <hi>Mars,</hi> not only a great many of the more ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous parts of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and ſuch as are fitteſt to hinder its Cryſtallization, are carried away, but alſo there remains the hardeſt and the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact part of Iron, which makes the <hi>Antimony</hi> firmer than it was. So that the Purification does ſerve to lay open the natural Cryſtals of <hi>Antimony</hi> in form of a <hi>ſtar,</hi> and the Iron by its hardneſs does expatiate theſe Cryſtals, from whence it comes that the <hi>Martial Regulus of Antimony</hi> is harder than the other <hi>Regulus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cryſtals then do appear in form of a <hi>ſtar</hi> in the <hi>Martial Regulus of Antimony,</hi> becauſe they were ſo naturally in the <hi>Antimony</hi> before. This <hi>ſtar</hi> does not appear exactly the ſame in the <hi>common Regulus of Antimony,</hi> let it be Purified never ſo much, becauſe its parts have not the ſame tenſion as thoſe of the other.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The <hi>Antimony</hi> muſt be Calcined within the Chimny, and the vapours that fly from it muſt be avoided as being very injurious to the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>This Calcination is performed to deveſt it of ſome groſs Sulphurs that might hinder its Vitrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Some do add to this gray powder <hi>Borax,</hi> others crude Antimony, and others Sulphur, that it may Vitrifie the more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>The Vitrification happens not, until the parts of <hi>Antimony</hi> have been rendred more firm and ſtiff than they were before, to the end the fiery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles paſſing and repaſſing through the matter may form the pores into a ſtrait line, ſo that they can remain in this condition, when the <hi>Antimony</hi> is grown cold; and it is the figure of theſe pores, which cauſes the tranſparency, becauſe they ſuffer the light to paſs through them directly.</p>
                     <p>The ſulphur and antimony do help it to melt, wherefore ſome do add them to the matter, though in a ſmall quantity, and their volatile part flies away before the Vitrification.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Borax</hi> does not only help the fuſion, but likewiſe ſerves to harden the matter when cold, that the pores may the longer be preſerved ſtrait; for, although a great part of the ſulphurs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony flies away, yet there remains enough ſtill in the very ſubſtance of the glaſs, which yet do not very long continue in their firſt poſition, but ſhutting the pores of the matter do render it opake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:48366:126"/>This accident does not happen to ſuch glaſſes as contain no Sulphur, becauſe their parts being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſerved ſtiff and firm, their pores do never become obſtructed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Glaſs of Antimony</hi> receiving more Calcination than the other preparations, ſhould conſequently be leſs Vomitive, by reaſon of the diſperſion and loſs of much Sulphur, wherein its Vomitive virtue doth conſiſt: Nevertheleſs experience ſhews us the contrary, for it works with more force, as I have ſaid; and the reaſon of it is, becauſe no Salt is uſed in the making of this glaſs, whereas in the other preparations Salt-peter is uſed, which by its fixt parts hinders the activity of ſome part of the Sulphurs; thus although there doth remain but a ſmall quantity of Sulphur in the <hi>Glaſs of Antimony,</hi> yet as little as there is being in great motion, it cauſes a greater diſpoſition to Vomit.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Glaſs of Antimony</hi> may be corrected by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining it in a crucible with a third part of Salt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then waſhing it divers times with hot water, it is to be dried. This powder is not ſo ſtrong in its operation as the <hi>Glaſs of Antimony,</hi> becauſe the Salt-peter has fixed ſome part of the Sulphurs of <hi>Antimony.</hi> It works much like the <hi>Crocus metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi> of which I am to treat.</p>

                  <p>This preparation is an <hi>Antimony</hi> opened by Salt-peter, and by fire, which have made it half glaſs, and which have given it a Liver-colour.</p>

                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:48366:127"/>Take a pound of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and ſo much Salt-peter, powder them, and mix them well together, put this mixture into an Iron mortar, and cover it with a tyle; leave an open place nevertheleſs through which you may convey a coal of fire, and take it out again, the matter will flame, and cauſe a great detonation, which being over, and the mortar grown cold, ſtrike againſt the bottom that the matter may fall down; then ſeparate the droſs with a hammer, from the ſhining part, which is called <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> from its colour.</p>
                  <p>To make the <hi>Emetick</hi> wine you muſt infuſe an ounce of this <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in powder in a quart of White-wine four and twenty hours, and ſo let it ſettle; the Doſe of this wine is from half an ounce to three ounces.</p>

It is uſed as the <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> to make the Emetick wine, and it is given likewiſe in ſubſtance to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſtrongly: the doſe is from two to eight grains.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>This preparation is a more impure <hi>Glaſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> than that I deſcribed, and conſequently it is more opaque; it works not ſo violently as the glaſs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> hath a different ſtrength according to the proportion of <hi>Niter</hi> that enters into it; when there's more <hi>Niter</hi> than <hi>Antimony,</hi> it is the leſs Vomitive, not only becauſe great ſtore
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48366:127"/>
of the Sulphurs of Antimony are loſt in the ſtrong detonation that it raiſes, but alſo becauſe there remains more fixt parts of the Salt-peter, which do joyn and unite with the Sulphurs that remain in the matter. Thus if inſtead of a pound of Salt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you ſhould uſe twenty ounces, as many do, you'd have a <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> leſs Vomitive than that I deſcribed. Now on the contrary when leſs Salt-peter than Antimony is uſed, the <hi>Liver</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from this mixture is not ſo Vomitive as that I now deſcribed; the reaſon of it is that the Sulphurs of Antimony have not been ſufficiently ſtirred by the Salt-peter in ſo little a quantity: for Antimony becomes not Vomitive, but only when it hath been ſufficiently opened, either by fire, or ſome Salts. The moſt convenient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion then that can be obſerved to render the <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> as Vomitive as may be, is to take equal parts according to my deſcription.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrong detonation that happens when fire is put to the matter, is not cauſed through the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of Salt-peter, as almoſt every body hath thought, through want of ſufficient reflexion; I ſhall prove in its proper place that it can never take flame, and that its volatile parts do ſerve for a kind of Bellows, or Vehicle to rarifie and exalt the Sulphurs of Antimony.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> is prepared with equal quantities of Antimony, Niter, and Sea-ſalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitated; and becauſe theſe ſalts do give it a red colour like unto the <hi>Opale,</hi> this preparation has been called <hi>Magneſia Opalina;</hi> it is leſs Emetick than the other, by reaſon of the addition of ſea-ſalt, which fixes the ſaline Sulphur of Antimony.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="220" facs="tcp:48366:128"/>Several other ways of preparing the <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> have been invented; but I am contented with having given you the beſt of all, and the eaſieſt to prepare.</p>
                     <p>If you uſe ordinary ſalt-peter in this Operation, you'l obtain eight ounces and two drachms of <hi>Liver of Antimony;</hi> but if you uſe purified ſalt-peter, you'l get but ſix ounces and a half.</p>
                     <p>This difference of quantity proceeds from the nature of ſalt-peter, for the more volatile parts this Mineral ſalt contains, the more apt it is to carry off ſome parts of the Antimony. Now pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Salt-peter is much more volatile than the common ſort, wherefore the <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> where it is uſed, is in leſſer quantity.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> that's made with common ſalt-peter is the redder, and comes nearer to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of an Animals Liver, than that which is made with purified ſalt-peter; this happens through the fixt ſalt which is in this preparation more than in the other; for common ſalt-peter contains much fixt ſalt, as I ſhall ſhew in its proper place; this ſalt does likewiſe make the matter the heavier.</p>
                     <p>As for the virtues of theſe <hi>Livers of Antimony,</hi> the difference is not very great, but only that which is made with purified ſalt-peter is a little more Emetick than the other.</p>
                     <p>I cannot paſs by here the falſe imagination of ſome men who think that preparation of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Antimony,</hi> of which half a drachm, or two ſcruples may be given, is much better than that whereof 3 or 4 grains perform the ſame effect; for there is no doubt but the taking ſo great a quantity of Antimony will give an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48366:128"/>
to the ſtomach, that a leſſer quantity is not able to do. Furthermore, whereas theſe kind of preparations do commonly open the Antimony but little, or but half-fix the ſaline ſulphurs, it is to be feared leſt ſome ſalt they may meet with in the ſtomach, ſhould open them too much, or volatilize them, and ſo cauſe moſt unhappy accidents.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> is waſhed with warm water, ſome part of the fixt <hi>Niter</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in it is ſeparated. Many have believed that the more violent part of the Emetick was carried off by this Lotion: but on the contrary, this fixt part is more capable of mitigating than augmenting its violence for the reaſons I have ſpoke already.</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve that if you ſhould put four ounces of prepared Antimony into a quart of wine, the wine will not be more Vomitive than if you ſhould put but an ounce; becauſe being loaded with as much of the ſubſtance of it as it is able to contain, the reſt remains at bottom, and cannot be diſſolved unleſs more wine be added. Now an ounce of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> or <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> is, according to experience, capable of impregnating not only one quart of wine, but after having poured off the liquor by Inclination, if you put as much more wine to the matter that remains, and leave it in digeſtion two or three days together, you'l have an Infuſion as Emetick as the firſt. You may if you pleaſe renew the wine that is poured upon it to be infuſed, nine ſeveral times, and it will always prove Emetick; after which, if you Calcine your matter a quarter of an hour in an earthen pot unglazed over a ſmall
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48366:129"/>
fire, ſtirring the matter continually with an Iron Spatule, you may infuſe it again as before, and it will render the wine Emetick.</p>
                     <p>That Emetick wine which is made with the <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> is moſt in uſe; it is likewiſe prepared with the <hi>Regulus</hi> and glaſs, as I have ſaid ſpeaking of them.</p>
                     <p>You might likewiſe make another ſort of it, by infuſing warm ſome days crude Antimony in white-wine; for the tartarous ſalts of the wine do open the Antimony, but it would not prove ſo vomitive as the other.</p>
                     <p>The Emetick wine is given alone, or mixed with Purgatives, that convey it partly by ſtool. When you find an Inclination to vomit, you muſt be provided of broth a little fat, and take ſome ſpoonfuls to facilitate the Vomiting, and hinder the great efforts which ſometimes break veſſels, and cauſe mortal Hemorrhagies to follow. You muſt alſo conſider that thoſe who have their breaſts ſtrait, and bodies thin, are much harder to vomit than others. But let us leave thoſe particulars to the wiſdom of Phyſicians.</p>

                  <p>Powder and mix well together one part of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony with three parts of purified Salt-peter; and having heated a Crucible red-hot in the Coals, caſt into it a ſpoonful of your mixture, you'l hear

a noiſe or detonation; after that's over, caſt in another ſpoonful, and continue to do ſo 'till all your powder is in the Crucible. Leave a great fire about it two hours, then throw your matter which will be white, into an earthen pan almoſt filled with Fountain-water, and leave it a ſteeping warm ten or twelve hours, that the fixt Salt-peter may diſſolve in it; ſeparate the liquor by Inclination, waſh the white powder that remains at bottom five or ſix times with warm water, and dry it. This is called <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum,</hi> or mineral Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick, or the <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Antimony.</hi>

                  <p>All the Lotions may be evaporated, and a fixt Salt-peter will be found at the bottom of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, which works much like the <hi>Sal Polychreſtum.</hi>

                     <p>In this preparation three pounds of Salt-peter are uſed for one pound of Antimony, that after ſublimation of the volatile parts there may remain ſtore of fixt Niter, which unites with the Antimony, and hinders it from being Vomitive.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable, that three parts of Niter with one of Antimony do not cauſe ſo ſtrong a deto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor ſo great a diminution of the parts of Antimony, as when there are but equal quantities.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48366:130"/>
And the reaſon of it is, that there's too little ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Antimony for the quantity of Niter, and that ſome part of the ſulphur does remain unactive in the fixt Niter, which admits not of flagration, for the volatile part of Salt-peter does not burn, but according to the proportion of ſulphur with which it is mixed. And this is a proof of my aſſertion in this matter, that if you throw upon lighted coals, a little of that Salt-peter which you ſhall have drawn from the lotions of <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Diaphoreticum,</hi> it will ſtill cauſe a flame to ariſe, by reaſon of new ſulphur which it meets with in the coals, which ſulphur does joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the volatile part of Salt-peter that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. I ſhall ſpeak more at large of the flagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salt-peter, in the Chapter of this Salt.</p>
                     <p>You muſt put the mixture into the Crucible ſpoonful after ſpoonful, that the Calcination may be done the better. When it is ended, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is waſhed, for to ſeparate the Salt-peter that is unuſeful. But let there be never ſo many lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they can never waſh away a certain invelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or cover that is given to the Antimony by the fixt Salt-peter; for each particle of Antimony is ſo cloſely united, that it cannot any way be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated without recourſe to ſome reductive Salt; and this is it that makes this preparation of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be not at all Vomitive. Many do ſay it is Sudorifick, but I could never obſerve any ſuch effect ſenſibly. Nevertheleſs I would ſubmit to think ſo, both becauſe many Authors have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo, and becauſe the heat of the body may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeparate ſome of its Sulphurs, which not being ſtrong enough to make one Vomit, may only
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48366:130"/>
drive by Tranſpiration ſenſible or inſenſible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the pores are more or leſs open. Others do think <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum</hi> is meerly an alkali, that is good for nothing but to deſtroy acids, and on this principle do give it for the ſame ends as Coral, Perle, Calcined Harts-horn, and ſuch like things as do abſorb ſharp or acid humours, which abounding too much in the body do cauſe divers diſeaſes; but without doubt they that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe principles have not built them on Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; for pour any kind of acid on <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum,</hi> it will never diſſolve at all, and take away the acid after a very long Infuſion, it will be as ſtrong as ever; which proves it to be no alkali, and therefore not to produce the effects that are pretended.</p>

                  <p>Take a good earthen pot unglazed, able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the fire, with a hole in the middle of its height, and a ſtopple to it; ſet it in a Furnace of an equal proportion, and fit to it three pots more of the ſame earth, all three open at the bottom, and fit a glaſs head to the uppermoſt pot, with a little Viol for a Receiver. Lute the junctures well, and by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48366:131"/>
the means of ſome Bricks and Lute together, let the fire tranſpire only through ſome little holes, and be but ſtrong enough to warm the bottom of the lowermoſt pot; then give your fire by degrees, to heat this pot by little and little red-hot.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time mix three parts of Salt-peter, with one of <hi>Antimony</hi> in powder; caſt a ſpoonful of it into the red-hot pot through the hole, and ſtop it again quickly, you'l perceive a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonation, and after it is over, caſt in another ſpoonful, and continue to do ſo until all your matter is ſpent. Then encreaſe the fire to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for half an hours time, and ſo let it go out. Unlute the veſſels as ſoon as they are coid, you'l find a little Spirit of Niter in the Receiver; white flowers in the three upper pots, and a white maſs in the lowermoſt, which may be waſhed as the other <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum,</hi> and ſo dried. This Mineral Diaphoretick is as good as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; you muſt waſh the flowers ſeveral times with warm water, and then dry them. They are not ſo Emetick as thoſe I ſhall deſcribe hereafter; the doſe is from two to ſix grains.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>In this preparation the volatile or Sulphureous parts of <hi>Antimony</hi> do ſtick to the ſides of the pots like flower; if you don't waſh them, they will not be ſo Vomitive, becauſe the Salt-peter that riſes with them, hinders their activity.</p>
                     <p>The acid ſpirit which is found in the Recipient may be uſed in the Colick; the doſe is from
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48366:131"/>
four to eight drops in Broth, or ſome appropriate liquor.</p>
                     <p>If you uſe in this operation five ounces of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and fifteen ounces of Salt-peter, you will draw half an ounce of Spirit of Niter, two drachms of flowers of Antimony waſht, and dried, and five ounces of very white <hi>Antimonium diaphoreticum,</hi> after that it is well waſht and dried; and if you evaporate and cryſtallize the lotions, you will find ten ounces of Salt, which will be a Salt-peter half fixed, and which will flame being thrown upon the coals; inſomuch that there will be loſt in the whole of the mixture, four ounces and two drachms. This diminution comes from what loſes through the hole of the pot, during the detonation, for ſtop it as well as you can, there will always vent out a great deal of fume, which will incommode the Artiſt, unleſs he takes care to turn away his head from the ſteam.</p>
                     <p>The purified Salt-peter loſes no more than the other, becauſe the ſulphur of Antimony can take of the volatile parts of Salt-peter but ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as it requires to raiſe it. So that in fifteen ounces of Salt-peter, (whether it be the purified ſort or the common) there are much more vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile parts than are neceſſary, in order to joyn with the ſulphur of five ounces of Antimony.</p>
                     <p>Although there do riſe a great many parts of Antimony with the volatile portion of Salt-peter in the detonation, yet we find that the <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium diaphoreticum</hi> which remains, does weigh as much as the Antimony which was imployed in the operation; the reaſon of which is that in place of the part of Antimony that exhales, a great deal
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48366:132"/>
of Salt-peter does as it were inſeparably join with the remainder, and this is that which fixes it, and hinders it from being vomitive, as I have ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Again, although Antimony is naturally black, it becomes altogether white, when it has been well rarefied; for all that we ſee in this operation, is a pure white, as well the volatile as the fixt, which ſhews very well that colours have no real being.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Antimonium diaphoreticum</hi> may be prepared, and at the ſame time likewiſe a ſulphur of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, after the following manner.</p>
                     <p>Diſſolve within the chimney, what quantity you pleaſe of crude Antimony with three times as much <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> in a glaſs body, there will appear a ſtrong ebullition with red vapours, which muſt be avoided as being very injurious to the breaſt; when the diſſolution is over, pour upon it a great quantity of water, in order to weaken the <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> upon which the whole turns into a milk, and then a Precipitate in a white powder falls to the bottom of the veſſel.</p>
                     <p>You will likewiſe ſee a kind of gray ſcum ſwim upon the liquor, which you muſt gather up with a Spatule, or with a wooden ſpoon, and dry it in the ſhade; it is a ſulphur which fires like common ſulphur, and is good for nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>You muſt decant the water from the body, and waſhing the precipitated powder divers times, and drying it, you will have an <hi>Antimonium dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticum</hi> that may be uſed as the former; this preparation indeed is not much in uſe, but many do prefer it before all the others.</p>
                     <p>When Antimony is Calcined by the heat of the Sun, as through a Burning-Glaſs; inſtead of loſing
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48366:132"/>
its weight, as one would think it ſhould by reaſon of the evaporation of Sulphureous parts, it does increaſe in weight: which ſhews that ſome more ponderous bodies have ſucceeded in the place of thoſe that are gone.</p>

                  <head>Flowers of Antimony.</head>
                  <p>This preparation is the more volatile part of Antimony raiſed by fire.</p>
                  <p>Fit the ſame pots I ſpoke of in the laſt Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one upon another; ſet them in the ſame Furnace, and obſerve the ſame circumſtances for their ſituation, and for heating the lowermoſt. When its bottom is red-hot, caſt into it a ſmall ſpoonful of Antimony in powder through the hole, and ſtir the matter at the bottom of the pot with an Iron Spatule crooked a little on purpoſe to do it the better; draw out your Spatule, and ſtop the hole, the flowers will riſe and ſtick in the upper pots. Continue a great fire, that the pot may ſtill remain red-hot, and when you ſee nothing more ſublime, caſt in ſo much more Antimony, obſerving to do what I have ſaid. Repeat the caſting it in through the hole, till you have flowers enough. Then let the fire go out, and when the veſſels are cold, unlute them, you'l find flowers all about the three upper pots, and the head, gather them together with a Feather, and keep them in a Viol.</p>
                  <p>It is a powerful Emetick; it is given in Quartan Agues, and other Intermittent Feavers, and alſo in the Epilepſie; the doſe is from two grains to ſix in Lozenges, or Broth.</p>

                  <head>Remarks.</head>
                  <p>In this preparation, as in the former, you muſt leave room enough; otherwiſe the flowers of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony being driven fiercely by the fire, would be apt to break the veſſel for want of room to move in. And this is the reaſon why many pots are here placed one upon another. There's no need of any Receiver, becauſe there is no liquor to fall into it, ſo that a blind head may ſerve.</p>
                  <p>At the bottom of the pot which contained the matter, there remains a maſs of the more terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious part of Antimony, that muſt be flung away as being good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> do happen to be of different colours, it is becauſe the fire was not managed equally ſtrong; theſe <hi>Flowers</hi> are more Vomitive than the former, becauſe they have no Salt-peter in them.</p>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Flowers</hi> are the more ſulphureous part of <hi>Antimony</hi> rarefied and exalted by fire.</p>
                  <p>Powder and mix well together four pounds of common glaſs with one pound of <hi>Antimony,</hi> put this mixture into an earthen, or glaſs Retort lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whoſe half is empty; ſet it in a Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Furnace, and fit to it a large Receiver, lute the junctures lightly, and give a little fire at firſt to warm the Retort, then augment it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48366:133"/>
and you'l ſee <hi>Red flowers</hi> come forth into the Receiver: continue the fire until no more can come, which you'l know as you unlute the junctures; and taking off the Receiver gather your <hi>Flowers,</hi> and keep them for uſe. They are more Vomitive than the former, and are given to the ſame intents: the doſe is from two grains to four in a Lozenge, or ſome appropriate liquor.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>That which makes theſe <hi>Flowers</hi> more Vomitive than the former, is the more terreſtrious or fixt part of <hi>Antimony</hi>'s being kept from riſing by the glaſs, ſo that what is exalted by the fire is more Sulphureous, and conſequently more Emetick.</p>
                     <p>The red colour of theſe <hi>Flowers</hi> doth proceed from the abundance of Sulphurs they are impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, and it may be ſaid that glaſs, which is an alkali, acting on this Sulphur gives it this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour after the ſame manner as Quick-lime, or the alkali Salt of Tartar makes common Sulphur turn red, when they are boiled together in water.</p>
                     <p>The time that you take theſe <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> you muſt often drink broth, both to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the vomiting, and dull the great activity of this Remedy; for it is one of the ſtrongeſt vomits that is in Phyſick. But becauſe it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that this Powder ſticking in the membranes of the ſtomach, or ſome of its folds, doth cauſe a continual vomiting, notwithſtanding the frequent uſe of broths, you muſt then add the Cream of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and diſſolve it in the broth, and ſo take ſome

ſpoonful every quarter of an hour. This Cream of <hi>Tartar</hi> ſtops the vomiting, becauſe it joyns with the Sulphurs of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and fixes them, ſo that they precipitate by ſtool.</p>

                  <p>Powder, and mix ſix ounces of the <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> with a pound of Sublimate Corroſive; put this mixture into a glaſs Retort, whoſe half remains empty; ſet your Retort in Sand, and after having fitted to it a Receiver, and luted the conjunctions, you muſt firſt make a ſmall fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and there will diſtil a clear oil; after that, augment the fire a little, and there will come forth a white thick liquor like <hi>Butter,</hi> which would ſtop the neck of the Retort, and break it, if you did not take care to ſet live Coals near it, that it may melt and run into the Receiver. Continue the fire, until you ſee a red vapour come forth. Then take away the Receiver, and put another in its place filled with water.

                  <p>This <hi>Butter</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> is nothing but a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the acid Spirits of Sublimate Corroſive with the <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and thoſe Spirits are they that render it Cauſtick.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirits of Salt and Vitriol in this operation do leave the <hi>Mercury</hi> to adhere unto the <hi>Antimony</hi> which is more porous; inſomuch that the <hi>Mercury</hi> being diveſted of that which kept it in a Cryſtalline form, and being driven by a ſtrong fire, rarefies into vapours, which paſs through the neck of the Retort into the Receiver filled with water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it condenſes into Quick-ſilver by means of the coolneſs.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but ſome will find difficulty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how the acids that adhered to the ſolid body of <hi>Mercury</hi> ſhould ſtrike off to joyn with the <hi>Antimony;</hi> but it may be ſaid to that, that the acids being ſo many edges faſtned at one end in the body of <hi>Mercury,</hi> may by t'other end be ſeparated and drawn off by the ſoft and ramous parts of the <hi>Antimony,</hi> that are in greater motion than the <hi>Mercury.</hi>

                  <p>When the red vapours begin to appear, take away the Receiver, and put another in its place without luting the junctures; encreaſe the fire by little and little till you make the Retort red-hot: continue it ſo three or four hours, then let the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort cool, and break it, you'l find a <hi>Cinnabar</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed, and adhering to the neck, ſeparate it and keep it: it is a good Remedy for the Pox, and the Epilepſie, it purges by ſweat, the doſe is from ſix to fifteen grains in Pills, or <hi>Bolus,</hi> with ſome proper Conſerve.</p>

                  <p>This preparation is an <hi>Antimony</hi> fixed by ſpirit of Niter, and rendred ſudorifick.</p>
                  <p>Melt in hot aſhes two ounces of the Butter of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and pour it into a Viol or a Bolthead, drop into it good ſpirit of <hi>Niter</hi> until the matter is perfectly diſſolved, commonly ſo much ſpirit of <hi>Niter</hi> is requiſite as there is Butter of <hi>Antimony;</hi> during the diſſolution there will riſe up vapours that you muſt have a care of, and therefore will do well to place the veſſel in the Chimney. Pour your ſolution into a glaſs body, or an earthen diſh, and evaporate it in a gentle ſand-fire until it is dry; there will remain a white maſs, which you muſt let cool, and then pour upon it two ounces of ſpirit of <hi>Niter;</hi> ſet the veſſel again in ſand, and evaporate the liquor as before; once more pour two ounces of ſpirit of <hi>Niter</hi> on the white maſs, and having evaporated the humidity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the fire a little, and Calcine the matter for half an hours time, then take it off the fire, and you have a white powder, which you muſt keep in a Viol well ſtopt. It is ſudorifick, and ſerves for the ſame uſes as <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum:</hi> the doſe is from ſix to twenty grains, in broth, or ſome appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate liquor.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Spirits of Vitriol and Salt were not ſtrong enough, nor in quantity enough to make an entire diſſolution of the <hi>Antimony,</hi> they only made a light adheſion to it, but when they are joyned with ſpirit of <hi>Niter,</hi> they act with much more force; for they penetrate and divide every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and do render them imperceptible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of receiving a more exact diſſolution. Now in this penetration, as in the ſolution of <hi>Mercury,</hi> there happens a great efferveſcency, for which reaſon I adviſe to pour the ſpirit of <hi>Niter</hi> by little and little, for fear the matter ſhould riſe above the veſſel. This efferveſcency doth proceed from the reſiſtance, that the edges of the ſpirits do meet with, when they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pores of the <hi>Antimony:</hi> for ſo ſoon as the diſſolution is ended, there is no further Ebullition. Afterwards the humidity is evaporated, and new ſpirit of <hi>Niter</hi> poured twice more on the fixt maſs, as I have ſaid; after which the Butter of <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> that was ſo great a Cauſtick, and Emetick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes one of the mildeſt medicins we have, and near approaching the preparation of <hi>Antimony</hi> that is called Diaphoretick.</p>
                     <p>This great change may well make us wonder at it, and it is hard to conceive how an acid Corroſive ſpirit, ſuch as ſpirit of <hi>Niter,</hi> ſhould be able to to ſweeten a matter that became Cauſtick only for being impregnated with acid ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:48366:138"/>To give this difficulty ſome ſolution, it may be ſaid, that the Butter of <hi>Antimony</hi> became Cauſtick, for that the acids which it contained did but ſuperficially adhere, and were ſo adapted that the motion of the <hi>Antimonial</hi> parts did ſerve them for a vehicle to diſtribute their keenneſs as they did; but that after the ſolution, the acids being in great quantity, do fix the <hi>Antimony,</hi> and not only deſtroy its aptitude to motion, but do ſo ſheath or lock themſelves in the pliant ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts of this mixt, that they loſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all their corroſion.</p>
                     <p>In the evaporation, abundance of the ſulphurs, which were in the Butter of <hi>Antimony,</hi> are loſt.</p>
                     <p>This powder is called <hi>Bezoar Mineral,</hi> becauſe it cauſes Sweat, like the <hi>Bezoar</hi> ſtone.</p>
                     <p>You muſt know that theſe preparations are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſo many transformations of the <hi>Regulus of Antimony,</hi> made by acid ſpirits or by fire; ſo that by Fuſion, or by the means of ſome reductive ſalt, they may be recovered into <hi>Regulus</hi> again, by deſtroying thoſe ſalts which kept them under this form.</p>

                  <p>Put into a glaſs retort ſix ounces of <hi>Antimony</hi> finely powdered, pour upon it four ounces of good ſpirit of ſalt, and the ſame quantity of the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Oil of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> ſhake and mingle them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſtopping the retort, ſet it in ſand,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48366:138"/>
with the noſe upwards, give it a ſmall digeſting fire for four and twenty hours, then turn the noſe downward, and when you have unſtopt it, fit to it a glaſs receiver, lute the junctures with a wet bladder; make a little fire gradually to the ſecond degree, and there will diſtil a whitiſh liquor; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it a little at laſt, and continue it until no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more comes forth into the receiver.

               <p>
                  <hi>ARſenick</hi> is a Mineral Body conſiſting of much Sulphur, and ſome Cauſtick ſalts, There are three ſorts of it, the White that keeps the name of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> the Yellow called <hi>Auripigmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or Yellow <hi>Orpin,</hi> and the Red called <hi>Realgal,</hi> or <hi>Sandaracha;</hi> the White is the ſtrongeſt of all, and is ſometimes tranſparent like cryſtal. Some do add to theſe for a fourth kind of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> a Yellow <hi>Arſenick,</hi> which is an <hi>Orpin</hi> differing from the other only in this, that it is not ſo tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, nor of ſo high a colour.</p>
               <p>None of theſe <hi>Arſenicks</hi> may be given inwardly, although ſeveral perſons that have ventur'd to uſe the white, do pretend to have cured with it divers diſeaſes, and among others the Quartan-Ague. They venture to give of it as far as four grains, in a great deal of water, and after that manner it will Vomit, like <hi>Antimony.</hi> But I can by no means allow of this <hi>Febrifuge,</hi> and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver adviſe any body to uſe ſo dangerous a Remedy. Nature doth furniſh us with Medicins enough of Conſcience to provoke Vomiting without recourſe to <hi>Arſenick.</hi> It is uſed outwardly with ſufficient ſucceſs, becauſe it eats proud fleſh.</p>
               <p>People ſometimes cover the Corns of their feet with <hi>Arſenick</hi> in powder, and it eats them to the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48366:140"/>
root without any pain, but they muſt be ſure to cover the adjacent fleſh with a plaiſter of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma,</hi> after the ſame manner as when Cauſticks are applied.</p>

                  <p>Powder and mix together a pound of <hi>Arſenick</hi> with ſix ounces of gravelled Aſhes, incorporate this powder in a pound of ſoft ſoap, and make a paſte of it, put it in a great Crucible, and cover it with an earthen cover, that hath a hole in the middle; ſet your Crucible in a wind-furnace, and give a little fire at firſt, then augment it gradually, that the matter may be in a clear fuſion: throw it into a mortar greas'd at the bottom, or into a <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,</hi> ſtrike it round about a little with pincers, and let the matter cool, then knock it out, you'l find in the bottom of the mortar a <hi>Regulus of Arſenick,</hi> ſeparate it from the droſs. It is not ſo Corroſive as <hi>Arſenick</hi> it ſelf, and its effect is milder.</p>

                     <p>The ſoap being full of an alkali ſalt, and the gravelled Aſhes do correct or fix the great activity of the ſulphurs of <hi>Arſenick.</hi>

                     <p>A hole is made in the cover that the more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile part may ſublime with the Oil and humidity that are in the Soap, the alkali ſalts do remain in

the droſs with ſome part of the more groſs ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs of <hi>Arſenick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If by way of Curioſity you ſhould boil the droſs in water, Filtrate the decoction, and pour Vinegar upon it, or ſome other acid, to break the force of the alkali's, a <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Arſenick</hi> will precipitate, that is ſtronger than <hi>Arſenick</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arſenick</hi> being compounded of abundance of ſulphurs, is not ſo quick in its operation as Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Corroſive, becauſe theſe ſulphurs do not knaw ſo faſt as the acid ſalts.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Arſenick</hi> ſhould happen to be taken inwardly through any miſtake, the perſon may ſtill be ſaved half an hour afterwards, by ſwallowing good ſtore of warm oil, to Vomit and Purge; after that he muſt be purged with <hi>Caſſia,</hi> and Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and he muſt often drink Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> in Broths, that if any ſulphur ſhould chance to remain, it might be fixed by this Salt; for when <hi>Arſenick</hi> is in the body, the heat of the body raiſes and rarefies the ſulphurs on every ſide.</p>

                  <p>Put what quantity you pleaſe of <hi>Arſenick</hi> groſly powdered into a Crucible, ſet it in a ſmall fire under the Chimney to Calcine and evaporate about the third part of the matter.

                  <p>If you ſhould repeat the Sublimation four or five times, adding ſalt each time, a ſweet Sublimate of <hi>Arſenick</hi> would be made, that is to ſay, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly leſs corroſive than common <hi>Arſenick.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Arſenick</hi> is Calcined, to the end the more volatile part may fly away in fumes; if you ſhould continue the fire, and encreaſe it toward the end, every jot of the <hi>Arſenick</hi> would fly away.

                     <p>The Salt Decrepitated does ſix the great vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> and the fire carries off ſome of its more active ſulphurs, inſomuch that the oftner it is ſublimed, the more it does dulcify, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes proper to apply to fleſh, where we would gently corrode.</p>
                     <p>If you ſublime <hi>Arſenick</hi> alone in a bolthead, with a great fire, without having Calcined it at all before, the ſublimate will be converted into a glaſs, much reſembling common glaſs both in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and tranſparency.</p>

                     <p>The ſame thing happens in this operation, that I ſpoke of in the Butter of <hi>Antimony:</hi> that is, the Spirits of Sublimate Corroſive do leave the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Arſenick,</hi> which they draw along with them in a gummous liquor: the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> being afterwards diſengaged, and finding no ſulphurs to fix it, comes forth in a vapour, and condenſes into water.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of Quick-lime.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ick-lime</hi> is a Stone, whoſe moiſture the fire hath quite dried up, and brought into its place a great many igneous bodies. It is theſe little bodies that cauſe the Ebullition, when water hath opened the matter that kept them incloſed: and this Ebullition laſts until all the parts of the <hi>Lime</hi> are dilated, and the fiery particles ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſo that there is no need of further trouble to get out. Theſe little igneous bodies do likewiſe render the <hi>Lime</hi> Corroſive, for the ſtone is not at all ſo of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>When the ſtone, that <hi>Quick-lime</hi> is made of, is grown red hot in the Furnaces, the Workmen have a ſpecial care to keep up the fire at an equal height, until the ſtone is quite Calcin'd; for if the flame which has begun to burn among the ſtones, ſhould be ſuffered to leſſen for a while, and ſo the heat be checkt before the end of the work, they would never afterwards be able to make <hi>Quick-lime</hi> with thoſe ſtones any more, though they ſhould be at the charge of burning fifty times as much wood as is commonly required; and this, becauſe in that interval of heat, the pores of the ſtone, which were begun to be opened, do cloſe and ſhut, and the matter ſinks down in a lump to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the whole. And then again the flame
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48366:144"/>
can't riſe in it any more, for it finds none of thoſe <hi>interſtices,</hi> or ſpaces between, which were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent before, for it to paſs through. The matter therefore is rendred uncapable of receiving the fire any more, becauſe all the ſmall cells that were uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for its reception, are ſhut up and deſtroyed in this confuſion.</p>
               <p>It is objected, that if igneous bodies were they that cauſed the Corroſion of <hi>Quick-lime, Tiles, Bricks,</hi> and all ſtones that are not of the nature of <hi>Lime-ſtone,</hi> and <hi>Iron, Copper, Silver, Gold,</hi> and many other bodies ſhould be as Cauſtick as <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> after having endured the fire as long if not longer than it.</p>
               <p>But this does not follow, for <hi>Tiles,</hi> and other Calcined ſtones have not the pores diſpoſed like thoſe of <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> to retain fiery particles; and if ſome metals are found impregnated with them during their Calcination, they are known to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them ſo well by the ſolidity of their parts, that neither the heat nor moiſture of the fleſh are able to draw them out of the places they are fixt in, to cauſe a Corroſion upon the part. It is eaſie here to give you an example; for if you take the <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> that encreaſed its weight in the Calcination, as I have ſaid before, and ſteep it in water, the water will not act at all upon it, and the <hi>Calx</hi> may be taken from the water in the ſame weight it was put in; you muſt melt it by fire, if you would ſeparate the igneous bodies: but now as for common <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> a ſmall matter of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is able to ſeparate the tender parts of the ſtone, and drive out the fiery particles in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:48366:144"/>It is ſaid likewiſe that the ebullition of water which happens when flung upon <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> muſt not be imputed to fiery bodies, ſeeing neither ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wine, nor oil, when thrown upon it, do at all cauſe heat, although they are both of them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable bodies, nay on the contrary they are obſerved to quench the heat that uſes to happen to <hi>Quick-lime</hi> when water is joyned with it.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, that theſe effects do proceed from, this, that Oil, ſpirit of wine, and other Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous liquors of the ſame nature, inſtead of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the parts of <hi>quick-lime,</hi> as water does, do rather hinder any ſeparation from being made by ſtopping up the pores.</p>
               <p>That which withdrew me from the Sentiment of thoſe who will have all the effects of <hi>quick-lime</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from its ſalt, was, that I could never find any in it, though I have ſought after it with care enough; for ſome through miſtake do take a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bituminous ſcum, which often ſwims upon the <hi>Lime-water,</hi> for a ſalt.</p>
               <p>Neither can I be of the opinion of thoſe who will needs have an acid to be in <hi>quick-lime,</hi> which being drawn out by the water, and meeting an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali, does cauſe the efferveſcency which is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when water is poured upon <hi>quick-lime;</hi> for although according to appearance an acid may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the natural compoſition of the ſtone that <hi>quick-lime</hi> is made of, this acid has loſt its nature, not only by breaking its points in its ſtrict union with earth at the Petrification, but alſo in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Calcination that is given to this ſtone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to a <hi>Calx.</hi> So that we may here ſay, the ſame thing happens to the acid which enters
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48366:145"/>
into the compoſition of the <hi>ſtone,</hi> as I have ſaid did happen to the ſalt of Vegetables and other mixt bodies, which though naturally an acid ſalt, changes into an alkali by means of its union with earth, and the fiery particles in time of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination; there is only this difference between them both, the acid of the ſtone is mixed with more earth than the ſalt of Vegetables.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lime</hi> is once ſlackt, it neither cauſes any more ebullition, nor heat, with water; but if you add to it an acid, it makes both a conſiderable ebullition, and heat, becauſe the acid edges will penetrate into the particles of the <hi>Lime,</hi> where the water was not able to go.</p>
               <p>There is not made any ebullition, or precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the mixing acids with Lime-water.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Phagedenick Water.</head>
                  <p>This water is a mixture of Sublimate and Lime-water.</p>
                  <p>Put a pound of <hi>Quick-lime</hi> into a large earthen pan, and quench it with ſeven or eight pints of hot water; after the <hi>Lime</hi> hath infuſed five or ſix hours, and is ſunk to the bottom, pour off the water by Inclination, and Filtrate it, this is called Lime-water.</p>
                  <p>To each pint of this water are added fifteen or twenty grains of <hi>Sublimate Corroſive</hi> in powder, and the water preſently turns yellow; they are ſtirred together a good while in a glaſs or marble mortar, and this water is uſed for cleanſing old Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: it eats proud fleſh, and is likewiſe uſed in the

                        <hi>Lime-water</hi> changes the colour of Sublimate Corroſive, becauſe being an alkali, it deſtroys ſome part of the acids, which, according as they are diverſly mixed with the <hi>Mercury,</hi> do give it different colours.</p>

                  <head>Cauſtick ſtones, or Cauteries.</head>
                  <p>This operation is the ſalt of <hi>Gravelled aſhes,</hi> or the Lees of wine Calcined, rendred more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive than it was before, by the igneous parts of <hi>Quick-lime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Put into a great earthen pan, one part of <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> and two parts of <hi>Gravelled aſhes,</hi> or Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined <hi>Tartar,</hi> powder and mix them; pour good ſtore of hot water upon your matter, and leaving it in infuſion five or ſix hours, boil it a little; afterwards paſs that which is clear, through brown paper, and evaporate it in a Copper baſin or earthen pan, there will remain at bottom a ſalt,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48366:146"/>
which you muſt put over the fire in a Crucible, it will diſſolve and boil untill all the remaining humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is evaporated. When you find it at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom like to an Oil, caſt it into a baſin, and cut it into pieces while it is warm; put theſe <hi>Cauteries</hi> quickly into a ſtrong glaſs bottle, ſtop it with wax, and a bladder, for the air would eaſily diſſolve it into a liquor: you muſt alſo take care to keep it in a dry place.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Cauteries are the ſtrongeſt of all that are made; and they are but half an hour in making.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gravelled aſhes</hi> are only a <hi>Calcined Tartar,</hi> for they are made by burning the Lees of wine; but becauſe theſe Lees, by reaſon of their liquidity have fermented more than common <hi>Tartar,</hi> the ſalt which is drawn from them is of a more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating nature than other <hi>Tartar,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is fitter to make <hi>Cauſticks</hi> with. The <hi>Quick-lime</hi> does alſo help to make them much the ſtronger, for the igneous parts which it contains do mix with this ſalt, and make it the more active, and corroſive.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not powder the <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> for the little fiery bodies would then fly away, before they could be received into the water.</p>
                     <p>When you Filtrate the ſolution, you muſt put a cloth under the brown paper to ſupport it, otherwiſe it would be preſently corroded.</p>
                     <p>Ten or twelve ounces of ſalt would be drawn from the <hi>Gravelled aſhes</hi> alone, but the ſlakt <hi>Lime</hi> retains a great deal of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:48366:146"/>If you have uſed in this operation ſixteen ounces of <hi>gravelled aſhes,</hi> and eight ounces of <hi>quick-lime,</hi> you will have eight ounces of your Cauſticks.</p>
                     <p>If you would have the Cauſticks in edges, you muſt put a hot Iron Spatule into the Crucible, whilſt the matter is in Fuſion, and form the edges in a flat baſon.</p>
                     <p>This Cauſtick ſalt is very eaſily diſſolved, and in the making of it you muſt not ſtay till it appears dry at the bottom of the veſſel, as you do for other ſalts; for it remains ſtill fluid, though all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of it be gone; therefore you muſt put a little of it to cool, that you may ſee whether it be in its due conſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why it thus remains in Fuſion is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is full of little fiery bodies which it has taken from the <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> and which have ſo diſpoſed its parts to penetration; for all ſolid bodies which are put in Fuſion by fire do receive this liquid form for no other reaſon, but becauſe the little fiery bodies are become mixed with their parts, and have ſet them into a great agitation.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould uſe lime that is ſlakt, the Cauſticks would not ſo eaſily melt; and if you draw the ſalt from <hi>Gravelled aſhes</hi> alone, it will coagulate in drying, much as other ſalts do; wherefore this Fuſion of the Cauſticks muſt needs proceed from the fiery bodies which were contained in the Quick-lime.</p>
                     <p>Cauſticks may likewiſe be made divers other ways, but this deſcription will deſerve a prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before others, when you would have them be of a quick operation.</p>

                  <p>Theſe operations are liquors of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which do deſtroy one another; the firſt is an infuſion of Quick-lime and Orpin; the ſecond a water turned black by means of burned Cork; and the third is a vinegar impregnated with <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take an ounce of <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> and half an ounce of <hi>Orpin,</hi> powder and mix them, put your mixture into a matraſs, and pour upon it five or ſix ounces of water, that the water may be three fingers breadth above the powder, ſtop your matraſs with Cork, Wax, and a Bladder; ſet it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion in a mild ſand-heat ten or twelve hours, ſhaking the matraſs from time to time, then let it ſettle, the liquor becomes clear like common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Burn Cork, and quench it in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> then diſſolve it in a ſufficient quantity of water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſhall have melted a little <hi>Gumm Arabick,</hi> in order to make an Ink as black as common Ink. You muſt ſeparate the Cork that can't diſſolve, and if the Ink be not black enough, add more Cork as before.</p>
                  <p>Get the Impregnation of <hi>Saturn</hi> made with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, diſtil'd as I have ſhewn before, or elſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ſo much ſalt of <hi>Saturn</hi> as a quantity of water is able to receive: write on Paper with a new Pen dipt in this liquor, take notice of the place where you writ, and let it dry, nothing at all will appear.</p>
                  <p>Write upon the inviſible writing with the Ink made of burnt Cork, and let it dry, that which

                  <p>Dip a little Cotton in the firſt liquor made of <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Orpin,</hi> but the liquor muſt be firſt ſetled and clear; rub the place you writ upon with this Cotton, and that which appeared will preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear, and that which was not ſeen will appear.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>Theſe Operations are indeed of no uſe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſomewhat ſurprizing, I hope the curious will not take it ill, that I make this ſmall digreſſion.</p>
                     <p>It is a hard matter to explicate well the effects I have now related, nevertheleſs I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to illuſtrate them a little, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy,</hi> which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, and do explicate nothing at all, but before I begin, we muſt remark ſeveral things.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that it is an eſſential point to quench the coal of Cork in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> that the viſible Ink may become black with it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the blackneſs of this Ink does proceed from the fuliginoſity or ſooty part of the coal of the Cork, which is exceeding porous and light, and that this fuliginoſity is nothing but an oil very much rarefied.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that the Impregnation of <hi>Saturn,</hi> which makes the inviſible Ink, is only a <hi>Lead</hi> diſſolved, and held up imperceptibly in an acid liquor, as I have ſaid, when I ſpoke of this metal.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that the firſt of theſe liquors is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the alkali and igneous parts of <hi>Quick-lime</hi> with the ſulphureous ſubſtance of <hi>Arſenick;</hi> for the <hi>Orpin</hi> is a ſort of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> as I ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>All this being granted, as no body can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably think otherwiſe, I now affirm, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the viſible Ink does diſappear, when the defacing liquor is rubbed upon it, is that this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48366:148"/>
conſiſting of an alkali ſalt, and parts that are oily and penetrating, this mixture does make a kind of ſoap, which is able to diſſolve any fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſubſtance, ſuch as burnt Cork, eſpecially when it has been already rarefied and diſpoſed for diſſolution by <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> after the ſame manner as common ſoap, which is compounded of oil, and an alkali ſalt, is able to take away or make diſappear ſpots made by greaſe.</p>
                     <p>But it may be demanded, why after the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution the blackneſs does diſappear.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that the fuliginous parts have been ſo divided, and lockt up in the ſulphureous alkali of the liquor, that they are become inviſible, and we ſee every day that very exact ſolutions do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the thing diſſolved imperceptible, and without colour.</p>
                     <p>The little alkali ſalt which is in the burnt Cork may alſo the better ſerve to joyn with the alkali of the <hi>quick-lime,</hi> and to help the diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>As for the inviſible Ink, it is eaſie to apprehend how that appears black, when the ſame liquor, which ſerves to deface the other, is uſed upon it. For whereas the impregnation of <hi>Saturn</hi> is only a <hi>Lead</hi> ſuſpended by the edges of the acid liquor, this <hi>Lead</hi> muſt needs revive, and reſume its black colour, when that which held it rarefied is intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed; ſo the alkali of <hi>Quick-lime</hi> being filled with the ſulphurs of <hi>Arſenick</hi> becomes very proper to break and deſtroy the acids, and to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinate together the particles of <hi>Lead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It happens then that the viſible Ink does diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by reaſon that the parts which did render it black, have been diſſolved, and the inviſible Ink
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48366:149"/>
does alſo appear, becauſe the diſſolved parts have been revived.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quick-lime</hi> and <hi>Orpiment</hi> being mixed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted together in water, do yield a ſmell much like that which happens when common ſulphur is boiled in a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of <hi>Tartar.</hi> This here is the ſtronger, becauſe the ſulphur of <hi>Arſenick</hi> is loaded with certain Salts that make a ſtronger impreſſion on the ſmell. <hi>Quick-lime</hi> is an alkali that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in this much like the Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> in the other Operation; you muſt not leave the matraſs open, becauſe the force of this water doth conſiſt in a Volatile. The <hi>Lime</hi> retains the more fixt part of the <hi>Arſenick,</hi> and the <hi>Sulphurs</hi> that come forth are ſo much the more ſubtile, as they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from what did fix them before, and this appears to be ſo, becauſe the Sulphurs muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity paſs through all the book to make a writing of a clear and inviſible liquor appear black and viſible: and to facilitate this penetration the book is ſtrook, and then turned about, becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or Volatile Sulphurs do always tend upwards: you muſt likewiſe clap it into a preſs, that theſe Sulphurs may not be diſperſed in the air. I have found, that if theſe circumſtances are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the buſineſs fails. Furthermore that which perſwades me that the Sulphurs do paſs through the book, and not take a circuit to ſlip in by the ſides, as many do imagine, is that after the book is taken out of the preſs, all the inſide is found to be ſcented with the ſmell of this liquor.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing more to be obſerved, which is, that the infuſion of <hi>Quick-lime</hi> and <hi>Orpin</hi> be newly made, becauſe otherwiſe it will not have
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48366:149"/>
force enough to penetrate. The three liquors ſhould be made in different places too; for if they ſhould approach near one another, they would be ſpoiled.</p>
                     <p>This laſt effect does likewiſe proceed from the defacing liquor; for becauſe upon the digeſtion of <hi>Quick-lime</hi> and <hi>Orpin,</hi> it is a thing impoſſible but ſome of the particles will exalt, ſtop the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel as cloſe as you will; the air impregnated with theſe little bodies does mix with, and alter the Inks, inſomuch that the viſible Ink does thereby become the leſs black, and the inviſible Ink does alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little blackneſs.</p>

                  <hi>FLints,</hi> as all other ſtones, are made by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Salts, or by acid liquors, which do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate and incorporate with earth, which is an alkali, ſo that from their mixture there does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult a <hi>Coagulum,</hi> which by little and little does harden by means of the ſubterranean heat, or elſe do petrifie by the cold. Now you muſt obſerve, that according to the quantity of earth which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters with this acid liquor, there are made ſuch different ſorts of ſtones. Thus precious ſtones and Cryſtals do obtain their hardneſs and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48366:150"/>
tranſparency, from a juſt proportion, ſuch as is needful to make an exact penetration, and a ſtrict union of the acid with the earth. There are found ſome waters in ſeveral places, which falling upon ſtones do ſoon petrifie, as particularly in a Grot at <hi>Arſi</hi> in <hi>Burgundy.</hi> The reaſon that may be given of this petrification, is that theſe waters do contain an acid, which in paſſing through earths do diſſolve ſome part of them, which is capable to make them petrifie, but the great agitation they are in whilſt they run with rapidity down moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, does hinder their coagulation; for that can never happen until theſe waters have fallen into ſome place fit for them to repoſe and lye ſtill in.</p>

                  <p>This operation ſhews the way to open the bodies of <hi>Flints</hi> and Cryſtal, ſo that thereby they may be eaſily reduced into a powder.</p>
                  <p>Heat red-hot ſome <hi>Flints</hi> in the fire, and quench them in water; repeat heating and quenching them three or four times, or until they are friable, and can be finely powdered; you muſt chuſe <hi>River-Flints,</hi> that are full of veins of ſeveral colours.</p>

                  <p>This operation is an exaltation of ſome parts of <hi>Flints,</hi> and ſalt of <hi>Tartar</hi> in ſpirit of wine.</p>
                  <p>Mix well four ounces of Calcined <hi>Flints</hi> finely powdered, with four and twenty ounces of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined <hi>Tartar:</hi> put this mixture into a large Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, cover it and place it in a wind-furnace, light a fire about it by little and little, to warm it gently, and then encreaſe it to the laſt degree. Continue it in this condition for five hours, that the matter may all the while remain in Fuſion. Thruſt a Spatule into it, and ſee if your matter begins to grow diaphanous like glaſs. If it doth ſo, pour it into a warm Iron mortar, and it will preſently congeal into a hard maſs, which you muſt powder while it is hot, and put into a matraſs very dry and hot: pour upon it Spirit of Wine Alcoholized, four fingers above the matter; ſtop your matraſs cloſe with another, whoſe neck may be received into that which contains the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Lute the conjunctions well with a wet blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſet it in ſand, give a fire under it that is ſtrong enough to make the Spirit of Wine ſimper for two days together, it will turn of a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; unlute your matraſſes, and ſeparating them a-ſunder, decant the <hi>Tincture</hi> into a bottle: put new Spirit of Wine to that which remains, and digeſt it as before, ſeparate the liquor that is turned red, and mingling it with the former, pour it all together into a glaſs body, and cover it with a head, fit to it a Receiver, and lute the junctures,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48366:151"/>
diſtil in a vaporous bath two thirds of the Spirit of Wine, that may ſerve for uſe as before, then take your veſſel off the fire, and keep that which remains in the bottom of the body, in a Viol well ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Tincture</hi> is ſaid to be a good remedy to open obſtructions; they uſe it for the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and in Hypochondriacal caſes: the doſe is from ten to thirty drops in ſome proper liquor.</p>

                     <p>When this liquor is mixed with an acid Spirit, an Ebullition preſently happens, from the acid Spirits piercing the alkali, and afterwards a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Coagulation is made, then when an acid Spirit is poured on the Oil of <hi>Tartar,</hi> becauſe this ſame alkali contains more earth than does the Salt of <hi>Tartar.</hi>

                     <p>This liquor may diſſolve ſome Sulphureous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that now and then happen, and then it provokes Urine; but if it meets with an acid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, it cauſes a Coagulation, that may turn into a ſtone: wherefore I would not adviſe any body to uſe this Remedy, no more than the former

               <p>Mix the <hi>Oil</hi> that remains in the Receiver with a ſufficient quantity of other <hi>Brick</hi> dried and powdered, and make a paſte of it, form ſeveral little pellets, and put them into a glaſs Retort; ſet the Retort in Sand, and fitting to it a large Receiver, and luting them together, give a fire by degrees to rectifie all the <hi>Oil,</hi> pour it into a Viol, and keep it for uſe; it is called the <hi>Oil of Philoſophers.</hi>

               <p>It is a good Remedy applyed outwardly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs the Tumours of the Spleen, for the Palſie, Phthiſick, and ſuffocations of the mother.

                  <p>This operation ſerves only to exalt the <hi>Oil of Olives,</hi> that being more opened by the fire, it may rarefie and diſſolve humours more eaſily; for you muſt not imagine that the <hi>Brick</hi> doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any great virtue, it is a dry body, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all active principles.</p>
                  <p>You muſt make a very moderate fire in this diſtillation, that the <hi>Oil</hi> may come forth in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours;

for if it ſhould come out drop by drop, it would not be ſo open, nor would it produce ſo good effects.</p>

There are of them of ſeveral colours, as the <hi>White,</hi> the <hi>Red,</hi> and the <hi>Black;</hi> now and then there are found ſome of two colours, as <hi>Red,</hi> and <hi>Black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Red</hi> is the moſt common, and moſt in uſe; it is choſen of a deep colour; the <hi>White</hi> is more rare than the <hi>Red.</hi> A certain white ſtone very ſpungy, that is like unto <hi>Coral,</hi> is brought among us, which is miſtaken for true <hi>white Coral</hi> by thoſe that don't know it, but the true is not at all ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; it is rather very compact, and as white as Ivory; <hi>Black Coral</hi> is the greateſt rarity of them all.</p>
               <p>If you put the branches of <hi>Red Coral</hi> to infuſe a day or two in melted white Wax, upon hot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the <hi>Coral</hi> will loſe its former colour, and become white, and the wax will aſſume a yellow colour.

               <p>If you ſhould put other <hi>red Coral</hi> to ſteep in the ſame Wax, it would turn brown.</p>
               <p>If again the third time you ſhould put <hi>red Coral</hi> to ſteep in the ſame wax, the wax would then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come red.</p>
               <p>The wax diſſolves a little of the bituminous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is upon the <hi>Coral,</hi> and which did render it red: this operation is done only for curioſity.</p>
               <p>Many perſons do hang <hi>red Coral</hi> about the neck, in order to ſtop Haemorrhagies, to purifie the bloud, and to fortifie the heart. I believe that which gave occaſion to think it has ſuch excellent virtues, was its Red colour, which is like to that of the bloud, and the heart; but experience does no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that outwardly applied, it has any ſuch effects.</p>

                        <hi>Red Coral</hi> is generally uſed, becauſe it is thought to have more virtue than the reſt, by reaſon of its Tincture.</p>
                     <p>The efferveſcency which happens, when <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> doth penetrate <hi>Coral,</hi> is reckoned among cold efferveſcencies, if there be any ſuch; for my part, I cannot ſay that I ever perceived any coldneſs in it. In truth it is very ſtrange, that ſo great an Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, or motion of the parts, ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any ſenſible heat, but you muſt conſider, that <hi>Coral,</hi> having large pores, may be eaſily diſſolved, and ſo the acids need not joſtle it very much, which would be requiſite to produce any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able heat.</p>
                     <p>Some do uſe in this operation the acid Lotion of <hi>Butter of Antimony,</hi> or pure <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Vinegar;</hi> but becauſe theſe ſpirits do leave too great an acidity in the Preparations of <hi>Coral,</hi> I conceive it better to uſe diſtilled <hi>Vinegar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Coral</hi> being an alkali, the acid points do ſtick in it, and ſuſpending its parts, do render them imperceptible; and this is the reaſon that the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> doth loſe all its acidity, becauſe the acidity did only conſiſt in the activity of its points, which do now ſheath themſelves in the alkali.</p>
                     <p>If you would, by way of curioſity, diſtil this diſſolution, inſtead of Evaporating it, as I have
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48366:155"/>
ſaid, you'd gain nothing but an inſipid water, becauſe the acid is fixt with the <hi>Coral.</hi> This water is evaporated away, becauſe it would ſerve for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and would only weaken the impregnation.</p>
                     <p>The diſſolution of Perle, Crabs-eyes, burnt Harts-horn, and all other alkali matters, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed after the ſame manner; their <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Magiſteries</hi> may be likewiſe made as thoſe of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> which I am going to deſcribe.</p>
                     <p>It is here remarkable, that the ſolution of this ſort of alkalies in diſtilled <hi>Vinegar,</hi> ſmells much like ſpirit of Wine, and that ſome quantity of it may be drawn, with a very gentle fire; the reaſon of it is, that in the making of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> the acids had in a manner fixed this ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Spirit, but when they do enter into the pores of <hi>Coral,</hi> they are forced to quit it, and ſo let it recover its volatility.</p>

                     <p>The liquor of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which is an alkali ſalt diſſolved, encountring the acid, makes it let go the particles of <hi>Coral</hi> that it held ſuſpended, and ſo they precipitate by their own weight; this precipitate is nothing elſe but a <hi>Coral</hi> finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by means of acids, which do eaſily divide into abundance of parts things that otherwiſe would ſeem indiviſible. But you muſt obſerve here, that theſe preparations, inſtead of rendring <hi>Coral</hi> more effectual as is pretended, do indeed render it almoſt good for nothing; which is a thing eaſie enough to prove, if we conſider that <hi>Coral</hi> works in our bodies by nothing elſe but by abſorbing acids, or ſharp and ſalt humours which do continually occaſion divers diſeaſes; for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it ſtops <hi>Haemorrhagies</hi> only by ſweetning the keen ſalts which corroded the membranes of the veins, or elſe raiſed great efferveſcencies in the bloud, ſo as to make it extravaſate; it ſtops <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rheas,</hi> by deſtroying the acrimony of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or other humors; laſtly, if it cures the falling down of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula,</hi> and does remedy many other accidents, it is done by nothing elſe, but by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force of the ferments which do cauſe them, after the ſame manner as it deſtroys the acidity of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48366:156"/>
Vinegar, or ſome other liquor; this being ſo, as there is great reaſon to believe it, it were far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take <hi>Coral</hi> without any other preparation than that which is made on the marble, then to diſſolve it by an acid, and precipitate it into a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery;</hi> for the acid or ſharp humors that this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery</hi> is to encounter in our bodies, finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the medicine that is able to blunt their edges, will continue their former activity, and ſo no effect at all will follow.</p>
                     <p>In this Precipitation there does not appear any efferveſcency, becauſe the edges of the Vinegar being broken, it has neither ſtrength nor motion enough left to penetrate and to ſeparate the parts of ſalt of <hi>Tartar;</hi> but if the diſſolution of <hi>Coral</hi> had been made with ſome ſtronger diſſolvent than Vinegar, ſuch as Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> there would be an ebullition in the time of the Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe there would remain ſtill action enough to the broken edges of that ſpirit, for to enter into the pores of the alkali ſalt, and to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refie it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of Common Salt.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are three ſorts of <hi>Common Salt,</hi> the <hi>Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile Salt,</hi> the <hi>Fountain Salt,</hi> and the <hi>Sea Salt;</hi> the firſt is called <hi>Sal Gemme,</hi> by reaſon of its tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency and ſmoothneſs, like to a precious ſtone; it is that of which whole mountains are found full in <hi>Poland,</hi> and other places; the ſecond is drawn by evaporation of the waters of ſome Fountains, and the laſt from Sea-water by Cryſtallization or Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration: theſe three ſalts are of the ſame nature,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48366:157"/>
and have almoſt the ſame effect; they are uſed, not only in Aliments, but ſometimes in Remedies too, ſuch as Clyſters, when they ſhould be made very Carminative.</p>
               <p>It is here obſervable, that <hi>Sal Gemme</hi> is a little more penetrating than <hi>Sea ſalt,</hi> that is drawn by Cryſtallization, and that the <hi>Sea ſalt</hi> which is drawn by Cryſtallization is more penetrating than that which is made by Evaporation of the waters.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that may be given for the piercing quality of <hi>Sal Gemme</hi> is this, that having never been diſſolved in water, it never loſt any of its keenneſs, whereas the others do loſe their more ſubtle edges in the waters, and this chiefly when thoſe waters are in ſtrong agitation, as are thoſe of the Sea.</p>
               <p>It is very probable, that the violent Vomiting which does ſo much annoy thoſe who take a voyage to Sea, does proceed from theſe ſame ſubtile parts of ſalt, which being volatilized do fill the ſea-air; for this vomiting does happen only to ſuch who have not been uſed to breath a ſalt air, and who beſides are ſufficiently ſhook by the motion of the Sea.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sea ſalt</hi> which is made in <hi>Normandy</hi> by evaporation of Sea-water over the fire, is not ſo ſtrong as that which is made at <hi>Rochell</hi> by Cryſtalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, becauſe in the evaporation many of the ſubtler parts of the Salt are loſt, and a mark of that is, that if Sea-water is diſtilled over a fire <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ever ſo ſmall, it will not fail to carry with it ſome volatilized ſalt, which will alter its virtue, as experience hath teſtified ſeveral times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:48366:157"/>But it doth not happen thus to Sea-ſalt Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, for it fixes of it ſelf, when the Salt-waters have ſetled for ſome time in places fit for their reception.</p>
               <p>I have delivered my thoughts ſufficiently touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Origine of theſe three ſorts of Salt, in the Remarks I made on the principles, wherefore there's no need of repeating what I then ſaid.</p>
               <p>Sea-ſalt is made at <hi>Rochell</hi> in ſalt marſhes, which are places that muſt be of a lower ſituation than the ſea, and the ground muſt be Clayie, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would not be able to retain the ſalt-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that has been let into them. Thus all places near the ſea are not alike proper to make ſalt marſhes.</p>
               <p>When the Seaſon of the year begins to grow hot, which commonly happens in <hi>May,</hi> all the water is emptied that was let into the marſhes for the better preſerving them during the winter, then the ſluces are opened to let in as much ſalt-water as they think fit, it is made to paſs through a great many different Channels, wherein it puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and heats, and then is let into places that are made flat, ſmooth and fit to Cryſtallize the ſalt.</p>
               <p>The ſalt is made only during the great heats of Summer, the Sun does firſt evaporate ſome part of the water, and becauſe after the great heat, a ſmall wind does uſe to blow (as is uſual near the ſea) the coolneſs of this wind does condenſe and Cryſtallize the ſalt.</p>
               <p>But if it happens to rain but two hours during the hot weather, there can no ſalt be made for a fortnight afterwards, becauſe the marſhes muſt be again emptied of all the water, to let in more in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48366:158"/>
its place, ſo that if it chances to rain but once again in the next fortnight, they can make no ſalt.</p>
               <p>Salt is purified, by diſſolving it in water, then filtrating the ſolution through brown paper, and afterwards evaporating the water in an earthen pan, until a very white ſalt does remain.</p>
               <p>But beſides the purification of ſalt by evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be further purified, if inſtead of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of the humidity, you ſet ſome of it a Cryſtallizing in a cool place, for very pure ſalt is found at bottom of the veſſel, which ſalt may be ſeparated from the water, and dried, and you may then evaporate again ſome part of the ſalt liquor, and ſet it in a Celler a Cryſtallizing, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue your evaporations and Cryſtallizations; but at laſt you muſt be fain to evaporate all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, becauſe at laſt it will Cryſtallize no longer, the reaſon whereof is, that the remaining ſalt is full of a fat bituminous matter, which is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner inſeparable from it, and this it is that hinders the Cryſtallizing at laſt.</p>
               <p>It is probable that this fat matter may come from the earth of thoſe marſhes that were ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The firſt Cryſtallized ſalt being put into <hi>Oil of Tartar,</hi> or ſome other alkali ſalt diſſolved, does mix with it without making any Ebullition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe although ſea ſalt is acid, yet its points are too groſs, and have too little motion, to ſeparate the parts of the alkali.</p>
               <p>The laſt ſalt being dried over the fire, and mixed with ſome alkali ſalt rendred liquid, ſuch as <hi>Oil of Tartar,</hi> makes a Coagulation and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of a ſubſtance that appears ſaline and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48366:158"/>
oily; this Coagulation does proceed from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and adheſion of ſome Bituminous earth with the ſea-ſalt and the Tartar; for the ſalts do eaſily unite with oily ſubſtances, and in them loſe their activity.</p>
               <p>Many acid Bituminous ſalts which are drawn by the Evaporation of certain Mineral waters, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Baleruc</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Digne</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> do perform the ſame effects, when they are mixed with <hi>Oil of Tartar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Coagulum</hi> does not diſſolve in water, as well by reaſon of the different nature of the ſalts it is compounded of, as the oily earth that holds them together; but it will diſſolve in diſtilled <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and ſeveral other acid liquors, and then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens an efferveſcency, becauſe the acid does pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the ſalt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> whoſe parts the ſea-ſalt had no power to ſeparate.</p>

                  <head>Calcination of Common Salt.</head>
                  <p>Heat a pot, that's unglazed, red-hot; throw into it about an ounce of ſea-ſalt, then cover it, and it will crackle, and ſo fall into powder: this noiſe is called <hi>Decrepitation:</hi> when it is over, put ſo much more ſalt into the pot, and continue to do ſo, till you have enough. The pot muſt be ſure to be red-hot all the while: when the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is over, take the pot out of the fire, and when it is cold, put the ſalt into a bottle, and ſtop it well, to hinder the air from entring in to moiſten it anew. Bags full of it are applied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the neck warm, (to conſume too great a
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48366:159"/>
a moiſture of the Brain) by opening of the pores. It is uſed likewiſe in ſeveral Chymical operations.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>That which makes the Salt crackle, when it is in the fire, is an inwardly contained moiſture, which upon its being rarefied doth force its way out with impetuoſity, and finding the pores too cloſely ſhut to ſuffer an eaſie eſcape, doth break through the parts and open a paſſage. Now every thing elſe that hath cloſe compact pores, will make ſuch a noiſe too in the Calcination, as do glaſs and ſhells.</p>
                     <p>If you have occaſion to uſe Salt decrepitated, it is convenient to have it newly Calcined, becauſe the moiſture of the air does return again what the fire had driven away. But if you would keep it any time, let it be in a glaſs bottle well ſtopt.</p>
                     <p>For as much as this Salt is deprived of all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity by its Calcination, it will abſorb ſeroſities much better than common ſalt. It is laid hot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the neck, to the end that opening the pores it may facilitate tranſpiration. A little Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> may be mixed with it, to render it the more active.</p>

                  <head>Spirit of Salt.</head>
                  <p>This Spirit is a very acid liquor, drawn from Salt by diſtillation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:48366:159"/>Dry <hi>Salt</hi> over a little fire, or elſe in the Sun, then powder finely two pounds of it, mix it well with ſix pounds of Potters earth powdered, make up a hard paſte of this mixture with as much rain-water as is needful, form out of it little pellets of the bigneſs of a Nut, and ſet them in the Sun a good while a drying; when they are perfectly dry, put them into a large earthen Retort, or glaſs one luted, whereof a third part remains empty; place this Retort in a Reverberatory Furnace, and fit to it a large capacious Receiver, without luting the junctures, give a very moderate heat at firſt to warm the Retort, and make an inſipid water come forth drop by drop; when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome white clouds ſucceed theſe drops, pour out that which is in the Receiver, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted it, lute the junctures cloſe; encreaſe the fire by degrees to the laſt degree of all, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it in this condition twelve or fifteen hours; all this while the Receiver will be hot, and full of white clouds, but when it grows cold, and the clouds do diſappear, the Operation is at an end; unlute the junctures, and you'l find the <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> in the Receiver, pour it into an earthen, or glaſs bottle, and ſtop it well with wax: it is an Aperitive, and is uſed in Juleps to an agreeable acidity for ſuch as are ſubject to the Gravel. It is likewiſe uſed for cleanſing the Teeth, being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with a little water, and to conſume the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs of bones.</p>
                  <p>To make the dulcified <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> of <hi>Baſilius Valentinus,</hi> you muſt mix equal parts of <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> and Wine, and ſet them in digeſtion two or three days in a double Veſſel, in a gentle ſand-heat.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48366:160"/>
It is eſteemed better than t'other to be taken inwardly, becauſe it is leſs Corroſive, being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> the doſe is from four to twelve drops in ſome liquor appropriate to the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Potters earth, is mixed with the Salt, to divide it into particles, that the fire may the more eaſily be able to rarefie it; for the parts which Salt conſiſts of are ſo ſtrictly united, that the utmoſt force of fire is not able to diſengage them, until they are ſeparated by ſome <hi>Interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The preparation that I give unto Salt, before it is put into the Retort, is longer than the common ſort; but I have obſerved, that the Spirit comes forth with leſs difficulty, when the matter is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared according to this form.</p>
                     <p>You muſt leave a vacuity in the Retort, and fit to it a large Receiver, for giving liberty to the ſpirit to circulate before it diſſolves, otherwiſe it would break them both. Likewiſe the fire muſt be encreaſed by little and little, becauſe the firſt Spirits do break out with a mighty violence, when they are driven too hard.</p>
                     <p>Some ways of drawing the <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out addition have been much ſought after, but that is not yet well diſcovered. It is true indeed, <hi>Monſieur Seignette,</hi> an Apothecary of <hi>Rochell,</hi> among other excellent diſcoveries that he hath made on Salts, to the knowledge of which he hath
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48366:160"/>
particularly applied himſelf, brought me hither a ſea-ſalt in the year 1672, that we diſtilled without addition of any thing elſe, by a very moderate fire, and in two hours time we drew three ounces and a half of very good Spirit, out of ſix ounces of ſalt, that we put into the Retort. After this we broke the Retort, and having powdered the Salt that remained in it to the weight of two ounces and a half, we expoſed it to the air in a pan for a fortnight, and we found it reimpreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Spirits; we diſtilled it once more, and with the ſame eaſe as before, we drew half its weight in Spirit, of the ſame force as the former. The matter remaining in the Retort being again expoſed to the air recovered new Spirits. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Seignette</hi> did aſſure me, that he had thus drawn Spirit from the ſame matter nine ſeveral times; which is a thing worth our admiration, and ſhews us very well that the air contains a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which forms divers things according to the different diſpoſition of the ſubjects that it enters into. This ſalt is particular to him that ſhewed it me, and he prepares it himſelf ſome way that he is unwilling to diſcover.</p>
                     <p>Since I writ of <hi>Monſieur Seignette</hi>'s particular way of drawing <hi>ſpirit of ſalt,</hi> ſome have Printed, that if common ſalt well decrepitated, and kept a good while over the fire, were expoſed to the air for ſome dayes, and diſtilled without addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing to it, it would yield a ſpirit much like that I have ſpoken of, and in full as great a quantity.</p>
                     <p>But if we examine the ſharp liquor which is drawn this way, we ſhall find it of ſo weak a nature,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48366:161"/>
that it may more reaſonably be called phlegm, than ſpirit, and the ſalt remains entire in the Retort; whereas M. <hi>Seignette</hi>'s ſpirit of ſalt is full as ſtrong as common ſpirit of ſalt, and has the very ſame qualities, nay I conceive it ſomewhat better, as not having ſo great an impreſſion from fire as the other.</p>
                     <p>Again ſome ſay, it does not deſerve the name of ſpirit of ſea-ſalt, nor ought this preparation to be look't upon as any great myſtery, becauſe the ſame incorporation and augmentation happens to divers other ſalts expoſed to the air, after drawing off their ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>I grant this augmentation proceeds from the ſpirit of the air, and I conceive it is the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which produces all manner of things according to the Matrixes, or different pores of the earth it uſes to meet with, as I have explicated in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the Principles. But becauſe this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the air has met with pores in our matter, ready diſpoſed to make a ſalt much like unto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalt, and a ſpirit is drawn from it much like unto that which is drawn from common ſalt, I ſee no reaſon to doubt why this ſpirit ſhould not be a true ſpirit of ſalt; all the difference is this, the ſalt I now ſpeak of is not ſo throughly united to its earthy part, as common ſalt is, and therefore its ſpirits do ſeparate with more eaſe; for they are drawn without addition of any thing elſe, and with a gentle fire, whereas thoſe of common ſalt are ſo fixt, that they can't be driven out, without mixing a great deal of earth in order to ſeparate all its parts, and without a very great fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:48366:161"/>As for the augmentation which happens to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other bodies expoſed to the air, after their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are drawn off, I don't queſtion the matter of fact, nor that theſe ſame ſubſtances do return into what they were before, by impregnating again with ſpirits of the air in ſome conſiderable time; but it is rarely found that any of them do yield ſo ſtrong ſpirits, and ſo eaſily as our ſalt, and herein lies the myſtery.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable that the acids which are drawn by ſo violent a fire do very much differ from thoſe that are made naturally, ſuch as the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars of Beer, Wine, Cider, the acid of Citron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Spirit of ſalt</hi> among others hath ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar difference from the reſt, becauſe it will preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate that which <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> hath diſſolved. This acid, according as may be judged by its effects, is compounded of ſtronger, and more weighty points than the reſt, but they are not ſo ſharp and piercing. And this is the reaſon that it jogs ſo effectually thoſe of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> loaded with ſome bodies they have diſſolved, and that ſhaking them about it makes them let go their hold.</p>
                     <p>Some have writ, that this precipitation muſt not be imputed either to the weight, or the ſtrength, no more than to the agitation, which ſpirit of ſalt may have given to the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or to matters diſſolved, but rather to the conjunction of the acidity of this ſpirit with the volatile and ſulphureous alkali of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which does by that means conſtrain this laſt to abandon the metal which it had diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>But this is the way to explicate, as they ſay, one obſcure thing by another that is much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48366:162"/>
for what likelihood is there that the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſpirit of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is an alkali? and pray how comes it to remain in ſo great a motion with the fixed acid ſpirit of this ſame water without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying or loſing its nature, this is a thing that can never be conceived very eaſily. But further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſuppoſing this ſpirit were an alkali, it would be ſtill neceſſary to explicate mechanically, for what reaſon this alkali does quit the body of the metal to betake itſelf to the Spirit of ſalt; for to ſay meerly that by the conjunction of theſe two ſpirits the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is compelled to abandon the metal that it had diſſolved, is nothing at all to the clearing of the queſtion, unleſs a man will needs give an intelligence to theſe ſpirits. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſtill have recourſe to the agitation and joſtles, for the true reaſon.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo remarkable, that the efferveſcency which happens when <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> is caſt into the ſolution of ſome bodies by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that which happens when ſome alkali is caſt into it, the former being much more gentle than the latter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> diſſolves leaf gold, which <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is not able to do.</p>
                     <p>When this <hi>Spirit</hi> is dulcified, it is mixed with Spirit of Wine, which being a Sulphur doth take off the edges of the acid, and in part hinders their motion; whence it comes to paſs that this Spirit is milder by this addition, than if water had been uſed inſtead of Spirit of Wine.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> may be made with Salt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitated, after the ſame manner.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of Niter or Salt-peter.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is probable that the <hi>Niter</hi> of the antients was either the <hi>Aegyptian Natron,</hi> or a ſalt that is found in the earth in a gray compact maſs, or elſe the natural <hi>Borax,</hi> or the ſalt which is drawn from the water of the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> and many other rivers. And it may be, that all theſe ſalts are divers kinds of their <hi>Niter,</hi> but the <hi>Niter</hi> of the moderns is nothing elſe but Salt-peter, and this is that of which I intend to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Niter</hi> is a Salt impregnated with abundance of Spirits out of the air which do render it volatile; it is taken from among the ſtones and earths of old ruined buildings. Some of it is likewiſe to be found in Cellars, and ſeveral other moiſt places, becauſe the air doth condenſe it in thoſe places, and eaſily unites with the ſtones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is alſo ſometimes made by the Urine of Animals, falling upon ſtones and earths. Nay ſome have thought that all <hi>Salt-peter</hi> comes from that cauſe, whereas we ſee every day that ſome of it is taken out of places, where there never came any Urine at all. This ſalt is half volatile, and half like unto <hi>Sal Gemme</hi> as I ſhall prove here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>The great and violent flame which happens ſo ſoon as <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is flung upon the coals, and the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48366:163"/>
red vapours which it uſes to yield when reduced into a ſpirit, have induced the Chymiſts generally to believe that this ſalt is inflammable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently fully loaded with Sulphur, becauſe Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is the only Principle that flames; but if they had ſuſpended their judgments herein, until they had got more experience on this Subject, they would not only have known that <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is not at all inflammable in its nature, but they would e'en have doubted whether or no any Sulphur does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the natural compoſition of this ſalt; for if <hi>Salt-peter</hi> were inflammable of it ſelf like Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, it would burn where there is no Sulphur, for example in a Crucible heated red-hot in the fire; but it will never flame therein, uſe what quantity of it you pleaſe, and let the fire be never ſo great. It is true indeeed, if you throw <hi>Salt-peter</hi> upon kindled coals, it makes a great flame, but this is only through the ſulphureous Fuligino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the coals, which are violently raiſed and rarefied by the volatile nature of <hi>Niter,</hi> as I ſhall prove in the Operation upon fixt <hi>Niter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for any Sulphur that is thought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> it can't be demonſtrated by any Operation whatever, for the red vapours that come from it are no more inflammable than the <hi>Niter,</hi> when they are not mixt with ſome Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous matter; and it is far more probable, that this ſalt contains no Sulphur, if we conſider its cleanneſs, tranſparency, acidity, and cooling qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which have no manner of affinity with the effects of Sulphur, which are commonly to make a body <hi>opake,</hi> to take off acidity, and to heat.</p>

                  <head>Purification of Salt-peter.</head>
                  <p>To purifie <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is to deprive it of part of its fixt ſalt, and of a little bituminous earth, which it contains.</p>
                  <p>Diſſolve ten or twelve pounds of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> in a ſufficient quantity of water, let the diſſolution ſettle, and filtrate it, then evaporate it in a glaſs or earthen veſſel, to the diminution of half, or until there begins to appear a little skin upon it; then remove your veſſel into a cool place, ſtirring it as little as may be, and leave it there till the morrow, you'l find Cryſtals which you muſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the liquor; evaporate this liquor again to a skin, and ſet the veſſel in a cool place, to get new Cryſtals; repeat the evaporations, and Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallizations, until you have drawn all your <hi>Salt-peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note that in the laſt Cryſtallizations, you'l have a Salt altogether like unto ſea-ſalt, or <hi>Sal Gemme,</hi> keep it apart, it may ſerve to ſeaſon meat with.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Cryſtals are the pure <hi>Salt-peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may, if you pleaſe, diſſolve and purifie <hi>Salt-peter</hi> ſeveral other times in water, obſerving every time what I ſaid before, for to render it more white, and purifie it from its Sea-ſalt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salt-peter</hi> purified is a great aperitive, it cools the body by fixing the humours that are in too much motion, and drives them by Urine. It is given in Feavers, in <hi>Gonorrheas,</hi> and many other diſeaſes; the doſe is from ten grains to a drachm in Broth, or ſome appropriate liquor.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:48366:164"/>
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The firſt Purification that is given to <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is this: the ſtones and earths that contain it are groſly powdered; they are boiled in a great deal of water, to diſſolve the <hi>Salt-peter:</hi> the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is filtred, and then poured upon aſhes, to make a <hi>Lixivium;</hi> after it hath been poured upon the aſhes ſeveral times, it is evaporated and Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized.</p>
                     <p>The ſalt of the aſhes which does mix with the <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> increaſes its fixt part; but that which is made without aſhes is the better to make <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> with.</p>
                     <p>The earth from whence <hi>Salt-peter</hi> hath been drawn, being ſet in the open air, and ſtirred about from time to time, doth re-impregnate with a kind of Salt.</p>
                     <p>The long Cryſtals that we ſee <hi>Salt-peter</hi> ſhoot into, do proceed from its volatile part, for that which is Cryſtallized laſt, is fixt like ſea-ſalt, and looks juſt like it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Salt-peter</hi> can never be purified ſo well, but it will ſtill contain a ſalt like unto <hi>Sal Gemme,</hi> or ſea-ſalt, but in leſs quantity than before.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is boiled a long time in water, and over a great fire, ſome part of the Spirits do fly away, and there remains at laſt nothing but a ſalt like unto ſea-ſalt, or <hi>Sal Gemme,</hi> which ſerves to prove that <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is only a <hi>Sal Gemme</hi> fuller of Spirits than the other, as I ſaid ſpeaking of the Principles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:48366:164"/>When you would Cryſtallize a Salt, you muſt diſſolve it in a convenient proportion of water; for if there ſhould be too much, the ſalt would be weakned too much, and not able to coagulate; and if on the contrary there ſhould be too little, the Cryſtals would be confuſed. Therefore to make them fair, you muſt take your veſſel off the fire, when you perceive a little skin upon the liquor, which is a mark to ſhew that there remains a little leſs liquor than is convenient to keep all the ſalt diſſolved, and thus when it comes to be ſet in a cool place, it will not fail to fix.</p>
                     <p>Acid ſalts, and among them the volatile, do Cryſtallize in much leſs time than others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Salt-peter</hi> cools the body, by reaſon that being an acid it depreſſes the humours, which by their too great motion did heat the body, and ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates them by Urine; for the volatile ſalts and ſulphurs, that all bodies are full of, are eaſily fixed and quieted by acids.</p>
                  </div>

                  <head>Cryſtal Mineral, called <hi>Sal Prunellae.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>This operation is a <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> from which ſome of the volatile part hath been ſeparated, by the means of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and fire.</p>
                  <p>Bruiſe two and thirty ounces of Purified <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and put it into a Crucible, which you muſt ſet in a furnace among burning coals. When the <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is melted, throw into it an ounce of flower of Sulphur, a ſpoonful at a time, the matter will preſently flame, and the more volatile ſpirits of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> fly away: when the flame is over,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48366:165"/>
the matter will remain in a very clear fuſion. Take the Crucible out with a pair of tongs, and turn it upſide down into a braſs baſon, very clean, and a little warmed before-hand, to dry up the moiſture that might be upon it; ſhake about the baſon to ſpread the matter while it is cooling, and this is called <hi>Sal Prunellae.</hi> If you deſire to have it very pure, you muſt diſſolve it in a ſufficient quantity of water, filtrate the diſſolution, and cryſtallize it, as I have ſaid in the Purification of <hi>Salt-peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is accounted better than purified <hi>Salt-peter</hi> for Phyſical uſes, becauſe the Sulphur is thought to have corrected it. It is given to cool, and to work by Urine, in burning Feavers, in Quinſeys, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrheas, and other diſeaſes, that proceed from heat, and obſtruction: the doſe is from ten grains to a drachm in Broth, or ſome other liquor appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to the diſtemper.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>This Preparation is called <hi>Sal,</hi> or <hi>Lapis prunellae,</hi> either becauſe the eſſential ſalt which is drawn from <hi>prunella</hi> or <hi>Self heal</hi> hath, near upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſame virtue and figure as <hi>Cryſtal Mineral,</hi> or elſe becauſe it is given in hot Feavers, whoſe heat is compared to that of a burning coal called <hi>Pruna.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> do give it the form of a <hi>Sloe,</hi> after having coloured it red with Roſes.</p>
                     <p>The Antients have thought it neceſſary to throw <hi>Flowers of Sulphur</hi> on melted <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> to the end it might be made the more Aperitive; but thereby it is deprived of the more opening ſpirits
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48366:165"/>
which the <hi>Sulphur</hi> carries away along with it; thus inſtead of rendring it more open, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, the better part of it is loſt.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſie to perceive that this abuſe is one of thoſe that hath inſenſibly gained upon men, and diminiſhes very much from the benefits that might be received from Chymical Phyſick, for want of applying themſelves to examine well the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent parts of natural things, before propoſing of correctives. I ſhall rather adviſe them to uſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple purified <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> or purified from its fixt ſalt three or four ſeveral times, ſo as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and I am confident, after the experience that I have often made of it, that it will better ſatisfie the intenſions of thoſe who uſe it, than when it ſhall have been prepared with <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The diminution which is made of the <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> is not only of the volatile parts which are carried off with the Sulphur, but it is likewiſe of the watry part which this ſalt does always contain, and which does hereby evaporate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cryſtal Mineral</hi> is often counterfeited, by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Roche-alom</hi> with it during the fuſion, and if thoſe men do uſe a <hi>Salt-peter</hi> that is not very pure, this Alom does ſerve to purifie it, by cauſing a thick ſcum to ſeparate to the ſides of the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo the <hi>Cryſtal Mineral</hi> becomes much the whiter.</p>
                     <p>This adulteration may be known, in that the <hi>Cryſtal Mineral</hi> made this way is more glittering than the other, and it is the Alom which gives it this colour.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who carry about this <hi>Cryſtal Mineral</hi> to the ſhops do eaſily enough vend it for its outward
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48366:166"/>
excellency, and for the cheapneſs they ſell it at; for Alom coſts but little, but this ſort wants a great deal of having ſo good effects as the other.</p>

                  <p>This operation is a <hi>Salt-peter</hi> fixed by Sulphur, and by fire.</p>
                  <p>Powder and mix equal parts of <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and common Sulphur, throw about an ounce of this mixture into a good Crucible, which you ſhall have heated red-hot before-hand, there will riſe a great flame, which being over, throw into it as much more of the matter, and continue to do ſo, until all your mixture is uſed. Let the fire continue four or five hours, ſo as to keep the Crucible all the while red-hot, then pour out the matter into a copper well dried by the fire, and when it is cold, powder it and diſſolve it in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water; filtrate the diſſolution, and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it in an earthen pan or a glaſs veſſel, in ſand until it is dry. You muſt fling away as inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant that which remains in the filter.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Salt</hi> be not altogether ſo white, as we would have it, it is becauſe it ſtill retains ſome Sulphur; therefore you muſt calcine it in a ſtrong fire in a Crucible, ſtirring it about with a Spatule three or four hours, or until it becomes very white; then repeat your diſſolution in water, your filtration and evaporation; thus you have a <hi>Sal Polychreſtum</hi> exceeding pure.</p>

half a drachm to ſix drachms in ſome proper li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>Salt</hi> is properly a <hi>Salt-peter</hi> diveſted of its volatile part by <hi>Sulphur,</hi> it is called <hi>Polychreſtum</hi> from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that is to ſay, good for ſeveral uſes, becauſe it is uſed not only to purge by ſtool, but by urine too, being taken to the weight of one or two drachms in a quart of water in the morning like a Mineral water. It is commonly uſed in Infuſions of <hi>Senna</hi> from one ſcruple to four, as well to increaſe the ſtrength of the Purgative, as to draw out more ſtrongly the <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Senna.</hi> Some do give it to ſix drachms in a pint or a quart of water, to purge ſtrongly; but I would not adviſe any body to uſe this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative all alone, by reaſon of the vellications that it gives in paſſing through the ſtomach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sal Polychreſtum</hi> muſt by no means be uſed until it is made very white, and very pure; for when there remains any groſs portion of Sulphur, it is apt to cauſe <hi>Vertigoes,</hi> ſtupefaction of the Nerves, and nauſeouſneſs of the ſtomach.</p>
                     <p>If you uſed ſixteen ounces of purified <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and ſo much ſulphur in this operation, you'l have at laſt but three ounces and a half of <hi>Sal Polychre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum</hi> very fine; but if you uſe common <hi>Salt-peter</hi> inſtead of purified, you'l have five ounces of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreſtum</hi> as white as the other.</p>
                     <p>This difference of weight proceeds from common <hi>Salt-peters</hi> containing more fixt ſalt than purified <hi>Salt-peter.</hi>

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48366:167"/>
forth, which will diſtil out drop by drop. When you perceive there will diſtil no more, throw the Phlegm away that is found in the Receiver, and having refitted it, lute the junctures, and encreaſe the fire by little and little to the ſecond degree, there will come forth Spirits, which will fill the Receiver with white clouds; then keep the fire two hours in the ſame degree, after that encreaſe it to the greateſt violence you can give it, and ſo the vapours will come red; continue the greateſt fire till there come no more, the operation will be ended in fourteen hours. When the veſſels are cold, unlute the junctures, and pour your <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> into an earthen bottle, which you muſt ſtop with Wax.</p>

                     <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> is uſed for the diſſolution of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, it is the beſt <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> that is; and the corroſive virtue of other waters of this nature doth chiefly proceed from the <hi>Niter</hi> that enters into their compoſition.</p>

                     <p>I have boiled ſeveral times in water a good while, the earth that remained after the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> and after evaporation of the filtrated decoction, I could find no ſalt at bottom.</p>
                     <p>I have likewiſe obſerved, that out of two pounds of purified <hi>Niter,</hi> a pound and fourteen ounces of liquor, in Phlegm and Spirit may be drawn.</p>
                     <p>A third part of the Retort, wherein the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is performed, muſt remain empty, and the Receiver muſt be very large; for otherwiſe theſe Spirits coming haſtily forth would break all to pieces for room to move in.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>You muſt leave the Bolthead open; for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours would either carry away the ſtopple, if there were one, or elſe they would break the veſſel; the Bolt-head is ſo hot during the ebullition, that one can't endure ones hand upon it.</p>
                     <p>The heat and ebullition begins ſooner or later, according as the Spirits that are uſed have been more or leſs dephlegmated; or elſe according as the ſeaſon, in which it is made, is either hotter or colder, for in the winter you muſt warm the liquor in a gentle ſand-heat, and when it grows a little hot, you muſt take it off, and ſhake it, thus it will come to boil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:48366:169"/>This effect is very ſtrange, for ſpirit of Niter being a ſtrong acid, and ſpirit of Wine a ſulphur, it can't be ſaid that there is here any alkali, to cauſe the ebullition with acid, according to the common maxim. And this operation ſhews us that every thing can't be explicated by the ſole Principles of acid and alkali, as ſome do pretend.</p>
                     <p>This operation has much reſemblance with that which happens when oil of Turpentine is put into a bottle with oil of Vitriol; for the mixture of theſe liquors does heat and boil much alike. I ſhall ſay ſomething of this laſt mixture hereafter. There is this difference notwithſtanding, that ſpirit of Niter being more volatile than oil of Vitriol, cauſes a greater efferveſcency.</p>
                     <p>In order therefore to explicate this ebullition, two things muſt be conſidered. Firſt, that ſpirit of Niter contains a great many fiery parts lock't up in its acidity, but which do ſtill retain ſome evident motion, for it is they that make the ſpirit of Niter to Fume as it does.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, that ſpirit of Niter is more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable than <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> when mixed with any ſulphureous body, and the reaſon thereof is, that it is more rarefied than <hi>ſalt-peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus when this acid ſpirit is mixt with ſpirit of Wine, which is a ſulphur very much exalted, and very ſuſceptible of motion, the volatile part of the ſpirit of Niter joyns itſelf to this ſulphur, and the mixture becomes very ready to take flame; likewiſe after this mixture the fiery bodies that were in ſpirit of Niter, do by ſtriving to mount upwards put the liquor into ſo great a motion, that it e'en almoſt flames, and would without all
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48366:169"/>
queſtion quite flame, if there were not ſome phlegm always mixed with theſe ſpirits, let them be drawn never ſo pure, which ſerves to allay the activity of the fiery particles; ſo that there muſt needs follow a very great ebullition.</p>
                     <p>This efferveſcency therefore proceeds from this, that ſpirit of wine, and ſpirit of Niter, which are as it were a <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> and ſulphur highly exalted, have been almoſt kindled into a flame by the fiery bodies that were in ſpirit of Niter; and that which further proves this conception is, a noiſe or kind of detonation, during the efferveſcency, which is much like that which happens when ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> are burnt together.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe there may be ſome difficulty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving what is meant by little fiery bodies, I do underſtand by them a ſubtile matter which having been put into a very rapid motion does ſtill retain the aptitude of moving with impetuoſity, even when it is incloſed in groſſer matters; and when it finds ſome bodies which by their texture or figure are apt to be put into motion, it drives them about ſo ſtrongly that their parts rubbing violently the one againſt the other, <hi>heat</hi> is thereby produced.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſulphureous parts of ſpirit of Wine, and the volatile acids of ſpirit of Niter being mixed, and being very aptly diſpoſed for motion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they muſt needs be eaſily put into it by theſe fiery bodies, inſomuch that their parts often rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing or ſtriking the one againſt the other, they muſt cauſe a heat after the ſame manner, as when a ſtone is ſtrook hard againſt a piece of Iron, a heat and fire do follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:48366:170"/>The great diminution of the liquor proceeds from the evaporation of the more volatile parts of the <hi>Spirits of Wine</hi> and <hi>Niter,</hi> through the neck of the Bolt-head during the ebullition.</p>
                     <p>That which remains is a well <hi>ſweetned ſpirit of Niter,</hi> for not only its edges are very much blunted in the ebullition, but the <hi>ſpirit of Wine</hi> being a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur does unite and imbody with thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, ſo that they have no longer any Corroſive quality.</p>

Then let the veſſels cool, and unlute them, you'l find in the Receiver an <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which you muſt keep in an earthen bottle well ſtopt. It ſerves for the diſſolution of metals.</p>

                     <p>I do uſe to Calcine the Vitriol to a whiteneſs, that the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> may not be weakned with an inſipid water.</p>
                     <p>The mixture of Vitriol and Salt-peter has quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome ſmell of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> becauſe Vitriol con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a great deal of Sulphur, which eaſily inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates into the volatile part of Salt-peter, and exalts ſome little of it, which cauſes the ſmell; it is this Sulphur in Vitriol which by volatilizing the red ſpirit of Niter, makes it come forth faſter, and with a leſs fire, than when Salt-peter is diſtilled with Clay alone.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Corroſion of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Niter,</hi> for the <hi>Vitriol</hi> doth yield but very weak Spirits in compariſon with the other. I do acknowledge indeed that the <hi>Oil of Vitriol</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Corroſive, but eighteen or twenty hours are not able to drive that out, for it doth not uſe to come until after three days continual diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Vitriol</hi> then and the Clay do ſerve here only for a matter to ſeparate the <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> that it may by the means of fire, the better rarefie into Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Although there does not enter into this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſo much terreſtrial matter, as there does into that of <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> nevertheleſs it proves very well, becauſe the Sulphurs of <hi>Vitriol</hi> do help the Spirits to riſe.</p>
                     <p>If you would keep on the fire five days and nights together, the Receiver would be ſtill full
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48366:171"/>
of clouds, becauſe the <hi>Vitriol</hi> would yield ſome Spirits during all that time.</p>

                     <p>There remains in the Retort a red maſs, which may be uſed like <hi>Colcothar,</hi> for an Aſtringent.</p>

                  <p>This operation is a <hi>Salt-peter</hi> rendred porous by Calcination, and by the aſhes of coals, which are mixed with it.</p>
                  <p>Melt ſixteen ounces of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> in a ſtrong and large Crucible among burning coals, throw into it a ſpoonful of coals groſly powdered, and there will riſe a flame and detonation, which being over, throw ſo much more, and continue to do ſo until the matter flames no longer, but remains fixt in the bottom of the Crucible; then pour it into a warm mortar, and when it is cold, powder it and diſſolve it in a ſufficient quantity of water; filtrate the diſſolution through brown paper, and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all the water in an earthen pan in ſand, there will remain a very white ſalt, which you muſt keep in a Viol well ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>This Salt hath a taſte like to that of Salt of Tartar, and they differ but little in virtue; it opens Obſtructions, and works by Urine, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48366:171"/>
ſometimes by Stool; the doſe is from ſixteen to thirty grains in ſome convenient liquor.</p>
                  <p>It may be uſed to aſſiſt in drawing forth the <hi>Tincture of Senna,</hi> a red Tincture may be alſo drawn from it with Spirit of Wine, as from Salt of Tartar.</p>
                  <p>If this Salt is ſet in a Cellar, it diſſolves into a liquor like the Oil of Tartar: it is uſed to extract the Tincture of Vegetables and Minerals.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Crucible muſt be but half full of <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> becauſe the detonation is ſo great, that the matter would be driven out of the Crucible, if too much be put in. When the Crucible is not very ſtrong, it breaks in pieces about the middle of the operation, and ſome part of the matter is loſt thereby.</p>
                     <p>This detonation is more violent than that which is made with a mixture of <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> and common ſulphur, becauſe the ſulphur of Coals is more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refied than common ſulphur.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Niter</hi> will never flame, when ſet over the fire alone in a Crucible, though you make your fire never ſo ſtrong, and coals though loaded with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginous or oily parts, do ſend forth but only a ſmall blue flame; but when theſe two bodies come to be mixt together, the volatile parts of <hi>Niter</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the coals, which are oily, do rarefie and exalt the coals with ſuch violence, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a very great flame. Now this operation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms my opinion that <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> does only ſerve here to rarefie the flame of ſulphur, but cannot ſend
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48366:172"/>
forth the leaſt flame of itſelf; becauſe that as ſoon as ever the coals, you put into the Crucible, are burnt, the flame goes out, and appears no more until you throw in more coals, with which a convenient proportion of the volatile parts of <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> that ſtill remained, does joyn and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them into a flame. Thus new coals are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively thrown into the Crucible, until it flames no longer; but toward the end of the operation, becauſe there remain but few volatile parts in the <hi>Niter,</hi> the detonation is much the leſs, and ſo is the flame, until at laſt the coals finding nothing more in <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> for it to raiſe, do burn only as they uſe to do when alone.</p>
                     <p>If you uſe common <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> for this operation, you'l have occaſion to uſe but three ounces and a half of coals, and you'l get twelve ounces of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſalt, but if you uſe fine <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> you muſt have ſeven ounces of coals, and yet will get but three ounces of purified ſalt.</p>
                     <p>This difference of weight proceeds from the fine <hi>ſalt-peters</hi> containing more volatile parts than the other; likewiſe a great deal more coals is required to raiſe them, and there remains the leſs <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> for the ſame reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fixt Niter</hi> being prepared as I have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, it is a little gray coloured; now to make it white you muſt Calcine it in a great fire, ſtirring it in the Crucible all the while with a <hi>ſpatule;</hi> when it ſhall have continued red hot for above an hour, it will become exceeding white. You muſt then diſſolve it in water, <hi>filter</hi> the diſſolution, and evaporate the water, and thus you have a very pure and white ſalt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:48366:172"/>This ſalt is an alkali, being a mixture of the ſalt of coals, which is an alkali, and <hi>fixt ſalt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> theſe two ſalts are ſo ſtrictly united and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the Calcination, that they make a porous ſalt, and ſuch as is much like unto the <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> of Plants,</p>
                     <p>Not that there is an alkali ſalt in <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> as Chymiſts will have it; for give what Calcination, or other preparation you pleaſe to this mineral ſalt, without adding any thing to it, not the leaſt alkali can be drawn from it, and all that ever we can ſee in it is acid.</p>
                     <p>It is further obſervable, that the liquor of <hi>fixt Niter,</hi> which has been made with common ſalt-peter, being kept a year, or a year and a half, loſes moſt of its activity as an alkali, ſo that it is no longer able to cauſe any ſuch ebullition with acids, as it could before.</p>
                     <p>This accident can have no other cauſe, than that the pores of ſalt contained in the liquor do cloſe up by little and little, and the acid ſalt of <hi>Niter</hi> does abſorb and deſtroy the alkali, which kept the pores open.</p>
                     <p>But the ſame thing does not happen, where the liquor of <hi>fixt Niter</hi> was made with <hi>purified ſalt-peter,</hi> becauſe whereas a great deal of coals was uſed in the fixing it, and but little ſalt of <hi>Niter</hi> remained in it, the alkali muſt there predominate ſo powerfully, that the acid is not able to regain its ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Some Chymiſts have thought fit to call the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of <hi>fixt Niter, Alkaheſt,</hi> that is, an univerſal diſſolvent, thinking it able to draw out the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous ſubſtance of all mixt bodies.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of Sal Armoniack.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SAl Armoniack</hi> is either Natural or Artificial. The Natural is found in very hot Countries, ſuch as many parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> that are near the <hi>Torrid Zone.</hi> It is found upon the earth that hath imbibed the Urine of Animals, that is to ſay, where the Sun hath ſublimed the volatile Salt of this Urine, and made of it a <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Artificial <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> is made at <hi>Venice,</hi> and divers other places with five parts of Urine, one part of <hi>ſea-ſalt,</hi> and half a part of <hi>Chimney ſoot;</hi> theſe three are boiled together, and reduced into a maſs, which being put into ſubliming pots, over a gradual fire, it ſublimes into a Salt in the form we commonly ſee <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi> Now in this ſublimation the volatile alkali ſalts of the <hi>Soot</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> do raiſe up as much <hi>ſea-ſalt</hi> as they can, and do join ſo ſtrictly together with this acid ſalt, that the mixture ſeems to be fixt. The reaſon of this cloſe union is, that <hi>ſea-ſalt</hi> being in form of points, does inſinuate into the alkali ſalts; and becauſe it has not motion enough to ſeparate the parts of theſe ſalts, it gets within them, and fills their pores.</p>
               <p>If you would purifie <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> you muſt diſſolve it in a ſufficient quantity of water, filtrate the diſſolution, and evaporate it until it is dry in a
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48366:173"/>
glaſs veſſel. You'l have a white ſalt, which may be given from ſix to four and twenty grains in ſome convenient liquor. It is an excellent Sudorifick and Diuretick; it is good in Malignant feavers, and in Quartan agues, and to bring the <hi>menſes</hi> in women. It is alſo uſed in ſome <hi>Collyries,</hi> or waters for the eyes.</p>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Flowers</hi> are a part of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> raiſed by Fire.</p>
                  <p>Powder and mix together equal parts of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> in powder, and <hi>ſea-ſalt</hi> decrepitated; put this mixture into an earthen Cucurbite, and having placed it in ſand, fit to it a blind head. You muſt give a gentle fire at firſt, and encreaſe it by little and little, ſo long as you perceive the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> to riſe up like meal, and ſtick to the head, and the uppermoſt part of the Cucurbite: continue the fire, until nothing more riſes up, then let the veſſels cool; lift up the head gently, and gather your <hi>Flowers</hi> with a Feather; keep them in a Viol well ſtopt; they have the ſame vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> but are given in a little leſs doſe, as from four to fifteen grains.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>This operation is performed, to the end the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> may be volatilized, by checking ſome part of its <hi>fixt</hi> ſalt by the addition of <hi>Salt decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated,</hi>

                     <p>This water is called <hi>Regalis,</hi> or Royal, becauſe it diſſolves Gold, which is the King of metals. It is likewiſe called <hi>Aqua Stygia,</hi> or <hi>Chryſulca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The veſſel in which it is made muſt be of a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bigneſs, becauſe in the diſſolution the Spirits do rarefie with ſo great violence, that they would break it, if they had not room to circulate in;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48366:174"/>
when a great deal of this water is preparing at a time, you muſt take care to remove the veſſel from the fire, ſo ſoon as the diſſolution begins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> may be likewiſe made, with equal quantities of <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and <hi>Sal Gemme,</hi> by mixing theſe Salts with thrice as much Potters-earth powdered, and the diſtillation of it is made after the ſame manner as I ſhewed, to draw the <hi>Spirit of Niter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is ſomewhat difficult to conceive how <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> is able to diſſolve Gold, which is a moſt ſolid Metal, and cannot diſſolve Silver, which is a much leſs ſolid body. Some Chymiſts endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſolve this difficulty, have ſaid that Gold being a Metal fuller of Sulphur than Silver, did therefore require a ſulphureous diſſolvent, ſuch as <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> compounded of the volatile ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous ſalts of <hi>Sal Armoniack:</hi> but this expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation deſtroys itſelf, for if Gold did contain more Sulphurs than Silver, it would conſequently be leſs weighty, for <hi>Sulphur</hi> is one of the lighteſt Principles in Chymiſtry.</p>
                     <p>I know the Alchymiſts will tell me, that their Sulphur is quite of a different nature from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, and that they do conceive in Gold, a Fixt, and conſequently a heavy ſulphur. But beſides that a fixt ſulphur is a thing meerly imaginary, it can never be ſo heavy as the other principles which they pretend to be in Gold, and which they are forced to think as fixed as the Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>Moreover if we examine what happens in the compoſition of the diſſolvent of Gold, it will be no difficult matter to contradict this opinion: for we ſee that as ſoon as ever the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48366:175"/>
to work upon the <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> the acid ſalt joyns with it, and quits the volatile ſalts, which finding themſelves diſingaged from the bodies that held them in a manner fixed, do riſe up with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but becauſe theſe ſalts which are alkalies, do meet in their paſſage with ſome acids of the <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> the great efferveſcency happens which is always wont at the meeting of alkali ſalts and acids. This efferveſcency being over, our <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> remains in the veſſel: it is properly nothing elſe but an acid <hi>ſea-ſalt</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the volatile ſalts being either exalted, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Acids, and that which confirms this opinion is, that <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> is as well made with <hi>ſea-ſalt,</hi> in which there are no volatiles at all, as with <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> according as I have ſaid.</p>
                     <p>It is not then by diſcourſes of this nature, that this <hi>Phanomenon</hi> can be clearly explicated. I am apt to believe, with more likelihood, that if <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> be not able to diſſolve Silver, the reaſon of it is becauſe the edges of the <hi>Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> being magnified by the addition of Salt do ſlide over the pores of Silver, not being capable to enter into them by reaſon of the diſproportion of their figures, whereas they eaſily enter into Gold, whoſe pores are larger, to make their diviſions. On the contrary if the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> diſſolves Silver, it is becauſe its points are very ſubtle and fitly proportioned to enter into the ſmall pores of this metal, and by their motion to divide its parts. Theſe ſame points may likewiſe enter into the large pores of Gold, but they are too ſmall and pliable to act upon this body. There's need of ſtronger and keener knives, which by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48366:175"/>
its pores more advantageouſly may have force enough to divide it.</p>
                     <p>I do eaſily foreſee, it will be objected, that Gold being heavier than Silver, ſhould have leſſer pores and not greater, becauſe the weight of a body doth only conſiſt in the proximity of parts; but it is eaſie to ſolve this difficulty, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each metal with a good Microſcope, for the pores of Gold are ſeen to be much larger than thoſe of Silver, though indeed there are much fewer, and that will explicate very well why Gold is heavier than Silver, though its pores are greater; for ſeeing they are at a good diſtance the one from the other, there's a very compact matter as it were intercepted, which cauſes all the weight; but the pores of Silver being very near one another, and of a much greater number, do intercept leſs ſolid matter, and conſequently it muſt be lighter. I'le uſe a familiar example, to make my ſelf more plainly underſtood.</p>
                     <p>If you take two veſſels of the ſame ſize and bigneſs, and fill one with ſmall hail-ſhot, and the other with large bullets, that which holds the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets will be much heavier than that which is full of ſhot; and yet notwithſtanding the vacuities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the bullets are much larger, than thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſhot.</p>
                     <p>According to this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> reaſon may be likewiſe given, why Gold is cut in pieces more eaſily than Silver; for the greater the pores of a body are, the eaſier entrance will a pair of Sheers meet with.</p>
                     <p>Gold ſpreads under the hammer more than Silver, becauſe having larger pores the hammer
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48366:176"/>
makes a greater impreſſion into it, and dilates the parts the more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>It is objected, that if there be any heavy matter as it were intercepted between the pores of Gold, it muſt needs precipitate of itſelf, after the action of <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> upon this metal, which is a thing that does not happen.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that if the parts of Gold are heavy, the diſſolvent nevertheleſs is a groſs body, and very well proportioned to hold up thoſe heavy parts, and to hinder them from precipitating.</p>
                     <p>Others have oppoſed this explication, and have writ, that if <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> diſſolves Gold, and cannot diſſolve Silver, the reaſon of it is, that the groſs points of <hi>ſpirit of Niter,</hi> or <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> are ſubtilized by the mixture of <hi>ſal Armoniack,</hi> and are rendred fit to enter into the ſmall pores of Gold, whereas the delicate Fabrick of theſe ſame points does not leave them the neceſſary ſtrength nor motion to divide the parts of Silver, whoſe pores are a great deal bigger.</p>
                     <p>But this way of arguing does not agree with experience; for what likelihood is there that the points of <hi>ſpirit of Niter</hi> are ſo ſubtilized by the penetration and diviſion of the parts of <hi>ſal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack?</hi> or where ſhall we find any example, that after a conſiderable efferveſcency of two ſalts met together in conflict, the acidity grows ſharper than it was before? this is a thing that can never be proved. On the contrary, every body knows well enough that no efferveſcency happens but the acid is in part blunted or broken thereby. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Argument ſuppoſes that <hi>ſpirit of Niter</hi> does break its ſubtileſt points in violently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48366:176"/>
with the <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> ſince alſo that in <hi>ſal Armoniack</hi> there are alkali ſalts whoſe property it is to deſtroy acids. I could further add here, that the conjunction of ſalt with <hi>ſpirit of Niter</hi> ſhould of neceſſity render its points more groſs than they were, and that the Cryſtals which are drawn by <hi>aqua Regalis</hi> have their ſhape not ſo keen as thoſe that are drawn by <hi>aqua Fortis.</hi> But that which I have ſaid is ſo probable in itſelf, and ſo eaſie to be convinced of, if a man takes never ſo little pains to conſider it, that I ſhould but amuſe my Reader to little purpoſe, if I ſhould offer to give any proofs of it.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I find it convenient to make a long diſcourſe in explicating how Silver, which has leſſer pores, is more ſuſceptible of the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Air and Fire, than Gold which has larger, ſeeing I have already ſuppoſed that the matter intercepted between the pores of Gold is more compact, and conſequently more hard to ſeparate than that of Silver.</p>

                  <p>This preparation is a volatile ſalt raiſed from <hi>ſal Armoniack</hi> by the means of <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> and diſſolved into a liquor.</p>
                  <p>Take eight ounces of <hi>ſal Armoniack,</hi> and four and twenty ounces of <hi>Quick-lime;</hi> powder them apart, and when you haved mixed them in a mortar, pour upon them four ounces of water, and put it quickly into a Retort, whoſe half muſt remain empty. Set your Retort in a ſand Furnace, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48366:177"/>
fitting to it a great Receiver, and luting the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures exactly, begin the diſtillation without fire, for a quarter of an hour; afterwards increaſing it by little and little unto the ſecond degree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it until nothing more comes forth; take off your Receiver, and pour out the Spirit immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into a Viol, turning away your head as much as may be to avoid a very ſubtile va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour that continually riſes from it. Stop the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cloſe with wax, to keep the Spirit in; you will have of it five ounces, and ſix drachms.</p>
                  <p>It is an excellent Remedy for all diſeaſes that proceed from Obſtructions, and corruption of humours, ſuch as Malignant feavers, the Epilepſie, Palſie, Plague, Small-pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It drives by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, or by Urine: the doſe is from ſix drops to twenty, in a glaſs of <hi>Balm,</hi> or <hi>Carduus</hi> water.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> which is an alkali, deſtroys the ſtrength of the acid Sea-ſalt, which in a manner bound up the volatile ſalts in the <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> whence it comes to paſs, that as ſoon as <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> are mixed together, there exhales an unſufferable ſmell of Urine; for the volatile ſalts coming forth abundantly do ſo fill the Noſe and Mouth of the Artiſt, that he would never be able to put the mixture into the Retort, if he did not take good care to turn away his head, while his hands are at work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="319" facs="tcp:48366:177"/>Water is added to it to liquifie theſe volatile ſalts, for if there were nothing to moiſten them, they would ſuddenly ſublime to the neck of the Retort, and ſtopping it all together would break it to pieces.</p>
                     <p>You muſt ſtop the Retort with your hand, ſo ſoon as you have poured the water into it, and ſhaking it one minute, you muſt haſten all you can to fit to it the Receiver, and to lute well the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; for the <hi>Quick-lime</hi> does preſently grow hot, ſo ſoon as its body is opened; and this heat, which is very conſiderable would ſpend the more volatile of the ſalts, if there were no care taken to preſerve them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Quick-lime</hi> being wetted does ſwell, and take up a great deal of room; wherefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort muſt be filled but half full, that there may remain room enough for the Spirits to rarefie in; you muſt alſo uſe a large Receiver, in which the vapours that riſe in abundance may be able to circulate with eaſe.</p>
                     <p>This Spirit is nothing but a ſolution of volatile ſalts in water; if you would ſublime, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it from the water, you muſt put the liquor into a matraſs with its head, and proceed as I ſhall ſhew when I deſcribe the volatile ſalt of <hi>Vipers;</hi> but this ſalt being dry, flies away more eaſily than when it continues diſſolved in water, ſo that it were better keep it as it is.</p>
                     <p>This is a ſtronger Spirit than that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> becauſe the little fiery bodies of the <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> which are mixed with it, have quickned the motion of the volatile ſalts; likewiſe theſe fiery particles are they that do
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48366:178"/>
hinder the coagulation of this Spirit with <hi>ſpirit of Wine,</hi> when they are mixed together, for there muſt be a cohaeſion and repoſe of parts, in order to make a <hi>Coagulum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo have a care when you remove the Receiver, not to hold your head over it; for this volatile ſalt ſuffering a greater ſeparation than before, enters the Noſe immmediately, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Reſpiration; inſomuch that ſeveral perſons have been ſeen to fall in a ſwound by that means alone. Now to avoid this accident, you had beſt have ready a wet cloth, to ſtop the Receiver with, ſo ſoon as it is unluted.</p>
                     <p>This Spirit is an excellent <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to make precipitations with, it deſtroys acids exceeding well, as do all other volatile alkalis; it is uſed to precipitate Gold, after it is diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>It is good in thoſe diſeaſes I named, becauſe it opens the pores, and drives the humours by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, or by Urine, according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of bodies: moreover, as it is an alkali, it deſtroys the acids which cauſed theſe diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Again, it ſometimes cauſes ſleep, becauſe it dulls the keenneſs of acid ſalts, which entring into the little conduits of the Brain, do cauſe perpetual watchings.</p>
                     <p>It is better give volatile Spirits in Sudorifick waters, than broth, becauſe the broth being taken hot, the heat would evaporate the better part of the volatile Spirits, before a man could reach the Porringer to his mouth.</p>
                     <p>You will find in the Retort thirty ounces of a white matter, which you muſt throw away as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; it is the fixt ſalt of <hi>ſal Armoniack</hi> mixed with the <hi>Quick-lime.</hi>

                  <head>Another Preparation of the Volatile Spirit of Sal Armoniack, together with its Flowers, and Fixt Salt againſt Feavers.</head>
                  <p>Powder and mix together eight ounces of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> and ſo much <hi>Salt of Tartar;</hi> put this mixture quickly into a glaſs body, and ſprinkle it with three ounces of Rain-water, ſet a head upon it, and after fitting the Receiver, and luting the junctures cloſe with a wet bladder, place your veſſel in ſand, with a gentle fire at firſt to warm the Retort by little and little, and diſtil the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit drop by drop; but when you perceive there will diſtil no more, take away the Receiver, and ſtop it cloſe: then encreaſe the fire to the third degree, and continue it about two hours, there will ſublime the <hi>white Flowers of Sal Armoniack,</hi> which will ſtick about the bottom of the head like meal.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit hath the ſame ſtrength, and virtues as the former: you will have ſeven ounces of it, and a half.</p>
                  <p>Gather up the <hi>Flowers</hi> with a Feather, and uſe them as you would thoſe I deſcribed before the Preparation: you'l have of them ten drachms, and a half.</p>
                  <p>There remains at the bottom of the Cucurbite nine ounces, and three drachms of a white fixt maſs. You muſt diſſolve it in ſufficient water, then filter the diſſolution, and evaporate it, until it is dry, you'l have a very white Salt, that may be reckoned a good Remedy for intermittent
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48366:179"/>
Feavers: the doſe is from eight grains to thirty in the ſmall Centaury water, or ſome other conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent liquor.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> ſerves in this Operation, as the <hi>Quick-lime</hi> did in the other; but becauſe it is a more powerful Alkali than <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> you muſt not uſe ſo great a quantity of it. The fixt Salt of <hi>Niter</hi> might be ſubſtituted in its place, or any other Alkali that you will.</p>
                     <p>When the fire begins to heat the matter, there do riſe up into the head ſtore of volatile Salts, in a fine delicate Cryſtalline form, but the moiſt vapours coming upon them do diſſolve them into Spirit.</p>
                     <p>The Volatile Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> is then a diſſolution of Volatile ſalt in water, and if there be not phlegm ſufficient to diſſolue all the Volatile ſalt, there will remain ſome part of it at bottom of the Receiver, and that may likewiſe be turn'd into Spirit, by only adding enough water to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it. Thus the Spirit becomes as ſtrong as it can be made, for the pores of the water being filled with as much ſalt as they can contain, it can receive no more. But if there happens to be more water than the proportion of Volatile Salt requires, then the Spirit proves weak, and muſt be given in a larger doſe.</p>
                     <p>This Spirit is Sudorifick, but you may perceive more ſenſibly the effect of <hi>Sal armoniack</hi> to cauſe Sweat, by diſſolving ſix or eight grains of this ſalt, and the ſame quantity of <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> each ſeparately in two ſmall doſes of ſome proper li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48366:179"/>
and giving them to a Patient one preſently after the other; for the <hi>ſalt of Tartar</hi> working upon the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> in the ſtomach, after the ſame manner as it does when they are mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Mortar, the Spirits do ſeparate from the latter with the more force, and act more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, than when they were mixed, before they were given; for the little violence that the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirits do uſe in their ſeparation from ſea-ſalt, does leave them the more activity, and diſpoſes them the better to paſs through the pores. Again, it is probable, that in the former effort which theſe Spirits made in their ſeparation from the fixt part, when <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> was mixt with <hi>ſalt of Tartar</hi> in a mortar, the more ſubtile part might fly away firſt, and be loſt; now it is this ſubtile portion that is moſt proper to rarefie the humours, and to drive them forth by Tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>The flowers do proceed from ſome part of the <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> which the <hi>ſalt of Tartar</hi> had not ſufficiently opened.</p>
                     <p>The Febrifugous ſalt is nothing but a mixture of <hi>ſalt of Tartar,</hi> and the fixt and acid part of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> it works by Urine, and but ſeldom by Sweat, by reaſon that being fixed it precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates more eaſily than it rarefies; and it is by this means that it opens obſtructions, which are often the firſt cauſe of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>If you mix in a Viol equal quantities of Volatile Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> &amp; <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and ſhake them a little together, they will cauſe a <hi>Coagulum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Coagulation proceeds from hence that the <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> which is a rarefied Oil, does unite with the Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> which is a ſaline
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48366:180"/>
liquor; and it is but the ſame thing which happens from ſtirring Oil and ſome ſalt liquor in a mortar, in order to make an Unguent, called <hi>Nutritum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this incorporation together, the ſalt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the ramous parts of the ſulphur, and theſe ſame ſulphureous parts are checkt, or as it were fixed by the ſalt, ſo that neither of them have any more freedom of motion; and from this repoſe of theſe parts does reſult the <hi>Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be likewiſe ſaid that the conjunction of the acid that is in <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> with the volatile <hi>Armoniack</hi> alkali, does contribute much to this Coagulation.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> prepared with <hi>Quick-lime</hi> does not at all coagulate with Spirit of Wine, by reaſon of fiery parts that it contains The <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> too may have mixed ſome fiery bodies in the Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> but there are not enough of them in it to hinder its aduna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Spirit of Wine.</p>

                  <p>It is a very good Medicin for the Lethargy, the Palſy, the Scurvy, Malignant feavers, and Hyſterical maladies; it may be given inſtead of Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> before deſcribed. And it is not ſo repugnant to the taſte. It works by Sweat, or by inſenſible Tranſpiration; the doſe is from twelve drops to thirty, in ſome proper liquor; it is likewiſe good, outwardly applied, for the Palſie, and for cold pains.</p>

                     <p>So ſoon as the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> is mixed with the <hi>ſalt of Tartar,</hi> Volatile ſalts do riſe from them, which would very much incommode the Artiſt if he ſhould hold his noſe over it. You muſt loſe no
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48366:181"/>
time in putting the mixture into the body, and then ſtopping it, for theſe firſt ſalts are the moſt ſubtile of all.</p>
                     <p>The ſalts muſt be ſeparately powdered, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the loſs which would be made of the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſalts, in the mixing of the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> with the <hi>ſalt of Tartar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the making this mixture, you muſt not uſe any mortar made of metal, becauſe that in the conflict of the two ſalts it would be corroded, and that which were corroded from it would be apt to ſpoil the operation.</p>
                     <p>The body muſt be filled but half way, when the whole is in. The volatile ſalt is lighter than the ſpirit of Wine, for it riſes firſt.</p>
                     <p>When the Spirit of Wine is well rectified; it will not diſſolve any of the volatile ſalt at firſt, but on the contrary it hinders this ſalt from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving in a liquor, becauſe the ramous parts of the wine do ſtop the entrance of the air, but if there be any phlegm in the Spirit of Wine, it diſſolves the ſalt according to the proportion that there is of it.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who had rather uſe the volatile <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi> dry, then in liquor, may keep it dry in a bottle well ſtopt, and uſe it for the ſame purpoſes as the ſpirit; the doſe of it muſt be a little leſs, it is very white and pure, this keeps better than that which is drawn with water, becauſe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Spirit of Wine which remains in it, does ſerve to retain the ſalts in ſome meaſure.</p>
                     <p>You need not wonder, that there happens no <hi>Coagulum,</hi> when Spirit of Wine and this volatile ſalt are ſtirred together in a bottle, as there does
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48366:181"/>
by the mixture of Spirit of Wine, and Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> for this ſalt having all its parts intirely united, cannot ſo well mix with the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of ſpirit of wine; but if you add water enough to diſſolve the ſalt, then there will be a <hi>coagulum,</hi> becauſe the parts of the ſalt will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united, and by the help of water will enter into the pores of Spirit of wine. I have explicated this <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulum</hi> in the Remarks of the Chapter preceding.</p>
                     <p>The volatile <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> does diſſolve well with wateriſh liquors, and ſpirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> may be made of them together, by only mixing water enough to diſſolve the ſalt. But if you would mix, or diſſolve it in Spirit of wine, you will find a great deal of trouble in the doing it; if you ſhould only infuſe it in ſpirit of wine, it would none of it diſſolve; on the contrary, that is a way to keep and preſerve the ſalt; therefore you muſt diſtil it over ſeveral times, that the ſaline parts may rarefie, and unite with the ſpirit of wine. That which remains undiſſolved in the Receiver, has been very much rarefied by repeated diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for which reaſon it alſo diſſolves ſome days afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Spirit of wine in this operation hath ſo wrought upon the volatile ſalts that they are no longer ſo diſagreeable to the taſte or the ſmell as they were before, and it is by that means that it ſweetens them, for ſulphurs do contemperate the acrimony of ſalts, as I have ſaid ſpeaking of the Principles.</p>

                     <p>This acid Spirit proceeds from the fixt part of the <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> for the Alkali contributes not one drop of it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>VItriol</hi> is a Mineral compounded of an <hi>Acid Salt,</hi> and <hi>Sulphureous Earth;</hi> there are four ſorts of it, the <hi>Blue,</hi> the <hi>White,</hi> the <hi>Green,</hi> and the <hi>Red.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Blue</hi> is found near the Mines of Copper, in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of Cyprus,</hi> from whence it is brought to us in fair Cryſtals, which keep the name of the Country, and are called <hi>Vitriol of Hungary,</hi> or <hi>Cyprus;</hi> it partakes very much of the nature of Copper, which renders it a little Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick; it is never uſed but in outward applications, ſuch as <hi>Collyriums,</hi> or waters for the eyes, and to conſume proud fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>White Vitriol</hi> is found near unto Fountains, it is the moſt of all depurated from a Metallick mixture: it may be taken inwardly to give a vomit; it is likewiſe uſed in <hi>Collyriums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:48366:183"/>There are three ſorts of <hi>Green Vitriol,</hi> the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>Roman.</hi> That of <hi>Germany</hi> draws near unto the <hi>blue,</hi> and contains a little Copper, it is better than the reſt for the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> That of <hi>England</hi> partakes of <hi>Iron,</hi> and is proper to make the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> is much like the <hi>Engliſh Vitriol,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that it is not ſo eaſie to diſſolve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Red Vitriol</hi> was brought among us a few years ago out of <hi>Germany,</hi> it is called <hi>Natural Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar,</hi> and is eſteemed to be a <hi>Green Vitriol Calcined</hi> by ſome ſubterranean heat. It is the leaſt common of them all, it ſtops Bloud, being applied to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhagies.</p>
               <p>If you diſſolve a little <hi>white,</hi> or <hi>green Vitriol</hi> in water, and write with the diſſolution, the writing will not be ſeen, but if you rub the paper with a little Cotton dipt in the decoction of Galls, it will appear legible; then if you wet a little more Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> and paſs it gently over the paper, the Ink will diſappear again; and yet at laſt if you rub the place with a little more Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton dipt in <hi>Oil of Tartar</hi> made <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> it will again appear legible, but of a Yellowiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that I can give for theſe effects is this, the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> diſſolves a certain <hi>Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> which is made of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Galls,</hi> but the <hi>Oil of Tartar</hi> breaking the force of this acid Spirit, the <hi>Coagulum</hi> recovers it ſelf, and appears again, but becauſe it now contains <hi>Oil of Tartar</hi> too, it acquires a new colour.</p>
               <p>If you throw the diſſolution of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Vitriol</hi> only powdered, into a ſtrong decoction of dried
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48366:183"/>
Roſes, it will turn as black as common Ink; if you pour ſome drops of <hi>ſpirit of Vitriol</hi> into it, this Ink will turn red; and if you add to it a little vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile ſpirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> it will turn gray.</p>
               <p>Theſe changes of colour do proceed from the <hi>ſpirit of Vitriol</hi>'s diſſolving the <hi>Coagulum</hi> which the <hi>Vitriol</hi> it ſelf had made, and rendring it inviſible; the liquor recovers a freſher red colour than it had, before the <hi>Vitriol</hi> was put into it, becauſe the ſame ſpirit does ſeparate the parts of the Roſe which were diſſolved in the liquor, and renders them more viſible.</p>
               <p>The volatile ſpirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> which is an alkali, does partly break the acid edges of the <hi>ſpirit of Vitriol,</hi> ſo that the parts of the Roſe having nothing more to keep them rarefied, do cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and conſequently the liquor changes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>By this experiment may be ſeen, that the dried Roſe may ſerve to make Ink with, as well as Galls; <hi>Indian</hi> wood, and divers other things will do the ſame.</p>

                  </p>

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48366:184"/>
then evaporate a third part of the liquor that remains, and ſet the veſſel again in a Cellar, there will ſhoot new Cryſtals; continue thus eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating and cryſtallizing, until you have gotten all you can; dry theſe Cryſtals in the Sun, and keep them for uſe; the doſe is from twelve grains to a drachm, in Broth, or ſome other liquor.</p>

                     <p>This is only a Purification of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> that ſerves to ſeparate a little earth from it.</p>
                     <p>All the liquor may be evaporated without any Cryſtallization, the <hi>Gilla Vitrioli</hi> will remain at bottom in a white powder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>White Vitriol</hi> is uſed in this operation rather than <hi>Green,</hi> becauſe it is milder.</p>

                     <p>After taking this vomit, a man ſometimes voids by ſtool a black matter like Ink, becauſe it frequently happens that ſome part of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> deſcending into the Guts, meets a ſaline matter that it joyns with, and ſo cauſes a blackneſs, as it uſes to do when <hi>Vitriol</hi> is mixed with Galls.</p>

                  <head>Calcination of Vitriol.</head>
                  <p>Put what quantity you pleaſe of <hi>Green Vitriol</hi> into an earthen pot unglazed; ſet the pot over the fire, and the <hi>Vitriol</hi> will diſſolve into water; boil it to the conſumption of the moiſture, or elſe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48366:184"/>
until the matter turn into a grayiſh maſs drawing towards white; this is called <hi>Vitriol Calcined</hi> to whiteneſs. If you ſhould Calcine this gray <hi>Vitriol</hi> a good while over a ſtrong fire, it would turn as red as bloud. It is called <hi>Colcothar,</hi> and is good to ſtop bloud, being applied to a wound.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>You muſt not Calcine the <hi>Vitriol</hi> in a glazed pot for fear of diſſolving the Verniſh, which would change the nature of the <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be Calcined, or rather dryed in the Sun, until it becomes white, this Calcination deſerves to be preferr'd before the other, but only it is longer a doing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vitriol</hi> may be likewiſe ſpread about a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace heated a little, and ſo dried until it turns white.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould reſolve to dry as exactly as you can, ſixteen pounds of green <hi>Vitriol,</hi> there would remain but ſeven pounds of white <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in order to do this, you muſt powder the white maſs of Calcined <hi>Vitriol,</hi> after you have broke the pot, and ſtir it a long time in an earthen pan, over a little fire, until there riſes no more fume from it, or until there remains in it no more phlegm.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould Calcine this white <hi>Vitriol</hi> to a redneſs, you'd have five pounds and a half of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar.</hi> The ſulphur of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is loſt during this laſt Calcination, you muſt do it in the Chimney, for the fume would be very injurious to the breaſt.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48366:185"/>
This ſulphur has the ſame ſmell as ordinary ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</p>
                     <p>Some have writ, that the red colour which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears after a long Calcination of <hi>Engliſh Vitriol,</hi> was an undoubted proof that there was Copper in it, after the ſame manner as the red colour which happens to Verdigreeſe calcined is a certain proof that it contains in it ſome particles of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                     <p>But that which is here ſaid to paſs for a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, is no proof at all; for firſt of all thoſe <hi>Vitriols</hi> which are thought moſt to partake of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, do give no greater redneſs in their Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the others which partake the leaſt of it. Secondly let Copper be prepared which way you pleaſe, you can never make it redder than the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar</hi> of <hi>Engliſh Vitriol,</hi> whoſe redneſs muſt be thought to proceed from ſome particles of this metal contained in it. And thirdly, we ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Iron, Lead, Mercury,</hi> and divers mineral bodies do acquire a red colour in their Calcining, without containing any Copper.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sympathetical powder</hi> that has made ſo much noiſe is nothing but white <hi>Vitriol</hi> opened, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared divers ways according to mens different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions about it. The <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> is better eſteemed than the other for this operation.</p>
                     <p>The common method of preparing this <hi>Powder</hi> is to expoſe it to the heat of the Sun, whilſt the Sun is in <hi>Leo,</hi> that is in <hi>July,</hi> in order to dry it, and to open it. And men think that Sign does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow particular influences on the preparation. Though in truth it undergoes drying better in that ſeaſon than another, by reaſon of the great heat
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48366:185"/>
then of the Sun. And it may be the parts of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> do become more volatile by this heat, but for what is ſaid of Influence it is meerly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
                     <p>Many do only pulverize the ordinary <hi>Vitriol,</hi> in order to make the Sympathetical powder.</p>
                     <p>When you would uſe this powder, you are to take the bloud of a wound upon a linnen cloth, and to ſprinkle ſome of it upon the bloud. It is pretended, that though the bloudy linnen were ten miles off from the Patient, when the Sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal powder is applied to it, the wound would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently heal. But the experience of ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have tried it (and others may do the ſame) does evince, that men have had a great faith, when they have talked of the effects of this powder; for if it be not applied to a cloth newly blouded, and even in the chamber of the Patient, you will certainly find no effect from it. Nay where ſuch precautions have been uſed, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms no great matter, and ſometimes does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.</p>
                     <p>Now to explicate the action of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> called Sympathy, you muſt know that there does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exhale into the air, little bodies from this mineral ſalt, and to convince you of it, you need only to put the ſeveral Vitriols of different colours pretty near one another in the ſame place, you will find after 12 or 15 daies that they have all changed colour a little in their <hi>ſuperficies.</hi> The white will become yellow, the green whitiſh, the blue greeniſh, the red grayiſh. Theſe changes of colour cannot proceed but from little bodies, which being ſeparated from each kind of <hi>Vitriol,</hi>
                        <pb n="336" facs="tcp:48366:186"/>
and mixing in the air, ſome part of them do fall confuſedly on the matter. And it muſt not be ſaid that theſe changes are cauſed by the air, which does open and rarefie theſe ſalts; for if you put them into places ſeparate, or diſtant from one another, this effect will in no wiſe happen.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo obſerve that the bloud, to which the Vitriolick powder is applied, retaining ſome heat ſtill, may thereby increaſe the activity and number of the little bodies which do ariſe from the <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And theſe Vitriolick bodies diſperſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the air are they that cauſe all the Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, for they do mix in the wound of the patient, and becauſe the virtue of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is to ſtop the bloud, and to dry it, you need not wonder if the volatile parts which come from it, do perform the ſame effect.</p>
                     <p>But it may be objected, that the volatile parts of <hi>Vitriol</hi> have no more determination naturally to go find out the wound of a perſon, than other parts of the body, and other places of the chamber. Nay on the contrary, that a wound being common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covered with a plaiſter, and ſomewhat thick ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, is not ſo likely to receive thoſe bodies.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that there is no need of giving any other determination to theſe volatile parts of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> than is given to other volatile ſalts which are diſperſed in the air; but becauſe wounds are always of a glutinous temper, it is eaſie to conceive that theſe little bodies will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to them in greater quantity than to others, as any downy ſubſtance which flies about a room, wherein there is Glue, or Turpentine,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48366:186"/>
will more eaſily ſtick in them, than in other places.</p>
                     <p>As for the Bandage and Plaſter, uſed to wounds, you muſt know that thoſe who do uſe the Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical powder, do apply none of them. But when it happens, which is very rare, that a mans wound has been cured by this Powder, although there was a Plaiſter and bandage alſo laid upon it, this effect can never be attributed to any thing elſe but the penetration of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> for there are wounds that a very little quantity of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of drying.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have given you the moſt rational expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that can be, of an effect which has hitherto paſſed for a thing altogether inexplicable.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I would not adviſe any wounded perſon to inſiſt or depend too much on a remedy of this nature; for to one who ever received conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able good, there's a hundred, who never perceived any effect from it, and the cauſe of it has been, that the volatile parts of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> have hapned to be diverted from the wound by ſome wind, or elſe becauſe the greateſt part of people have their bloud too ſubtile, and too active to be fixed by ſo little a quantity of <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs thoſe whoſe heads are filled with the Sympathetical Powder do ſpeak of it, as of a never failing medicine. And if a man offers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them by an experiment to the contrary, as it is not hard to do, they preſently cry out, that the reaſon it fails is, becauſe it is ill prepared; but it is eaſie to convince them, if they deſire a ſerious ſatisfaction in it, for the powder of their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, that they ſo much magnifie, though it be
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48366:187"/>
ſucceſsful in one, will be found to fail in a great many others.</p>
                     <p>Many Authors have alſo written a great many falſhoods in defence of the Sympathy, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that if the urine of an Infant were caſt into the fire ſo ſoon as it is made, it would cauſe a heat of urine: that if the excrements of an animal were thrown into the fire, or among Nettles, there would be an Inflammation in the guts of the ſame creature, and many the like ſtories, which a thouſand experiments will prove not to be true.</p>

                  <head>Diſtillation of Vitriol.</head>
                  <p>This Spirit is an acid ſalt of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> diſſolved into a liquor, by a great fire.</p>
                  <p>Fill two thirds of a large earthen Retort, or glaſs one luted, with <hi>Vitriol Calcined</hi> to white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; place it in a cloſe Reverberatory furnace, and fitting to it a great Balon or Receiver, give a very ſmall fire to warm the Retort, and make the water come forth that might ſtill remain in the <hi>Vitriol;</hi> and when there will diſtil no more, pour the water out of the Receiver into a Bottle, this is called <hi>Phlegm of Vitriol;</hi> it is uſed in Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the eyes to waſh them with: refit the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver to the neck of the Retort, and luting the junctures exactly, encreaſe the fire by degrees, and when you perceive Clouds to come forth into the Receiver, continue it in the ſame condition, until the Receiver grows cold; then ſtrengthen the fire with wood to an extream violence, until the flame riſes through the Tunnel of the Reverberatory as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48366:187"/>
big as ones arm. The Receiver will fill again with white Clouds; continue the fire after this manner for three days, and ſo many nights, then put it out: unlute the junctures when the veſſels are cold, and pour the Spirit into a glaſs body, ſet it in ſand, and fit to it quickly a Head with its Receiver; lute the junctures cloſe with a wet Bladder, and diſtil with a very gentle fire, about four ounces of it, this is the <hi>Sulphureous ſpirit of Vitriol,</hi> keep it in a viol well ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>It is good for the <hi>Aſthma,</hi> Palſie, and diſeaſes of the Lungs, the doſe is from four drops to ten in ſome convenient liquor.</p>
                  <p>Change the Receiver, and augmenting the fire, diſtil about half the liquor that remains in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: this is called the <hi>Acid Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it is mixed in Juleps to an agreeable acidity.</p>
                  <p>That which remains in the body is the moſt acid part of the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and is improperly called <hi>Oil.</hi> It may be uſed like the <hi>acid Spirit,</hi> for continued Feavers, and other diſtempers that are accompanied with a violent heat. This Oil is likewiſe uſed for the diſſolution of metals.</p>
                  <p>You'l find in the Retort a <hi>Colcothar</hi> which hath the ſame virtues with that I ſpoke of before.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>To make the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> you muſt take <hi>green Engliſh Vitriol,</hi> ſuch as being rubbed upon Iron doth not at all change colour, which ſhews it doth not partake of Copper, as the <hi>German</hi> does, that looks a little blueiſh, and is more acrimonious.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48366:188"/>
You muſt Calcine it as I have ſaid, to the end it being deprived of the greateſt part of its <hi>Phlegm,</hi> the diſtillation may be diſpatched the ſooner. A third part of the Retort is left empty, that the Spirits may have room to rarefie in, when they come forth.</p>
                     <p>There diſtils alſo a great deal of <hi>Phlegm</hi> into the Receiver, and all of it is known to have come, when there drops no more. Thoſe who don't care for the <hi>ſulphurcous ſpirit,</hi> do let it come forth, and mix together with the <hi>Phlegm,</hi> before the junctures are luted; but you muſt be ſure to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the fire diſcreetly at that time; for theſe Spirits come with a great deal of violence, and uſe to break the Retort, when they are driven too furiouſly. When they are out, you muſt aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the fire to the laſt degree of all, for the acid Spirit will not part with its earth, until it is forced by an extraordinary heat.</p>
                     <p>If you diſtil eight pounds of <hi>white Vitriol,</hi> at ſixteen ounces to the pound, you'l draw off ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen ounces of <hi>Phlegm,</hi> and two and twenty ounces and a half, both of the Sulphureous, and the Acid <hi>ſpirit of Vitriol.</hi> Of theſe two and twenty ounces and a half, there will be five ounces of Sulphureous ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>You'l find in the Retort five pounds, five ounces of <hi>Colcothar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Uſe all the care you can poſſible to preſerve all the liquors which come from <hi>Vitriol,</hi> yet it will be impoſſible for you to hinder it from loſing ſome through the junctures, during the diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould uſe <hi>German</hi> inſtead of <hi>Engliſh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> you'd draw off a little more ſpirit than the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48366:188"/>
quantity I have named, but it would have ſome ſmell of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and the matter which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Retort would be of a brown colour drawing towards black. This colour proceeds from ſulphureous Fuliginoſities which riſe more from this <hi>Vitriol</hi> than the other, becauſe it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of Copper; for this Sooty vapour finding no vent to get out at, falls down again upon the matter and blackens it.</p>
                     <p>The Furnace in which this operation is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt be very thick, that the heat of the fire being none of it loſt through the Pores, may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter act upon the Retort. Theſe Spirits do rarefie into white vapours in the Receiver, which muſt be provided large enough, to give them free liberty to circulate in, before they condenſe into a liquor at bottom. The fire is uſually continued four or five days together, but if after that, you ſhould change the Receiver, and continue the fire three or four days longer, there would come forth an <hi>Oil of Vitriol</hi> congealed, and cauſtick, which is nothing but the more fixt part of the <hi>Sprit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</hi> And this Congelation hath given this liquor the name of <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi> though improperly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vitriol</hi> contains earth enough, wherefore none is added to it, as is neceſſarily done in the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Niter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Acid Spirits</hi> are Salts become fluid by the force of fire, which hath diſingaged them from their more terreſtrious part, and they may be revived again by pouring them upon ſome Alkali; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> remaining ſome time upon <hi>Iron,</hi> doth reincorporate into <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> poured upon <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> makes a <hi>Salt-peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="342" facs="tcp:48366:189"/>There is one thing happens about the <hi>Oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> when it is very ſtrong, which is ſtrange indeed; it is, that if you mix it with its <hi>Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> or with water, or elſe with an <hi>Ethereal Oil,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Oil of Turpentine,</hi> this mixture grows hot to that degree, that ſometimes it breaks the Viol it was put into, and often it produces a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ebullition.</p>
                     <p>I could quickly give an account of this heat and Ebullition, if I would ſuppoſe an Alkali to be in the <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi> as thoſe do who pretend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate every thing that happens by the notions of acid and alkali; but not comprehending how an alkali ſhould be able to remain ſo long a time with ſo ſtrong an acid as is the <hi>Oil of Vitriol</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed, I had rather give a reaſon that ſeems to me abundantly more probable.</p>
                     <p>I conceive therefore that if water, or <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> or the <hi>Ethereal Oil of Turpentine</hi> do come to heat the <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi> it is by ſetting in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a great many fiery particles which the <hi>Oil of Vitriol</hi> had drawn with it in the diſtillation; for theſe little fiery bodies being environ'd with ſalts that are exceeding heavy, and hard to rarefie, they drive about with vehemence whatſoever ſtands in their way, and when they have cauſed an Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, and find they can't get out at the top of the Viol, they break it to pieces with the buſsle they make at bottom, and on the ſides.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it will be ſaid, I do here ſuppoſe <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> that the <hi>Oil of Vitriol</hi> does contain fiery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; but if we conſider the great violence of fire, and the time that is ſpent in drawing this acid, it will be no ſuch hard matter to grant me this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48366:189"/>
Beſides it will be hard to explicate the great and burning Corroſion of <hi>Oil of Vitriol</hi> without admitting theſe fiery parts, for the <hi>Vitriol</hi> contains nothing in it ſelf of this Cauſtick nature; it is true indeed that it contains <hi>Phlegm, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> but it is a thing impoſſible but this acid ſhould diſcover it ſelf more than it does, if it were as Corroſive in the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> as it is in the Oil.</p>
                     <p>Once it hapned to me, that putting into my Furnace a Retort whoſe two thirds were filled with <hi>German Vitriol</hi> dried, in order to draw off its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, I diſtilled firſt of all the <hi>Phlegm,</hi> and ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit, which I took out of the Receiver; I then fitted it again to the Retort, and by a great fire continued three days and three nights, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled off the acid Spirit as we are uſed to do. When the veſſels were cold, I admired to find in my Receiver nothing but a maſs of Salt, or Congealed <hi>Oil of Vitriol.</hi> This Salt was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Cauſtick and burning, that if I offer'd to touch the ſmalleſt part of it with my finger, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently felt an inſufferable ſcalding, and was fain to put my hand immediately into water, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to fume ſtill, and when a little of it was thrown into water, it made the ſame hiſſing noiſe, as a fire-coal flung into water would do. Beſides it heated the water very much, and much more than common <hi>Oil of Vitriol</hi> could.</p>
                     <p>I kept this congealed Spirit about ſix months, after which time it diſſolved into a liquor, which I uſed as <hi>Oil of Vitriol;</hi> for it was in effect the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>And in my opinion this operation does ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince, that <hi>Oil of Vitriol</hi> contains fiery parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="344" facs="tcp:48366:190"/>It hapned to me another time, that having recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> to ſeparate it from its Oil by an Alembick, ſome part of the diſtilled Spirit was turned into fair and tranſparent Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals in the bolt-head, or Receiver, which Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals had the ſame acrimony, and ſtrength with the maſs I now ſpoke of.</p>
                     <p>If you pour ſome drops of Spirit, or <hi>Oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> into a quart of hot water, in which you ſhall infuſe a pugil of dried red Roſes, the liquor will in a little time become as red as Claret; and this effect muſt not ſo much be attributed to the Spirit of Vitriol's ſharpning the water, and ſo thereby drawing out the Tincture of Roſes, as to this that the acid Spirit does rarefie and ſeparate the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Roſe (which the water had diſſolved) and made to appear better than before; for if you ſtrain the Infuſion, and ſeparate the Roſes, before you pour to it your Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> although the liquor ſo ſtrained be yet but little raiſed in colour, it will nevertheleſs turn to as high a red, after the Spirit is dropt into it, as if the Roſes remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill in the liquor. We muſt ſay the ſame thing of other Tinctures that are drawn by acids, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſuch as are made by an Alkali ſalt.</p>
                     <p>If you fill a glaſs Viol with the decoction of <hi>Nephritick wood</hi> clarified, and look on it, turning toward the light, it will appear yellow; but if you turn your back to the light, it will appear blue; if you mix with it ſome drops of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it will appear yellow on every ſide, but if you again add about as much more <hi>Oil of Tartar,</hi> it will return unto its firſt colour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:48366:190"/>If you take a Blue, or Violet tincture made in water, ſuch as is drawn out of the Sun-flower, or Violet flowers, and pour upon it ſome drops of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it will preſently turn red; but if you throw into it ſome Alkali ſalt, it will recover again its former colour.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary if you pour an Alkali liquor, ſuch as volatile Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> or the <hi>Oil of Tartar,</hi> upon the blue Tincture, it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn green; and if you again pour upon it a little <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it will change this colour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an obſcure red.</p>
                     <p>The decoction of <hi>Indian wood</hi> is very red: if you drop into it a little <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> it will turn yellow; and if you ſtill add ſome volatile Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> it will become black.</p>
                     <p>If you infuſe three or four hours a piece of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an wood</hi> in ſome clear juice of Citron, and take out your wood, the liquor will have received no alteration of colour, but if you add to it ſome drops of <hi>Oil of Tartar</hi> made <hi>per deliquium,</hi> it will take a brown colour, and if you add to it a little <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it will reſume its colour again.</p>
                     <p>If you pour ſome drops of <hi>Oil of Tartar</hi> upon Claret, it will become greeniſh, and if you add to it a little <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it will return to its former colour.</p>
                     <p>All theſe changes of colour, which the Spirit of Vitriol, or other acids, and Alkali's do make, proceed only from the different poſition of bodies diſſolved in the liquor, and from its diſpoſition to modifie the light different ways.</p>

Some Authors ſay, that it Vomits juſt after the ſame manner, as <hi>Gilla Vitrioli,</hi> taken in a ſmaller doſe, but I have obſerved that its effect was much leſs, and on the contrary there was need of giving it in a larger doſe than the <hi>Gilla,</hi> to procure a Vomit; for having given of it ſeveral times a drachm at a doſe, the perſon had no Inclination at all to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and truly I am apt to believe that a fixt ſalt of Vitriol diveſted of its Sulphur, doth rather tend to precipitate downwards than mount up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for Vomiting is cauſed by Saline Sulphurs, which prick the Fibers of the Stomach, whence follows a Convulſion to this part.</p>
                     <p>That which remains indiſſoluble is called <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> it is uſed for Aſtringents.</p>
                     <p>If you expoſe it to the Air for a year, or a year and half, it returns into Vitriol again.</p>

                  <hi>ROche-Alom</hi> is a very Styptick Mineral Salt, found in the veins of the earth in many places of <hi>Europe;</hi> it is taken up in great tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pieces, the beſt is that which is reddiſh, for the white contains fewer Spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alom</hi> is purified after the ſame manner as Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol; it is uſed to cleanſe the teeth; it is a good Diuretick; a drachm of it is diſſolved in a quart of water, and a glaſs of it is given now and then.</p>
               <p>Many things are likewiſe called by the name of <hi>Alom,</hi> as the <hi>Saccharinum,</hi> which reſembles Sugar, it is nothing but a mixture of <hi>Roche-Alom, Roſe-water,</hi> and the white of an Egg. <hi>Plume-Alom,</hi> which ſome call <hi>Lapis Amianthus,</hi> is a kind of Talk.</p>

into an earthen Retort half empty; place your Retort in a Reverberatory furnace, and fitting to it a large Receiver, lute the junctures cloſe, and light a very ſmall fire the firſt three hours only to warm the Retort, afterwards increaſe it every hour to the utmoſt violence, and theſe Spirits will come forth, and fill the Receiver with white Clouds; continue the fire in this condition three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then let the veſſels cool: you'l find in the Receiver an acid Spirit, which you may rectifie by diſtilling it in a glaſs Alembick in ſand, in order to make it the clearer. This acid is more diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable than that of Vitriol, it is uſed in Juleps for continued Feavers, and Tertian Agues; the doſe is from four to eight drops; it is likewiſe good to cure the <hi>Aphtha,</hi> or little Chancres in the mouth.</p>
                  <p>Break the Retort, and you'l find in it a white maſs very much rarefied, and light, it is called <hi>Burnt Alom,</hi> or <hi>Calcined Alom,</hi> it is uſed for to eat carnous excreſcences, or proud fleſh.</p>

                  <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lphur</hi> is a kind of <hi>Bitumen,</hi> that is found in many places in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> There is brought among us both a <hi>Natural</hi> and an <hi>Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial;</hi> the <hi>Natural</hi> is greyiſh, and called <hi>Sulphur Vivum,</hi> the other is Yellow, and is nothing but the <hi>Natural</hi> melted, purified from its groſſer earth and formed into Rowls, which we do commonly uſe.</p>
               <p>Some think that <hi>Sulphur</hi> is a Vitriol ſublimed in the earth, becauſe theſe mixts are very often found near one another; that there is a great deal of <hi>Sulphur</hi> in the maſs of Mineral Vitriol, and that the acid Spirits which are drawn from them both are wholly alike.</p>

                  <p>This preparation is an exaltation of <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Put about half a pound of <hi>Sulphur</hi> groſly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into a glaſs body, place it in a ſmall open fire, and cover it with a pot or another Cucurbite turned upſide down, one that is unglazed, ſo as that the neck of the one may enter into the neck of the other.

                     <p>This Operation is intended only to rarefie the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that being become more open, it may work the better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sulphur</hi> is proper againſt Infirmities of the Lungs, when they proceed from a Viſcoſity that ſticks to them, becauſe it deterges; but if it ſhould be given to ſuch as are too much dried with a Feaver, it proves very ill in that it raiſes a greater motion of the humours: it cures Tettars, and the Itch, becauſe opening the Pores it drives out the ſubtler part of the humor, but yet the groſſer part remaining within, they do frequently return again.</p>
                     <p>You may uſe a glaſs head to fit upon the body.</p>
                     <p>If you mix one part of <hi>Sal Polychreſtum</hi> with two pounds of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and ſublime them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as thoſe I have deſcribed, you'l have <hi>white flowers of Sulphur,</hi> which are thought to be better for diſtempers of the Breaſt than thoſe others, they are given in the ſame doſe. This whiteneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48366:198"/>
from a very exact attenuation which <hi>Sal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lychreſtum</hi> gives to the <hi>Sulphur;</hi> the <hi>Sal Polychre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum</hi> which remains at bottom of the Cucurbite, may be Calcined, and if you afterwards Purifie it by ſolution, Evaporation, and Filtration, it will be as good as before.</p>

                  <p>This Operation is a <hi>Sulphur</hi> diſſolved by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali ſalt, and precipitated by an acid.</p>
                  <p>Take four ounces of the <hi>Flower of Sulphur,</hi> and twelve ounces of the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> or <hi>Salt-peter fixed</hi> by the coals: put them into a large glazed pot, and pour upon them ſix or ſeven pints of water.

                     <p>Water alone is not able to diſſolve ſuch a groſs body as <hi>Sulphur;</hi> wherefore an Alkali ſalt is added to divide it into ſmall imperceptible particles.</p>
                     <p>The acid liquor pierces the Alkali, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating its parts makes it let go its hold, ſo that the <hi>Sulphur</hi> gathers it ſelf together, and falls down to the bottom in a white powder. This powder is waſhed to take away the impreſſion of the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> and the acid that might remain among it, after which it may be ſaid to be a <hi>Flower of Sulphur Alcoholiſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The change of its yellow colour into a white comes from this, that being more rarefied it hath a ſmoother ſurface then it had before, to reflect the light in a direct line to our eyes.</p>
                     <p>This Operation may give us an <hi>Idea</hi> of what happens in Chylification, and in Sanguification; for after the ſame manner as the <hi>Sulphur</hi> does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come white, when it has been reduced into a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery,</hi> or fine powder, ſo the aliments having been fermented, and their ſubſtance attenuated in our ſtomachs, the Chyle receives a white colour; and after the manner as the <hi>Sulphur</hi> when intirely diſſolved does turn of a red colour, ſo the parts of Chyle having been altogether exalted, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by repeated circulations, does become red and turn into bloud.</p>
                     <p>This bloud turns into a <hi>Pus,</hi> and becomes white in Impoſthumes, becauſe the acid which is found
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48366:199"/>
in them having as it were fixed and gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether its inſenſible parts, does make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover again the colour of Chyle.</p>
                     <p>You muſt take care not to let there be any Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver veſſel where this Operation is performed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the vapour which proceeds from <hi>Sulphur</hi> will make it black.</p>
                     <p>Fifteen grains of this powder will do as much as double the quantity of <hi>Flower of Sulphur,</hi> for diſeaſes of the Breaſt, and it doth not heat ſo much.</p>

                  <p>This Operation is a ſolution of the oily parts of common <hi>Sulphur</hi> in oil of Turpentine.</p>
                  <p>Put into a ſmall matraſs an ounce and a half of <hi>Flower of Sulphur,</hi> and pour upon it eight ounces of <hi>Oil of Turpentine;</hi> place your matraſs in ſand, and give it a digeſting fire two hours; afterwards encreaſe it a little for four hours, and the Oil will take a red colour; let the veſſel cool, then ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the clear <hi>Balſom</hi> from the <hi>Sulphur</hi> that could not diſſolve.

                  <p>To make the <hi>Aniſeed Balſom of Sulphur,</hi> you muſt uſe the Oil drawn from <hi>Aniſeed</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Oil of Turpentine,</hi> and proceed as I have ſaid; it is more agreeable than the former, and has leſs acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>

                     <p>There is no need of a great fire for this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe <hi>Sulphur</hi> being a fat body doth eaſily incorporate with Oils, and commonly gives them a red colour.

                     <p>That which remains undiſſolved in the matraſs is the acid or ſaline part of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and is found cryſtallized.</p>

                     <p>A great many <hi>Machines</hi> have been invented to draw the <hi>Spirit of Sulphur;</hi> the ordinary one is the <hi>glaſs bell,</hi> under which the <hi>Brimſtone</hi> is burnt, and the Spirits coagulating againſt its ſides diſtil into an earthen pan, that is ſet underneath, after the ſame manner as I have ſhewed in the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my <hi>Machine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt leave an empty ſpace between the brims of the Bell, and the Pan, that the Fire may have air enough to keep it lighted; but beſides that the Fire is apt to go out every moment, uſe never ſo much precaution, a very poor quantity of Spirit is drawn this way.</p>
                     <p>Authors do recommend this Operation to be done when the weather's wet, and to moiſten the Bell before-hand, but I have found by experience that theſe circumſtances ſignified nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>With the <hi>Machine</hi> that I have deſcribed I can draw a good handſom quantity of Spirit, and I am not forced to fire the <hi>Sulphur</hi> ſeveral times; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the hole at top gives vent to the air, and hinders the fires going out: Again the more Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick part evaporates that way, but the acid Spirit not being able to riſe ſo high, condenſes againſt

the ſides of the tunnel, and then falls down under the little pan that is turned upſide down, to raiſe the other higher, that contains the <hi>Sulphur.</hi> You may uſe a Crucible inſtead of a pan to put the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> in.</p>
                     <p>The greeniſh <hi>Sulphur</hi> is better than the other for this Operation, becauſe it has more Vitriol in it, and conſequently more Spirit; for this Spirit is nothing but a <hi>Vitriolick Salt</hi> diſſolved, that differs little from the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> beſides in the Taſte, which is not ſo Empyreumatical, as not having undergone ſo violent a Fire.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vitriolick ſalt</hi> which is in the <hi>Sulphur</hi> does not riſe, until the more volatile parts are ſpent; for which reaſon the Spirit does not diſtil until towards the end, and the drops begin then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the middle of the Tunnel.</p>
                     <p>Foraſmuch as <hi>Sulphur</hi> is good for diſeaſes of the Lungs and Breaſt, many do think that the Spirit which is drawn from it ought to have the ſame vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but they do not conſider that this Spirit being deprived of the fat, or moſt ſulphureous part of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> hath alſo loſt the virtue that accompanies it, and that it muſt produce effects altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> after the manner as the acid Spirits which are drawn from Sugar, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and many other matters, have very different virtues from thoſe of the mixts themſelves. And the reaſon of it is very plain, for whereas the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> by its ramous parts can ſweeten the acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious humours which fall upon the Lungs, and ſo help the Cough, the <hi>Spirit of Sulphur</hi> which is an acid does prick the Fibres of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and cauſe a Coughing, as all other acids do.</p>

                  <p>Put four ounces of <hi>Sal Polychreſtum</hi> prepared as I have ſaid, into an earthen pan, or a glaſs veſſel, and pour upon it two ounces of <hi>Spirit of Sulphur;</hi> ſet your veſſel in ſand, and evaporate all the liquor over a gentle fire: there will remain four ounces and ſix drachms of an acid ſalt, moſt agreeable to the taſte, keep it in a bottle well ſtopt.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>Salt</hi> is improperly called <hi>Salt of Sulphur;</hi> for it is nothing but a <hi>Sal Polychreſtum</hi> impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an acid Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Many great deſcriptions have been given of <hi>Salt of Sulphur,</hi> which being well examined do all come to the ſame thing as this; it is called by many Authors a <hi>Febrifugous ſalt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The true <hi>Salt of Sulphur</hi> (truly ſo called) ſhould be a little of the fixed Vitriol which remains in the earth of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> after that the flowers have been drawn from it, and ſhould be ſeparated from the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48366:202"/>
earth by a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> as other fixed ſalts are made; but ſuch a Salt would not have the ſame qualities as this.</p>
                     <p>Some have written, that when <hi>Spirit of Sulphur</hi> is poured upon <hi>Sal Polychreſtum</hi> diſſolved in water, there is made a great efferveſcency, as well as when the ſame Spirit is thrown upon <hi>Salt-peter:</hi> but without doubt they little examined the matter, for there is no ebullition made, neither with the <hi>Sal Polychreſtum,</hi> nor with <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> they being both of them acid ſalts.</p>
                     <p>The union of acid Spirits with acid Salts is very different from that between acids and alkalis; for the acid Spirits not being able to open the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible parts of acid Salts, they do loſe nothing of their ſtrength, and their keenneſs remains the ſame, but it is not ſo in reſpect of acids mixed with alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, for ſuch a penetration is made into the alkalis that the acid loſes its ſtrength in them.</p>
                     <p>And for the reaſon that I have now given, the <hi>Salt of Sulphur</hi> is very acid, and <hi>tartarum vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum</hi> is hardly at all acid, although there is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed proportionably as much more acid Spirit for the making <hi>tartarum vitriolatum,</hi> than there is for the making <hi>Salt of Sulphur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Salt of Sulphur</hi> is good in Tertians, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Feavers, and on all occaſions where there is need of calming the too great motion of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, becauſe the acid ſerves to fixe the volatile Salts, or Sulphurs, which are moſt commonly the principal cauſe of theſe diſeaſes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>Of Succinum or Ambar.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is found in ſmall currents near the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sea, in the Dutchy of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> a certain coagulated <hi>Bitumen,</hi> which, becauſe it ſeems to be a juice of the earth is called <hi>Succinum,</hi> and <hi>Carabè,</hi> becauſe it will attract ſtraws; it is likewiſe called <hi>Electrum, Gleſſum, Ambra Citrina,</hi> vulgarly <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Ambar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Bitumen</hi> being ſoft and viſcous, ſeveral little Animals, ſuch as Flies, and Ants, do ſtick to it, and are buried in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambar</hi> is of different colours, ſuch as <hi>White, Yellow,</hi> and <hi>Black.</hi> The <hi>White</hi> is moſt eſteemed, though it be no better than the <hi>Yellow.</hi> The <hi>Black</hi> hath the leaſt virtue of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambar</hi> ſerves to ſtop ſpitting of bloud, the Bloudy-flux, the immoderate flux of the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids, Terms, and Gonorrheas: the doſe is from ten grains to half a drachm. It is likewiſe uſed to ſtop a little the violence of Catarrhs, by receiving the fume of it at the Noſe.</p>
               <p>Some do think that <hi>Petroleum,</hi> or Oil of Peter, is a liquor drawn from <hi>Ambar,</hi> by the means of Subterranean fires, which make a diſtillation of it, and that <hi>Jet,</hi> and coals are the remainders of this diſtillation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:48366:203"/>This opinion would have probability enough in it, if the places, from whence this ſort of drogues does come, were not ſo far aſunder the one from the other; for <hi>Petroleum</hi> is not commonly found but in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Provence.</hi> This Oil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils through the clefts of rocks, and it is very likely to be the Oil of ſome <hi>Bitumen,</hi> which the ſubterranean fires have raiſed.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Tincture of Ambar.</head>
                  <p>This Operation is a ſolution of ſome oily parts of <hi>Ambar,</hi> made in Spirit of wine.</p>
                  <p>Reduce into an impalpable powder five or ſix ounces of yellow <hi>Ambar,</hi> and put it into a bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, pour upon it Spirit of wine to the height of four fingers, ſtop this bolthead with another, to make a double veſſel, and having exactly luted the junctures with a wet bladder, place it in digeſtion in hot ſand, and leave it there five or ſix dayes, or until the Spirit of wine is ſufficiently tinged with the <hi>Ambar</hi> colour; decant this Tincture, and put more Spirit of wine to the matter, you muſt digeſt it as before, then having ſeparated the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation, mix it with the other: Filtrate them, and diſtil from them in an Alembick with a very little fire, about half the Spirit of wine, which may ſerve you as before; keep the Tincture that you will find at the bottom of the Alembick, in a Viol well ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>It is good for the Apoplexy, Palſie, Epilepſie, and for Hyſterical women; the doſe is from ten drops to a drachm in ſome proper liquor.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>You muſt powder the <hi>Ambar</hi> finely, that the <hi>menſtruum</hi> may open its body the better; this Tincture is nothing but the Sulphureous or oily part of <hi>Ambar,</hi> which Spirit of wine (a <hi>Sulphur</hi>) does become impregnated with: a liquor that were not ſulphureous would perhaps diſſolve the <hi>Ambar,</hi> but that which is diſſolved by it would be the more impure; wherefore you muſt always uſe ſuch a diſſolvent as is of the ſame nature with the ſubſtance that you would diſſolve.</p>
                     <p>Half the Spirit of wine is drawn off, to make the Tincture the ſtronger.</p>

                  <head>Diſtillation of Ambar, and the Rectification of its Oil, and Spirit.</head>
                  <p>Fill with <hi>Ambar</hi> groſly beaten two thirds of an earthen Retort, or glaſs one luted; place it in a Furnace, on two iron bars; fit to it a large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and luting the junctures cloſe, give under it a ſmall Fire to warm the Retort, and drive out the <hi>Phlegm.</hi> Afterwards augment it by little and little, there will come forth a Spirit, and an Oil; continue the Fire until there comes no more; then let the veſſels cool, and unlute them. Pour about a pint of warm water into the Receiver, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it ſoundly about, for to diſſolve ſome vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt that often ſticks to the ſides of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48366:204"/>
pour all the liquor into a glaſs Alembeck; fit to it a Receiver, and luting well the junctures, make a ſmall Fire to heat the veſſel, then aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it a little, the water and Spirit will riſe, and carry with them a little white Oil; continue the Fire, until there riſes no more, and the thick Oil remains at bottom of the Cucurbite without boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſeparate the white Oil that ſwims above the Spirit and Phlegm, and keep it in a Viol well ſtopt; it is given inwardly in Hyſterical Diſtempers, in the Palſie, Apoplexy, and Epilepſie; the doſe is from one drop to four in ſome appropriate liquor: it may be mixed with a little yelk of an Egg, to diſſolve it eaſily in water or broth.</p>
                  <p>The water and Spirit do remain mixed confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, now to ſeparate them you muſt pour this mixture into an earthen or glaſs diſh, and evaporate over a very gentle Fire two thirds of it; that which remains is the <hi>Spirit of Ambar,</hi> keep it in a Viol well ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>It is an excellent Aperitive, and is given in the Jaundiſe, ſtoppage of Urine, Ulcers of the neck of the bladder, and in the Scurvy; the doſe is from ten to four and twenty drops in ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient liquor.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Black Oil</hi> which remains in the Cucurbite may be kept apart for outward uſes, to chafe the Noſe and Wriſts of women in Hyſterical maladies.</p>
                  <p>If you would rectifie it, you muſt mix it with ſo much ſand as is neceſſary to make it into a Paſte, and put it into a Retort, and placing it in a Furnace in a naked Fire diſtil all the Oil; the firſt that comes forth will be red, but exceeding clear, keep it by it ſelf; It may ſerve inſtead of the white.</p>

                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Oils of <hi>Ambar</hi> and <hi>Jet</hi> do work in Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical caſes, chiefly by their ill ſmell; for we ſee that whatſoever is ungrateful to the ſmell does commonly allay ſymptoms in diſeaſes of the <hi>matrix,</hi> and that good ſmells do increaſe them.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of theſe effects is not very eaſie to find, ſeeing that all that has been hitherto ſaid for explication of them has only come to this, that the <hi>matrix</hi> ſympathizing with the brain does riſe upwards to ſhare in the good ſmells of the brain, and ſinks downwards when the noſe is offended with that which is unpleaſant. Nay ſome have thought the <hi>matrix</hi> to be a little animal, by reaſon of the many motions that have been obſerved in it. Theſe kinds of diſcourſes are indeed very proper to leave people in the ſame doubts they were in before, and I don't think any body has received any ſatisfaction from them. Therefore let us try whether we can ſay any thing more to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>When a woman receives an agreeable ſmell, the tickling pleaſure which this ſmell produces in the brain by means of the olfactive nerve, does move the Spirits and determinate them to run into the veſſels in a greater abundance, and with more agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than they did before. Then alſo is perceived, if ſhe minds it, a certain titillation of the parts,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48366:205"/>
and all the ſenſes do ſeem willing to partake of this good ſmell. All this is common to men as well as women.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the veſſels which go from the brain to the <hi>matrix</hi> do ſwell with this affluence of Spirits, they muſt of neceſſity be abbreviated in their length, as a cord is found to ſwell and to ſhorten when it is wetted, or as the Fibres of a glove do ſhrink when the humidity that is within them is rarefied by the Fire.</p>
                     <p>Theſe veſſels being thus ſhortned, they muſt needs give ſhocks, and receive like returns from the <hi>matrix.</hi> And then likewiſe it is perceived to riſe and to move upwards. But becauſe this <hi>viſcus</hi> does commonly contain a groſs bloud, and humors very eaſie to ferment, which are actuated by theſe ſhocks, there do riſe from it groſs vapours which oppreſs the diaphragm, and do cauſe that which is called the <hi>ſuffocation</hi> of the <hi>matrix.</hi> Theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers do likewiſe very often happen to women who have no ways been offended with ſweet ſmells, but that which cauſes the ſame ſymptoms does work after the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>As for ill ſmells, they muſt produce a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, for by ſtriking offenſively the nerve of the noſe, the Spirits do retire back to their places, and conſequently the veſſels, and the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> do reſume their ordinary diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay perhaps that a grain of Musk or Civet is often applyed to the Navil, to ſettle the mother, and to lay the vapours.</p>
                     <p>This has been practiſed indeed by ſome, but without any proof that ever it did any good, or that it gave any eaſe. Civet is put into the middle
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48366:205"/>
of <hi>Galbanum</hi> Plaiſters, or the <hi>Oxycroceum,</hi> which is applied to the Navil, but there is more reaſon to attribute the effects which come from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy rather to the Plaiſters than to the Civet. And beſides, it cannot be ſaid that this Civet, or this Musk thus applied do yield any good ſmell.</p>
                     <p>Many men are likewiſe very ſubject to vapours, and among others thoſe that are of a Melancholick temper do ſeem to feel the ſame ſymptoms as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, upon any ſweet ſmells. This comes from obſtructions in the veſſels, which have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the brain, for theſe humors which do cauſe the obſtruction being thereby moved may produce theſe effects.</p>
                     <p>That which is called <hi>Spirit of Ambar</hi> is only a volatile ſalt diſſolved in a little Phlegm.</p>
                     <p>Some Authors pretend, that putting this <hi>Spirit</hi> into a matraſs with its blind-head, they can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime a volatile ſalt from it as from Animals, but I could never find experience anſwer their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for after having followed them ſeveral times in this Operation, I could never gain one jot of that ſalt, which hath given me occaſion to examine this Spirit, and to enquire what kind of ſalt it might contain.</p>
                     <p>I found this Salt was acid, and like unto that of Plants which is called Eſſential, whereof I have ſpoken in the Principles. This Salt being leſs volatile than that of Animals, cannot riſe ſo high, beſides that it is heavier than the Phlegm which muſt riſe firſt. Wherefore to ſeparate it, you muſt evaporate about a third part of the Spirit, over a very gentle fire, and then put the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into a cool place, and leave it there ten or
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48366:206"/>
twelve days without ſtirring it, you'l find little Cryſtals which you may take and keep in a Viol well ſtopt. This Salt hath the ſame virtues as the Spirit: the doſe is from eight grains to ſixteen, in Raddiſh, or Pellitory water; but it is better to keep it in the Spirit, for beſides that it is more eaſily preſerved ſo, there always flies away ſome part of it with the Phlegm in the evaporation, let the fire be never ſo moderate. But now I ſhall give you a preparation of the volatile ſalt of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> that may be eaſily made, and may keep dry.</p>

                  <p>Put two pounds of <hi>Ambar</hi> powdered into a large glaſs or earthen Cucurbite, let it be filled but the fourth part, ſet this Cucurbite in ſand, and after you have fitted a head to it, and a ſmall Receiver, lute well the junctures, and light a little fire under it for about an hour; then when the Cucurbite is grown hot, encreaſe the fire by little and little to the third degree; and there will diſtil firſt of all a phlegm and Spirit, then the volatile ſalt will riſe, and ſtick to the head in little Cryſtals; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there diſtils an Oil firſt white and then red, but clear: when you ſee the vapours riſe no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, you muſt put out the fire, and when the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are cold unlute them. Gather the volatile ſalt with a Feather, and becauſe it will be but impure as yet, by reaſon of a little Oil that is mixed with it, you muſt put it into a Viol big enough that the ſalt may fill only the fourth part of it, place the Viol in ſand, after you have ſtopt it only with
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48366:206"/>
paper, and by means of a little fire, you'l ſublime the pure ſalt in fair Cryſtals to the top of the Viol. When you perceive the Oil begin to riſe, you muſt then take your Viol off the fire, and letting it cool, break it, to ſeparate the ſalt; keep it in a Viol well ſtopt, you'l have half an ounce.</p>
                  <p>This ſalt is a very good aperitive, and may be given from eight grains to ſixteen in ſome opening liquor, for the <hi>Jaundies,</hi> for <hi>Iſchuries, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers in the Bladder, the Scurvy, Fits of the Mother,</hi> and upon all occaſions where there is any need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving obſtructions, and opening by way of Urine.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit and Oil have the ſame virtues as thoſe I have ſpoken of. If you would diſtil in a Retort the maſs which remains in the Cucurbite, until there comes away nothing more, you'l have a Black Oil, which might ſerve women to ſmell to in fits.</p>

                     <p>The Cucurbite muſt be ſure to be large enough, for otherwiſe it will break while the vapours are a riſing.</p>
                     <p>You will have five ounces and a half of a clear Oil, and one ounce and a half of Spirit, two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and a half of a black oil, are drawn from the maſs by the Retort, and that which remains weighs two ounces; it is a black rarefied matter which burns like coals by reaſon of the fuliginoſities that fall upon it.</p>
                     <p>A clear Oil may be drawn from <hi>Ambar</hi> in the firſt diſtillation by mixing the <hi>Ambar</hi> with an

                  <hi>JAlap</hi> is a grayiſh root brought out of <hi>America,</hi> cut into ſlices and dried; it grows in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> and in ſeveral other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the beſt is that which is moſt compact, and filled with Reſinous veins. It purges watery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors very well, and is therefore uſually given in the Dropſie and Gout: the doſe is from ten grains to a drachm in broth, or White-wine.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Roſine, or Magiſtery of Jalap.</head>
                  <p>This Operation is a ſolution of the oily or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous part of <hi>Jalap,</hi> made in Spirit of wine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated by common water.</p>
                  <p>Put a pound of good <hi>Jalap</hi> groſly powdered into a large matraſs; pour upon it Spirit of wine <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holized,</hi>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:48366:209"/>
until it be four fingers above the matter: ſtop the matraſs with another whoſe neck enters into it, and luting the junctures with a wet bladder, digeſt it three days in a ſand-heat, the Spirit of wine will receive a red Tincture: decant it, and then pour more upon the <hi>Jalap;</hi> proceed as before, and mixing your diſſolutions filtrate them through brown paper. Put that which you have filtred into a glaſs Cucurbite, and diſtil in a vaporous bath two thirds of the Spirit of wine, which may ſerve you another time for the ſame Operation. Pour that which remains at the bottom of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite into a large earthen Pan, filled with water, and it will turn into a milk, which you muſt leave a day to ſettle, and then ſeparate the water by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, you'l find the <hi>Roſine</hi> at bottom like unto Turpentine. Waſh it ſeveral times with water, and dry it in the Sun, it will grow hard like common <hi>Roſine;</hi> powder it fine, and it will become white. Keep it in a Viol, it purges Seroſities. It is given in Dropſies, and for all Obſtructions: the doſe is from four to twelve grains, mixt in Electuary, or elſe in Pills.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roſines</hi> of <hi>Turbith, Scammony,</hi> and <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> may be drawn after the ſame manner.</p>

                     <p>The Spirit of wine, which is a Sulphur, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a very convenient <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to extract <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines,</hi> which are groſs Sulphurs; you muſt uſe enough Spirit to diſſolve all the <hi>Roſine,</hi> and give it a ſufficient time to open all the body of the <hi>Jalap,</hi>

after which a good part of the Spirit of wine is drawn off, and may ſerve for the ſame uſe again, provided you diſtil it with a very gentle fire, for if you let it be too ſtrong, it will carry along with it good part of the <hi>Roſine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A great deal of water is poured upon it, to weaken the Spirit of wine, which held the <hi>Roſine</hi> diſſolved; and then it revives again, and its parts approaching one another, there is made a kind of milk, which clears up, according as the <hi>Roſine</hi> precipitates.</p>
                     <p>If you have uſed ſixteen ounces of <hi>Jalap,</hi> you will draw an ounce and ſix drachms of <hi>Roſine</hi> well waſhed and dried.</p>
                     <p>From ſix ounces of good <hi>Scammony,</hi> you draw five ounces of <hi>Roſine</hi> by the like preparation.</p>
                     <p>Some do evaporate the Spirit of wine, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing any Precipitation, they find their <hi>Roſine</hi> in an Extract at the bottom of the veſſel, but then it becomes black like pitch.</p>
                     <p>All the Purgative virtue of the <hi>Jalap</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>Roſine:</hi> an Alkali ſalt may be drawn from the remainder but in a very ſmall quantity.</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve to give the <hi>Roſine of Jalap</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mixt with ſomething elſe that may ſeparate its parts for if it be taken alone, it will be apt to adhere to the inward membrane of the Inteſtines, and ſo cauſe Ulcers by its acrimonious quality.</p>
                     <p>Moreover <hi>Apothecaries</hi> ſhould obſerve to mix it in a little yolk of an Egg, when they would diſſolve it in a Potion, for it ſticks to the mortar like Turpentine, when it is humected by any aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquor. It may be likewiſe incorporated with ſome Electuary, and then it eaſily diſſolves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="378" facs="tcp:48366:210"/>Twelve grains of this <hi>Roſine</hi> work the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as a drachm of <hi>Jalap</hi> in ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>It is not yet ſufficiently known wherein the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative virtue of mixts doth conſiſt, to give it a right explication. It is eaſily conceived that theſe effects do follow the Fermentation that the Remedy hath cauſed, but no body can find what it is that makes this Remedy be Purgative rather than ſeveral others, which ſeem to have as great a diſpoſition as this to cauſe ſuch Fermentation; wherefore I ſhall not pretend to clear the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> I ſhall only endeavour to give ſome reaſon for a very conſiderable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which is to know how <hi>Hydragogues</hi> do work in our bodies, and why they rather purge water than other humors.</p>
                     <p>A general reaſon that may be given of it is that all <hi>Hydragogue Remedies</hi> have more acrimony than other Purgatives, and conſequently they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to open the Lymphatick veſſels.</p>
                     <p>But it may be further ſaid that theſe Remedies do ſo cut and attenuate the Viſcoſities which are found in bodies, that they make them be like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and there is no difficulty in conceiving this laſt reaſon, when it is conſidered, that theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which do purge water, are all of them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous or elſe ſalts; for after the ſame manner as we ſee Sulphurs, or Liquified ſalts diſſolve Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous bodies, ſo do Roſines, which are Sulphurs and ſalts, diſſolve Viſcoſities in the body, which are compounded of a great deal of Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>But there is this difference between the effects of <hi>Salt</hi> and of <hi>Roſines,</hi> that the Salt paſſing quick, and making but little impreſſion, doth diſſolve
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48366:210"/>
only that which is found in what is called the firſt Region of the body, wherefore it purges but mildly; whereas the <hi>Roſine</hi> by reaſon of its viſcous, hooked parts, remains a longer time in the body, and leaſurely cauſes a Fermentation not only about the parts where it immediately works, but ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates on the brain, and other remote places, from whence it forces Phlegm to diſcharge it ſelf into the Belly, and this is that which cauſes Roſinous Hydragogues to purge more than Salts.</p>

                  <head>Extract of Rhubarb.</head>
                  <p>This <hi>Extract</hi> is a ſeparation of the purer parts of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> from the terreſtrious.</p>
                  <p>Bruiſe ſix or eight ounces of good <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> and ſteep it twelve hours warm in a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Succory</hi> water, ſo as the water may be four fingers above the <hi>Rhubarb;</hi> let it juſt boil, and paſs the liquor through a cloth; infuſe the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſo much more Succory water, as before, then ſtrain the Infuſion, and expreſs it ſtrongly: mix your Impregnations, or Tinctures, and let them ſettle; filtrate them, and evaporate the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in a glaſs veſſel, over a very gentle fire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til there remains a matter that hath the conſiſtence of thick honey, this is called <hi>Extract of Rhubarb,</hi> keep it in a Pot.</p>
                  <p>The doſe is from ten grains to two Scruples in Pills, or diſſolved in Succory water for diſeaſes of the Liver and Spleen, it binds after the purge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

Likewiſe waters may be uſed for <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums,</hi> that are appropriated to the virtue of the mixt, whoſe <hi>Extract</hi> you intend to draw.</p>
                  <p>When you draw the <hi>Extract</hi> of <hi>Aromaticks,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Roſes,</hi> and <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> the liquor may be diſtilled rather than evaporated, whereby you gain a fragrant water.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>Though the name of <hi>Extract</hi> ought to be very general in Phyſick, it is confined only to one ſort of Preparation that is reduced to the conſiſtence of an Electuary, it is nothing elſe but a Purification that is made to cleanſe a mixt from its more Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious parts, that being more open and free it may work with the greater ſtrength. Now this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is good for mixts that are not Odoriferous, but not ſo for thoſe that are; for by evaporation their beſt part is loſt which conſiſts in a volatile. So that I would by no means adviſe to make the <hi>Extract</hi> of <hi>Aromaticks.</hi> Nature is a very good Artiſt to perform this Operation within our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when the Principles are eaſie to ſeparate, as in theſe ſorts of mixts.</p>
                     <p>There has been a great conteſt among Chymiſts heretofore, in which of the Principles it is that the Purgative virtue of many medicins doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. Some have maintained it to be in the Salt, others in the Sulphur, and others again in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. But when every party had very diligently ſeparated each their Principle, and came to try it, they found after all, that none of them was Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; which hath perſwaded many of them to think that this Purgative principle was of ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and penetrating a nature, that glaſs it ſelf was not able to preſerve it from being loſt.</p>
                     <p>For my part I cannot grant any ſuch indiſcernable Purgative, &amp; I rather am apt to believe that the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative virtue of a mixt conſiſts in nothing elſe but
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48366:212"/>
ſuch a different mixture of Principles as is requiſite to produce certain Fermentations in our bodies. So that when once we ſeparate the Sulphur, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, or Salt, the poſition of parts, or proportion of Principles being changed, there remains no longer any Purgative effect, becauſe the Principles being ſeparated can no more produce that Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which they did while they were mixed, and united together ſome kind of way that Art is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how to imitate.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps ſome who think themſelves good Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks will ſay this Chapter contradicts the former; for I there maintained that the Roſine of Jalap, which is a Sulphur, doth contain all the Purgative virtue of Jalap; but though I did call the Roſine of Jalap a Sulphur, I did not mean it was a pure Sulphur, it is a ſubſtance out of which all the five Principles may be ſtill drawn; but by reaſon it doth contain great ſtore of Sulphur, this name may be given to it as it often is to others of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>And thus <hi>Salt</hi> may be ſaid to be Purgative too; but it doth not follow from thence that the Salt alone muſt be thought to contain all the Purgative virtue of mixt bodies; ſeeing many plants, ſuch as <hi>Guaiacum, Box, Carduus,</hi> and <hi>Wormwood,</hi> do contain as much, or more Salt, than <hi>Senna,</hi> and <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> and yet nevertheleſs do not purge at all.</p>

                  <head>Diſtillation of Guaiacum.</head>
                  <p>This operation is a ſeparation of the liquid parts of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> from its terreſtrious matter.</p>
                  <p>Take the ſhavings of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> fill a large Retort with them three quarters full, place it in a Reverberatory Furnace, and joyn to it a great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Receiver. Begin the diſtillation with a fire of the firſt degree, to warm the Retort gently, and to diſtil the water, which is called Phlegm; continue it in this condition, until there come no more drops, which is a ſign that all the Phlegm is diſtilled. Throw away that which you find in the Receiver, and fitting it again to the neck of the Retort, lute well the junctures. You muſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48366:213"/>
encreaſe the fire by degrees, and the Spirits, and Oyl will come forth in white clouds; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the fire until there comes no more, let the veſſels cool, and unlute them, pour that which is in the Receiver into a Tunnel lined with brown paper, ſet upon a bottle, or ſome other veſſel, the Spirit will paſs through, and leave the black, thick, and very fetid Oil, in the Tunnel; pour it into a viol, and keep it for uſe; it is an excellent Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for rottenneſs of bones, for the Tooth-ach, and to cleanſe old Ulcers. It may be rectified as I ſaid of the Oil of <hi>Ambar,</hi> and may be uſed inwardly in the Epilepſie, Palſie, and to drive forth the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth: the doſe is from two drops to ſix.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> may be rectified by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling it by an Alembeck, for to ſeparate a little impurity that might have paſſed with it; it works by perſpiration, and by Urine: the doſe is from half a drachm to a drachm and a half. It is likewiſe uſed mixt with the water of honey, to cleanſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>You'l find in the Retort the coals of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> which you may turn into aſhes by putting fire to them, which they will ſooner take than other coals: Calcine theſe aſhes ſome hours in a Potters furnace, then make a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of them with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which being filtred, evaporate it in a glaſs or earthen veſſel in ſand; there will remain the Salt of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> which you may make white by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining it in a Crucible in a ſtrong fire. This Salt is Aperitive, and Sudorifick; it may ſerve as all other Alkalis to draw the Tincture of Vegetables: the doſe is from ten grains to half a drachm in ſome convenient liquor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:48366:213"/>The earth, called <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> is good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>After this manner the five ſubſtances of all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables may be drawn; but becauſe the fire doth give them a loathſome Empyreumatical ſmell, other ways have been invented to draw the Oil of Aromaticks: I ſhall deſcribe them in the ſequel.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>During the diſtillation of Spirits, you muſt not make the fire too ſtrong, for they coming forth with a great deal of violence, would elſe be apt to break either the Retort or the Receiver.</p>
                     <p>Though the <hi>Guaiacum</hi> that is uſed be a very dry body, yet abundance of liquor is drawn from it; for if you put into the Retort four pounds of this Wood, at ſixteen ounces to the pound, you'l draw nine and thirty ounces of Spirit and Phlegm, and five ounces and a half of Oil; there will remain in the Retort nineteen ounces of coals, from which you may draw half an ounce or ſix drachms of an Alkali ſalt.</p>
                     <p>The Oil of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> is acrimonious by reaſon of the Salts it has carried along with it; and it is the gravity of theſe ſalts that does precipitate it to the bottom of the water. The Oil of Box, and moſt others that are drawn this ſame way, do the like.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſorts of Oil are good for the Tooth-ach, becauſe they ſtop the nerve with their ramous parts, hindring thereby the air from entring. Moreover by means of the acrimonious ſalts which they contain they do diſſipate a phlegm which uſes
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48366:214"/>
to get within the gum, and cauſes the pain, but yet by reaſon of their fetid ſmell men have much ado to take them into their mouth.</p>
                     <p>That which is called Spirit of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a diſſolution of the Eſſential ſalt of the Plant in a little phlegm.</p>
                     <p>The fixt ſalt is an Alkali that works much like others of that kind, nevertheleſs it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the fixt ſalts of Vegetables, let them be never ſo much Calcined, do always retain ſome particular virtue of the Plant they were drawn from.</p>
                     <p>If one would take the pains to Calcine the earth that remains, he would obtain a ſalt, though but very little of it.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Papyrus</hi> of the Antients, which gave the name to our PAPER, was a tree growing in <hi>Aegypt</hi> near the river <hi>Nilus.</hi> The bark of this tree was prepared, and men did write upon it, but our Paper is made of old rags or clouts, which are beaten exceeding fine in Paper-mills, and then put into the preſs in order to make Paper with them.</p>
               <p>This Paper has ſome uſe in Phyſick; pieces of it are lighted in a room, and Hyſterical women are
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48366:214"/>
made to receive the fume of it; they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relieved with this diſagreeable ſmell, as by many others of the like nature.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Oil and Spirit of Paper.</head>
                  <p>Fold white paper into little pellets and fill a great earthen Retort, or glaſs one luted, with them, place your Retort in a Reverberatory furnace. Fit to it a large capacious Receiver, lute well the junctures, give it a very little fire for two hours only to heat the Retort; increaſe it with two or three coals, and continue it ſo for two or three hours, then quicken it to the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. The Receiver will be filled with white clouds, put out the fire, when no more will come forth, the operation will be ended in ſeven or eight hours. When the veſſels are cold, unlute them, pour what you find in the Receiver into a Tunnel lined with a coffin of brown paper, the Spirit will paſs through the filter, and a thick, black, and ill-ſcented oil will remain within it, keep the oil for uſe in a Viol.</p>
                  <p>It is a very good remedy in deafneſs, ſome drops of it are put into the ear with a little cotton, from time to time, it quiets the noiſe of the ear; it is alſo good for Tettars and for the Itch, the parts being anointed a little with it; it cures the tooth-ach, much like the Oil of <hi>Guaiacum;</hi> it is good likewiſe to repreſs hyſterical vapours, women ſo affected are to ſmell to it.</p>
                  <p>You muſt rectifie the Spirit, by diſtilling it in ſand. It is an Aperitive, and may be given where
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48366:215"/>
there is occaſion for a diuretick, the doſe is from ſix drops to twenty in ſome proper liquor.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Vitriol and other drogues which are in Ink might alter the virtue of the Oil and Spirit of paper; wherefore it is better to uſe clean, than written paper. The receiver muſt be large, in order to give room to the vapours to circulate in, for they come forth with that force that they would break the veſſel if they had not room enough to play in; you muſt manage the fire with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for if you make it too great the firſt hours, the Spirits will break the Retort.</p>
                     <p>If you have uſed in this operation four and twenty ounces of paper, you will draw two ounces and two drachms of Oil, and thirteen ounces and a half of Spirit, there will remain in the Retort ſeven ounces and a half of coals.</p>
                     <p>The Oil does not paſs with the Spirit, through the coffin in the tunnel, becauſe it is too thick, its black colour, and its ill ſmell, do come from the fire.</p>
                     <p>It is good for deafneſs, becauſe that diſeaſe is often cauſed by a thick or phlegmatick humor which dries and hardens in the ear ſo as to ſtop the auditory nerve. Now this Oil diſſolves and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies this humor, and diſpoſes it the better to come out. And this is the reaſon that it diſſipates the noiſes in the ears, for they were cauſed by winds which this humor had ſhut in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="389" facs="tcp:48366:215"/>The Spirit is very acid in compariſon with other Spirits of Vegetables, becauſe it comes from an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential ſalt which has been put into a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motion. Again, it is probable that by the many different forms which the flax, and canvas have received, in order to make cloth, and afterwards Paper, and by the fermentations which they may have received, their fixed ſalt may be volatilized, and become of the nature of that which is called Eſſential. Now in the diſtillation all this ſalt has been diſſolved into a liquor by the phlegm, and turned into that which is called Spirit; that which confirms me in this ſentiment is that there can be hardly any fixed ſalt at all drawn from the coal which remains in the Retort, wherefore the coal is thrown away as uſeleſs, it takes fire exceeding eaſily, by reaſon of a light ſoot that is fallen upon it, and which gave it the black colour.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>CInnamon</hi> is the Bark of a Tree as large as an Olive Tree, it grows in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and is much like that which the <hi>Caſſia Lignea</hi> is taken from, but it is not the very ſame, as ſome will needs think; the beſt <hi>Cinnamon</hi> is that which has the ſtrongeſt ſmell, is quick upon the taſte, and of a reddiſh colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:48366:216"/>The <hi>Caſſia Lignea</hi> differs from <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> in that it is not ſo biting to the taſte, ſmells not ſo ſtrong, and becomes mucilaginous in the mouth when it is chewed, which <hi>Cinnamon</hi> doth not do.</p>
               <p>Both <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> and <hi>Caſſia Lignea</hi> are good to fortifie the ſtomach, to help perſpiration of groſs humors, to ſtrengthen and rejoice the heart, and in hyſterical caſes.</p>

                  <head>Oil, or Eſſence of Cinnamon, and its Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real water.</head>
                  <p>Bruiſe four pounds of good Cinnamon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it in ſix quarts of hot water, leave it in dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in an earthen veſſel well ſtopt two days: pour the Infuſion into a large Copper Limbeck, and fitting a Receiver to it, and luting cloſe the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures with a wet bladder, diſtil with a pretty good fire three or four pints of the liquor, then unlute the Limbeck, and pour into it by Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the diſtilled water, you'l find at bottom a little oil which you muſt pour into a Viol, and ſtop it cloſe. Diſtil the liquor as before, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the water into the Limbeck, take the Oil you find at bottom of the Receiver, and mix it with the firſt: Repeat this Cohobation until there riſes no more Oil; then take away the fire, and diſtil the water that remains in the Receiver, the ſame way I ſhall ſhew hereafter to rectifie Spirit of wine, you'l have an excellent ſpirituous Cinnamon wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:48366:216"/>The Oil of Cinnamon is an admirable Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; it ſtrengthens the ſtomach, and aſſiſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her evacuations. It is given to make wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have an eaſie delivery, and to bring their Terms; it likewiſe encreaſes Seed; a drop of it is commonly mixed in a little Sugar-Candy to make the <hi>Eleo-ſaccharum,</hi> which is eaſily diſſolved in Cordial, or Hyſterical waters.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirituous water of Cinnamon hath the ſame virtues, but two or three drachms are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for a doſe.</p>
                  <p>After this manner almoſt all the Oils of Odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Vegetables may be drawn, ſuch as thoſe of Box, Roſes, Roſemary, Lavender, Juniper, Cloves, and Anis-ſeed, which do either ſwim above the water, or fall to the bottom, according as they are more or leſs loaded with Salts.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>You muſt make the fire ſtrong enough, for if there be not a ſufficient heat, the Oil will not riſe.</p>
                     <p>The Cohobation ſerves to open the Body the more, that the Oil may compleat its ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cinnamon</hi> yields leſs Oil than other woods, or Barks, and it is very difficult to draw ſix drachms of it out of four pounds, let it be never ſo good.</p>
                     <p>The Spirituous water of <hi>Cinnamon</hi> is nothing but a rarefied Oil, whoſe parts are ſeparated in the water by Fermentation, ſo as they become imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible: they do make what is called a volatile Spirit, which eaſily mixes with all ſorts of liquors, as doth the <hi>Eleo-ſaccharum;</hi> for the <hi>Eleo-ſaccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the Bark of Peru.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi> called <hi>Quinquina,</hi> or <hi>Kina Kina</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> is a Bark that has been brought into theſe parts, ſome years ſince, from <hi>Peru;</hi> it retains the name of the Tree from which it is taken, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do call it <hi>Palo de Calenturas,</hi> or the wood againſt Feavers. There are two kinds of this Tree, the one is cultivated, and the other grows wild, the cultivated is much better than the other; you muſt chooſe it of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact ſubſtance, bitter to the taſte, and of a reddiſh colour.</p>
               <p>It is the moſt certain remedy that ever yet was known, to hinder the fits of Agues. The manner of uſing it for a great while paſt has been to give the patient the powder from half a drachm to two drachms, with a little white-wine, at the coming of the fit. But this method has been quite changed in our days, for at preſent we do infuſe an ounce of the powder in two quarts of wine, eight and forty hours, in a <hi>Balneum;</hi> the infuſion is then ſtrained, and the patient is made to drink every day three or four little glaſſes of it, at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Paroxyſm. The uſe of this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is continued a fortnight at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Some do frequently add to the infuſion of this <hi>Bark,</hi> the leſſer Centaury, Wormwood, Chervil,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48366:218"/>
Juniper-berries, the bark of the Alder-tree, Saſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fras, Salt of Tartar, and divers other ingredients, thought to be <hi>Febrifuges.</hi> But the baſis of all is the <hi>Bark of Peru,</hi> the reſt of the ingredients do no great good. Some do likewiſe mix with it a little <hi>Opium,</hi> but that ought not to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deal of precaution.</p>
               <p>You muſt obſerve to purge your patient well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you give him the <hi>Bark,</hi> becauſe this remedy ſhuts up the humors for ſome time, and when they come to ferment a-new, they do ſometimes cauſe more dangerous maladies than he had before, ſuch as <hi>Aſthma's,</hi> dropſies, rheumatiſms, dyſenteries, ſuppreſſion of the <hi>menſes</hi> in women, and many others which have too too often ſucceeded Cures by this <hi>Bark.</hi> For which reaſon many diſeaſed perſons have again wiſhed for their Ague that were cured by this remedy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bark</hi> is likewiſe very ill for thoſe who have any Abſceſs in their body, for it fixes and hardens the humor for ſome time, which afterwards fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and cauſes a gangrene in the part. You muſt forbear the uſe of Milk, and aliments of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when you take this remedy, by reaſon of their cheeſie part, which would lie heavy upon the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and be apt to corrupt in the veſſels.</p>
               <p>It is probable that the <hi>Bark</hi> does check the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Feaver, much after the manner as an Alkali does ſtop the motion of an acid ſalt, that is to ſay, it unites with it, and makes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a kind of <hi>Coagulum;</hi> this humor does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly remain quiet a fortnight, and the perſon cured does find himſelf a little ſwelled and heavy, eſpecially if he were not purged, before he took it.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48366:218"/>
Afterwards the Ague returns becauſe the feaveriſh humor having been agitated by the Spirits, or elſe being joyned with other humors of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which have been preparing in the body during the fornights reſpite, it gets quit from the <hi>Bark,</hi> and ferments as it did before.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes, and that eſpecially when the body of one in an Ague has been well cleanſed, if you ſhould perſiſt in continuing the uſe of the <hi>Bark,</hi> you will ſo fix the humor that you will diſpoſe it to precipitate and be evacuated, either by ſtool, or urine, or by inſenſible perſpiration, and the Ague returns no more, for the Spirits in our body do by their motion puſh outwards, as much as they are able, whatſoever moleſts the oeconomy of the parts.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Tincture of the Peruvian Bark.</head>
                  <p>This Operation is an extraction of the more oily, and ſeparable parts of the <hi>Bark</hi> by Spirit of wine.</p>
                  <p>Put into a Bolt-head four ounces of good <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Bark</hi> groſly powdered, pour upon it Spirit of wine four fingers height above the matter, fit to it another matraſs in order to make a double veſſel, lute well the junctures, and place your veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to digeſt in horſe-dung, or in a vaporous Bath, four days: ſtir it from time to time, the Spirit of wine will load it ſelf with a red colour, unlute the veſſels, filtrate the <hi>Tincture</hi> through brown paper, and keep it in a viol well ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:48366:219"/>It is a Febrifuge to be given in Agues, three or four times a day, at a diſtance from the fitt, and to be continued for a fortnight; the doſe is from ten drops to a drachm in ſome proper liquor, ſuch as Centaury water, or Juniper, or Wormwood water, or wine.</p>
                  <p>If you put new Spirit of wine to the matter which remains in the matraſs, and ſet it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion as before, you will draw more <hi>Tincture,</hi> but it will not be ſo ſtrong as the other, wherefore you muſt give it in a little larger doſe.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>This <hi>Tincture</hi> works like the <hi>Infuſion</hi> I now ſpoke of; it is a more convenient preparation than the other in this, that it can keep as long as you will, whereas the other does ſowr in a little time. Again thoſe who do not love wine will like it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but I ſhould prefer the <hi>Infuſion</hi> before the <hi>Tincture,</hi> becauſe wine is a more proper <hi>menſtruum</hi> wherewith to draw the ſaline and ſulphureous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a mixt, then Spirit of wine.</p>
                     <p>You may ſteep a few Coriander ſeeds, or a little Cinnamon in the wine or water, and after it is ſtrained off diſſolve ſome ſugar in it, and in this you may mix the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> and ſo make a kind of <hi>Febrifugous Roſſoli,</hi> which Infants may be eaſily made to take of.</p>

                  <p>This Operation is a ſeparation of the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial parts of the <hi>Bark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Put to infuſe warm four and twenty hours eight ounces of <hi>Peruvian Bark</hi> in a ſufficient quantity of diſtilled water of Nuts; afterwards boil the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion gently and ſtrain it, make a ſtrong expreſſion of the reſidence, put it to infuſe in new water of Nuts, boil and ſtrain it as before, mix together what you have ſtrained, and let them ſettle; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant the clear liquor, and evaporate it in a glaſs or earthen veſſel, ſet in a ſand-heat, unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of thick honey.</p>
                  <p>It is a Febrifuge that has the ſame virtues as the former, the doſe is from twelve grains to half a drachm, in Pills, or diſſolved in wine.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Wine and Spirit of wine are very proper to draw forth the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> but they are by no means good to make the <hi>Extract</hi> with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the evaporation the Spirit carries away with it the more ſubtile parts of the mixt. The water of Nuts is much more convenient, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it loſes leſs of the volatile ſubſtance, it is a little febrifugous itſelf. Inſtead of this water you might uſe thoſe of <hi>Juniper-berries,</hi> the leſſer Centaury, or Wormwood-water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="398" facs="tcp:48366:220"/>The <hi>Extract</hi> is convenient for thoſe who cannot endure the taſte of remedies, for it may be given in Pills wrapped up in a wafer, without partaking of the taſte. But I ſhould prefer the Infuſion, or the <hi>Bark</hi> in ſubſtance, before this preparation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible to avoid the evaporation of the more ſubtile parts in the ebullition of it, uſe what precaution you will to preſerve them.</p>
                     <p>You may draw the <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> from the reſidence that remains, after you have drawn the <hi>Extract,</hi> or the <hi>Tincture.</hi> You muſt dry it, and burn and calcine the aſhes in a crucible, then ſteep them in hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ten or twelve hours, boil them an hour, and then filtrate this <hi>lixivium,</hi> and evaporate the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in an earthen pan or glaſs veſſel in ſand, there will remain a ſalt at bottom, which you muſt keep in a bottle well ſtopt. This ſalt is an alkali, as are all other fixed ſalts drawn from plants, it is aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it may be given for a quartan Ague; the doſe is from ten grains to a ſcruple in ſome proper liquor.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not think that this ſalt retains all the virtues of the <hi>Bark,</hi> they are rather all deſtroyed in the calcination.</p>
                     <p>Nor may we think to ſeparate the Febrifugous virtue of this <hi>Bark,</hi> by diſtilling it dry in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort; for on the contrary, this would deſtroy it, by breaking the natural harmony and union of its parts, and you would get only a ſtinking Spirit, and a burnt oil, which would be of no great uſe.</p>

                     <p>I have given you this Preparation to ſerve upon an emergence, when you want in haſte the <hi>Oil of Cloves,</hi> you muſt only uſe hot aſhes to warm the <hi>Cloves,</hi> if you deſire to have a white Oil, for if you give a greater heat, the Oil turns red, and loſes a good part of it. You muſt alſo take care to lift up the Cup from time to time, to ſtir about the powder of <hi>Cloves.</hi> The <hi>Oil of Cloves</hi> may be likewiſe drawn, if you pleaſe, like that of <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you uſe a pound of <hi>Cloves,</hi> to diſtil <hi>per deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> according to the deſcription I have given, you'l draw an ounce and two drachms of white Oil, and an ounce of Spirit; there will remain thirteen ounces and two drachms of matter, from whence might ſtill be drawn a little red Oil.</p>
                     <p>It is likely that the <hi>Oil of Cloves</hi> works in eaſing the tooth-ach much after the ſame manner as I ſaid the Oil of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> did. But this Oil having an agreeable ſmell with it, there is no difficulty in admitting the application of this, as there was in the other.</p>
                     <p>Some do diſſolve <hi>Opium</hi> in <hi>Oil of Cloves,</hi> and do uſe this diſſolution for the tooth-ach; they do put one drop of it into the aking tooth, and this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies the pain in a very little time, by reaſon of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48366:221"/>
the <hi>Opium,</hi> but there is one thing to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from this uſe of <hi>Opiates,</hi> and that is deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſome have thereby become deaf, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that rarely happens.</p>
                     <p>You may rectifie the <hi>Spirit of Cloves</hi> by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it in ſand. And when you have diſtilled two thirds of it, you muſt keep it in a Viol well ſtopt, and fling away the phlegm which remains at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Cucurbite. The <hi>Spirit of Cloves</hi> is a good ſtomachick, it is good to help concoction, to comfort the heart, to perſpire ill humors, and to provoke Seed; the doſe is from ſix drops to twenty in ſome convenient liquor.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>N<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tmeg</hi> is the fruit of a Tree as big as a Pear-Tree, which grows in the Iſle <hi>Banda</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> It is called <hi>Nuciſta, Nux Moſchata, Myriſtica, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentaria,</hi> and <hi>Aromatites.</hi> While it is green, it is clothed with two Barks, but when it comes to maturity, the uppermoſt chaps, and lets the ſecond appear, which is tender, and very fragrant. This laſt Bark is called <hi>Mace,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly the <hi>Flower of Nutmegs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The beſt <hi>Nutmeg</hi> is that which is moſt weighty; it is mixed in Carminative, &amp; Hyſterical Remedies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:48366:222"/>Sometimes a ſort of <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> called <hi>Male-Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg,</hi> is found at the Druggiſt, which differs from the common ſort, in that it is longer and weaker.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Oil of Nutmeg.</head>
                  <p>Take ſixteen ounces of good <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> beat them in a Mortar, until they are almoſt in a Paſte, and put them upon a boulter; cover them with a piece of ſtrong Cloth, and an earthen pan over that; put your cloth over a kettle half filled with water, and ſet the kettle upon the fire, that the vapour of the water may gently warm the <hi>Nutmegs;</hi> when you ſhall find upon touching the pan, that it is ſo hot you cannot endure your hand upon it, you muſt take off the boulter, and putting the matter into a linnen cloth, take its four corners, and tye them quickly together; put them into a preſs between a couple of warm plates, ſet the pan underneath, and there will come forth an Oil which congeals as it grows cold: expreſs the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as ſtrongly as you are able, to draw out all the Oil; then keep it in a pot well ſtopt; this Oil is very ſtomachick, being applyed outwardly, or elſe given inwardly. The doſe is from four grains to ten in broth, or ſome more convenient liquor. It is commonly mixed with Oil of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich,</hi> to chafe the Region of the ſtomach. And this way the green Oils of Anis-ſeed, Fennil, Dill, and Mace, may be drawn.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The <hi>Nutmegs</hi> muſt be well beaten, or elſe they will yield little Oil; this way of warming them is called the <hi>Vaporous Bath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ordinary method is to heat the <hi>Nutmegs</hi> in a kettle, and then expreſs them ſtrongly, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the warming them that way carries off a great deal of its volatile parts, the Oil never proves ſo good, as when made with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have mentioned; for thus the matter heats inſenſibly by the vapour of the water, and alters not its virtue in the leaſt; and if any water doth mix with the <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> it is eaſily ſeparated from the Oil. They who deſire to have it very fragrant, may ſet it over a veſſel of wine inſtead of water.</p>
                     <p>If you draw the Oil from ſixteen ounces of Anis-ſeed, the way I have deſcribed, you may obtain from ſix drachms to nine drachms and a half of it, according to the goodneſs of the Anis-ſeed you uſe, this Oil will be of a green colour.</p>
                     <p>The Oils of Almonds, Wall-nuts, Gold ſeeds, Hazle nuts, Poppy, and Behen, muſt be only bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſo put into the preſs, without heating becauſe they do yield their Oils very eaſily, and becauſe theſe Oils are often taken inwardly, it is better to draw them without the help of fire, to avoid the Empyreumatical impreſſion it would otherwiſe take.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Diſtillation of an Odoriferous Plant, ſuch as Balm, its Extract, and fixt Salt.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TAke a good quantity of <hi>Balm</hi> newly gathered, when it is in its vigour: beat it well in a Mortar, and put it into a large earthen pot, make a ſtrong decoction of other Balm, and pour of it into the pot enough to ſwet it ſufficiently; cover the pot, and leave it two days indigeſtion; then put the Matter into a large <hi>Copper Veſica,</hi> and cover it with its Refrigeratory, or Head, Tin'd on the inſide: ſet it in a Furnace, and fitting to it a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver lute the junctures with a wet bladder; make a fire of the ſecond degree under it, and diſtil about half the water you poured upon the <hi>Balm,</hi> then let the Veſſels cool, and unlute them: You'l find in the Receiver a very good <hi>Balm-water,</hi> put it into a bottle, and expoſe it to the Sun five or ſix days open, then ſtop it, and keep it for uſe. It is uſed in Hyſterical Maladies, in the Palſie, Apoplexy, and Malignant Feavers, it is given from two to ſix ounces.</p>
               <p>Expreſs through a linnen cloth ſtrongly that which remains in the body, and let the Expreſſion ſettle; filter it, and evaporate the water with a gentle heat in an Earthen veſſel, until there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains an Extract in the conſiſtence of thick hony.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48366:223"/>
'Tis a good remedy for ſuch diſeaſes as proceed from corrupt Humors, it works by perſpiration, or by Urine: the doſe is from a Scrupule to a Drachm, diſſolved in its proper water.</p>
               <p>Dry the Reſidence that remains after expreſſion, and burn it with good ſtore of other <hi>Balm</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dried, you may obtain an Alkali ſalt from the aſhes by a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> the ſame way I ſpoke of concerning the ſalt of <hi>Guaiacum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Salt is Aperitive, and Sudorifick, the doſe is from ten grains to a Scrupule in <hi>Balm-water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Water, Extract, and Salt of all Odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Plants, ſuch as <hi>Sage, Marjoram, Time, Mint, Hyſſop, &amp;c.</hi> may be drawn after the ſame manner.</p>
               <div type="remarks">
                  <head>Remarks.</head>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome will think it ſtrange that I add water for the diſtillation of <hi>Balm,</hi> but thoſe who uſe to work on this ſort of Herbs do know well enough, that being dry ſubſtances of themſelves, there is no good diſtilling them without firſt wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them; and beſides, the water that is added doth only ſerve to imbibe the volatile parts, as the Fermentation operates; and when the matter is heated, the more ſpirituous part as being the lighter riſes firſt, and ſavours much leſs of the <hi>Empyreume,</hi> than if the herb were diſtilled without firſt wetting it.</p>
                  <p>You muſt obſerve in theſe diſtillations to give a fire from the ſecond to the third degree, becauſe if it were made too little, none of the Eſſential or volatile Salt of the Plant would riſe; and if it
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48366:224"/>
were too ſtrong, the water would taſte of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreume:</hi> wherefore to make a good diſtillation, you muſt let one drop follow another ſlowly.</p>
                  <p>The waters ſo ſoon as they are diſtilled, have commonly no great ſmell, but when they have lain ſome time in the Sun, their ſpirituous parts that were condenſed in the <hi>Phlegm,</hi> do diſplay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and exert their activity; for which reaſon it is that the water becomes fragrant which was not ſo before.</p>
                  <p>The Extract doth contain almoſt all the Eſſential Salt of the Plant, wherefore it is of greater vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue than the water; you muſt take care to Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate the liquor with a mild heat, for fear too much ſhould carry off this ſalt, which is but too volatile of its own nature; for it is in the ſalt that the principal virtue of the Plant doth conſiſt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>TAke a good quantity of <hi>Carduus,</hi> when it is in its prime; pound it in a Mortar, and fill with it two thirds of a Limbeck; draw by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion a ſufficient quantity of the Juyce of other
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48366:224"/>
                  <hi>Carduus,</hi> and pour it into the Limbeck, that the herbs ſwimming in the Juyce may incur no danger of ſticking to the bottom during the diſtillation: diſtil with a fire of the ſecond degree about half as much water as you uſed juyce, this water is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifick. It is uſed to drive out the Small-Pox, and in the Plague.</p>
               <p>Expreſs through a cloth that which remains in the Limbeck, let the juyce ſettle, and after it is filtred, Evaporate with a ſmall fire about two thirds of the liquor, in an earthen or glaſs veſſel: ſet this veſſel in a cool place, and leave it there eight or ten days, there will ſhoot out Cryſtals round about the veſſel, ſeparate them, and keep them in a Viol well ſtopt. Theſe Cryſtals are called the <hi>Eſſential ſalt;</hi> it is Sudorifick, the doſe is from ſix to ſixteen grains in its proper diſtilled water.</p>

                  <p>The hot Plants have much more of this Salt than others; <hi>Lettice</hi> contains leſs than <hi>Succory, Succory</hi> leſs than <hi>Sorrel,</hi> and ſo of the reſt.</p>

                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:48366:225"/>Seeing it is in the Salt that the virtue of the plant conſiſts, I would adviſe rather to uſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Plants than their diſtilled water, when the Plants are in ſeaſon, and when they are out, then to have recourſe to diſtilled waters, and mix with them a little of their <hi>Eſſential Salt,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of Sugar.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gar</hi> is the eſſential ſalt of a reed or cane that grows in many places, and eſpecially in the Weſtern Iſlands. The pulp in the trunk of this plant is taken and waſhed, and then ſteeped in hot water, this water is ſtrained, and evaporated, and the <hi>Sugar</hi> remains at bottom; heretofore it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mel arundinaceum,</hi> or the Cane-honey, but ſince it has been called <hi>Zucharum,</hi> or <hi>Saccharum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt elaboration that is given to <hi>Sugar,</hi> is to purifie it, by diſſolving it in water, filtrating and evaporating the liquor, after which it is made up into Loaves, or elſe it is ſent in Casks or Cheſts, and is called <hi>Caſſonnade,</hi> or <hi>Caſtonnade.</hi> There are of it the red, the brown, and the white
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48366:225"/>
                  <hi>Sugar,</hi> according as it has been more or leſs puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it differs in colour. The name <hi>Caſtonnade</hi> may have been derived from the Casks in which it is brought, called <hi>Caſt</hi> by the Germans.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Sugar</hi> has been refined no more then aboveſaid, it is a little fat; now to refine it far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is diſſolved in Lime-water, it is boiled, and the ſcum taken off; when it is ſufficiently boiled, it is caſt into molds of a Pyramidal form, which have a hole at bottom to let the more glutionous part run through, and ſeparate.</p>
               <p>It is ſtill farther refined by boiling it with the whites of eggs in water, for the glutinous quality of the whites of eggs does help to receive and take away the impurities which might remain in the <hi>Sugar,</hi> and the boiling of it ſerving to drive them all to the ſides of the veſſel in a ſcum, the liquor is paſſed through a cloth, and then evaporated to a due conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sugar-Candy</hi> is only a Sugar cryſtallized; the way to make it, is to boil refined Sugar in water to the conſiſtence of a thick Syrop, it is then poured into pots, wherein little ſticks have been laid in order; it is left in a ſtill place ſome days without ſtirring, and you have the <hi>Sugar-Candy</hi> ſticking to thoſe ſticks. <hi>Red Sugar-Candy</hi> is made after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sugar</hi> is good for infirmities of the breaſt and lungs, becauſe it does attenuate and cut the phlegm which ſometimes oppreſſes the fibres of theſe parts, but you muſt uſe it as little as may be in hyſterical caſes, by reaſon that it raiſes vapours. <hi>Red-Sugar</hi> is ſometimes mixed with deterſive Clyſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:48366:226"/>Its ſweetneſs does proceed from an eſſential acid ſalt mixed with ſome oily parts of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, as I have already explicated in the Remarks upon <hi>Oil of Antimony</hi> prepared with Sugar.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſſonnade,</hi> or Cask-ſugar makes a ſweeter impreſſion upon the tongue than our finer Sugar, becauſe it contains more viſcous or fat parts, which do remain the longer upon the nerve of the tongue, and this makes us ſometimes prefer the firſt, as to uſe, before the other. And for the ſame reaſon the finer a Sugar is, the quicker it paſſes off the taſte. <hi>Sugar-candy</hi> is better for Rheums than common Sugar, becauſe being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it requires a longer time to melt in the mouth, and beſides it keeps the breaſt moiſter than the common Sugar.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Spirit of Sugar.</head>
                  <p>This Spirit is a mixture of the acid part of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar with the Flowers of <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Powder and mix eight ounces of white Sugar-candy with four ounces of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> put this mixture into a glaſs, or earthen body, whoſe third only is thereby filled, fit a head to the body, and place it in a ſand-furnace; joyn a receiver to it, and lute well the junctures with a wet blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, give it a ſmall fire for an hour only to heat the veſſel, then increaſe it to the ſecond degree, there will diſtil a liquor drop by drop, and towards the end there will riſe white vapours into the head; increaſe your fire ſtill more, until nothing more comes forth; let the veſſels cool and unlute
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:48366:226"/>
them, you will find in the receiver ſeven ounces of a brown liquor, that has but an ill ſmell, and a little black oil ſtuck to the ſides, pour it all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a glaſs-body, and having fitted to it a head and receiver, and luted the joints, diſtil in ſand ſix ounces of a very acid ſpirit, that is clear and agreeable to the taſte, and without any ſmell of Empyreum.</p>
                  <p>It is a good aperitive againſt the gravel, and the dropſie, it is good to ſtop <hi>diarrhea's,</hi> and dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries with, it may be dropt into the Tincture of Roſes, inſtead of other acid Spirits. Some do think it good for diſeaſes of the breaſt; the doſe is eight or ten drops, or to an agreeable acidity in ſome proper liquor.</p>
                  <p>That which remains in the body after the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is a foetid oil, which may be outwardly uſed to cleanſe old ulcers.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Spirit of common Sugar is made without addition of any thing in the preparation; it is an acid Spirit, but is not ſo ſtrong, nor has ſo great virtues, as that which I have now deſcribed. It is thought good for diſeaſes of the breaſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sugar, which indeed is good for them, but ſo ſtrong an acid is apt to give a Cough.</p>
                     <p>The body muſt be big enough, in order to give room to the vapours to circulate in, as they do riſe.</p>
                     <p>A very little Oil of Sugar can be drawn in this operation; for that which remains after the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48366:227"/>
is not a pure oil, but a remainder of the Spirit tinged with ſome drops of oil, inſomuch that it would be very hard to get one drachm of pure Oil.</p>

               <p>In the making of <hi>White-wine,</hi> the <hi>Muſte</hi> of white Grapes is left to Ferment all alone; but <hi>Claret</hi> muſt Ferment with the <hi>Faeces</hi> of the Grapes; whence it comes to paſs that the Red is loaded with more <hi>Tartar</hi> than the White, and remains longer in the body after it is drunk. The wines of hot Countrys do commonly more abound with Tartar than others, by reaſon of the abundance of Salts which they attract from the earth. <hi>Muſcat,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Wines</hi> do not endure a Fermentation, until good part of the Phlegm is evaporated, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the heat of the Sun, or by fire; and this is the reaſon they become ſo glutinous as they do, almoſt like Syrup.

Fermentations to the <hi>Muſte.</hi> Now let us conſider what it is that happens in theſe Fermentations.</p>

                  <hi>Muſte</hi> is a ſweet liquor that ſends no vapours to the head to Intoxicate, though one drinks never ſo much. If you diſtil it, there will riſe firſt of all, good ſtore of <hi>Inſipid water,</hi> after that a fetid <hi>Oil</hi> with a few weak <hi>Spirits,</hi> which are nothing but an <hi>Eſſential Salt</hi> diſſolved; and laſtly there will remain a terreſtrious maſs, out of which may be drawn ſome quantity of fixt ſalt by making a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> as we draw other alkali ſalts; but among all theſe ſubſtances we find none of thoſe Spirits that uſe to make <hi>Brandy,</hi> and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs when <hi>Muſte</hi> hath Fermented for ſome time, it turns into Wine from whence you may draw a conſiderable quantity of Inflammable Spirits.</p>
               <p>Now to explicate this effect you muſt know that <hi>Muſte</hi> doth contain a great deal of <hi>Eſſential Salt;</hi> this Salt like a volatile, making an effort in the Fermentation to deliver it ſelf from the oily parts with which it was before incumbred, does open and divide them, until by its ſubtile and keen points it hath rarified them into Spirit; this effort of the ſalt does cauſe the Ebullition which happens to wine, and which at the ſame time does help to purifie it; for it ſeparates the groſſer parts of the wine in form of a ſcum, of which ſome part does ſtick to, and petrifie on the ſides of the veſſel, and another part precipitates to the bottom, the firſt is called <hi>Tartar,</hi> the laſt the <hi>Lees</hi> of wine. The inflammable <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> then is nothing but an Oil exalted by Salts, and this is an indubitable proof of what I eſtabliſh, that there was nothing but oil in the <hi>Muſte,</hi> which was capable of taking
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48366:228"/>
fire: theſe ſame ſalts alſo being a little freed from the cover they were wrapt in, are they that change the wallowiſh ſweetneſs of <hi>Muſte</hi> into an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tartneſs, ſuch as we perceive in our <hi>French Wines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is likewiſe remarkable that a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Phlegm is requiſite for the better ſeparation of the Salts in their Fermentation, and an Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Oil; for otherwiſe ſeveral changes are apt to happen: for example, when <hi>Muſcat,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh wine</hi> are made, a great deal of Phlegm is ſeparated from them; for the <hi>Muſcat Grape</hi> is left to dry in the Sun upon the Branches, before it is gathered to put into the preſs, and ſome part of the liquor of the <hi>Muſte,</hi> with which <hi>Spaniſh wine</hi> is made, is Evaporated before it is ſuffered to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is the cauſe that the Salts not having liberty to expatiate, and to rarifie the Oil as much as they would do if they had room, do make but an imperfect Fermentation. The Oil being thus half exalted, hath ſtill ſtrength enough to hinder the Tartneſs of the ſalt, and therefore only tickling the Nerves of the tongue, makes us perceive in theſe liquors a ſweet taſte. And this is alſo the reaſon, why fewer Spirits are drawn from <hi>Muſcat</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh wines,</hi> than from <hi>French wines;</hi> for whereas the Spirit of Wine doth conſiſt in a rarified Oil, there muſt needs be fewer Spirits in thoſe, than in <hi>French wines.</hi> But much more of a groſs Oil is drawn by diſtillation from thoſe half fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Wines.</p>
               <p>If on the contrary the <hi>Muſte</hi> ſhould be loaded with too much phlegm, as it happens often enough, there follows another imperfect Fermentation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:48366:228"/>
the Salts being too much weakned by it are not able ſufficiently to cut and exalt the parts of Oil, whence it comes to paſs that theſe Wines are ſubject to turn aigre, or to ſowre. The Wines of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Provence</hi> being extreamly loaded with <hi>Tartar,</hi> are groſſer than the Wines of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> and <hi>Champaigne,</hi> becauſe their Spirits are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with abundance of Salt and Earth. Wherefore the goodneſs of Wine may be ſaid to proceed from a convenient proportion of phlegm and <hi>Tartar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is objected to this laſt diſcourſe, that the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareous</hi> part being in a natural way ſeparated from the Wine, ſhould in no wiſe diminiſh the quantity nor the ſtrength of the Spirituous and inflammable part.</p>
               <p>But when I aſſerted that the Spirits of divers Wines are extreamly loaded with <hi>Tartar,</hi> I did not mean that <hi>Tartar</hi> which petrifies at the ſides of the veſſels, for that is at quiet, and does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Exaltation of Spirits; but I intended a <hi>Tartar</hi> that ſtill remains mixt in the <hi>Wine</hi> after the Fermentation, and which according as it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds more or leſs, does render the <hi>Wines</hi> more or leſs thick and groſs. It is eaſy to ſee this <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> I ſpeak of, if you Evaporate the <hi>aqueous</hi> part of <hi>Wine,</hi> for it will remain at bottom in form of <hi>Lees.</hi> Nevertheleſs there is no need of eſtabliſhing two ſorts of <hi>Tartar</hi> in one kind of <hi>Wine,</hi> for the former is only the more ſoluble part of the other.</p>
               <p>Divers little Objections have likewiſe been made me on this ſubject, for want of duly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining what I have eſtabliſhed. Wherefore I do not deſire to enlarge in the relation of them,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48366:229"/>
for I do aim as much as I can, to avoid Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being good for nothing but to ſwell a Book and tire the Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wine</hi> diminiſhes the appetite, as ſaith <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and the cauſe may be, becauſe the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirits it is charged with, do dull and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Ferment of the Stomach, which by its irritation cauſed hunger.</p>
               <p>Vinous liquors may be made of all Fruits, and many other things, by means of Fermentation, as from Apples, Pears, Honey, and Hopps. In like manner Berries, Seeds, Leaves, and Flowers, may be made to Ferment: but becauſe ſeveral of theſe things are naturally too dry to ferment eaſily, they muſt be wetted with water, after they are beaten; and to quicken their Fermentation, a little <hi>Yeſt</hi> is to be added, and by this means liquors are made, whence burning Spirits may be drawn, as well as from <hi>Wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which happens in the fermentation of Wines, may ſerve very well to explicate many diſeaſes, but eſpecially the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> for it is very probable that in this diſeaſe the bloud does boil and ferment in the veſſels much after the manner as Wine ferments in a veſſel.</p>
               <p>The little <hi>puſtules</hi> of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> are a <hi>Tartar</hi> which is ſeparated from the bloud to the skin, after the ſame manner as the <hi>Tartar</hi> ſeparates from the Wine to the ſides of the veſſel, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have the ſame effect as ſalt in corroding the skin.</p>
               <p>Infants are more ſubject to this diſeaſe than el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perſons, becauſe their bloud is more like to <hi>Muſte,</hi> and conſequently is more ſubject to ferment.</p>

                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:48366:229"/>The <hi>Small-pox</hi> does uſually happen but once in a mans life, juſt as <hi>Muſte</hi> does ferment alſo but once.</p>

                        <hi>Brandy</hi> is a Spirit of wine loaded with phlegm, that it hath carried with it in the diſtillation; theſe Spirits do always riſe firſt, and ſo it is known that there remain no more in the Cucurbite, when the liquor that diſtils is no longer inflammable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brandy</hi> may be drawn from all ſorts of Wines, but more of it may be drawn in ſome Countries than others. For example, the Wines that are made about <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> do yield greater plenty of <hi>Brandy</hi> than many others which ſeem to be ſtronger; and the reaſon is, that thoſe Wines which appear ſtronger, being loaded with a great deal of <hi>Tartar,</hi> have their Spirits as it were fixed, whereas the others containing but a convenient portion of this <hi>Tartar,</hi> do leave their Spirits at greater liberty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:48366:230"/>When Wine has been drunk, there is made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Spirits in the body, much reſembling that which is made by diſtillation: for the heat of the bowels warming it, cauſes the Spirituous parts to ſpread on all ſides through the pores, and ſome part of them to mix with the bloud, and rarefie it, from whence it comes to rejoyce the heart, and encreaſe the vigour of the whole body; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Spirits do always tend upwards, the greateſt part flies into the brain, where it quickens its motion, and produces a certain gaiety of mind that is wont to furniſh us with many excellent thoughts.</p>
                     <p>But now if wine moderately taken is ſo profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the Functions of the body, it likewiſe cauſes many miſchiefs, when it is exceſſively uſed; for the Spirituous parts riſing in great abundance do circulate in the brain with ſo much celerity, that they ſoon confound the whole Oeconomy. And then the objects will appear double, and the walls of the place where one is, ſeem to have changed their ordinary ſituation.</p>
                     <p>This Confuſion remains until the Spirits having ſome good time diſſolved the phlegm, do in part condenſe with it, and in part ſpend through the pores.</p>
                     <p>It likewiſe then happens, that a man is prone to ſleep, becauſe the <hi>Pituita</hi> being attenuated either by the Spirits of wine, or by the phlegm they have drawn along with them, glides into the ſmall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the brain, and retards the Circulation of the Animal Spirits, by gluing them together; for after the ſame manner as the motion of the Spirits in the Brain doth beget watchfulneſs, ſo their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48366:230"/>
or condenſation produces ſleep. But I ſhall ſpeak more amply of this ſubject hereafter, when I come to treat of the effects of <hi>Opium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſleep which is cauſed through exceſs of Wine doth uſually remain until the Animal Spirits have rarefied this phlegm, and opened a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Thoſe who are intoxicated with Beer, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or ſome ſuch like liquor, do remain in their Drunkenneſs a longer time, and ſleep more after it, than thoſe who are drunk with Wine, becauſe the Spirit of theſe liquors, carrying along with it a viſcous phlegm into the brain, remains a longer time in the diſengaging it ſelf, and paſſing through the pores. Again it is the viſcoſity of this phlegm, which entring into the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the brain, does cauſe ſo long a ſleep, becauſe it is ſo hard to rarefie.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Accidents that I have related to proceed from the immoderate uſe of Wine, are but the firſt, and the leſs grievous, though indeed they are but little to be deſired; every body knows that a continuation of frequent debauches doth at laſt render a man dull and ſtupid, and this by reaſon the Spirits of Wine do not only trouble the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Spirits in their functions, and render them Phlegmatick, but likewiſe by rarefying them do ever carry off and loſe ſome ſtore of them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Perſons are likewiſe ſubject to a continual ſpitting, or elſe they are moleſted with defluxions, Catarrhs, and Gout, becauſe the <hi>Pituita</hi> being rendred more liquid by the Spirits and phlegm of vinous liquors, is forced to deſcend through the Lymphatick veſſels; but if there happens to be the leaſt obſtacle in theſe veſſels, it takes its courſe with the Nerves, and falls upon all the parts of the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:48366:231"/>
body. Laſtly, when exceſs of wine does occaſion falling into the Apoplexy, and Palſie, it is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the <hi>Pituita</hi> is rendred too liquid by the Spirits and Phlegm of wine, and cauſes Obſtructions in the head, and hinders the natural courſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into the Nerves. Many other ſad effects of wine-debauches might be here mentioned, but this digreſſion is too long. Let us return to our Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>After the wine hath been deprived of theſe Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Spirits, there remains in the body a Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareous liquor, which being expoſed a good while to the Sun in a Cask without its ſtopple, turns into good Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſome ſuch thing happens in the Bodies of thoſe who accuſtom to drink too much wine; for whereas the volatile parts, which aſcend to the Brain and Heart, by an agitation of the Spirits, do beget Joy; ſo on the contrary the Tartareous parts by fixing the humors about the <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> do cauſe by little and little that which is called Melancholy, which proceeds from an acid; whence it comes to paſs that many men making a debauch upon wine, with deſign to paſs away their Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, do afterwards find they have encreaſed it, when the debauch hath had its effect.</p>
                     <p>If you would by way of curioſity make an exact <hi>Analyſis</hi> of wine, you muſt take that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the body after diſtillation of the <hi>Brandy,</hi> and diſtil off all the phlegm, there will remain a Matter like unto Roſine, put it into a Retort, and placing it in a Furnace, diſtil away more phlegm, in a ſmall fire, until it begins to come ſharp. Then fit a large Receiver to the Retort, and luting well
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48366:231"/>
the junctures, ſtrengthen the fire by degrees, to drive forth acid Spirits, and a little fetid Oil, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the fire until there comes no more.</p>
                     <p>The Oil is ſeparated from the Spirit in a Tunnel lined with brown paper; for the Spirit will paſs through, and the Oil being too thick will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. But it is here remarkable, that more of this Spirit and Oil is drawn from <hi>Muſte,</hi> than wine; which ſufficiently proves the Remark I made before, touching the origine of the volatile Spirit of wine; for ſeeing good ſtore of the Oil of <hi>Muſte</hi> hath contributed to the making volatile Spirit of Wine, there muſt needs remain but very little Oyl, in the liquor that <hi>Brandy</hi> is drawn from.</p>
                     <p>The acid Spirit of wine, and the Black Oil, are like to thoſe of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which I ſhall deſcribe anon. And an alkali ſalt wholly reſembling that of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> may be drawn by a <hi>Lixivium</hi> from the maſs that remains in the Retort.</p>

                     <p>The uſual way of making <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> is by diſtilling <hi>Brandy</hi> in a Limbeck ſo many times over until it comes pure; and to do this, about half the <hi>Brandy</hi> is drawn by diſtillation, and the phlegm that remains at bottom accounted of no uſe. Again, half the Spirit which was diſtilled is anew drawn off, and the phlegm thrown away; theſe Rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are continued, until you find by firing a ſpoonful of the Spirit, that every drop burns, and there remains not the leaſt Phlegm; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Operation is very tedious, and it is a hard matter thus to get a <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> wholly free from Phlegm, even after nine or ten times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating theſe diſtillations, let the fire be never ſo ſmall; Artiſts have invented a long Machine, which they call the <hi>Serpent,</hi> by reaſon of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolutions which it makes. It is fitted to the Cucurbite containing the <hi>Brandy,</hi> and the top made like a Tunnel receives the head, to which a Receiver is fitted, and the junctures well luted, and the veſſel placed in a ſmall fire, the <hi>Spirits of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48366:232"/>
Wine</hi> do riſe by this gentle heat, but the phlegm being too heavy cannot aſcend ſo high, ſo that thus a <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> deprived of its phlegm is had the very firſt time. But becauſe this Machine is hard to carry into the country, and other places where one would deſire to make <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and beſides that it is ſubject to looſen in the joints, through the violence of the Spirits; I have thought that the way I delivered for making <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> was more commodious; for provided you have but a matraſs and a head, it will be an eaſie matter to draw as good <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> as that by the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and there's no need to fear the Spirits breaking any way out of the veſſel, if you do but lute well the junctures, as I have ſaid.</p>
                     <p>The matraſs muſt have a very long neck, that no phlegm may be able to riſe into the Receiver.</p>
                     <p>The vaporous Bath is fitter than any other to perform this Operation in, becauſe a moſt mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat is requiſite to raiſe up the Spirits all alone; now the vapour of water warms very inſenſibly. You muſt continue the ſame degree of fire, until there comes nothing more.</p>
                     <p>Some perſons do endeavour to reject the method that I have deſcribed for drawing <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> becauſe, ſay they, a long time is required to draw a little <hi>Spirit,</hi> and by reaſon of the difficulty they conceive in procuring ſuch veſſels well made, at <hi>Paris,</hi> and much more ſo in the Country.</p>
                     <p>But it is likely theſe Gentlemen do blame this method becauſe they never tried it; for if they had but taken the pains to make <hi>Experiment</hi> of it, they would have found that with two or three of theſe veſſels, they might have drawn as much <hi>Spirit
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48366:233"/>
of Wine,</hi> as they could be able to do with their great Machine; and that this <hi>Spirit</hi> is not liable to the impreſſion which might be communicated to it from <hi>Copper</hi> or <hi>Tin</hi> veſſels. As for the difficulty that there is pretended of getting ſuch glaſs veſſels, there is none at all that I know of, but only for ſuch as will not take the pains to viſit the Glaſs-houſes, for there they would find enough for their turn; and though I uſe a great many of them in my <hi>Courſes of Chymiſtry,</hi> I never was to ſeek for any yet. But ſuppoſe there were none to be found ready made, methinks they might as eaſily beſpeak them, and have them made at the Glaſs-houſes, as well as beſpeak thoſe grand <hi>Copper</hi> or <hi>Tin</hi> Machines, that are commonly uſed. I know that ſuch as are better pleaſed with making a Fair ſhew, than with the effects of things, and who meaſure the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an Operation by the trouble it gives one, and by the greatneſs of veſſels and Furnaces, will find here but little to their ſatisfaction. But I am very little concerned at ſuch mens exceptions, I never endeavoured to follow their Track. My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is ſimply to facilitate the means of working in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and to take away, as much as lies in my power, thoſe things which render it myſterious and dark.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> is good for Lethargical, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectical perſons, becauſe it puts the Spirits into a greater motion than they were in before. Now becauſe according to all appearance theſe Diſeaſes are cauſed by Obſtructions which hinder the courſe of the Spirits into the Brain, this Spirit ſerves to give them a new vigour, to diſſolve and rarefie theſe Tartareous viſcoſities which ſhut up their
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48366:233"/>
paſſage. It likewiſe diſcuſſes Tumors and Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe it not only opens the pores, and gives vent to the ſubtler part of the humor to perſpire, but likewiſe diſſolves and rarefies the groſſer part, ſo as to render it fit to circulate with the blood.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> is excellent for Burnings, provided it be uſed ſo ſoon as they happen; for then it opens a paſſage for the igneous particles to come out at, and if there ſhould remain any within the part, it unites with them as it uſes to do when mixed with an Acid.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> doth likewiſe volatilize, and carry along with it ſome portion of the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> which gives it a very agreeable ſmell, and renders it a good Remedy for Obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>A ſign, that the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> has carried along with it ſome of the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> is this: if you dry gently the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> that remains in the Body, and weigh it, you'l find it diminiſhed an ounce and a half.</p>
                     <p>You may again put this <hi>Spirit of Wine Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized</hi> to half a pound of more <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> and diſtil it as before, but I have found that it is never a-whit the better for it.</p>
                     <p>This way of <hi>Tartarizing Spirit of Wine</hi> is the very beſt and ſhorteſt of all that have been invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether you deſire to make it pure, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate it with <hi>Salt of Tartar;</hi> and I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, that all the many long and tedious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions that have been given of this Operation, have been only invented to caſt a duſt into the eyes of <hi>Novices;</hi> for it is eaſie for any to obſerve, who give themſelves a little to examine things, that after all their long turnings and windings, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to no purpoſe, the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> is not ſo well <hi>Tartarized,</hi> as by the plain method that I have deſcribed.</p>

                  <p>Fill a glaſs or earthen cucurbite half full with <hi>Roſemary Flowers,</hi> gathered when they are at their beſt; pour upon it <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> ſufficient to infuſe the <hi>Flowers</hi> in; ſet your Cucurbite in a <hi>Balneum,</hi> and joyning its head, and Receiver, lute cloſe the junctures, and give it a digeſting fire for three days, after which unlute them, and pour into the Cucurbite that which may have been diſtilled. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit your Alembick, and encreaſe the fire ſtrong enough to make the liquor diſtil, ſo as one drop may immediately follow another; and when you ſhall have drawn about two thirds of it, and put out the fire, let the veſſels cool, and unlute them, you'l find in the Receiver a very good <hi>Water of the Queen of Hungary,</hi> keep it in a Viol well ſtopt. It is good in the Palſie, Lethargy, Apoplexy, and Hyſterical Maladies: The Doſe is from one drachm to two.

Ladies do uſe to mix half an ounce of it with ſix ounces of Lily-water, or Bean-flower water, and waſh their Face with it, to clear their complexion.</p>

                     <p>You muſt diſtil this water in a Fire that is ſtrong enough, for otherwiſe the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> would riſe alone, or elſe draw along with it but very little <hi>Eſſence,</hi> as I have obſerved in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Oyl</hi> or <hi>Eſſence of Roſemary,</hi> may be made as the <hi>Oyl of Cinnamon,</hi> and ſome drops of it mixed in the <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and hereby you have a <hi>Queen of Hungary's water</hi> made upon the ſpot.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Water</hi> of the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſometimes gives eaſe to the Tooth-ach, being ſnufft at the Noſe, or applied to the Gums with a little Cotton.</p>
                     <p>Some thinking to Criticize a little, do ſay, it is altogether uſeleſs to digeſt <hi>Roſemary flowers</hi> with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> becauſe their ſubſtance being of a very Volatile nature, it eaſily diſſolves in the Spirit without any digeſtion.</p>
                     <p>But this Circumſtance is very neceſſary, if we deſire to have a <hi>Water</hi> well impregnated with the Eſſence of the <hi>Flowers,</hi> for although there is a Volatile ſubſtance in <hi>Roſemary,</hi> yet good part of the Oil, in which conſiſts principally the Smell, is involved in the other Principles, and cannot be well rarefied, mixed, and exalted, but only by a digeſtion: and thus we have a very good effect from it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of Vinegar.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WInes,</hi> like all other liquors that uſe to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do grow ſowr by the diſſolution of their Tartar in a ſecond Fermentation: This diſſolution is commonly made, when upon the Wines going to decay, ſome of the more ſubtile Spirits are loſt; for the Tartar taking their place fixes the reſt of the Spirits which remain in the Wine, ſo that they can act no longer. This fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the cauſe that when the Wine turns ſowr, very little quantity of it is diminiſhed, and very little Tartar is found in the veſſels wherein <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> is made.</p>
               <p>To the end that Wine may quickly ſowr, you muſt ſet the Veſſel that contains it in ſome hot place, and mix the Lees from time to time; for this Tartar will eaſily diſſolve, when heat comes to act upon it.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it will be objected that Wine deprived of Tartar and Lees does grow ſowr, when kept a long time in a veſſel, without any diſſolution of Tartar.</p>
               <p>But we muſt conſider that Wine, let it be as clear and pure as may be, does always retain the more ſaline and ſubtile part of Tartar, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts and eaſily ſmells, when by Fermentation it gets the predominancy of the Sulphureous Spirits,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48366:236"/>
which held it as it were involved: and thus clear wine ſowrs alone, but it does not ſowr ſo faſt, and the Vinegar is not ſo ſtrong, as when it is made upon Tartar.</p>
               <p>Furthermore if we conſider the Principles that wine conſiſts of, we ſhall find, that neither the Oil, nor Earth, nor Water, are capable of yielding any Acidity, and that nothing but the Salt is able to give it. Now it cannot be doubted but that the Salt of wine is in the Tartar.</p>
               <p>It may be added here, that the Air to which wines are expoſed, by leaving the veſſel open, when they would have them turn into Vinegar, does likewiſe communicate a little of its Acidity to the wines, by exciting and rarifying the Acid of Tartar.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Diſtillation of Vinegar.</head>
                  <p>Put ſix quarts of ſtrong Vinegar into an earthen pan; evaporate in <hi>Balneum</hi> about a quart, which is the Phlegmatick part; and pour that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains into a glaſs or earthen Cucurbite, and diſtil it in a ſtrong ſand-heat, until there remains at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom nothing but a ſubſtance like Honey; keep this <hi>Vinegar</hi> well ſtopt, many do call it <hi>Spirit of Vinegar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its principal uſe is to diſſolve or precipitate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. It is ſometimes mixed in Cordial potions, to reſiſt putrefaction; the doſe is half a ſpoonful: it is mixed with water, and this <hi>Oxycrate</hi> is uſed to ſtop Hemorrhagies, taken inwardly, and to aſſwage Inflammations, applied outwardly.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Acidity of <hi>Vinegar</hi> conſiſts in an Eſſential, or Tartareous Salt, which being heavier than the Phlegm riſes laſt; but you muſt evaporate this Phlegm very gently, becauſe the Acid Spirit of <hi>Vinegar</hi> will eaſily ſublime with it.</p>
                     <p>I do uſe an earthen pan, rather than a Cucurbite, that the Phlegm of <hi>Vinegar</hi> finding a large open paſſage may evaporate the more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>It would be no great fault, if you ſhould diſtil the <hi>Vinegar</hi> without dephlegmating it firſt; for the ſeparating the phlegm from it is not of ſo much conſideration, as to make it as clear as pure water, that it may not beſtow any particular tincture to the ingredients that are to be diſſolved in it.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of <hi>Vinegar</hi> is much leſs fixed than many other acids, becauſe it partakes of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Spirits of wine which ſtill remain in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Common Vinegar</hi> keeps its ſtrength a longer time than the diſtilled, becauſe it contains a more Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrious Salt, that doth not Volatilize ſo eaſily. And for this reaſon, you ſhould rather chuſe to uſe <hi>Vinegar</hi> newly diſtilled, than that which hath been kept a good while. All Acids do prove Cordial, and good againſt malignity of humors, when it is cauſed by too great a commotion, becauſe it fixes and Coagulates them, moderating their motion. Thus in places where the Air is corrupted, and Peſtilential, <hi>Vinegar</hi> is a good Preſervative; you may every morning take half a Spoonful of it Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but in diſeaſes which proceed from a Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:48366:237"/>
humor, as the Hypochondriack melancholy, it is rather hurtful than good, becauſe it fixes the humors the more.</p>
                     <p>Some having dried and calcined the ſweet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that remains at the bottom of the Cucurbite, after the diſtillation of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and having by Solution, Filtration, and Coagulation, ſeparated from it an Alkali fixt ſalt, much like to that which is drawn from Tartar, they do mix it with <hi>Spirit of Vinegar,</hi> and diſtil and cohobate it divers times, until, ſay they, the ſpirit has carried off all the ſalt, and then will needs have it called <hi>Spirit of Vinegar Alkalized,</hi> or <hi>Radical Spirit of Vinegar,</hi> and they affirm that this being much more pure, and entirely united with its proper ſalt, is much the more powerful in diſſolving Metals. But the diſtilled <hi>Vinegar</hi> is ſo far from becoming the ſtronger through this Preparation, that I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that it breaks and loſes the greateſt part of its edges in contending with the Alkali ſalt, with which it is mixt, for it is the property of this ſalt to ſweeten Acids.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it neceſſary to believe that by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is ſo drawn the Alkali ſalt of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> for it remains fixt at bottom of the Retort with the acids it is impregnated with; ſo that this ſame <hi>Spirit of Vinegar</hi> to which ſo many great names and uſes have been appropriated, is properly the more Phlegmatick part of diſtilled <hi>Vinegar.</hi>

               <p>ANY groſs or terreſtrious matter, that ſticks to the ſides of the veſſel, when ſeparated from its liquor by means of Fermentation is called <hi>Tartar.</hi> But the <hi>Tartar</hi> I am going to ſpeak of here, is that of <hi>Wine.</hi> It is found ſticking to Casks like a very hard ſtone, ſometimes white, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times red, according to the colour of the wine it comes from.</p>
               <p>White <hi>Tartar</hi> is to be prefer'd before red, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is purer, and contains leſs earth; both one and t'other are had in greater abundance in hot Countries, ſuch as <hi>Languedock</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> than many other Climats; but the beſt white <hi>Tartar</hi> of all is brought out of <hi>Germany,</hi> it muſt be heavy, White, and Cryſtalline.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lees</hi> of wine are likewiſe a liquified <hi>Tartar,</hi> they are burned, and the Aſhes that are made of them are called <hi>Cineres Clavellati,</hi> in Engliſh, <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled Aſhes.</hi>

                  <p>This Operation is a <hi>Tartar</hi> purified, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated in form of Cryſtals.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Cryſtal of Tartar</hi> is Purgative, and Aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; it is good for Hydropical, and Aſthmatical perſons, and for Tertian and Quartan Agues. The doſe is from half a drachm to three drachms in broth, or ſome other proper liquor.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>This Operation is, to ſpeak properly, nothing but a Purification of the more Terreſtrious parts of <hi>Tartar.</hi> You muſt obſerve to boil it in an earthen veſſel, rather than any metallick one, becauſe it would be apt to take ſome Tincture from it.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Skin</hi> that ſwims a-top after evaporation of ſome part of the liquor was heretofore carefully taken off, and there was thought to be ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between it, and the Cryſtal of Tartar. But this <hi>Cream</hi> or <hi>Skin</hi> is only a part of the <hi>Tartar</hi> that begins to Coagulate, and ſo it is the very ſame thing in ſubſtance with the <hi>Cryſtal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="435" facs="tcp:48366:238"/>You muſt not imagine that the <hi>Cryſtals</hi> of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> do much differ from <hi>common Tartar,</hi> for they differ from it only in the containing a little leſs earth, but all the five Principles may be drawn from the Cryſtals, as from common Tartar.</p>
                     <p>When you would take the <hi>Cryſtals</hi> in ſubſtance you muſt make them into Pills, or into a <hi>Bolus,</hi> with ſome liquid ſubſtance; or elſe you may boil them in ſome liquor, but you muſt take the liquor very hot, otherwiſe the Cryſtals will fall to the bottom of the cup you drink out of.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould boil theſe <hi>Cryſtals</hi> in common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or in broth, and then let it ſtand to be cold, they will return into the ſame form they were in before, both at the bottom, and on the ſides of the veſſel, but the liquor will remain a little ſharp, through the ſolution of ſome part of the ſalt of Tartar into it.</p>
                     <p>I ſee no reaſon ſo much to wonder as ſome do, why <hi>Tartar</hi> will not diſſolve in cold water; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it does contain a great deal of ſalt, this ſalt is involved in <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> which muſt needs hinder the diſſolution, and there is no need of having recourſe, for an explication of this, to a proportionable Union of Volatile ſalts and acids.</p>

                     <p>This Operation is nothing but a diſſolution that the Salt of Tartar has made of Cream of Tartar, ſo that it can diſſolve in cold water, which it could not do alone; the Cream of Tartar alſo being an acid inſinuates into the pores of the Alkali ſalt, and ſweetens it.</p>
                     <p>If you boil Cream of Tartar in water, and put into it ſome ſalt of Tartar, there will happen an Efferveſcency between them, but if you mix theſe two ingredients together in cold water, there will be no Efferveſcency; the reaſon of which is, that the acid Spirits of Cream of Tartar being involved in other principles, can have no active power to open the Alkali, unleſs they be actuated by fire.</p>

                  <p>They are a good remedy for Obſtructions of the Liver, Meſentery, Spleen; they are given in Cachexies, and for Melancholy, and the Quartan Ague; the doſe is from fifteen grains to two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in broth, or ſome other liquor proper to the diſtemper.</p>

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:48366:240"/>
to free it from the Impurities of the Tartar and Iron which could not diſſolve; but you muſt paſs it very hot, for if it were a little cool, the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar would Coagulate in the cloth, and ſo none of the liquor would paſs.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of Cryſtallizing the diſſolved Tartar, you may evaporate all the liquor, and ſo obtain a brown powder, which has the ſame virtues as the Cryſtals.</p>

                     <p>The Ebullition which happens in this Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeds from the <hi>Cream of Tartars</hi> meeting with the Volatile and Alkali Salt of Urine; for the Acid of <hi>Tartar</hi> piercing the Salt of Urine divides its parts, and gives vent to igneous bodies which were contained in it, and which now finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free do break forth in great haſte.</p>
                     <p>Volatile Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> may be uſed inſtead of that of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine;</hi> but then there will be no ſenſible Ebullition, the reaſon of which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſalt of this Spirit is not an Alkali ſo open as the <hi>Spirit of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> by reaſon of ſome impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it has of the <hi>Acid ſal Armoniack,</hi> with which it was mixt; inſomuch that the <hi>Cryſtals of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> whoſe acid is not ſeparated from the Earth, has points too groſs, and too unactive to inſinuate, into the pores of this ſalt, and ſeparate its parts ſo eaſily as thoſe of the ſalt that is contained in <hi>Spirit of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> whoſe pores are bigger.</p>
                     <p>Some part of the <hi>Glaſs</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> diſſolves in the boiling, and gives the Emetick quality to the powder. It is a very gentle Vomit, becauſe the Tartar fixes, and in ſome meaſure hinders the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Sulphurs of <hi>Antimony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If inſtead of making the aforeſaid evaporation, you ſhould take the veſſel off the fire, when there is but two thirds of the liquor conſumed, and let it ſettle without ſtirring it, in four and twenty hours the ſoluble Tartar, will cryſtallize at the bottom, and on the ſides, but it will be never a whit the better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="441" facs="tcp:48366:241"/>When you would make this Cryſtallization you muſt uſe a flat veſſel, let it be of earth, that the Cryſtals may diſplay themſelves the better.

The evaporations and cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizations are to be continued, until you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all your ſalt.</p>
                     <p>Another ſort of <hi>Soluble Emetick Tartar</hi> may be made by boiling in water an ounce of the <hi>Glaſs of Antimony</hi> powdered with four ounces of <hi>Soluble Tartar,</hi> for ſeven or eight hours, then upon fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring and evaporating the liquor, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a grey powder of the ſame virtues as the other, and to be given in the ſame doſe.</p>

                     <p>Almoſt all Authors who have ſpoke of <hi>Tartar</hi> have aſſerted, that two ſorts of Spirits could be drawn from it by diſtillation, the one very Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, the other fixt and acid; wherefore after all had mixed confuſedly in the Receiver, they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Oil, and added ſome Alkali, ſuch as Coral, or Crabs-eyes, to that which remained, then they poured it into a Cucurbite, and diſtilled
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:48366:242"/>
about half the liquor, which they pretended to be a Volatile Spirit; for the acid Spirit remained abſorb'd by the Alkali, with the Phlegm in the bottom of the body.</p>
                     <p>But having vowed never to be led by any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is not founded upon Experience, I have examined the nature of <hi>Tartar</hi> as ſtrictly as poſſible, and after a great many diſtillations of it, I could never perceive this Volatile Spirit, which hath been obtruded upon us; all that I could ever find is this, that <hi>Tartar</hi> contains good ſtore of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential ſalt, which renders it acid, and that this Salt coming forth by diſtillation, and mixing with phlegm, doth make all the Spirit that can be drawn from <hi>Tartar.</hi> So that the <hi>Spirit of Tartar</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deſcription of theſe men is only the more Phlegmatick part of the liquor, that is to ſay, the moſt deprived of this Eſſential Salt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe almoſt all of it doth adhere unto the Alkali body of Coral, or Crabs-eyes, which were added to it. But according to the way I have ſet down, the Spirit may be drawn as pure as may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I do not leave it to mix with the phlegm, which comes out firſt.</p>
                     <p>If we do rectifie the Spirit, it is done to purifie it from ſome Terreſtrious parts, which it might have carried along with it in the diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>Some thinking to do better than thoſe who recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Spirit of Tartar on alkali matters, do inſtead of thoſe alkalis uſe biſcuit powdered, but they attain their end never the better, for the biſcuit does ſweeten the acid <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> as much as Coral, or Crabs-eyes.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>In theſe two laſt Operations I have given you the means of obtaining all that can be got from <hi>Tartar;</hi> but thoſe who have no need of the Spirit or Oil, and would only deſire the Salt, may bruiſe the Crude <hi>Tartar,</hi> and wrapping it up in paper may Calcine it until it turns into a white maſs; after which they may draw the ſalt by a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> as I ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>I do commonly draw this way four ounces of very white, and well <hi>purified ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> from each pound of <hi>red Tartar;</hi> a little more may be drawn from <hi>white Tartar,</hi> but it is no better than the other.</p>
                     <p>I have obſerved that when water is thrown upon the maſs of <hi>Tartar</hi> newly Calcined, it heats, much like unſlack'd <hi>Lime,</hi> when wetted; the reaſon of which is the ſame that I have given, to explicate the Ebullition of <hi>Quick-lime</hi> in water: all the difference is this, that <hi>Tartar</hi> Calcined containing a great deal of Salt, does more eaſily imbibe water than <hi>Quick-lime.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some do Calcine <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> with a little ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, to hinder it from diſſolving ſo eaſily by the air, and to render it the whiter; but this is no good practice becauſe the acid Spirit of ſulphur deſtroys ſome part of the Alkali; and this does come to happen, by reaſon that the pores of this Salt by being thus Calcined are not ſo open as they were, and the air therefore cannot ſo eaſily melt it. If you would make <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> and other
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:48366:244"/>
                        <hi>Alkali fixt ſalts</hi> very white indeed, you muſt Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine them all alone in a great fire, until they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come white, and then purifie them by Diſſolution, Filtration, and <hi>Coagulation.</hi> As for their prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſſolve, this is natural to <hi>Alkali ſalts,</hi> and cannot be taken from them, but by deſtroying their nature.</p>
                     <p>Nor can I approve the addition of any quantity of <hi>Niter</hi> to the Calcination of <hi>Tartar,</hi> as ſome do, becauſe the volatile parts of <hi>Niter</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, the fixt do remain, and by their acidity do diminiſh the virtue of <hi>Salt of Tartar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> be tolerably white after the firſt purification, yet if you do calcine threeſcore and four ounces of it, and filtrate it as I have ſaid, you will draw ſtill abundance of earthy matter: and if in curioſity you ſhould dry this earth, you would find three ounces and a half of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alkali ſalts</hi> are Aperitive, in that they diſſolve thoſe ſlimy humors which cauſed Obſtructions; and it is for the ſame reaſon that <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> does correct <hi>Senna,</hi> and hinders it from griping, for the ſubſtance of <hi>Senna</hi> being viſcous, this does rarefie it, and make it work the quicker; it may alſo ſerve to diſſolve ſome viſcous phlegm that ſticks in the guts, which as it is going off, cauſes griping pains.</p>
                     <p>The liquor or Oil made <hi>per Deliquium</hi> is only a <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> diſſolved by the moiſture of the Cellar, If you would make it quickly, you muſt diſſolve the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> in as much Rain water well filtrated, as is needful to turn it into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. It may be uſed like the former, it cures Tettars, and diſcuſſes Tumors, becauſe being an
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:48366:244"/>
Alkali it ſweetens the keen Salts which fomented theſe diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> or its liquor is diſſolved in water newly diſtilled from ſome green plant, the water will turn green, and the greener the plant is from which the water was diſtilled, this ſalt does make the water ſo much the greener. The water of Night-ſhade turns greener with it than Balm-water, Balm-water greener than Eye-bright-water, and ſo of the reſt. The reaſon of this effect proceeds from this, that the Alkali ſalt of <hi>Tartar</hi> does rarefie, and make appear many little parts of the plant, which did riſe with the water in the diſtillation, and did not till then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. But the water muſt be ſure to be diſtilled with a fire ſufficiently great, for if it ſhould have been diſtilled in a <hi>Balneum,</hi> or ſuch like heat, there would not appear the leaſt ſhew of green, though an Alkali ſalt were mixed with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cherry-water, Roſe-water</hi> and many other diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led waters of fruits or flowers, do give no colour, by the addition of <hi>Salt of Tartar.</hi>

This effect proceeds only from this, that the fire has attenuated and volatilized the parts of this fixt ſalt, ſo as to render them fit to exalt with the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of coals.</p>
                     <p>Many have writ that it is ſufficient to Calcine the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> two hours in a violent fire, or until the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> becomes blewiſh; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having tried ſeveral times to make the <hi>Tincture</hi> according to this deſcription, I could never be able to do it; it is true the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> will be a little Tinctured, but it comes not near that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to call it the <hi>Tincture of Salt of Tartar;</hi> for it ſhould be red like wine, and to make it ſo, it is requiſite to Calcine it as I have ſaid, and good ſtore of it ſhould be put into the Crucible, becauſe it diminiſhes exceedingly.

                     <p>This <hi>Tincture</hi> doth not proceed from a fixt ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur contained in the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> as many have pretended; it is only an exaltation of this ſalt in <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> for if by way of curioſity you ſhould diſtil this <hi>Tincture,</hi> you would recover only a <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> and yet nevertheleſs there will remain at bottom but a ſmall quantity of <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> with its uſual whiteneſs; which ſhews ſufficiently that this colour did only proceed from the exact mixture of the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> with the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> ſeeing upon their ſeparation the colour diſappears.</p>

                        <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum</hi> may be made with the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> as well as with the <hi>Oil;</hi> the Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:48366:246"/>
proceeds from this, that the acid of Vitriol piercing the Alkali <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> doth violently ſeparate its parts, and gives vent to igneous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which were there impriſoned; and this Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency comes to paſs as often as an Alkali meets with an acid, and remains until the acid can find nothing more to encounter in the alkali ſalt. Then there follows a <hi>Coagulum</hi> at the bottom of the veſſel, becauſe the acid and alkali claſping toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do loſe their motion, and by their united weight do precipitate to the bottom. And this cauſes the liquor to be much leſs acrimonious than the <hi>Oil of Tartar</hi> was before, though at leaſt an equal quantity of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> was mixed with it. You muſt evaporate it gently, and eſpecially toward the end, for fear the acid ſhould riſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
                     <p>This Salt is whiter than common <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> as having been ſubtilized by Acids, after the ſame manner as we ſee ſeveral other white things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in their colour, as they are beaten into a fine powder.</p>
                     <p>If you do uſe two ounces of <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> in this Operation, you'l draw two ounces and a half of <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum.</hi> This Augmentation comes from the more heavy and ſtrong part of the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> for that which is evaporated is very phlegmatick.</p>
                     <p>You may here uſe the <hi>Rectified Oil of Vitriol</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and then the leſs is requir'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſtronger acid, but the <hi>Tartarum Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolatum</hi> will not be ſo white, as when <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> is uſed, by reaſon of ſome <hi>Tincture</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remains with the <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi> rectifie it as much as you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="452" facs="tcp:48366:247"/>Though ſome have written, that if <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum</hi> were put into a Retort, and diſtilled, one might draw <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> as good as it was at firſt, nevertheleſs it is certain that it will not be ſo ſtrong a <hi>Spirit;</hi> for it has loſt the moſt ſubtile part of its acidity, by encountring with the alkali, which may be eaſily judged both by the taſte, and the effects.</p>
                     <p>If by way of curioſity you would ſearch a little narrowly into this Operation, and obſerve what happens during the ebullition of the acid and the alkali, you would find, that a great many little daſhes of water do fly about, eſpecially if the veſſel is not placed too low, and you hold a lighted Candle near it, for they will be apt to put it out. This effect can have no other cauſe than the violent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the parts of the alkali by the acid, which makes the watry part of this liquor to ſparkle upwards, being on all ſides violently driven.</p>
                     <p>If you uſe <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi> the ebullition is the greater, and the heat the more conſiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its acid being ſtronger, it ſeparates the parts of the alkali body more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>Now conſidering the ebullition which happens between acid and alkali, I have the leſs opinion of a method that ſome do follow, which is to bathe a little the bodies that are to be embalmed, with <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſalt,</hi> and then to put <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> into the embalming powder; for it is very likely, that this <hi>Spirit of Salt,</hi> which is an acid, by mixing with the alkali ſalt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> may produce a Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which may ſtir up the remaining humidity of the Carkaſs, and make it to mix with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:48366:247"/>
of the powder, and ſo inſtead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the dead body, we have reaſon to fear leſt this Fermentation ſhould rather haſten a diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its parts.</p>
                     <p>Acids do ſometimes diſſolve and rarifie, and at other times coagulate and precipitate, as may be ſeen by the Operations which have been deſcribed. Theſe different actions do ſeem very ſtrange, for it is hard to conceive how one and the ſame liquor ſhould produce contrary effects; but I'le give you an explication of this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> which becauſe it is built upon experience, may perhaps meet with ſome Approbation.</p>
                     <p>An Acid proves always a diſſolvent, when good ſtore of it is poured upon the matter that is to be diſſolved; but it makes a <hi>Coagulum</hi> as often, when being in too ſmall a quantity its points are fixed in the pores of the matter, and have not power enough to get out; and this is plainly perceived, when <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> is poured upon the liquor of <hi>Salt of Tartar;</hi> for if you ſhould mix but ſo much as is requiſite to penetrate the Salt, the acids do remain ſheathed in it, and bear it down, whence a Coagulation and Precipitation happens; but if now ſo much more, or a greater quantity of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> ſhould be ſtill added to the liquor, the <hi>Coagulum</hi> will diſappear, by reaſon that the little bodies which being gathered together maintained their part againſt the acid, and hindred its motion, will be then ſcattered and diſſolved by the acid, that is now grown the ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>The ſame thing may be remarked in all other bodies which can be diſſolved by acids; for if you take a little of any of thoſe, and pour a little acid
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:48366:248"/>
upon it, there is made a great efferveſcency, and after that a <hi>Coagulum,</hi> but if you add more acid, the matter will all diſſolve.</p>
                     <p>An acid can likewiſe Precipitate what an alkali hath diſſolved, as we ſee in the Operation of the Magiſtery of Sulphur, and this becauſe the acid having diſſolved and ſeparated the parts of the alkali makes it let go its hold, and the body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates by its own weight.</p>
                     <p>When Milk coagulates by the means of an acid, it is becauſe it contains a great deal of Cheeſe, into which the acid enters, and loſing its motion weighs it down; whence it comes to paſs that the <hi>Coagulum</hi> which is made with a weak acid, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates much leſs than that which is made with a greater quantity of acid; but if you ſhould in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity pour a great deal of acid upon the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>Coagulum,</hi> you would find it diſſolve by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                     <p>The fermentation of Dough, and other matters of the ſame nature does proceed from this, that the natural ſalts having been put into motion by trituration or ſome other cauſe do rarifie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, as much as they can, whatſoever reſiſts their motion; but becauſe theſe acid ſalts do exert their activity by little and little, and do meet with much reſiſtance, the ſolution is made ſlowly, and the diviſion of ſome parts is with difficulty enough. And this is that which cauſes the matter to ſwell as it does, and to take up greater room than it had before.</p>
                     <p>Leaven does encreaſe the fermentation in dough, becauſe it ſelf being a paſte whereof the ſalts are become free to act by means of a long fermentation,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:48366:248"/>
theſe ſalts do eaſily join with thoſe of the other paſte, or dough, and do help them to rarifie and diſſolve the whole.</p>
                     <p>The ſame may be likewiſe ſaid of other acid matters which cauſe a fermentation.</p>
                     <p>But when the acids have rarified the matter as much as they are able, they loſe their motion in it, and then the matter coagulates, that is to ſay, returns into the ſame extenſion as before.</p>
                     <p>There is ſtill one effect of acids, which ſeems different from thoſe I have now ſpoken of, that they do preſerve certain bodies which are put into them, as ſalt keeps or preſerves meat. Thus when young Cucumbers, Samphire, or Capers are ſteeped in Vinegar, there is no fermentation with them, and conſequently no corruption.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of which is that the parts of Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and other like things being very viſcuous and ſluggiſh, the acids do inſinuate to diſſolve them, but they have not there their motion free enough to make their joſtles, and to divide the parts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely, ſo that the acids of the Vinegar do only fix in the pores of theſe matters and coagulate in them.</p>
                     <p>It is this coagulation which hinders the Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from corrupting, for theſe acids do ſhut their pores, and ſerve for ſo many little pegs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſuſtain their parts firm and quiet. Sea-ſalt which is an acid does preſerve meat, and many other matters, for the ſame reaſon. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken of that in my Remarks upon the Principles.</p>
                     <p>The Coagulation then which acids do cauſe may juſtly be ſaid to be an imperfect diſſolution of
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:48366:249"/>
bodies, and I could here relate a great many other Examples to prove what I have aſſerted. But I ſhall content my ſelf with thoſe already ſaid. And now let us ſee whether this diſcourſe can furniſh us with any thing that illuſtrates the digeſtion of Aliments in the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of our modern Philoſophers have not ſpared the notion of acid, when they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to explicate digeſtion, they have conceived the Membranes of the Stomach to be all impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with it, and many of them not contented with this liquor alone have brought ſome more of it from the Spleen and <hi>Pancreas:</hi> but if all theſe acids were really in the Stomach, the aliments would not eſcape coagulating, and conſequently an Indigeſtion, as uſes to happen, after taking too many acids at Meals; for conceive never ſo great a quantity of them, either there would not be enough to diſſolve the Aliments, or elſe the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Stomach would be attenuated and concocted too, as well as that which they contain, which nevertheleſs doth not happen in the natural temper of the body.</p>
                     <p>There is no need of ſeeking after theſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary acids to cauſe digeſtion; the ſpittle which mixes with the Aliments as they receive their firſt Trituration between the Teeth, will furniſh us with enough to actuate the Fermentation in the Stomach; there is but little acid requiſite to ſet the parts in motion, but when once they are moved, they do contain enough Salts and Spirits of the ſame nature, which being quickned by the heat of this <hi>viſcus</hi> will break all their Chains, and find a vent out, whence does infallibly follow
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:48366:249"/>
an attenuation of the Aliment into a Chylous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>It will be ſaid, without doubt, that the irritation in the Stomach, which is called <hi>Hunger,</hi> cannot be produced by any thing but an acid, which find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more Aliments to work upon, uſes to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Membranes themſelves. But I think I ſhall explicate this Irritation better, according to my own opinion, than that of theſe men; for I may with reaſon enough ſay, that the ſpittle finding the ſtomach empty of all nouriſhment, ferments alone, and creates this Irritation, ſeeing that ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as every body muſt grant, is loaded with a Salt; but as for them, they muſt make an acid to come from the membranes, which nevertheleſs doth not irritate them, but only when it meets with nothing elſe in the Stomach to exerciſe upon, which is a thing hard enough to comprehend.</p>
                     <p>I know very well that ſome of them to avoid this difficulty will ſay, that the acid is generated in the ſtomach from the remainder of that which is eaten, which continuing ſome time in the ſtomach produces a Leaven after the ſame manner as Dough; but then they muſt explain to me what the Ferment did conſiſt of, which ſerved to digeſt the firſt Aliments that the Infant took.</p>
                     <p>Another Objection may be made to what I have ſaid touching digeſtion; it is, that whereas I have maintained that acids do diſſolve when they abound, and Coagulate when they are but few in a great deal of matter, it ſhould happen that Spittle ſhould then be apter to Coagulate the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the ſtomach, and cauſe indigeſtion, than would a greater quantity of acids, for it ſeems,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:48366:250"/>
according to my diſcourſe, the more acids are found in a matter, the more liable it muſt be to diſſolve.</p>
                     <p>To reſolve this difficulty, which ſeems to be very conſiderable, we muſt obſerve, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural acids of Aliments taken into the ſtomach, are ſufficient to rarifie and diſſolve thoſe bodies which hinder their motion, when it has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by Maſtication, or by ſome ſalt of the ſpittle, which ſerves as a Leaven to them, much after the ſame manner as the ſalts of meal do rarifie the Paſte, when they have been actuated before by Trituration and Leaven together; but now if there happens to be too much acid in the Aliments that are taken into the ſtomach, they will have the ſame effects as Cucumbers and thoſe other things I mentioned, which are preſerved in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. The acids will indeed endeavour to cut in pieces what ſtands in their way, but having to do with parts too viſcous and heavy, they will ſoon loſe all their activity, and fix by their quantity, and their gravity the natural ſalt of theſe Aliments, as Vinegar fixes that of Cucumbers; for when the acids do ſhut the pores of the matter, and keep them firm and quiet, the natural ſalt cannot exalt ſo as to cauſe any Fermentation or digeſtion.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon then why a ſmall portion of acids will cauſe digeſtion in the ſtomach, and a greater quantity will hinder it, is that the ſmall quantity will joyn with the natural ſalt of the Aliments, and have its operation without ſhutting the pores of the matter, whereas a great ſtore of acids will quite fill the pores of this matter, and hinder the motion of the natural ſalt; for it is not enough
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:48366:250"/>
that there be a great many acids, to cauſe ſuch a diſſolution, theſe acids muſt have room to move in, and to make their joſtles.</p>
                     <p>Thus theſe effects do make nothing againſt what I have aſſerted concerning acids, for a greater quantity of them will always have more diſpoſition, and tendency to a diſſolution; but if this great quantity does Coagulate divers things, it is only by accident, and through the diſpoſition of the matter into which the acid points have entred.</p>
                     <p>What I have here eſtabliſhed concerning acids may ſerve very much to explicate the nature of Feavers, and their principal ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all every body muſt grant, that when there are Obſtructions in our bodies, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed matter does ferment and ſowr, as Dough, Wine, and ſeveral other things grow ſowr by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtale.</p>
                     <p>This matter by Fermenting ſends ſaline or acid vapours into the maſs of bloud, which do cauſe divers alterations in it, according to their quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and quality, for theſe acids are commonly mixt with ſulphurs, which are a kind of Vehicle to the acids, and are more or leſs corrupted, according as the matter whence they are derived has ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more or leſs in the obſtructed part.</p>
                     <p>Now if theſe acid vapours are carried into the veſſels, but only in ſuch a quantity as is fit to make a kind of Leaven, they will then rarifie the bloud too much, and whereas they by conſequence do encreaſe its motion and heat, they do cauſe that which we call a Feaver; this Feaver muſt remain as long as the Ferment continues in the bloud, and according as there comes a new ſupply of matter
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:48366:251"/>
in place of that which nature has thrown off.</p>
                     <p>But if a greater quantity of acids ſhould riſe all of a ſudden from out of the Obſtructions, then there muſt needs happen a kind of <hi>Coagulation,</hi> for theſe acids thus abounding, and fixing the groſſer part of the bloud, do partly loſe their motion, and quiet the Ebullition of the bloud by fixing its parts.</p>
                     <p>It is this kind of Congelation which cauſes thoſe cold ſhiverings, which are felt, before the hot fit begins; for as the heat is derived from the motion of the Spirits, the cold is produced from the ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their motion.</p>
                     <p>The cold fit continues until the Spirits have by their activity rarified this Congelation; for the Spirits being continually ſupplied with additional forces do make violent aſſaults until they have made their way free.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Coagulum</hi> being diſſolved, the bloud ſhould ſeem to Circulate as it did before, but becauſe the matter of the <hi>Coagulum</hi> is converted into a Leaven, this Leaven makes the bloud to boil, and ſo cauſes a Feaver; this Feaver continues until the bloud is freed from all this Ferment, either by Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by Urine.</p>
                     <p>Now to conceive how this <hi>Coagulum</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a Leaven, we muſt conſider that the Spirits of the bloud have loſt moſt of their acidity in diſſolving this <hi>Coagulum,</hi> and that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but only acidity enough to produce a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs you muſt not think I mean by this Congelation now ſpoken of, a <hi>Coagulum</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like to that in Milk, or to that which happens, when an acid liquor is ſyringed into the Veins of an
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:48366:251"/>
Animal, for theſe Congelations are too ſtrong, and there would then happen the ſame thing, or very near the ſame as does to the Animal, who ſoon afterwards falls into Convulſions, and dies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the courſe of the Spirits and bloud would be intirely ſtopt, and they would never be able to break through ſo great an obſtacle: but I do underſtand here that the bloud is made thicker than it was, and has not ſo free a motion as it had before, which is enough to cauſe ſuch cold fits.</p>
                     <p>Now it remains for me to explicate how it comes to paſs that Feavers have their returns regularly by fits.</p>
                     <p>The matter that makes the Obſtructions which I have laid down for the Fundamental cauſe of Feavers, begins not to ſend forth its vapours, nor to diſperſe its acid ſalt into the bloud in order to cauſe a Feaver, until it has got together a certain quantity in the obſtructed veſſels, and then it is probable that there is a new diſcharge of the matter.</p>
                     <p>This diſcharge or eruption of Feaveriſh matter muſt happen at ſet times, ſo long as the Obſtruction laſts, becauſe the humors which Circulate to the obſtructed parts, and there ſtop, are always in an equal quickneſs and an equal quantity.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe in a Tertian, the veſſels wherein the obſtruction happens, do acquire in two days a ſufficient repletion of matter to produce the Eruption and Fermentation I have ſpoken of, the Fits do come to operate every ſecond day.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe in a Quartan the humors are more tenacious and heavy, and flow with leſs expedition, the Fermentation and eruption muſt needs be
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:48366:252"/>
ſlower, and conſequently the fits more diſtant the one from the other.</p>
                     <p>The Quotidian Ague is cauſed by a <hi>Saline Pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> which is naturally fluid enough to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ferment in leſs time, wherefore it is that the fits do return every day.</p>
                     <p>We may reaſon concerning the other kinds of Feavers upon the ſame principle, and explicate all the accidents that happen, but I have no deſign to enlarge my ſelf further upon this ſubject, I ſhould think it would be too great a digreſſion, and a book ſhould rather be made on purpoſe, to expreſs all the circumſtances which might be deduced from it.</p>

                  <head>Volatile Salt of Tartar.</head>
                  <p>This Operation is the Salt of the Lees of Wine, volatilized by fermentation.</p>
                  <p>Dry the Lees of wine with a gentle fire, and fill with them two thirds of a large earthen or glaſs Retort, place this Retort in a Reverberatory Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and fitting to it a large Receiver, give a ſmall fire to it to heat the Retort by degrees, and to drive forth an inſipid phlegm; when vapours begin to riſe, you muſt take out the phlegm, and luting carefully the junctures of your veſſels, quicken the fire by little and little, until you find the Receiver filled with white clouds; continue it in this condition, and when you perceive the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver to cool, raiſe the fire to the utmoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and continue it ſo, until there riſe no more vapours. When the veſſels are cold, unlute the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:48366:252"/>
Receiver, and ſhaking it about to make the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſalt which ſticks to it fall to the bottom, pour it all into a Bolt-head; fit to it a Head with a ſmall Receiver; lute well the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and placing it in ſand, give a litttle fire under it, and the Volatile ſalt will riſe, and ſtick to the head, and the top of the Bolt-head; take off your head, and ſet on another in its place: gather your ſalt, and ſtop it up quickly, for it eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves into a liquor; continue the fire, and take care to gather the ſalt according as you ſee it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; but when there riſes no more ſalt, a liquor will diſtil, of which you muſt draw about three ounces, and then put out the fire.</p>
                  <p>This ſalt is in great requeſt for to purifie the bloud, by ſweat or urine: it may be given in the Palſie, Apoplexy, Epilepſie, Quartan and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Agues, and to open Obſtructions; the doſe is from ſix grains to fifteen in ſome proper liquor.</p>
                  <p>The diſtilled liquor is a Volatile ſalt that is riſen with the phlegm; it is called the Volatile Spirit of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and has the ſame virtues as the ſalt; its doſe is from eight to four and twenty drops.</p>
                  <p>After this ſame manner the Volatile ſalt of <hi>Beans, Soot,</hi> and divers <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Seeds</hi> may be prepared.</p>

                     <p>The Lees of Wine being incomparably more Fermented than the <hi>Tartar</hi> which is found in the ſides of veſſels, we need not wonder if its ſalt is more Volatile.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="464" facs="tcp:48366:253"/>This ſalt is ſublimed in a Bolt-head, to the end the phlegm, which is too heavy to riſe eaſily ſo high, may not mix with it; but it is extraordinary hard to keep this ſalt dry, it eaſily humects and diſſolves into a liquor, wherefore it were much better to draw it in a Spirit, and leſs of the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile part would be loſt, being detained by the phlegm.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs becauſe there are ſeveral perſons who are as well pleaſed with the ſight of things, as their effects, this liquefied ſalt might then be mixt with a ſufficient quantity of Calcined bones powdered, to make thereof a Paſte, which might be made into little Pellets, to be put into a Bolt-head, and fitting to it a Blind-head, this ſalt may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed or rectified as before, and this <hi>pure ſalt</hi> muſt be kept in Viols well ſtopt,</p>
                     <p>The difficulty there is in keeping this Volatile ſalt dry, as well as that of other Vegetables, does proceed from this, that only the more eſſencial part is volatilized, for there remains much ſixt ſalt with the earth in the Retort.</p>
                     <p>This volatile ſalt becomes alkali by the means of fire, as other volatile ſalts do, whereof I have already ſpoken in my <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the Principles; and there is no manner of probability that it ſhould have been of this nature, either in the <hi>Plant</hi> or in the <hi>Lees,</hi> for the reaſons that I have ſhewn in the ſame <hi>Remarks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall add here, that if the alkali ſalt did exiſt in the <hi>Lees,</hi> but is not able to expand it ſelf, and get the predominancy of acids but only by a long Fermentation, as the Chymiſts will have it, who follow the common way of diſcourſing of theſe
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:48366:253"/>
things, it would then neceſſarily follow that the more Lees do ferment, the more they muſt loſe of their acidity, becauſe the alkali would deſtroy it. Nevertheleſs the contrary to this happens; for Lees do ſowr as they grow ſtale, &amp; thoſe who make Vinegar, do know well enough how to uſe the Lees, and to make them ferment with their wine, when they would make Vinegar quickly.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems to me from the conſideration of this effect, that there is little reaſon to follow the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of ſome, who have writ that the Lees of wine abounding in volatile ſalt, and a ſulphureous ſpirit do contain but very little acid; for it is as plain as may be that this volatile ſalt is acid in the Lees, and is the ſame that makes the acid ſpirit of Vinegar, being more volatile than many other acids, to volatilize with its phlegm in the diſtillation. It is true that ſalt of Tartar drawn by the Retort, does riſe more eaſily than Spirit of Vinegar, but this is from its being volatilized by the violent heat of fire.</p>
                     <p>Another mark that all the ſalt of Lees is acid, is this, that the <hi>Tartar</hi> does all diſſolve in the wine, and turns into Vinegar; for very little or no Lees, or other <hi>Tartar,</hi> is to be found in the veſſels wherein Vinegar is made, although there was ſome naturally before, or though ſome more were added to it as I have ſaid in the Chapter of Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it will be objected, that Lees are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times added to wines grown ropy and mucilaginous, to make them good again, and yet thoſe wines are not ſowred by the Lees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="466" facs="tcp:48366:254"/>But this effect happens, when the former Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation becoming imperfect, through the too great quantity of phlegm for the little proportion of ſalt that was in the wines, the ſalt of the Lees does rarifie, exalt, and conjoin with the Oily parts of the liquor that the Spirit of wine is made of, as I have ſaid in the Chapter of Wine.</p>
                     <p>For the wine does not ſowr, ſo long as the ſalt finds Oil to act upon, but it does ſo, when this ſalt finds nothing to hinder it from expanding it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The volatile ſalt of Tartar produces much the ſame effects, as that of <hi>Beans,</hi> and other ſeeds, and though many will needs give it ſublime and extraordinary virtues in compariſon with other volatile ſalts, I do'nt ſee any reaſon for ſuch high conceits, nor that effects do anſwer their pretences.</p>
                     <p>Volatile ſalts have a good uſe, when they find the pores &amp; humors diſpoſed for perſpiration, but they are full as dangerous, when the humors are not at all prepared; for by their volatility they do put the humors into ſo great a motion, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Feaver is encreaſed by them, and a tranſlation made to the Brain: wherefore you muſt conſider well the Temper and preſent ſtate of your Patient, before you preſume to give them.</p>
                     <p>That which remains in the Bolt-head, after the volatile ſalt, and ſpirit are drawn off, is a black and ſtinking Oil mixt with the more phlegmatick part of the liquor; you muſt ſeparate this Oil in a Tunnel lined with brown paper; it is good for the Palſie, for Cold pains, and for Hyſterical wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſmell to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="467" facs="tcp:48366:254"/>A <hi>Lee</hi> or <hi>Tartar Calcined</hi> is found in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, out of which you may draw a fixt alkali ſalt, as out of common <hi>Tartar,</hi> but in a much leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, for that the greateſt part of the ſalt of Lees is volatilized.</p>

                  <hi>OPium</hi> is a Tear, which diſtils of itſelf, or by Inciſion of the heads of <hi>Poppies,</hi> found very frequently in <hi>Greece,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> and the territories of <hi>Grand-Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt:</hi> there are three ſorts of it, the Black, the White, and the Yellow.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of thoſe Countries do keep this <hi>Opium</hi> for their own uſe, and do ſend us only the <hi>Meconium,</hi> which is nothing elſe but the <hi>Juyce</hi> of theſe ſame <hi>Poppy-heads,</hi> drawn by expreſſion, and then thickned, and wrapt up in leaves to tranſport the better. It is this Drug that we improperly call <hi>Opium,</hi> and always uſe for want of the true; but being more impure than the true, it hath not the ſame activity, and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Meconium</hi> may be made after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the heads of thoſe <hi>Poppies</hi> that grow in <hi>Italy, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> but it will prove much weaker than the former.</p>

                  <p>This Operation is the purer part of <hi>Opium</hi> drawn in water and Spirit of wine, and reduced to the conſiſtence of an extract.</p>
                  <p>Cut into ſlices four ounces of good <hi>Opium,</hi> and put it into a bolt-head; pour upon it a quart of Rain-water well filtred; ſtop the bolt-head, and ſetting it in ſand, give your fire by degrees, then increaſe it, to make the liquor boil for two hours, ſtrain it warm, and pour it into a bottle.</p>
                  <p>Take the <hi>Opium</hi> which remains undiſſolved in the Rain-water; dry it in an earthen pan, over a ſmall fire, and putting it into a Matraſs pour upon it <hi>Spirit of wine</hi> to the height of four fingers; ſtop the Matraſs, and digeſt the matter twelve hours in hot Aſhes; afterwards ſtrain the liquor, and there will remain a glutinous earth which is to be flung away.</p>
                  <p>Evaporate both theſe diſſolutions of <hi>Opium</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, in earthen or glaſs veſſels, in a Sand-heat, to the conſiſtence of honey, then mix them, and finiſh the drying this mixture with a very gentle heat, to give it the conſiſtence of Pills, or a ſolid <hi>Extract.</hi>

great an activity of the humors, it is good for the Tooth-ach, applied to the tooth, or elſe to the Temple-artery in a plaiſter, it is uſed for to ſtop ſpitting of bloud, the bloudy-flux, the flux of the <hi>menſes</hi> and hemorrhoids, for the colick, for hot defluxions on the eyes, and to quiet all ſorts of griping pains: the doſe of it is from half a grain to three, in ſome convenient Conſerve, or elſe diſſolved in a Julep.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Opium</hi> is compounded of a Spirituous part and a groſs terreſtrious Roſine; the Spirituous part may be eaſily diſſolv'd in water, but the Reſinous requires a more convenient <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi> You muſt dry the <hi>Opium</hi> after the firſt diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaſt the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> be too much weakned by the watry part that remains, which would hinder the ſolution from being done ſo well as it ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>Diſtilled Vinegar diſſolves <hi>Opium,</hi> but the acids may diminiſh its virtue, by deſtroying or fixing its volatile part, which ſerves for a vehicle to the other.</p>
                     <p>Spirit of wine alone might be uſed to diſſolve both parts of the <hi>Opium,</hi> but it might be feared it would carry away with it the volatile part in the Evaporation.</p>
                     <p>All that is in the <hi>Opium</hi> is preſerved by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; for the Reſinous part diſſolved in the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> cannot evaporate with it, becauſe it is the heavier; and the other part which I call Volatile in compariſon with the firſt is mixt with a little Roſine that keeps it back, while the water evaporates. The truth of this I have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and any body elſe may try as well as I
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:48366:256"/>
have done, by diſtilling theſe liqours. Laſtly it is hard to uſe any greater precaution than this, for the preſervation of all the pure parts of <hi>Opium,</hi> and fewer <hi>Menſtruums</hi> can be uſed that are more convenient.</p>
                     <p>If in curioſity you weigh the glutinous earth after it is dried, you will find it to be half an ounce.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt all Authors have appointed to torrifie <hi>Opium</hi> before it be diſſolved, to the end a certain malignity which they ſay is in it may be evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; but that which they call malignity is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Spirits, or Sulphurs that are moſt volatile, whereof I ſpoke but now; ſo that by the Torrefaction they deprive it of its more active part. They do further add to the <hi>Extract</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly drawn with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> Coral, Pearl, Treacle, <hi>Extract</hi> of Saffron, Cordial Confections, Hyſterical ingredients and other things which may reſiſt a cold malignity in the fourth degree which they pretend to be in <hi>Opium.</hi> But experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces us that it is not ſo dangerous, when given in the foreſaid doſe, ſo that there is no need at all of loſing its volatile part by Torrefaction, nor of mixing it with other ingredients which may hinder its operation, or retard its effect. It belongs to the Phyſician, when he thinks fit to give it, to judge whether there be any need of an Hyſterick, or Cordial, which he may appoint to be mixed upon the ſpot.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not ſtay to examine here whether <hi>Opium</hi> is cold or hot; they who have made the Anatomy of this mixt, do know very well that it is almoſt all of it Sulphur. I ſhall endeavour to explicate its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the moſt ſenſibly I can according to the Rules of Chymiſtry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="471" facs="tcp:48366:256"/>The virtue of <hi>Opium</hi> conſiſts in cauſing ſleep, and that by calming the motion of the Spirits; for ſince watchfulneſs does proceed from the motion of the Spirits, which by rarifying the humors in the little paſſages of the Brain do augment their Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it may ſurely be ſaid with probability enough that ſleep is cauſed by ſome condenſation of the humors, which happens from a repoſe of the Spirits in the Brain. According to this Principle then there muſt be contained in <hi>Opium,</hi> and all other Soporificks, a certain ſubſtance that inviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the Spirits, and hinders them for ſome time from Circulating ſo faſt as they did before. Let us examine now, whether any ſuch thing can probably be found in <hi>Opium,</hi> by the <hi>Analyſis</hi> I have made of it: firſt of all I have obſerved a Spirituous part, but after that hath been drawn out by means of Rain-water, there remains a gummous and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious matter, and this is the ſubſtance that I find ſo proper to produce this effect. For nothing in Phyſick is ſo fit to thicken the bloud, and other humors, as things that are Mucilaginous: Milk, and the Emulſions which are drawn from divers ſeeds, the Water-Lily, Lettice, nay and all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Aliments, do frequently incline to ſleep, becauſe they are impregnated with a gummous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which mixing in the bloud, does ſerve to agglutinate the Spirits, and to moderate the quickneſs of their motion; this now being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it is eaſie to conceive how <hi>Opium</hi> makes one ſleep, ſeeing it is loaded with Mucilaginous parts, which may be conveighed into the veſſels.</p>
                     <p>But without doubt it will be here objected, that <hi>Opium</hi> is full of ſubtile parts, which on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48366:257"/>
inſtead of condenſing the Spirits muſt needs rarifie them; and further, that according to my diſcourſe all ſorts of Gummous matters ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to ſleep as well <hi>Opium,</hi> which is a thing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly falſe.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, I anſwer, that the Spirits of <hi>Opium</hi> being actuated by the heat of the Stomach do ſerve to raiſe the Gummous part, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct it into the little paſſages of the Brain, but having there introduced them, they either fly away through their volatile nature, or elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe with the moiſture of the Brain. The ſame thing happens, after drinking any Spirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, ſuch as Wine, Cyder, or Beer; for the Sulphureous Spirits of theſe liquors carrying along with them ſome phlegmatick parts, do conduct them into the little veſſels of the Brain, or elſe do cauſe ſome Coagulation there, whence it comes to paſs that a man who is drunk commonly ſleeps until the Spirits of the liquor he is intoxicated with are in part ſpent, or evaporated out of his Brain.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, I ſay that all Gummous or viſcous things are not able to cauſe a ſleepineſs as <hi>Opium</hi> does, becauſe they have not equally the ſame proportion of volatile Spirits to convey them into the Brain. They may indeed, by giving more conſiſtence to the bloud, moderate its motion a little, and excite ſome diſpoſition to ſleeping; but it will not be done ſo quickly as by the means of <hi>Opium,</hi> and they likewiſe do it with a great deal leſs force.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould mix volatile Spirits with the Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous matters I now ſpoke of, it would not follow
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48366:257"/>
that they would prove narcotick as <hi>Opium</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirits not being capable of ſo ſtrict an union with thoſe matters, as the Spirituous part of <hi>Opium</hi> has received with its viſcous ſubſtance, they would ſoon ſeparate from one another in the ſtomach, and the gummous matter would want a vehicle to convey it into the channels of the brain, as would be requiſite in order to cauſe ſleep.</p>
                     <p>The viſcous parts of <hi>Opium</hi> inſinuating into the ſmall channels of the brain, do there produce a condenſation or inſpiſſation of the humors, until by little and little new Spirits do draw together, which by diſſolving and rarifying this glue, do carry it along with the bloud, or other humors. And then it is that the ſleeping ceaſes, a man finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf awake as before.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon may be given why pains in many places are aſſwaged after the effect of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> for theſe pains being cauſed by an agitation of the Spirits, when theſe Spirits are condenſed, the pain conſequently ceaſes. And this <hi>Opium</hi> does perform exceeding well, as I have ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who fall into <hi>Deliriums</hi> in a continued Feaver, do find themſelves ſtrangely relieved by the uſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> by reaſon that the principal cauſe of this accident is an acrimonious ſalt, which is got into the Brain, and irritates its membranes. Now <hi>Laudanum</hi> which is a viſcous ſubſtance, unites with theſe ſalts by means of its Sulphur, and takes away their Acrimony. It likewiſe ſtops the Dyſentery, the Flux of the <hi>menſes,</hi> and other Hemorrhagies by ſweetning the acrimonious Salts which fomented them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="474" facs="tcp:48366:258"/>Laſtly <hi>Opium</hi> may be ſaid to be one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Remedies that we have, when it is properly adminiſtred, and in a reaſonable doſe: but when it is given in too great a quantity, it ſo thickens and glues the humors in the brain by its viſcous parts, that the Spirits which come afterwards to ſuccour, not being able to diſſolve this viſcoſity, are forced to ſtop and congeal likewiſe by little and little, until at laſt they loſe all their motion, whence it comes to paſs that many do dye upon the taking of <hi>Opium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that many do ſo accuſtom themſelves to the uſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> that at laſt it is ſcarce able to make them ſleep, except when they take three or four times as much as is commonly given. There are ſome men in <hi>France,</hi> who can venture to take to a drachm, and this quantity does no more in them than two grains in another.</p>
                     <p>It is well known that the <hi>Turks</hi> will take of it to the bigneſs of a hazle nut, to fortifie themſelves when they are going to fight. The reaſon that they can do ſo is, that <hi>Opium</hi> paſſing a great many times into the ſmall veſſels of the Brain, hath in great meaſure dilated them. So that finding the paſſages very large, it makes little or no ſtop, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs taken in a greater quantity than before; for the <hi>Turks</hi> do not only accuſtom themſelves to the taking of <hi>Opium</hi> by little and little, but being of a hotter Temperament than we, they ſupply more Spirits to the Brain for rarefaction of the humors, which <hi>Opium</hi> might there have condenſed.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Turks</hi> do find themſelves fortified ſo ſoon as they have taken <hi>Opium,</hi> it is by reaſon of theſe volatile Spirits, which work in them much
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:48366:258"/>
the ſame effect, as the Spirits of Wine uſe to do with us.</p>
                     <p>Some have writ in oppoſition to what I have eſtabliſh'd on this ſubject, and ſay, that if we have regard to the quantity of Narcotick vapours that may ariſe from a ſmall doſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> it ought not to be imagined that thoſe vapours ſhould be able to ſhut the channels of the Spirits and humors which make a defluxion upon ſome part; but that we ſhould rather conclude the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of pains, and ſtopping of defluxions to proceed from a juſt proportion of the ſalt and ſulphur of <hi>Opium,</hi> and from the ſecret ferment they contain.</p>
                     <p>But this Objection will give us little trouble to anſwer, when we conſider that although the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours cauſed by it are but few, yet the veſſels of the Brain, in which the Animal Spirits do move, are exceeding delicate, and eaſie to be obſtructed; and that the too great activity of the Spirits, which often fly into the diſeaſed parts, being thus abated by the viſcous nature of <hi>Opium,</hi> there muſt needs follow thereupon ſome eaſe and comfort, without any need at all of admitting a ſtoppage of the veſſels which contain the humors.</p>
                     <p>As for the proportion of ſalt, and ſulphur in <hi>Opium,</hi> and the ſecret Ferment they pretend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with, in order to explicate this matter, I know they are high terms indeed, but illuſtrate the matter very little, for though they ſay theſe ſalts and ſulphurs do unite with <hi>Homogeneous</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that they meet with, and deſtroy ſuch as are the cauſe of the diſtemper, yet we can never by this means obtain any clear <hi>Idea</hi> of that which makes <hi>Opium</hi> to be ſoporiferous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="476" facs="tcp:48366:259"/>Beſides the virtue which <hi>Opium</hi> has to cauſe ſleep, I have obſerved that it is often Sudorifick. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this effect muſt not be attributed only to the volatile parts of this mixt, which may be thought to operate this way, after they are diſingaged from its viſcoſity, but rather to this, that during ſleep, the inward veſſels being as it were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, or in ſome manner coagulated, and the Spirits finding reſiſtance in their paſſage, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, or bend their motion to the outward parts, and draw along with them ſome moiſture through the pores. That which confirms me in this opinion is the conſideration, that divers perſons do uſe always to ſweat, when they are aſleep, though they have not taken any <hi>Opium</hi> at all. Now it may happen that in the operation of <hi>Opium,</hi> the Spirits finding more reſiſtance within than they are wont, may tend outwards with the more force, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently incline to ſweat more than in natural ſleep.</p>
                     <p>Some prejudiced <hi>Chymiſt</hi> may not reliſh perhaps this my explication, becauſe I do not ſeaſon it with <hi>ſalt</hi> enough, and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and other principles; but although the five principles which may be drawn from Vegetables may alſo be drawn from <hi>Opium,</hi> I never uſe them but when they are neceſſary to explicate ſome effect; for whenſoever I find they cannot ſatisfie my reaſon, nothing ſhall hinder me from purſuing my thoughts farther, and ſearching otherwhere for ſome better explication. In fine the Beauty of Chymiſtry does not conſiſt in ſuiting our opinions to thoſe of ordinary Chymiſts, who reſolving to explicate all the Events of nature by their Principles, which they manage according to their own faſhion, do
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:48366:259"/>
reject as ridiculous whatſoever does not agree with their Sentiments; but it rather conſiſts in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and imitating what is done Naturally, and ſo ſearching for reaſons that are moſt probable, and ſuch as may be ſaid to come neareſt to truth, though a man be fain to forſake the way that others have trod in.</p>

                  <hi>ALoes</hi> is the thickned Juice of a Plant bearing the ſame name, it grows in many Countries, eſpecially in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whence it is brought to us; the beſt is that which is called <hi>Hepatick,</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotrine,</hi> becauſe it bears the colour of a Liver, and a great deal of it is brought from an Iſland of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> called <hi>Soccotra;</hi> the <hi>Hepatick</hi> is drawn by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions made on the Plant; it is friable, of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive ſmell, and very bitter taſte.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of <hi>Aloes,</hi> which doth not differ from the former, but only in that being drawn by expreſſion, many Impurities are mixed with it, it is compact, heavy, and ſmells not ſo ſtrong as the other. It is called <hi>Aloes Caballina,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Farriers do uſe it moſt for their horſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aloes</hi> is not only uſed inwardly, as I ſhall ſhew, ſpeaking of its Extract, but it is alſo uſed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:48366:260"/>
in many Unguents and Plaiſters that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſive, and diſcutient.</p>
               <p>Its Tincture is alſo drawn with Spirit of Wine, by the ſame method as I ſhall deſcribe that of <hi>Myrrhe;</hi> it is diſcutient, deterſive, good againſt Gangrenes, and to Incarnate: it is uſed in Injections to diſſolve gypſous humors, and to cleanſe wounds, and old ulcers.</p>

               <p>THIS Operation is a Tincture of <hi>Myrrhe, Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Saffron,</hi> drawn in the Spirits of wine and Sulphur.</p>

                  <p>The name <hi>Elixir</hi> has been given to many Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or Tinctures of ſpirituous bodies prepared in ſpirituous <hi>menſtruum's.</hi> They would expreſs by this word a very pretious liquor, or a <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence. Paracelſus</hi> was the firſt who deſcribed this preparation. Many others ſince him have changed ſome circumſtances relating to it, but all have tended to the ſame end, which is to draw forth the Tincture of thoſe three ingredients.</p>
                  <p>I have uſed but one ounce of <hi>Saffron,</hi> becauſe this little flower is very light, and takes up a great deal of room. Though we ſhould uſe more of it, the <hi>menſtruum</hi> would receive no more than it does, for there is as much in that quantity as is ſufficient to fill the pores of the <hi>menſtruum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do leave the ingredients to infuſe two days in Spirit of wine all alone, that only their more ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous part may be drawn by this Spirit. The acid Spirit which is mixed afterwards, being ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ramous parts of the Spirit of wine has only force remaining to load itſelf with the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. This mixture of Spirit of wine, and Spirit
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:48366:261"/>
of ſulphur do give the Tincture a very pleaſant ſmell, and they have ſome cordial quality beſides. Wherefore I would not adviſe the changing this <hi>menſtruum,</hi> as ſome do, by ſubſtituting in their place Spirit of Harts-horn.</p>
                  <p>If you would, you might draw more Tincture from that which remains in the bolt-head, but it will not be ſo ſtrong nor ſo good as the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has already parted with its more volatile parts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tabaco,</hi> either chewed or ſmoked now and then, makes a great diſcharge of humors from the Head; but if it be uſed too immoderately, it is apt to cauſe ſeveral Diſeaſes, ſuch as the Palſie, and Apoplexy. It is beaten, and applied to tumors to diſcuſs them, it being full of Spirits which do

rarifie them and open the pores. It is likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in common water, and Tettars and other Itchings of the Skin are waſhed with this Infuſion, but you muſt have a care that the water be not too much charged with it, for fear of giving a vomit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tabaco</hi> kills Serpents, Vipers, Lizards, and ſuch like Animals, if you open a hole in their fleſh, and thruſt a little bit into it, or if you ſhould ſmoke them with it.</p>

                  <p>It is a powerful vomit, the doſe is from two drachms to ſix in ſome proper liquor, it is likewiſe good for Tettars, and the Itch, being rubbed light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with it.</p>
                  <p>Put that which remains in the Cucurbite into an earthen Retort, or Glaſs one luted, place it in a Furnace, and fit to it a great Receiver, and luting cloſe the joints, begin with a ſmall fire to raiſe all the phlegm; augment it by little and little, and the Spirits will come forth confuſedly with a black Oil; continue the fire until there comes no more, then let the veſſels cool, and unlute them; pour that which you find in the Receiver into a Tunnel lined with brown paper, the watry part will paſs through, while the black and fetid Oil remains in

                  <p>An Alkali ſalt may be drawn from the Coals that remain in the Retort, after the ſame manner as the Salt of <hi>Guaiacum.</hi> This ſalt is a Sudorifick, the doſe is from four grains to ten in ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient liquor.</p>

                  <p>The powder <hi>Diarrhodon Abbatis</hi> is Cordial, and reſiſts the malignity of humors, it takes its name from the <hi>Roſe,</hi> which is its <hi>Baſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Agarick</hi> is a Roſinous Muſhrom, that grows on the <hi>Larix,</hi> the beſt is the whiter, lighter, and moſt friable; it is uſed for to purge the brain.</p>
                  <p>The root of <hi>black Hellebore</hi> is a very ſtrong purger of Melancholy, wherefore it is given to Hypochondriacal perſons, and even to the Mania<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; it gives a vomit, when taken alone, but with this mixture it fixes downwards; the white is a poiſon, taken inwardly; it is never uſed but for ſneezing powders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scammony</hi> is a very Purgative reſinous juyce, the beſt is moſt friable, and which being powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hath a grey colour drawing towards white: its Roſine is drawn from it as that of Jalap.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aloes</hi> is ſaid to purge Choler, I have ſpoken of its virtues ſufficiently already, when I deſcribed its <hi>Extract.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Spirit of Wine is commonly uſed to make this <hi>Extract,</hi> and it may ſeem to be ſo much the purer, being drawn by this diſſolvent, rather than by a watry <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> for ſpirit of wine diſſolves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more Balſamick and purer part of mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: but nevertheleſs I chuſe rather to prefer the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:48366:264"/>
uſe of Dew, or elſe Rain-water, nay and even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water before Spirit of wine for ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe in the evaporation of the liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the <hi>Extract,</hi> drawn by Spirit of wine, a great many of the more ſubtile parts are loſt, which this diſſolvent had volatilized. And indeed it cannot be denied, but ſome uſeful parts will eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, let us uſe what diſſolvent we pleaſe; but it is plain there is no ſuch great loſs, when watry <hi>menſtruums</hi> are uſed, as when Spirit of wine. Now we ſhould always prefer ſuch <hi>menſtruums,</hi> as are beſt able to preſerve the virtue of the mixt, whoſe <hi>Extract</hi> we intend to draw.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, becauſe Spirit of wine does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways leave ſome impreſſion of heat and acrimony in the <hi>Extracts</hi> it draws, which the liquors that I uſe do not do.</p>
                  <p>The third is, becauſe Spirit of wine is not ſo convenient a <hi>menſtruum</hi> to diſſolve the ſalts which the Ingredients we uſe are full of, and it is in this ſalt, that their greateſt virtue does conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we ought to chuſe ſuch diſſolvents, as can beſt preſerve the virtue of mixt bodies, and ſuch as are familiar to our nature. We muſt uſe Spirit of wine to extract Roſines, ſuch as that of <hi>Scammony, Jalap, Turbith;</hi> but whenever an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> can be drawn with a watry <hi>menſtruum,</hi> it is better to uſe that, rather than another, for the reaſons I have mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Purgative medecins have been divided into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanagogues, Phlegmagogues,</hi> and <hi>Cholagogues.</hi> By <hi>Melanagogues</hi> are underſtood thoſe that chiefly purge <hi>Melancholy,</hi> by <hi>Phlegmagogues</hi> ſuch as purge
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48366:264"/>
                     <hi>Phlegm,</hi> and by <hi>Cholagogues</hi> thoſe that evacuate <hi>Choler;</hi> ſo then by mixing theſe three ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, a compoſition is made that is called <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymagogue,</hi> that is to ſay, purging all the humors, as doth the <hi>Extract</hi> I have deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Now to explicate the action of Purgative Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies upon all the ſeveral humors, you muſt conſider in the firſt place, that Melancholy is a very Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareous humor, and full of fixt ſalts; that Phlegm is very viſcous, and deſcending from the brain ſticks like Glue to the internal Membrane of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and that <hi>Choler</hi> is very thin and eaſie to rarifie.</p>
                  <p>The Remedies which are called <hi>Melanagogue,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Scammony, Senna, &amp;c.</hi> are full of Lixivious Salts, which are very good diſſolvents of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick humor contained in the lower parts, in that theſe ſort of Remedies do always deſcend, and being ſtrong purgers, do raiſe a Fermentation where-ever they come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phlegmagogues,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Agarick, Coloquintida, &amp;c.</hi> do purge the <hi>Phlegm</hi> chiefly that is contained in the Brain, becauſe theſe Remedies are full of volatile parts which eaſily ſublime thither by means of the Natural heat, and rarifying this humor do make it come down by the ordinary ways of Purgation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cholagognes,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Caſſia, Rhubarb, &amp;c.</hi> which are mild Remedies, and are not ſtrong enough to excite ſo great a fermentation as the others, do only purge <hi>Choler,</hi> it being very ſoluble, and eaſie to ferment; but they are not able to reach <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,</hi> or <hi>Phlegm,</hi> by reaſon of their thickneſs; wherefore there is no need of wondring, why a greater evacuation of <hi>Choler</hi> than other humors is effected by theſe Remedies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="488" facs="tcp:48366:265"/>It is further obſervable, that the Remedies which purge <hi>Phlegm</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> do remain, or leave their impreſſion in the body a longer time than thoſe that purge <hi>Choler,</hi> becauſe they more abound in Spirits or Salts: Moreover it is not to be imagined, that theſe <hi>Phlemagogues,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanagogues</hi> do evacuate no <hi>Choler</hi> at all, for they do force away all they can meet with, but becauſe it is then mixt with other humors, it appears not ſo plainly as when it is wrought upon alone.</p>

                  <p>This Operation is a ſeparation of the <hi>Oil of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine</hi> from its terreſtrious part.</p>
                  <p>Take three pounds of good <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and pour it into a Retort large enough to remain half empty. Add to it a handful of Stupe, to prevent the thicker parts of the <hi>Turpentine</hi> from riſing when the liquor diſtils; you muſt cleanſe the inſide of the neck of the Retort, and place it in a Furnace to diſtil in an open fire; fit to it a Receiver, and luting the joints, begin the Diſtillation with a very ſmall fire only to warm the Retort, and drive out a volatile ſpirit, after which augment the fire by degrees, there will come forth firſt a clear Oil, then a yellow oil, and at laſt a red oil; take care to ſeparate theſe liquors as they do diſtil, and when
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:48366:266"/>
you ſee the red oil begin to come thick, take away the fire, and when the veſſels are cold, unlute them. Keep all theſe liquors ſeparately in Viols.</p>
                  <p>The volatile Spirit is an excellent Aperitive, it is given from four to twelve drops in ſome appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate liquor, to expel Gravel out of the Reins or Ureters, in the Nephritick Colick, or to diſſolve Viſcoſities, it is likewiſe uſed in <hi>Gonorrheas.</hi>

                  <p>The firſt Oil ſerves for the ſame uſes as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the ſecond and third do ſerve as a Balſom to conſolidate wounds, diſcuſs tumors, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Nerves.</p>
                  <p>Break the Retort, and you'l find in it a maſs, melt and ſtrain it to ſeparate the Stupe; it is a good <hi>Colophone,</hi> and is uſed in Plaiſters to dry and to conſolidate.</p>

                  <hi>CAmphire</hi> is a Roſine that diſtils drop by drop from a great Tree that is much like to a Walnut-tree in the Iſland <hi>Borneo</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi> Little Cakes of it are likewiſe brought out of <hi>China,</hi> but that is not ſo good; it muſt be choſen white, tranſparent, clean, friable, without ſpot, and ſuch as is hard to quench, when once lighted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Camphire</hi> is compounded of a <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> ſo exceeding volatile, that it is very hard to keep it any time, and it always loſes ſomething, let it be never ſo cloſely ſtopt.</p>
               <p>It is an excellent remedy for the Fits of the mother, it is not only ſmelt to by women in this condition, and uſed in their Clyſters, but alſo taken inwardly; for it is lighted, and then quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five or ſix times in ſome water proper to the Diſtemper, and ſo the water is given to drink; it is likewiſe good for intermittent Feavers, being hung about the neck, becauſe in its evaporating away, it inſenſibly enters through the pores, and
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:48366:268"/>
cauſes a rarefaction, and tranſpiration of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which cauſed the diſeaſe: and for the ſame reaſon it is that ſeveral Druggs applied to the Wriſts and other places, have often cured diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but you muſt obſerve that this ſort of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies is always of a very Spirituous nature. <hi>Camphire</hi> is diſſolved in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and this diſſolution is called <hi>Spirit of Wine Camphorized,</hi> it is good in the Apoplexy, and in Hyſterical maladies; it is alſo found to be of excellent uſe in the Tooth-ach, a little Cotton is dipt into it, and put into the aking Tooth.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>This Oil is nothing but a diſſolution of <hi>Camphire</hi> in <hi>Spirit of Niter;</hi> for if you pour water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to deſtroy the force of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into <hi>Camphire</hi> as before.</p>
                     <p>Of all the Roſines this is the only one that can diſſolve with <hi>Spirit of Niter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſſolution is made without Ebullition, or ſenſible heat, becauſe the <hi>Camphire</hi> conſiſting of thin diſunited parts, the acids do enter among them and make an eaſie ſeparation: again acids mixing with ſulphurs do never raiſe any ebullition, becauſe they find thoſe bodies too pliant and yielding, to make ſufficient reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>If you have uſed three ounces of <hi>Camphire</hi> in this operation, you will obtain four ounces of Oil, and the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> will have loſt an ounce; this laſt will likewiſe have loſt much of its acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                     <p>Some have cenſured this operation, by reaſon, ſay they, of the violent impreſſion which the corroſive Spirit does give to the <hi>Camphire</hi> in its diſſolution, and that therefore the acrimony of the medicine renders it of a dangerous uſe.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing this Oil is not wont to be given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, methinks there is very little reaſon for this ſcruple: there are medecins which are much more acrimonious than this, which nevertheleſs are not eſteemed dangerous to be uſed.

                  <hi>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mm Ammoniack</hi> is ſo called, becauſe it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils from a ſort of <hi>Ferula,</hi> or Fennil-gyant, that grows near the place where the <hi>Oracle of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Ammon</hi> ſtood heretofore; the beſt is in large yellowiſh tears, and white within.</p>
               <p>It is given inwardly in Deoppilative Electuaries for Schirrhous Tumors of the Liver, Spleen, and Meſentery; it is uſed in Emollient and Attractive Plaiſters.</p>
               <p>The way to <hi>Purifie</hi> it is to diſſolve it in Vinegar, then paſſing it through a cloth all the moiſture is evaporated away over the fire; by this means it is cleanſed from ſome ſtraws or other little impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that it contained. But ſome part of its Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Spirits are evaporated at the ſame time, and in them conſiſts its greateſt virtue, while ſome others are fixed by the acid, which always hinders the motion of Volatiles. Wherefore I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver adviſe this <hi>Purification</hi> to be made; I would rather, after chuſing it as clean as may be, only powder it in a Mortar, to mix it with what may be thought fit; for though there ſhould be ſome little

ſtraws in it, that would never be able to alter the nature of the Remedy, or diminiſh its virtue ſo much as doth the deſtruction of its Volatile ſalts by the Vinegar.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing may be conſidered in the uſe of all other <hi>Gumms;</hi> &amp; if ſome of them, as <hi>Galbanum</hi> and <hi>Opopanax,</hi> are too moiſt to be powdered, you may cut them into little ſlices, &amp; dry them in the Sun.</p>

When the vapours begin to appear, throw out that which is in the Receiver, and refitting it, and luting cloſe the joints, encreaſe the fire by degrees, and continue it until all is come forth. Then let the veſſels cool, and unlute them; pour out that which is in the Receiver into a Tunnel lined with brown paper, the Spirit will paſs through, and leave the thick black Oil in the filter, keep it in a Viol: it is good for the Palſie, and Hyſterical diſeaſes: the diſeaſed parts are rub'd with it, and it is given to women to ſmell to.</p>
                  <p>Put the Spirit into a glaſs Alembeck, and Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it by diſtilling it in Sand. 'Tis a good Remedy

                  <div type="remarks">
                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>Two thirds of the Retort muſt remain empty, becauſe the <hi>Gumm</hi> rarifies exceedingly as it heats, and would be apt to come forth in ſubſtance, if it had not room enough.

                     <p>The phlegm is taken out of the receiver before the Spirits come forth, in order to their being the purer. You will have ſix drachms of phlegm, three ounces and ſeven drachms of Spirit, ſix ounces of a black &amp; ſtinking oil, and there remains in the retort four ounces ſix drachms of a black, light and very ſpongious matter, which is to be flung away. It is likewiſe a little inflammable by reaſon of fuliginoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have fallen upon it. And this is that which gave it the black colour; a great deal of the aſhes of this matter is requiſite to make a little ſalt, for the ſalt of <hi>Gumms</hi> being commonly more volatile than fixed, it comes forth almoſt all of it in acid Spirit.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Viper.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PAſſing by the fabulous Stories that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents have left us concerning the Birth of the <hi>Viper,</hi> I ſhall ſay it is a ſort of Serpent, that comes into the world by eating through the belly of her Dam, and killing her; whence ſhe is called <hi>Vipera, quòd vi pariat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Animal</hi> is very common in <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> and <hi>Poictou,</hi> from whence it is carried all over <hi>France.</hi> While it is in the field it feeds upon ſeveral little <hi>Animals,</hi> but when taken and ſhut up in any place, it may be kept a whole Summer without eating any thing at all, provided it hath Air enough to breath in.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why they can live ſo long without eating is doubtleſs that the pores of their skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo exceeding narrow, as they do appear to be upon examination, very few of their Spirits do
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:48366:274"/>
come to be loſt; wherefore they have little need of ſucceſſive nouriſhment to beget new ones, as other animals have, who ſpend abundance of Spirits.</p>
               <p>'Tis good to take <hi>Vipers</hi> in the Spring, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, becauſe then they are fatteſt, and in greateſt vigour. The Cold kills 'em. They differ from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Serpents in that they never grow ſo much; they have two Teeth on the ſides of their Jaws, and thoſe very long, in compariſon with a great many little ones that are round about, and the Gum of each of thoſe long Teeth is full of a Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh Juyce, in which many do think their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom conſiſts; now Serpents have none of thoſe long Teeth, but only little ones.</p>
               <p>Again, they differ in that being taken up by the Tails, they can't wind themſelves like Serpents, to make ſuch circumvolutions about the Arm, or thing that holds them, and this by reaſon of the different connexion of their <hi>Vertebra</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Viper</hi> is irritated, it ſhoots out a forked tongue, which looks like a little fire-brand, by reaſon of the vigorous motion of its Spirits; thoſe who never had ſeen the teeth of the <hi>Viper</hi> do think this is that which cauſes all the miſchief, but the tongue is not at all venomous. Some do ſave the tongue, to wear about their neck inſtead of an Amulet, in order to preſerve them from the effects of ill airs. Serpents do likewiſe thruſt out their tongues as the <hi>Viper</hi> does. But here it may be good to advertiſe you by the by, that thoſe things which are brought to us from <hi>Maltha</hi> for the tongues of petrified Serpents are nothing but the teeth of a fiſh which that Countrey affords.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:48366:274"/>The biting of <hi>Vipers</hi> is more dangerous than that of other Serpents, but the moſt quick and aſſured Remedy that can be uſed upon it, is to cruſh the head of the <hi>Animal,</hi> and lay it on the wound, becauſe by opening of the pores it lets out the venomous Spirits that were got in. The bit perſon may likewiſe take the volatile ſalt of <hi>Vipers,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>It is not yet ſufficiently known wherein conſiſts the venom of <hi>Vipers,</hi> nor can any good ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reaſon be given of the accidents which happen after the biting. Moſt men think this malignity conſiſts in the enraged ſpirits. And this is the opinion of <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> and <hi>Poterius,</hi> according to the relation of <hi>Zwelfer</hi> in his Remarks upon the <hi>Auguſtan Diſpenſatory,</hi> where he treats of the <hi>Troches of Vipers:</hi> He ſaith there have been a great many eminent men who have confirmed this opinion with curious obſervations, on the bitings of enraged <hi>Animals,</hi> particularly of Man, of the Cat, Wolf, Horſe, Dog, Weaſil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And among others <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> in his Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Operations, to whoſe proofs he thinks nothing further can be added to confirm the truth of this opinion: If accidents, ſaith he, do happen that are ſometimes more ſevere, and ſometimes leſs, they muſt be attributed only to more or leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation and anger, or ſometimes to a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found or ſlighter biting of theſe <hi>Animals.</hi> This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeems likewiſe to have been confirmed by ſome experiments, which Monſieur <hi>Charas</hi> relates in his book of <hi>Vipers,</hi> where he ſhews not only that the enraged Spirits are the ſole poiſon of the <hi>Viper,</hi> but alſo pretends that the <hi>Yellow Juice</hi> which
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:48366:275"/>
is found in the hollow part of the Jaw, wherein the great tooth is faſtned, and was ſuppoſed to be the venom of this <hi>Animal,</hi> is no ſuch matter; for having poured ſome of this liquor on the wounds of ſeveral beaſts, not one of them died, nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thoſe perſons who had ventured to taſte it, never found any inconvenience from it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs Monſieur <hi>Redy</hi> in a particular Treatiſe on the <hi>Viper</hi> will not grant the truth of theſe experiments.</p>
               <p>On the contrary he maintains, that having put ſome of this <hi>Yellow juice</hi> into the wounds of divers ſorts of <hi>Animals,</hi> they ſoon died upon it, and thence concludes that the venom of <hi>Vipers</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>Yellow juice,</hi> and not in the enraged Spirits only, as the others have thought, he taking this cauſe alone to be too Metaphyſical.</p>
               <p>And in truth who would believe that the <hi>Idea</hi> which this <hi>Animal</hi> forms, when he finds himſelf provoked, ſhould be able to imprint on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits qualities ſo malignant?</p>
               <p>Now in ſo great an oppoſition of Opinions and Experiments, a certain great man of theſe times found a way to reconcile them, by affirming that the <hi>Yellow juice</hi> of <hi>Vipers</hi> did produce different effects, according to the ſeveral places where theſe <hi>Animals</hi> lived; ſo that Monſieur <hi>Redy</hi> might have found the <hi>Yellow juice</hi> to be venomous in <hi>Italy,</hi> whereas in <hi>France,</hi> where the Climate is not ſo hot, this <hi>juice</hi> doth not produce any poiſonous quality, unleſs it be quickned by the <hi>Angry Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> of the <hi>Viper,</hi> which gives it a ſufficient pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.</p>
               <p>Others do confidently aſſure us they have ſeen ſeveral <hi>Animals</hi> in <hi>France</hi> die, ſoon after they
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:48366:275"/>
had put ſome of this <hi>Yellow liquor</hi> into the wounds they had made for that purpoſe, which very much favours the aſſertion of Monſieur <hi>Redy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore as for what is related, that in <hi>France</hi> people have ventured to taſte this <hi>Yellow liquor</hi> without any harm, I find this not to be a convincing proof that it is no poiſon; for although <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> for example, or ſome other acid, does not prove mortal, when taken inwardly, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs if the ſame quantity ſhould be ſyringed into the veins, the Animal falls preſently into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and dies. Now as that which cauſed the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> taken inwardly not to be Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was this; the acids do become weak through the mixture of the <hi>Saliva,</hi> and before ever they come to mix in the Maſs of bloud, their parts do receive ſo great an alteration from the ferment of the places they muſt paſs through, that they are able to do nothing elſe at moſt but cool the Body: ſo the ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Yellow</hi> liquor of the <hi>Viper,</hi> when it is taſted of, that beſides its mixture with the liquors of the mouth and ſtomach, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives divers alterations from the ferments of the places it muſt paſs through, before it enters into the maſs of bloud.</p>
               <p>Many do likewiſe think that the venom of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> hath its chief ſeat in the <hi>Gall,</hi> and thence is eaſily tranſported to the Gums, when they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; nevertheleſs in the Anatomy of this <hi>Animal</hi> there's no paſſage found capable of ſuch a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know very well that the pores of living bodies may be ſaid to be ſo open, that all manner of liquors may be preſumed to paſs through them, but yet no miſchievous effect is diſcovered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:48366:276"/>
from the <hi>Viper's Gall</hi> when given inwardly, for it only cauſes ſweat.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, others will have the <hi>Viper</hi>'s venom to be diſperſed over all its body. And thoſe who think thus, do adviſe us to whip theſe <hi>Animals</hi> in a warm baſon to drive their venom into the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the body, before we cut (as is uſually done) their <hi>heads</hi> two fingers below, and their <hi>tails</hi> two fingers above; after that, to flea off the skin, and take out the bowels, and then boil the body in water, wherein are added Salt, and Dill, to correct, as they ſay, the remaining malignity. When the fleſh is tender, it is to be ſeparated from the bones, then to eight ounces of this fleſh beaten into a Paſte in a marble mortar are added two ounces of bread dried and powdered, and <hi>Troches</hi> made of it, which being dried are kept for uſe.</p>
               <p>But this long preparation is ſeldom uſed, ſince Experience hath taught us, that no part of a dead <hi>Viper</hi> is at all poiſonous. The <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Tail</hi> dried and powdered may be taken inſtead of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, as well as the reſt of the body. I can like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aſſure you, upon my own experience, that the Tooth of a dead <hi>Viper</hi> is no ways venomous, having by chance been prickt my ſelf till the bloud came, whilſt I was a handling the heads of <hi>Vipers</hi> newly kill'd that I had a mind to dry, and there did not follow the leaſt ill accident from it.</p>
               <p>Furthermore by this Coction the <hi>Vipers</hi> fleſh is deprived of its volatile ſalts, which gave its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt virtue; for they diſſolve in the broth, which is flung away, and only the <hi>Faeces</hi> remain, wherein there hardly reſts ſo much Cordial virtue as there does in the bread which is mixed for a Corrective.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="511" facs="tcp:48366:276"/>But there is no need I ſhould enlarge my ſelf further on this ſubject, becauſe theſe <hi>Obſervations</hi> are ſufficiently delivered in the <hi>Auguſtan Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoeia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I do conceive it to be much better to uſe the <hi>Powder of Vipers</hi> newly made, than the <hi>Troches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make this <hi>Powder</hi> well, it is good to chuſe <hi>Vipers,</hi> when they are in the prime of their ſtrength; the Females that are full of Eggs or young ones, are not ſo good as the others: their <hi>heads</hi> are to be cut off, their <hi>skins</hi> thrown by, and their <hi>bowels</hi> taken out, and ſo they are ſet a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſhade, to be afterwards powdered in a mortar.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this <hi>Powder</hi> is hard to keep, in that worms do breed in it, it will be good to make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Paſte with a ſufficient quantity of the mucilage of <hi>Gum Tragacanth,</hi> ſo form it into <hi>Troches,</hi> to dry them, and powder them when there is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to uſe them, and thus it keeps good a long time.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Powder</hi> is given in the Small pox, Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feavers, and all other maladies where Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmicks are required, and the humors are to be purified by Perſpiration; the doſe is from eight grains to thirty in broth, or ſome other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient liquor.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Liver</hi> are dried in the Sun, and powdered together, and this <hi>Powder</hi> called <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Bezoar,</hi> hath the ſame virtues as the body of the <hi>Viper,</hi> only it is given in a little leſſer doſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gall</hi> of <hi>Vipers</hi> provokes Sweat; the doſe is a drop or two in <hi>Carduus</hi> water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:48366:277"/>The <hi>fat</hi> that is found in them is melted, then ſtrained for to ſeparate it from the membranes it ſticks to, it is as clear as Oil. Several Countries do uſe it in the Small-pox, and in Feavers: The doſe is from one drop to ſix in broth, or ſome other convenient liquor. It likewiſe enters into the compoſition of ſome Plaiſters, and into diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient unguents.</p>

                  <head>Diſtillation of Vipers.</head>
                  <p>This Operation is a ſeparation of the phlegm, the volatile ſalt, and the Oil of <hi>Vipers</hi> from its earth.</p>
                  <p>Take twelve dozen of <hi>Vipers</hi> dried in the ſhade, as I ſaid before, put them into an earthen Retort, or glaſs one Coated, place it in a Reverberatory furnace, fit to it a great capacious Receiver, and luting the joints cloſe, begin the diſtillation with a ſmall fire to warm the Retort gently, and drive out a phlegmatick water drop by drop; when you ſee no more drops to fall, encreaſe the fire a little, and <hi>Spirits</hi> will come forth, which will fill the Receiver with white Clouds, you will ſee at laſt a black oil come, and the volatile ſalt ſtick to the ſides of the Receiver. Continue the fire until there comes no more, after which let the veſſels cool, and unlute them. Shake about the Receiver a little, to looſen the volatile ſalt from the ſides, and pour it all into a Bolt-head, fit to it a head and a ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and lute the joints with a wet bladder; you muſt ſet your veſſel in Sand, and with a gentle fire under it, the volatile ſalt will ſublime, and ſtick
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:48366:277"/>
to the head, and uppermoſt part of the bolt-head, ſeparate it and keep it in a viol well ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>It is one of the beſt medicins we have in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, it is good in Malignant Feavers, and Agues, the Pox, Apoplexy, Epilepſie, Palſie, Hyſterical Maladies, and the bitings of all venomous Beaſts; the doſe is from ſix to ſixteen grains in ſome proper Liquor.</p>
                  <p>Pour that which remains in the bolt-head into a Tunnel lined with brown paper, the Spirit and phlegm will paſs through, and the ſtinking Oil remain behind; Hyſterical women may ſmell to this laſt, to allay vapours, and Paralytical parts may be anointed therewith; but its ſmell is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive that it is hard to endure it.</p>
                  <p>Pour the Spirit and Phlegm mixed confuſedly together into an Alembeck, and diſtil in a vaporous Bath about half the liquor, you'l have a Spirit that muſt be kept well ſtopt, it hath the ſame virtues as the Salt; the doſe is from ten to thirty drops.</p>
                  <p>The Phlegm muſt be flung away.</p>
                  <p>If that which remains in the Retort is Calcined in an open fire, and a <hi>Lixivium</hi> made of it, as I ſaid concerning fixt Alkali Salts, a ſmall quantity of fixt Salt will remain, which nevertheleſs hath no more virtue than other Alkali Salts I ſpoke of before.</p>
                  <p>The volatile ſalts of Harts-horn, the bloud, Skull, Nails, Hair, and other parts of Animals may be drawn after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <div type="remarks">

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Receiver muſt be ſure to be large enough, that the Spirits may circulate with greater eaſe, the fire muſt likewiſe be well managed; for theſe Spirits being forced out too faſt do ruſh forth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and break the Receiver, or elſe are loſt through the joints.</p>
                     <p>The Phlegm comes before the other Principles in the firſt diſtillation, but in the Rectification the Volatile Salt riſes firſt, becauſe it is at liberty, and is lighter than the Phlegm.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit which is drawn from Animals by Chymiſtry is nothing but a volatile ſalt diſſolved in Phlegm.</p>
                     <p>Your veſſel for ſublimation muſt be very high, that the Volatile Salt may riſe without any Phlegm, for when the veſſel is ſhort, the Phlegm riſeth with the Volatile ſalt, liquifies it, and turns it into Spirit. A bolt-head, or a long body with its head, may ſerve for this Operation, becauſe the Phlegm being too heavy cannot mount ſo high, and therefore leaves the Volatile Salt to ſublime alone, which may nevertheleſs be Rectified to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more pure; you muſt mix it with the diſtilled Spirit, and repeat the Sublimation according as I have ſaid: but becauſe this Salt always carries along with it a ſmall quantity of Oil, a few days afterwards it loſes its whiteneſs, and turns Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh: now to avoid that, you muſt pour upon it, when it is in the bottle, <hi>Spirit of Wine Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed</hi> one fingers height, and ſo keep it well ſtopt.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:48366:278"/>
This <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> hinders the ſalt from diſſolving its ſelf and the Oil it contained, ſo that after ſome days it turns red, and the ſalt grows white; when it is to be uſed, the Spirit is decanted from it, and the Salt left alone: by means of this Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it loſes a little of its former ſmell; but care muſt be taken that the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> be well Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for if there remained any the leaſt Phlegm, the Salt would diſſolve in it. You may alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime it again as before, after having well waſht it in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> it will be dry, and very fair.</p>
                     <p>There is another way of Rectifying the Volatile ſalt, which is by mixing it with four or five times as much bones, or horns burnt white, and putting the mixture into a glaſs, or earthen body, then fitting to it a blind-head, or ſuch a one whoſe Noſe has not been opened, after that luting well the joints, then ſetting the veſſel in ſand, and with a gentle fire the Volatile ſalt will riſe, and ſtick to the head, you muſt continue the fire until there riſes no more.</p>
                     <p>This ſalt is hereby purified from a great deal of its Oil, which remains in the powder of Bones, wherefore it becomes whiter than it was, and pleaſanter to the palate. It may again be mixt with other Calcined bones, and ſublimed as before, to render it purer ſtill, and take away more of its loathſome ſmell, that's cauſed partly by the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreumatical oyl</hi> that it draws along with it in the diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>The Volatile ſalt diſſolved in a little water Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallizes like Sugar-Candy, and then it is eaſier to keep than before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="516" facs="tcp:48366:279"/>There can be drawn from <hi>Animals</hi> but a very little quantity of fixt ſalt, becauſe the Spirits which abound in them do volatilize their ſalt: for which reaſon this volatile ſalt keeps dry lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that of <hi>Vegetables.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The virtue of <hi>Animals</hi> doth principally conſiſt in their Volatile ſalt, it is that which gives meat its ſavour, that makes Broths ſtrong, and turns them into a Gelly, according as they do abound more or leſs. The <hi>Juſcula Conſummata</hi> which are made with a ſmall fire are better than thoſe that are boiled quick, becauſe a ſtrong fire carries away good part of the Volatile ſalts.</p>
                     <p>Volatile Salts do rarifie the humors of the body, both by reaſon of their piercing nature, and alſo in that being Alkalis they do dull the ſtrength of Acids, which keep the humors condenſed, after which the bloud being in greater motion than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth the more eaſily purifie it ſelf, either by perſpiration or by Urine, from heterogeneous bodies which were there gathered together.</p>
                     <p>This Operation may ſerve to ſhew how the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt of all <hi>Animals,</hi> or any part of them, may be drawn.

                     <p>If you diſtil two and thirty ounces of ſhavings of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> you'l draw thirteen ounces of liquor, and Volatile ſalt, and there will remain in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort nineteen ounces of matter as black as Coal.</p>
                     <p>You'l draw from the liquor an ounce and a half of Volatile ſalt, ſix ounces of Spirit, and two ounces of Black oil.</p>

                     <p>Some do ſtratifie <hi>Harts-horn</hi> with <hi>Bricks,</hi> and Calcining it that way, they call it <hi>Harts-horn</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>Philoſophically,</hi> they account it more Cordial than it was before; but they are egregiouſly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, for the Volatile ſalt, and oil, which were the things that ſhould render it <hi>Cardiacal,</hi> were carried away in the <hi>Calcination,</hi> and there remains only a <hi>Terreſtrious</hi> matter that may be called a <hi>Caput mortuum.</hi> Notwithſtanding it is an alkali, which may ſerve as <hi>Crabs-eyes, Coral,</hi> and divers other matters of the like nature, which abſorb acids; the <hi>Bricks</hi> beſtow no virtue at all to it.</p>

                     <p>Afterwards by the Rectification you will get two ounces and a drachm of Volatile ſalt, one ounce and five drachms of a ſtinking black oil, five ounces of Spirit, and four ounces two drachms of phlegm.</p>
                     <p>If you Calcine the black pieces which remain in the Retort, in an open fire, the ſoot will leave them and they will burn white; this is called burnt Ivory, or <hi>Spodium:</hi> it has the ſame virtues as <hi>burnt Harts-horn,</hi> you will have at leaſt twenty ounces of it.</p>

                        <pb n="518" facs="tcp:48366:280"/>It is here remarkable that <hi>Ivory</hi> does contain much more earth than <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> and doubtleſs that is the reaſon why it is the whiter.</p>
                     <p>If you diſtil twelve ounces of <hi>Hair,</hi> you will obtain eight ounces of liquor and volatile ſalt. There will remain in the Retort three ounces and a half of a black matter very ſpongy and earthy, from which no fixed ſalt can be drawn.</p>

                     <p>All Volatile ſalts have much reſemblance in their figure, ſmell and taſte, but that of <hi>Vipers</hi> is accounted the moſt active, and proper againſt Poiſons; thoſe of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> and <hi>Mans Skull</hi> are thought to be better than others for the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſie, that of <hi>mans bloud</hi> to purifie the bloud, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>When you Rectifie the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vipers,</hi> or <hi>man's Skull,</hi> or <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> or <hi>hair,</hi> in order to purifie them from their phlegm, if you ſhould let the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor continue diſtilling longer than is fitting, the phlegm will riſe after the Spirit, but then it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates from the Spirit as water ſeparates from oil, the Spirit will be uppermoſt, and a little troubled, and whitiſh, but if you keep theſe two liquors together for a month, the whole will mix together, and there will be no longer any ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them at all.</p>
                     <p>Theſe effects do happen from this, that the Spirit in riſing does carry with it ſome ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:48366:280"/>
of Oil, which was diſſolved in the liquor by reaſon of ſalts that it contains. This Oil is very volatile, it riſes with the Spirit, and by rendring the Spirit a little oily, it hinders at firſt the phlegm from mixing with it. It is likewiſe this little quantity of oil which makes the Spirit look a little troubled, and whitiſh; but when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and phlegm are kept a good while together, they mix, and the whole appears like a homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous liquor, becauſe there being but little oil in the Spirit, the phlegm inſenſibly enters into, and incorporates with it; wherefore you muſt take care to ſeparate the Spirit from the phlegm ſo ſoon as ever you take the Receiver from the noſe of the head, in caſe you have ſuffered the liquor to diſtil too long.</p>
                     <p>What I have now ſpoken of does not happen in the Rectification of the Spirit of <hi>Ivory,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the reaſon is that the <hi>Ivory</hi> does not contain ſo much Oil as the other parts of <hi>Animals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some do prepare a <hi>Sudorifick water</hi> with <hi>Vipers</hi> after this manner.</p>
                     <p>They do put the <hi>Vipers</hi> alive into a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en body, they fit to it a head with its Receiver, they lute the joints, and diſtil in a <hi>Balneum</hi> all that will riſe from it; but you muſt take care that the head be well faſtned to the body, for when the <hi>Vipers</hi> begin to be heated, they leap and fling about with ſo much violence, that they would otherwiſe throw it down, and get out of their ſtove. And then the Artiſt muſt have a care of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not be too bold, for theſe creatures being irritated would fling about on every ſide, and a <hi>bite</hi> of theirs at that time would be twice as dangerous as at another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="420" facs="tcp:48366:281"/>This water which riſes whileſt the <hi>Vipers</hi> are in their greateſt fury is Sudorifick, becauſe ſome Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile ſalts have riſen and mixed with it.

                     <p>But to avoid the forementioned danger you might cut the <hi>Vipers</hi> in pieces before you put them into the body; and becauſe theſe pieces of them do retain life a long time, the water will be little the worſe for their not being intire.</p>
                     <p>When you have drawn as much water from them as you can, by the heat of a <hi>Balneum,</hi> you muſt put the remainder of the <hi>Vipers</hi> into a Retort, and diſtil it as I have ſhewn before; you will thereby have the <hi>Volatile ſalt,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Oyl.</hi>

                     <p>The word <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> comes from the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, <hi>Lucifer,</hi> or the Morning-Star.</p>
                     <p>Of them there are the Natural, and the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, the Natural are ſuch as Glow-worms, Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wood, and many others. The Artificial are made with the <hi>Bolonian ſtone,</hi> with chalk, with urine, with bloud, and with divers other ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous matters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bolonian ſtone</hi> was one of the firſt Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> that has been known: it takes its name from the Town in <hi>Italy</hi> where it was made, he that did prepare it is dead without leaving the knowledge of his Secret, inſomuch that no body 'till the preſent has been able ſufficiently to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it, he did calcine it for a certain time, and perhaps after ſuch a manner as we are ſtill igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, then expoſing it to the air it yielded a great light in the dark, which by little and little grew weaker and weaker. This <hi>Stone</hi> is bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and full of Sulphur, which is the thing that
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:48366:284"/>
gives it this diſpoſition to ſhine in the dark, but becauſe its ſulphur is ſpent by little and little, it comes at length to be opake, like another ſtone. When it has not been calcined enough, it yields no light at all, becauſe the ſulphureous parts have not been put into ſufficient motion, and when it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined too much, theſe ſulphureous parts are thereby loſt; therefore a <hi>medium</hi> is to be obſerved, which no body has yet been able to hit.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> being very curious and induſtrious in Chymical concerns, have found out ſeveral kinds of <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> and I do not doubt but upon working further upon this ſubject much may ſtill be done. Among thoſe who have particularly applied themſelves to it <hi>Balduinus</hi> a <hi>German</hi> has invented a ſort of <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> whoſe deſcription I ſhall give anon; <hi>Kunkelius</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> has written very well upon it, and workt to good effect; <hi>Daniel Kraff</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Chymiſt is the firſt inventor of the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> which is drawn from Urine, he gives it the conſiſtence of a paſte, or of a liquor, as he pleaſes; and the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to whom all the ingenious have ſo much obligation, put forth a Treatiſe in <hi>Engliſh</hi> about three or four years ago, called <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiluca Aeria,</hi> full of abundance of Experiments, and moſt Curious Remarks which he has made upon this <hi>Phoſphorus;</hi> he likewiſe found the way to give it a ſolid conſiſtence, and a little while ſince he put forth the ſame Treatiſe in <hi>Latin</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged above half with new Experiments and Obſervations on the ſame ſubject.</p>
                     <p>You muſt provide a great quantity of Urine for this Operation, for a great deal is neceſſary to draw
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:48366:284"/>
a little luminous matter from. The veſſel in which it is put to ferment is left open, that the air entring into it may help the fermentation; and in truth, the more volatile ſalts are hereby loſt, but yet there do remain ſufficient to make the <hi>Phoſphorus.</hi> When the Urine upon evaporation begins to grow thick, you muſt take care that the matter does not ſwell over the veſſel, for it rarifies very much; you muſt evaporate as much phlegm as poſſibly you can when the evaporation is made in the earthen pans to the end that the operation be ſooner ended in the body, for there is much leſs time ſpent in the evaporation, and it is much more eaſie to keep down the matter when it ſwells in earthen pans, than in a body which is luted, and has its head on. The body muſt therefore be ſure to be large enough by reaſon of this rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter, which will be apt otherwiſe to riſe into the head, and to mix in the receiver with the diſtilled liquor, which would force you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the diſtillation anew.</p>
                     <p>When the veſſels are unluted, you may take the Volatile ſalt out of the head, if there remains any in it, and rectifie it as I have ſhewed ſpeaking of the diſtillation of Urine, but you will find little of it, becauſe the greateſt part of this ſalt was loſt in the fermentation; you might alſo preſerve the liquor which is ſeparated from the oil in the filtration, it is a Spirit of Urine.</p>
                     <p>The compact matter which remains in the body after that the ſpongy part is ſeparated, is fixed and ſaline; you might calcine it, and draw from it a fixed Salt of Urine by a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> as other fixed alkali ſalts are ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="528" facs="tcp:48366:285"/>You muſt heat the Retort very gently, for if you ſhould make too great a fire at firſt, it would break it to pieces.</p>
                     <p>The Oil which is ſeparated from the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> at the end of the operation is a little luminous, but it is very foetid; there is but little of it becauſe ſome part of it has been rarefied by the fire, and turned into <hi>Phoſphorus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> gives a deſcription of the <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> in which he puts to the thickned Urine three times as much ſand.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> contains more ſulphur than any thing elſe, for water condenſes it, and oyls diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it; it has an offenſive ſmell, and it is partly to correct the ſmell that it is diſſolved in <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Cloves,</hi> when we make it liquid.</p>
                     <p>The liquid <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> gives more light at firſt than the ſolid, becauſe its matter is more rarefied. Open but the bottle in the dark, and it appears to be all of a fire. You might uſe Oil of <hi>Cinnamon</hi> inſtead of Oil of <hi>Cloves,</hi> and the light would be ſtill the greater, becauſe the parts of Eſſence of <hi>Cinnamon</hi> are more volatile than thoſe of the Eſſence of <hi>Cloves,</hi> but it would endure the leſs time for the ſame reaſon. Add to this, that the Oil of <hi>Cinnamon</hi> is a very dear commodity.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould fire a little piece of the ſolid <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphorus</hi> with a Burning-glaſs, and quench it when two thirds of the quantity are conſumed, that which remains will be yellow, and a little lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſtill; it will eaſily diſſolve in water. This Experiment ſhews, that the more fixed part of the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> is ſaline, becauſe it diſſolves in water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="529" facs="tcp:48366:285"/>The <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> is luminous in the dark at all times, but eſpecially in hot weather; for the cold does a little conſtringe the parts. If you take a little piece of the Solid, or even the ſtopple of the bottle that contains the liquid, and write with it on paper, or upon the hand of a perſon, the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do ſeem to be a perfect fire.</p>
                     <p>If you rub a little piece of the ſolid <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> on paper, and preſs it down with the point of a knife, the paper will be ſet on fire.</p>
                     <p>After ſome Experiments made one day at my houſe upon the <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> a little piece of it being left negligently upon the Table in my Chamber, the maid making the bed took it up in the bed-clothes ſhe had put upon the Table, not ſeeing the little piece: the perſon who lay afterwards in the bed, waking at night, perhaps through the more than ordinary heat he felt, perceived that the coverlid was on fire. It ſeems the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heated with the body of him that lay in bed had ſet fire to the coverlid, and had before he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it burnt a great hole in it.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable, that the air lighting the fire by exciting the motion of parts in the <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> does likewiſe make it yield a conſiderable light; for when the matter has continued ſhut ſome time in the glaſs, it ſhines no longer, and it recovers its light no more until the glaſs is opened, and the air is let into it.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs ſome Experiments made a while ſince in <hi>Paris,</hi> at the houſe of Monſieur <hi>d' Alence,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Homberg</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> do ſeem to evince the contrary, that the air is not always neceſſary to make the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> ſhine in the dark.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="530" facs="tcp:48366:286"/>The caſe was thus: a very little piece of the ſolid <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> was put into a little glaſs bottle; a braſs cock was fitted to this bottle, and made ſo as it could enter into another cock belonging to a large glaſs Receiver. Then the bottle that contained the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> was heated, and the cock of this bottle was made to enter into that of the great glaſs veſſel, out of which the air had been pumped. So ſoon as the cocks were opened, the air came forth of the little bottle, and at the ſame time was ſeen to come a great train of light like a flaſh; nay ſome did diſcover particles of the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphorus</hi> at the bottom of the great glaſs.</p>
                     <p>The bottle was then taken from the receiver, and the light of the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> was very much diminiſhed: it ſometimes ſeemed to be quite out, the cock was turned to let in the air, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> recovered its light again.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the heat of the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> grew leſs and leſs, and it yielded but a weak light. We began the Experiment again, the ſame bottle that had the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> was applied to the great glaſs receiver, and when the air was drawn out of the bottle, the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> did ſhine brighter; on the contrary when we let the air again into it, the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> went out: which is quite different from what hapned whilſt the bottle that held the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> was hot in the former Experiment.</p>
                     <p>We repeated the Experiments divers times, and ſaw the ſame thing continually happen: that is to ſay, the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> being heated loſt much of its light, when the air was pumped out of the bottle wherein it was contained, and it recovered light again when new air was let into it: on the contrary
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:48366:286"/>
the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> being cold did ſhine when the air was pumped out of the bottle, and the light diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared when the air was let into it.</p>
                     <p>It ſuffices to have related two Experiments, as contrary one to another as can be, it is eaſie to judge what would happen when the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> is not ſo hot as in the firſt Experiment, and when it is not altogether ſo cold as in the ſecond, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the leaſt circumſtance quite alters the Experiment, but the ſame things always happens in proportion with thoſe already deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>We made another Experiment thus: we put a little piece of the ſolid <hi>Phosphorus</hi> into a cryſtal veſſel, and we poured upon it a very fixt acid li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, I think it was <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi> a great fume aroſe from the mixture; we ſtopt the bottle with paper, and ſtirred the matter ſeveral times after having left it ſome hours in digeſtion. We lookt upon it in the dark, and it appeared luminous, though it were ſtopt, and it has ſtill been alike luminous from about two months ago until the preſent. Indeed the light of it is not ſo great as is that of the <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> but it keeps a much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time.</p>
                     <p>That which is ſurprizing in theſe Experiments is, that the air does ſometimes make the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> ſhine, and ſometimes not. Now to explicate this difficulty, I do ſay, that in the firſt Experiment the greateſt part of the luminous matter of the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> did fly out of the bottle into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and that that which remained in the bottle after it was ſeparated from the receiver, being deprived of its moſt ſubtle ſulphurs, was not able to give ſo great a light as before; nevertheleſs the
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:48366:287"/>
matter ſtill retaining a little warmth, there did riſe from it enough particles to give a light when the bottle was unſtopt, but becauſe by the cold the little bodies do condenſe, and loſe very much of their motion, this <hi>Phosphorus</hi> likewiſe loſes much of its ſtrength, and gives but a languid or weak light.</p>
                     <p>When the air was drawn out of the bottle, the matter lookt very light, and when the air was let to it again, it went out, the reaſon whereof is that the light being weak, could not preſerve its ſelf but with a convenient proportion of air, and there was ſome remaining ſtill in the bottle, for though the air be never ſo much pumped out of the veſſel there will ſtill remain a little behind. The <hi>Phosphorus</hi> loſes its light by the uſual great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of air, as a little candle will be put out by being expoſed to the wide air, or a ſmall fire will ſoon go out, when too great a wind blows ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it. So long as the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> ſends forth a great many vapours, a good deal of air is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make it appear luminous, and a little air will not be ſufficient. Wherefore when the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphorus</hi> was hot, it would not ſhine, until the bottle was unſtopt, but when it was cold, it ſent forth only weak vapors, wherefore then a very little air ſufficed to make it ſhine, and when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived too much, it was thereby ſuffocated.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Experiment made in the little Cryſtal bottle does further very well prove my explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the fixt acid liquor which was poured upon the <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> did ſlacken the motion of its parts, ſo that from that time they could not diſplay their light with ſo much vigour as they did; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:48366:287"/>
a very little ſufficed to continue its light, ſo that the paper-ſtopple ſerved to give it ſufficient air; but when the bottle was ſtopt cloſely with its Cryſtal ſtopple, no more light was ſeen for ſome time afterwards, becauſe that ſtopple did wholly hinder the entrance of air. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the fixing of the Volatile parts of the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphorus,</hi> which preſerves the light ſo long, for the matter having now leſs motion than before it was fixed, its parts do come to be diſſipated with the more leaſure.</p>
                     <p>But you will tell me, that the great fume which exhaled from it when the acid liquor was poured upon the <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> is rather a ſign of a greater than leſs diſſipation of parts.</p>
                     <p>I grant that when this acid acts upon the matter, there is at that time a conſiderable exaltation of parts, but I ſay alſo that when this great motion is once over, that which remains is in much leſs agitation than it was, and you muſt obſerve that the ſtrong acids, ſuch as <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> upon being mixed with <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> do cauſe a much like fume as this, and yet afterwards the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> is much leſs volatile than it was.</p>
                     <p>Again the light of the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> which is in the little cryſtal bottle that is ſtopt, may be ſaid to be partly cauſed by an air which is produced by a kind of fermentation, for doubtleſs there is ſome little action between the acid and the matter.</p>
                     <p>I find therefore that there is a parity of reaſon in the explication of the light which appeared in the viol after the air was pumped out of it, and that which is ſeen in the little cryſtal bottle ſtop'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="534" facs="tcp:48366:288"/>It is further remarkable that this ſame <hi>Phospho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> which went quite out, when air was let into it by means of the Pneumatick Engine, yet did not altogether loſe its light when it received the air the common way, that is to ſay, meerly by unſtopping the bottle, whereof the reaſon is this, the air that is communicated from the Air-pump comes in with a great force and violence through the pipe, and ſo may very well put out the light of the <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> which the air that has its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary motion is not able to do; after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a candle lighted is much ſooner put out when expoſed to a blaſt of wind, than when it is ſet in a place where the air is quiet.</p>
                     <p>From conſidering all the kinds of <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> both Natural and Artificial, and the Experiments that have been made upon them, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the general cauſe of the light they give does proceed from a very great agitation of inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts; and whereas it is very probable that fire is only a very violent motion of little bodies round their center, the parts of our <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> may be ſaid to have received the ſame determination by the fermentations it has undergone; for <hi>Wood</hi> never ſhines in the dark until it is become rotten, that is to ſay, until it has undergone a ſufficient fermentation to make its moſt ſubtile parts move nimbly round their center. The <hi>Bolonian ſtone</hi> is not luminous until it has been calcined a certain time, in order to excite a motion of its parts.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Viper</hi> being irritated darts forth its tongue with ſo much quickneſs, that it appears all on fire. Many little creatures, ſuch as ſome kinds of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars,</hi> and <hi>Woodlice</hi> do ſhine in the night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:48366:288"/>
they have a matter ſo exceeding ſubtile to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their tail, that it produces a ſort of fire; and it is for the ſame reaſon of the motion of parts that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> does become luminous.</p>
                     <p>That which gave occaſion to the working upon <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> for the making of the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> was, that in ſome little holes of the earth wherein there had been ſtanding-puddles of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> a light had been obſerved to be ſeen at nights.</p>
                     <p>But you will ask me then, why the greateſt part of mixt bodies do yield no light, although the ſame means are uſed to excite a motion of their parts.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that all mixt bodies have not their inſenſible parts ſo diſpoſed to a rapid motion, and after ſuch a manner as thoſe I have now ſpoken of. Wood indeed will eaſily enough flame, but you can't make a flame with ſtones, becauſe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give ſtones the ſame determination to motion of parts, as you can to wood. To give light, or to make a fire, bodies muſt be compounded of ſulphureous parts, for ſulphurs are very ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of motion.</p>
                     <p>I do not at all doubt but an infinite number of things, that there is no imagination of at preſent, might ſerve to the making of <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> when inquiſitive men ſhall have a mind to try it.</p>
                     <p>It has been obſerv'd in many men, that when they have been in a great rage, or are become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Cholerick, the very hair of their head has ſhone brighter than uſual; and we need not be ſcrupulous in believing what is ſaid of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> that when he was hotly engaged in the battle, fire was ſeen to ſparkle out of his eyes,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:48366:289"/>
becauſe his humors were then in an extraordinary commotion.</p>
                     <p>What I have now ſaid may paſs for a general explication on this matter, but if we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into particulars nicely, it would be very hard to clear ſo well as could be wiſhed a great many doubts that have been raiſed: for example, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> conſiſts the difference of fermentations, which of many like matters makes this to ſhine, and that not to ſhine, although they do ſeem to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the ſame fermentations and elaborations in a like ſpace of time. <hi>Why</hi> ſome things that have fermented but little do give a light, and others of the ſame nature, though they have fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented as long and longer, yet give no light. <hi>Why</hi> one ſide of a matter ſhall be luminous, and the other ſhall not be; we ought to have a very perfect knowledge of the ſtructure and the order of the inſenſible parts of the matter, to give good ſubſtantial reaſons for the reſolution of theſe doubts.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes there have been found in the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles pieces of Veal, Mutton, Beef, which do ſhine in the dark, though they have been but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed, and yet other pieces of the ſame kind killed at the ſame time, ſhall not ſhine at all. Nay, this very year was ſeen at <hi>Orleans,</hi> in a very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſeaſon, a great quantity of meat of this ſort, ſome of it would ſhine all over, and others of it would ſhine only in ſome certain places, in form of Stars. It was likewiſe obſerved that with ſome Butchers almoſt all their meat was found to be luminous, and with other Butchers there was not a bit to be ſeen of that kind. Men concluded
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:48366:289"/>
preſently that ſuch fleſh as this was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome to eat of, they therefore flung away a great deal of it into the river, and ſeveral Butchers there had like to be ruined by this accident; but at laſt perceiving that there was ſuch quantities of it, ſome people ventured to eat of it, and at length it was found to be as good meat as any other.</p>
                     <p>I conceive that this <hi>Phenomenon</hi> may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to two cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt to the Paſturage of the beaſts; for it is certain that in ſome countries the herbs are more ſpirituous than in others, and thoſe do give ſuch an active impreſſion to the humors of thoſe beaſts who feed on them, that they may have a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the making this <hi>Phosphorus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, To theſe beaſts having been heated more than others in their driving upon the road, or elſe to their having been killed before they had ſufficiently reſted after their journey; for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being put into a great motion thereby, do not every where loſe it after the beaſt is killed, and ſo long as the ſpirits do continue their rapid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo long the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> is to be ſeen, but when the fleſh begins to ſtink, there appears no more light in it, becauſe theſe vigorous ſpirits are then ſpent, or elſe they come to be confuſed in the meat by the means of another fermentation.</p>
                     <p>But you will not fail to make me this Objection: If the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> does conſiſt in a violent motion of the inſenſible parts, then ſtinking meat ſhould be more luminous than that which was newly kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe the ſmell proceeds from the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the principles of a mixt body by fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which as they riſe from it do ſtrike the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:48366:290"/>
nerve of Smelling, wherefore there muſt needs be a greater motion of parts in ſtinking meat than in that which is freſh.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer that that which makes the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> in meat newly killed is a matter much more active and more ſubtile than that which gives the ill ſmell to ſtinking meat; it is a remainder of the ſpirits which do run with a prodigious ſwiftneſs through the body of a living creature in all its parts, and unleſs the matter be in this degree of motion, it will never become lucid, no more than if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible parts of inflammable matters be not put into a very rapid motion, they will not take fire.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps alſo it may be that the meat in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting might receive a ſufficient agitation of parts to produce light, as it happens ſometimes in the ſtanding puddles of Urine.</p>
                     <p>In conſidering the light which appears upon the ſurface of ſtanding Urines, I have been led to think that there are oftentimes ſeroſities that ſettle in the bodies of ſick perſons which might be in a condition to make kinds of <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> if they had but air enough to illuminate them; at leaſt they do produce the effects of fire, as in Gouts, in Rheumatiſms, in the <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> and in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of other Inflammations.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chalk</hi> is a bituminous earth called in Latin <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> from the Iſle of <hi>Crete,</hi> where there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of it. It likewiſe abounds in many other Countries. Some Authors do recount three ſorts of it, the white, the greeniſh, and the black, but that which we uſe in this operation is the common, the white: It is calcined in order to make its <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> more active than it was before; the more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile part of it flies away, but there is ſtill enough remaining to make the <hi>PHOSPHOR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although <hi>Chalk</hi> be bituminous, nevertheleſs it is an alkali, becauſe the <hi>Sulphurs</hi> which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in ſmall quantity are not capable to ſhut the pores of it; and beſides, the calcination opens them more, and diſpoſes this earth to receive more eaſily the impreſſion of acids, which plainly ſhews it ſelf by the ſtrong ebullition that happens when it is thrown into the <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> The body muſt be large, and the Chalk muſt be thrown into it by little and little, to hinder the matter from boiling over. The Chalk does all of it diſſolve perfectly in the <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> and more is ſtill to be added, until there be no further ebullition; for that is the ſign that the acid ſpirits have rarefied the matter as much as they were able, and that being as it were ſheathed or locked up in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they could not poſſibly diſſolve any more of it; if therefore you ſhould ſtill add more in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, the overplus would precipitate to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. When the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> you uſe is good, it
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:48366:291"/>
diſſolves very near its weight in Chalk; the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is yellow.</p>
                     <p>That which is evaporated is the more phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick part of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and the acid Spirits being incorporated with the Chalk do make a kind of auſtere ſalt; this ſalt might very eaſily be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into a liquor in the air. It is fit that it ſhould be very dry, when it is put into the Coppel, that the operation may be done the ſooner; the veſſel is covered, that the matter may be the more eaſily melted, but the cover muſt needs have holes in it, to give vent to the vapours which riſe from it, and that we may ſee when the vapours do come yellow, that we may then immediately take the veſſel off the fire, for theſe yellow vapours are they that make the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> lucid.</p>
                     <p>After Calcination you find at bottom of the pan, or coppel, a terreſtrious matter which muſt be flung away as uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>In order to preſerve this <hi>Phosphorus</hi> the better you may leave it as it is in the veſſel wherein it was Calcined, but you muſt ſtop it cloſe in a box with a glaſs lid.</p>
                     <p>It is to be kept in a ſhady place, that its parts being thereby the more condenſed, they may ſpend the more ſlowly; and when you would have it to ſhine in the dark, you muſt expoſe it to the air about a quarter of an hour, becauſe the air does put its parts into a motion. This <hi>Phosphorus</hi> is in its effects very like to the <hi>Bolonian ſtone,</hi> but that takes the air much ſooner than this <hi>ſtone,</hi> becauſe it contains abundantly more ſalt; its light does not endure ſo long as that of the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> which I deſcribed before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HOney</hi> is compounded of the moſt Balſamick ſubſtance of ſeveral Flowers, which the <hi>Bees</hi> do ſeparate and carry into their Hives for nouriſhment. They do gather up and order this <hi>Honey</hi> moſt artificially, as if they took ſpecial care to make proviſion againſt Winter, and thereby they make way for the Fermentation which ſends to the ſides the groſſer part which is like to a <hi>Tartar,</hi> and called <hi>Wax,</hi> the <hi>Honey</hi> being found in the middle; the beſt to the taſte is the White, but for Phyſick the Yellow is the better, as containing more <hi>Spirits</hi> than the other; it muſt be of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conſiſtence, that is to ſay, neither too hard, nor too clear.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Hydromel</hi> is prepared with it for Diſeaſes of the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Vinous Hydromel</hi> is made of <hi>water</hi> and <hi>clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Honey,</hi> then the liquor is put to Ferment in a veſſel in the Sun, until it is grown as ſtrong as <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh wine;</hi> a Spirit may be drawn from it; and <hi>Hydromel</hi> will grow as ſowr as wine.</p>

                  <head>Diſtillation of Honey.</head>
                  <p>This preparation is a ſeparation of the Water, the Spirit, and the Oil of <hi>Honey</hi> from its terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part.</p>
                  <p>Put four pounds of good <hi>Honey</hi> into a large earthen body, and diſtil the water in a moderate Sand-heat, until acid drops begin to come; then take away the fire, and keep this Water in a bottle; it is good to make the hair grow, you muſt either wet your Comb with it every day, or elſe dip a piece of Spunge into it, and therewith ſoak the roots of the hair.</p>
                  <p>Take that which remains in the Body, put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an earthen Retort, or glaſs one Coated, but one that's large enough for two thirds to remain empty, and place your Retort in a Reverberatory Furnace; then fitting a large Receiver, and luting the joints, begin the diſtillation with a ſmall fire for three hours only to warm the Retort; then encreaſe it by little and little, Spirits will come forth with a little black Oil, and fill the Receiver with Clouds; continue the fire until all is come out that will, unlute the veſſels, and ſeparate the Spirit from the black and ſtinking Oil in a Tunnel lined with brown paper, (there is but very little Oil) keep them both in Viols: you will have twelve ounces of <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> is an excellent Aperitive, ſome of it may be dropt into Juleps, to give them an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able acidity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="544" facs="tcp:48366:293"/>The <hi>Spirit</hi> may be Rectified by diſtilling it in Sand in a glaſs Body, and that which riſes laſt may be kept apart as the ſtrongeſt of all; it is uſed for to cleanſe old Ulcers, and to eat proud fleſh.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Oil</hi> is good to be uſed in <hi>caries</hi> of bones.</p>
                  <p>You will have in the retort ſix and twenty oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a black very ſpongy matter, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable by reaſon of a ſoot that remains in it; when it is burnt it yields but very few aſhes, out of which nothing can be drawn.</p>

                     <head>Remarks.</head>
                     <p>The Veſſels muſt be exceeding large for the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation of Honey,</hi> becauſe a great vacuity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for it to rarifie in.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Water of Honey</hi> makes the Hair to grow, becauſe it opens the Pores; ſome do mix it with the Juice of <hi>Onion</hi> to render it the more effectual.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes a little <hi>Wax</hi> is found in the receiver, which came with the <hi>Spirit</hi> from the <hi>Honey</hi> in the diſtillation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Diſtillation of Wax.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is a ſeparation of the Oil of <hi>Wax,</hi> from the Phlegm, and Salt.</p>
               <p>Melt two pounds of <hi>Yellow Wax</hi> in an earthen pan, and mix with it three or four pounds of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters earth powdered, or ſo much as is requiſite to make a Paſte of it, form it into little pellets, and put them into an earthen Retort, or glaſs one Coated, a third of which remains empty; place this Retort in a Reverberatory Furnace; fit to it a Receiver, and luting the joints, give a ſmall fire at firſt, and there will come forth <hi>Phlegm,</hi> then a <hi>Spirit;</hi> encreaſe the fire a little, and a liquor will diſtil that congeals in the Receiver like <hi>Butter;</hi> continue the fire till nothing more comes forth; then unlute the joints, ſeparate the <hi>Spirit</hi> mixed with <hi>Phlegm</hi> from the <hi>Butter,</hi> and keep it in a Viol well ſtopt. It is a good opener; the doſe is from ten drops to twenty in <hi>raddiſh</hi> water, or ſome other appropriate liquor.</p>
               <p>Some do uſe the <hi>Butter of Wax</hi> to diſcuſs tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, rather than the <hi>Oil</hi> that I am going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
               <p>Melt the <hi>Butter of Wax</hi> in an earthen pan, and make a paſte of it with ſufficient quantity of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters-earth powdered; form this paſte into little pellets, put them into a glaſs retort, ſet your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:48366:294"/>
in a Sand-heat, fit to it a Receiver, and luting the joints, begin the diſtillation with a ſmall fire, a great many <hi>Spirits</hi> will come forth mixed with <hi>Phlegm,</hi> after which encreaſe it a little, and a clear yellow <hi>Oil</hi> will come; having diſtil'd about three ounces of it, change the Receiver, for that which comes at laſt is as thick as <hi>Butter.</hi> It may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified with other clay, or potters-earth, and it will change into as tranſparent an <hi>Oil</hi> as the other. Separate the <hi>Oil</hi> from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and keep it in a Viol. It is a good diſcutient for Tumors, and Cold pains: it is mixed in Unguents and Oils for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Oil of Wax</hi> may be rectified ſeveral other times to make it ſtill clearer than before.</p>
               <div type="remarks">
                  <head>Remarks.</head>
                  <p>The ſolid conſiſtence of <hi>Wax</hi> doth proceed from a proportionate mixture of <hi>Water, Volatile Salt,</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> united and incorporated together; wherefore its ſolidity comes to be deſtroyed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the <hi>Principles</hi> do ſuffer a ſeparation; and this is eaſily obſerved in the <hi>Rectifications,</hi> for in every diſtillation that is made, ſome conſiderable quantity of water is ſeparated, and the <hi>Oil</hi> does likewiſe become clearer.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Clay</hi> ſerves only to ſeparate the parts of <hi>Wax,</hi> and to rarifie it the more.</p>
                  <p>If by way of curioſity you deſire to know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what quantity of liquor, or Spirit, can be drawn from <hi>Wax,</hi> you muſt dry your Clay as much as you can, or elſe uſe in its place, broken
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:48366:294"/>
pots, or Bricks powdered, which are not at all wet: out of three and twenty ounces of <hi>Wax,</hi> you'l draw in the firſt diſtillation juſt the ſame weight of liquor; to wit, twelve ounces of <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Spirit,</hi> and the reſt is a <hi>Butter;</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third diſtillation you'l draw fourteen ounces of Spirit, and ſix ounces of clear Oil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spirit of Wax</hi> is only a ſmall quantity of acid Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile ſalt diſſolved in Phlegm; but you muſt not believe what ſome have written, that having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled a conſiderable quantity of <hi>Wax,</hi> and put that which was drawn into a Bolt-head, they could ſublime the Volatile ſalt like others of that nature. For this ſalt, though it be indeed Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, yet it is not Volatile enough to riſe before the <hi>Phlegm;</hi> it is an acid ſalt much like unto that of <hi>Ambar,</hi> but is not of the nature of Volatile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali's, which are known to ſublime ſo eaſily; it were better therefore to keep this Spirit as it is, or elſe to evaporate about half of it with a very mild heat, that it may be the ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>The Volatile ſalts of many ſulphureous matters are drawn acid, as they are in the mixt, becauſe being clothed with ſoft and ramous parts which give way eaſily to their motion, they do not break their natural keenneſs by endeavouring to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, when they are forced to it by fire, and ſo they do not receive ſo much terreſtrious and firy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as is requiſite to make them porous, like Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile alkali's.</p>
                  <p>This Operation, and that of the Diſtillation of <hi>Ambar</hi> which I have deſcribed, do much confirm what I ſaid before in my <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> that all the ſalt of mixt bodies is naturally
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:48366:295"/>
acid, and that alkali is nothing elſe but an alteration of the Natural Salt, made by fire. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all ſorts of Experiments do ſeem to me to confirm and eſtabliſh this opinion; but yet I am not ſo peremptory in the vindication of it, but that I would gladly give place to another, if I could be ſhewed that it is better than mine, for I ſeek after nothing ſo much as to diſcover truth.</p>
