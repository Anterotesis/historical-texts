         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A GENTLEWOMAN to a Perſon of QUALITY;

PEREAT PAPA;
Or, REASONS why POPERY ſhould not inherit the

            <epigraph>
               <q>Anſwer a Fool according to his Folly.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAD the Paper you ſent me, intituled <hi>Pereat Papa, or Reaſons why</hi> Popery <hi>ſhould not uſurp the
Crown,</hi> come accidentally to my hands, and had not been ſeriouſly recommended to my
obſervation by you, I ſhould have concluded its Author had jocularly intended, or to, uſe
his own phraſe, conceived, and that very candidly, ſuch Reaſon<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> proper to Burleſque, a
late Deſign for altering the Succeſſion, on account of that ſo often baffled a Cauſe called <hi>Popery.</hi> But
inſtructed by your Letter from ſo wild a Reflection, I begin to conſider it as the Labours of ſome Grand
Sage—<hi>Ignoramus</hi> of the Common-Law, which furniſhes its Students with Reaſons intelligent
to none but themſelves; but Reaſons, ſince he is pleaſed to call them, ſo let them be; for ſhould a
filly Woman venture to queſtion that Title, ſhe might perhaps anger ſome terrible Judge that daily
deals out Death with the like Logick.</p>
            <p>Therefore with humble ſubmiſſion to ſuch powerful Diſputants, who can deſtroy by preſident
thoſe they cannot confute, I will give you my Obſervations thereupon, and firſt upon his Preamble,
in theſe following words.</p>
            <p>It is conceiv'd, and that very candidly, without prejudice to others Judgments, or troubling our
ſelves with that ſo often baffled a Cauſe called <hi>Popery,</hi> That a <hi>Papiſt</hi> ought not to inherit or ſucceed to
the management of the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> Now as to his candid conceiving, without prejudice to his Judgment, I humbly conceive,
That thoſe quaint words, and all the reſt ſo ill put together, are meer Non-ſence; and that without
the help of his Title it would be hard to find out his meaning to be, That a <hi>Papiſt</hi> ought not to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Crown: His firſt pretended Reaſon is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R. 1.</hi> In ſtrictneſs of Law, becauſe one ſo qualifyed hath wilfully diſabled or rendered himſelf uncapable
of that Benefit which the Common-Law (after the uſual courſe of deſcent) doth poſitively require,
for 'tis preſumable, That he that ſucceeds in the Office of the Crown ſhould be legally adopted to
execute ſo great a truſt; and therefore if <hi>Minus Idoneus</hi> not ſufficiently ballaſted with the Notions
and Intrigues of State, others are to govern in aid of him, as in caſe of Ideocy, Lunacy, or the like, and
the Parliament is bound (as truſted to redreſs Grievances and ſecure the Nation) to place it where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Propertie ſhall be adjudged moſt ſafe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51223:2"/>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> Here he would be thought a Lawyer, a Calling I have not profeſt, becauſe I obſerve Women
are rarely made Judges; but yet I am not ſo ignorant of the Common-Law, but that I have heard it
defin'd to be right reaſon, guided by ancient uſage: Therefore if this Gentleman had brought but one
Preſident where a <hi>Papiſt</hi> had been put by the Crown, meerly for being ſuch, he had ſaved himſelf and his
Readers much trouble in compoſing and obſerving ſo many nothings, as his eight unintelligable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
amount to: But in the name of Wonder, how does a <hi>Papiſt</hi> Prince incapacitate himſelf for the
Crown by the Common-law, (after the uſual courſe of deſcent) when from the time of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
there has been one and twenty of that Religion, and but five of the Reformed Church, have
worn the Imperial Crown of this Realm; but to ſpeak to the purpoſe, it is plain that the Common-law
alters not the Succeſſion on account of Religion, nor indeed on any account whatſoever, no not if
the King be <hi>Minus Idoneus,</hi> Infant, Ideot, or Lunatick: for right reaſon, continual uſage, with number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Preſidents in this and other Her<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ditary Monarchies, teach us. That ſuch alterations would do more
harm to Religion and Property, than any of thoſe Temporary Inconveniences, ſo that the Common-Law,
both by Preſident and right reaſon, abhors his Reaſon: and what the Power or duty of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in this Caſe is, I am ſure is a Theame too high for him or me to define; therefore I will paſs
on to his 6 pretended Preſidents of that nature, and if any of them proves the leaſt part of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I will ſubmit my Reaſon to be the Slave of Incoherency for ever.</p>
            <p>Preſident the 1ſt. <hi>Edgar Ethling,</hi> (as Stories agree) was the undoubted Heir, yet <hi>VVilliam</hi> the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
commonly called the Conquerour, was call'd in to oppoſe <hi>Harold,</hi> and inveſted with the
Crown, and <hi>Ethling</hi> for ever an Exile and diſinherited.</p>
            <p>2dly. After him ſucceeded his ſecond Son, <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and not <hi>Robert</hi> the eldeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> By his leave, Stories do not agree, that <hi>William</hi> was called in, though <hi>Edgar</hi> the right Heir
'tis true was put by, but 'tis as true (that Stories agree) that Liberty and Property were thereupon
deſtroyed; for <hi>William</hi> diveſted whom he pleas'd of their Lands, to gratifie his Fellow Conquerours:
Nor did the ſecond <hi>William</hi> deal Kindlier with any whom he ſuſpected had the leaſt Eye to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Robert</hi>'s Signiority; nor was the Nation freed from this Tyranny untill the Blood of the right
<hi>Saxon</hi> Heir <hi>Edgar</hi> was again inocculated into the Crown by the Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt. Would any
Man then in his right wits write ſuch Preſidents in order to preſerve Religion and Property?</p>
            <p>3dly. King <hi>John</hi> not only laid aſide <hi>Arthur Plantaginet,</hi> his elder Brother's Son, but likewiſe put
him to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> By this Preſident <hi>Ignoramus</hi> diſcovers his Morals; For that King <hi>John</hi> uſurp'd againſt his
Nephew <hi>Arthur</hi> none denys; and that thereupon enſued Bloody Inteſtine Broyls, with the loſs of
<hi>Normandy</hi> &amp;c. with other National Miſeries, the conſtant conſequences of ſuch mutations, but that
he murther'd his Nephew he ever denyed; though had our Lawyer been of his Council, he might
have boaſted it, becauſe 'tis two to one, the young Prince ſtood <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected.</p>
            <p>4thly. In <hi>Cicily</hi> there was lately a great Conteſt between the two Sons of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second,
<hi>Martellus</hi> and <hi>Robert,</hi> and I find the Crown awarded to <hi>Robert</hi> the youngeſt, as, <hi>Magnus dignus ad
Regandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5thly. <hi>Alexander</hi> was demanded to whom he would bequeath his Scepter, he ſaid, <hi>To the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and to him whoſe Sword hath the ſharpeſt point;</hi> meaning, to him whoſe Vertues were moſt Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent,
and of the brighteſt Integrity, according to the diſpoſition of <hi>Jacob,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and
conferring the Bleſſing on <hi>Ephraim</hi> the younger, as moſt deſerving and acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> Now would I defie your Author, or the moſt cunning Sophiſter on Earth, to make theſe
two Preſidents, or any part of them, to quadrate in the leaſt with his Title to them: There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Preſidents of this nature, but he is extream lucky in his choice, both of words and matters
which are nothing to the purpoſe, and above all in the next.</p>
            <p>6thly. The State of <hi>France</hi> rejected the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and appointed <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth to reign
over them, becauſe of another Religion, in leaving God, and complying with their Church, to gain
a Crown, with what a Tragical end did they reward him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> Would not this Preſident give me juſt cauſe to believe, That the Gentleman was burleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queing
his Cauſe; for who could think a man ſo ill verſt in Hiſtory, ſhould pretend to quote Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
from it; They rejected, ſays he, the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> for <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth; and why could
he not have ſaid, They rejected again <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth for the King of <hi>Navarr;</hi> and ſo it had been
a noble Preſident to ſuch as did not know that <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, and the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> were one and
the ſame Perſon: But why ſhould I concern my ſelf with ſo impertinent a Paper; for indeed all his
Preſidents are as much to the purpoſe, as the reply to ones demand, Why the Devil was generally
painted with Horns? how ſays the other, did you never read in Scripture, that <hi>the Devil goes about
like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Therefore, not much to combate a Nothing. I will
only obſerve the Gentleman ſtrangely forgot one Preſident, proper indeed to his Principals and Morals,
that is, the Depoſal and Murther of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, on pretence, amongſt other Falſhoods, that
he favoured <hi>Popery;</hi> This truly, as to his deſign, is worth a thouſand ſuch as he hath quoted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Can it be thought but that he that ſucceeds in the Crown, ſhould not ſucceed <hi>Concurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
his qui in jure requiſerunt,</hi> as the Civil Law expreſſes it, That in all the concerns thereof, which
are the Laws, principally thoſe that relate to Religion, and not for one man led away with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51223:3"/>
perverſeneſs, renouncing the Religion he knows not why, (and ſo wilfully attainting himſelf)
to inthrall the Nation in Superſtition and Tyranny; for regularly in all parts, where <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lords are
in the Church, there Tyranny of courſe rages in the State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> Can this be thought to look to any reaſonable man like Reaſon, for, except a ſcrap of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
(whereby the Gentleman pretends to the Civil Law, of which he underſtands as much as of the
Common, or Hiſtory) there is not one word to the purpoſe; for, what can purblind perverſeneſs, or
wilfully attainting himſelf mean more than mallice, as the whole Sentence indeed is intended for,
concluding with a poſitive falſeneſs, ſince it is well known we owe our thanks for <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and
other Franchiſes to Popiſh Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. 'Tis a Maxime amongſt Lawyers, that, <hi>Lex facit Regem;</hi> and Maxims muſt not be denyed;
if ſo, then to ſpeak out after the true intendment of the Law; he that comes not to the Crown <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatim,</hi>
as the Law notifies, and preſcribes, 'tis no lawful Succeſſion, but down-right uſurpation, and
without ſcruple it is in the Devoir of every good Chriſtian to withſtand an Uſurper, it being undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
more pleaſing to God to put one man by who thus wilfully diſables himſelf, and withall moſt
ſhamefully uſurps, than expoſe Millions of Souls to Damnation, and the Streets to flow with Blood,
by ſuffering that Religion to creep in, whoſe Reformation (at the milder rate) will certainly prove
Fire and Faggot.</p>
            <p>For this very cauſe <hi>Mecha</hi> was removed from being Queen, by her Son King <hi>Aſa,</hi> for making an
Idol in a Grove, incited thereunto by the Prophet <hi>Azariah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> I will believe it is a Maxime, and by it is only meant: That by the Law, the next of blood,
is made King; for as to his inference, 'tis malicious, Trayterous, and Ridiculous, ſetting up in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
pretended good Chriſtian, a power to depoſe any Prince he pleaſes to call an Uſurper; for his
Fire and Faggots they are meerly Wildfire in his own Brains, as his Example of King <hi>Aſa</hi> is, who
only took from his Mother the dignity of a Queen: for the Regal Power was before in himſelf, and
ſure he had reaſon to ſuppreſs in his firſt Subject ſo great an Example of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. The ſucceſſion of the Crown and a common deſcent much differ, for if an Heir that's a
ſubject prove looſe and debauch'd it little damnifies the Publick, more deſerving perſons may haply
ſtep into his Poſſeſſion, and be more ſerviceable to the Publick; the dammage is ſtill but private to
his own Family. But in caſe of the Crown, there is none ſo ſenſeleſs but muſt needs conceive the
dammage moſt fatal, becauſe univerſal, the whole Nation muſt inevitably ſuffer, Religion be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and Property deſtroyed, and the whole people in danger of their lives.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known in the private caſe, the Heir is uſually thrown off and diſ-inherited, if an Entail,
it may be deſtroyed, and the Law juſtifies it. The like in the publick of the Throne (the Grand
Inquiſitors of State and Conſervators of the Liberties of <hi>England</hi>) the Parliament may for weighty
Cauſes refuſe the Heir preſumptive, and for the ſafety of the Nation, ſettle it where they in honour
and prudence conceive moſt proper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> What ſhall I ſay more to all this New-Nothing, but that 'tis not fit he or I ſhould limit the
power of the King in his Parliament; but 'tis to be ſuppoſed that they will know beſt how to obey
new Laws, who are not factious againſt the Old, as your Author moſt impudently appears to be, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his Golden Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. We read in Scripture, which is the Golden Rule we muſt walk by; That <hi>Libnah</hi> revolted
from <hi>Jehoram</hi> becauſe he had forſaken the God of his Fathers, and ſo we had better forſake man and
adhere to God in keeping our Religion, than truſt to man and loſe God, to be unavoidably deſtroyed
here, and hereafter irrecoverably damned in ſerving <hi>Baal,</hi> and parting with the Divinity now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> This might have paſt as well for a Preſident, as a Reaſon, but that he infers from it a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to revolt from the worſhip of <hi>Baall,</hi> for the Divinity eſtabliſht, which priviledge by my conſent
no body ſhall deny him, ſince he has already made a revolt from Common-ſenſe and Humanity, by ſo
many vain and Chymerical ſuppoſitions as are put together in this and his next Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 6. <hi>When</hi> Rehoboam <hi>had prepared a huge Army to reduce the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>he was forbidden by
the Prophet,</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord, ye ſhall not go up nor fight againſt your brethren, for this is for me, <hi>mark,</hi>
he calls them Brethren not Rebels.</p>
            <p>Paſſive Obedience therefore is ſimple and fit for tame Owls that know no better, now God has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
the Snare and the Pit of Ruins that the Pope and the Devil has prepar'd for us, if we do not
timely countermine it by cautionary Laws to ſuppreſs thoſe that dig'd it, we may in a ſhort ſpace be
thrown into it head-long and no one pity us.</p>
            <p>But the Right Line with ſome ſhallow pated talkers, is a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> ſo ſacred forſooth, that
we muſt venture Body and Soul in ſubjecting our ſelves to all the curſes imaginable that Hell it ſelf
can inflict on us, rather than in the leaſt alter or controul it, a very frivolous Caveat, and not to be
heeded, humane examples, as I ſhewed before, have voted againſt it, and the Scripture warrants it,
<hi>Samuel</hi> foretold in the Caſe of <hi>Saul</hi> that he would be rejected for his diſobedience, though not his
Perſon degraded or Depoſed, yet that the Kingdom ſhould both be remov'd from his Line and Tribe,
which was done accordingly, and transferred on <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This proves very fully that Heirs, or next in Succeſſion, are not ſo immoveably placed, but that they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51223:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may lawfully (on juſt Cauſe) be diſplaced, if not legally Quallified, and others put up for Gods glory
in their Rooms.</p>
            <p>God raiſed <hi>Jehu</hi> to purge Idolatry againſt the Houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> all the Sons of <hi>Ahab</hi> were beheaded,
and in a manner his whole Line cut off, for his good Service he had a Promiſe of a ſpecial Bleſſing for
his Iſſue to continue the Throne to the fourth generation, ſeveral other inſtances I could give, but this
may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>In brief there is no Reformed Church, from the firſt <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Languedock</hi> to this very
day, but have held it lawful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> Through all the railing and no Reaſon of this long Reaſon, I will only pick out theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;
Firſt, That the Author is no true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who has always taught her
Children Paſſive Obedience at leaſt, for which they are by our mannerly Statiſts branded with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of Tame Owls and ſhallow pated Talkers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he has caſt an Aſperſion on all the Reformed Churches, from the firſt <hi>Waldenſes,
&amp;c.</hi> to this day, for holding his Wild Principles and bloody Examples lawful.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What greater advantage he could have given the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> falſly charged with ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to retort them on the Reformers, I cannot tell, but this am ſure, if it be true, it is a fair Caveat
to all Princes, not ſubject to ſuch Doctines, to be careful of their ſpreading in their Dominions, for at
worſt 'tis leſs dangerous to have one Mad Depoſer, called the Pope, at a diſtance, then to have every
Town in ones Dominions crouded with ſuch Soveraign Judges, whoſe Sentences may be executed
according to this Divinity by every deſperate hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. 'Tis conceited by half-witted States-men, that Reſtrictive Laws may prevent all miſchief,
and ſecure the <hi>Protestants:</hi> A very vain Opinion, and moſt fallacious; for Laws will never bind, but
more enrage, ſhackle him as you will, and load him with ne're ſo many Laws, when King, he and his
Party will be reſtleſs, till they have ſet themſelves at liberty, and to have the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> under; when
King he is not Impeachable, and the <hi>poſſe Regni</hi> will then be at his diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>When the Wolf is Shepherd, the Flock is very ſafe indeed, and like to be well look't to; after all
denounceable at will; for if his Party now commit ſuch outrages, that no Age can parallel, what
will they do then? now no man ſafe in his Bed, then none ſafe at all; they will adventure to murder
people covertly, and in their houſes, for they hold it no more ſin than to kill a Dog.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> The Gent. might have been more mannerly in his Character, if it be conſidered what
States-man has lately in Council, or rather to the Parliament, declared his Opinion for the Reſtrictive
Laws under a right Succeſſion; whoſe Declaration ought to have made that matter, <hi>A noli me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi>
at leaſt to any private perſon: But he that dare ſpeak evil of Dignities, and brand Superiours
with the Title of half-witted States-men, would, had he but half the courage that he has malice,
commit greater outrages, than Fancy can make the others guilty of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. In fine, be ſure he and his Party (which will daily encreaſe, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> decline) will
ſoon get an opportunity, either by Stratagem, or open force, to avoid all Laws, though they are ne're
ſo ſtrong and wary, and ſo impoſſible to be ſafe without a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Succeſſor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANS.</hi> This Prophetical Reaſon, in fine, is at beſt but one Doctors Opinion, and, I doubt me, but
a meer <hi>Mountebank</hi> at the Pulſe of a Kingdom: of which I will aſſure you, Sir, I perceive by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
he knows ſo little, that a better Diſcourſe often comes <hi>ex tempore</hi> from a good Woman at a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiping
upon the ſame Subject. For the whole, 'tis an unconnext Rapſody of meer words, interlaced
with ſcraps of <hi>Latine,</hi> brought in to as little purpoſe as his Preſidents; ſo that if he be your Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
(for Friend he cannot be to ſo worthy a Perſon) perſwade him to keep his Ignorance out of
Paper hereafter; and his Impudence, to treat of Subjects ſo much above his comprehenſion, will paſs
off well enough in <hi>Coffee-Houſes,</hi> where to rail ſufficiently againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> is policy to the purpoſe:
To which Crouds of unthinking Praters, I freely bequeath him, as I do my ſelf, to be for ever,</p>

            <p>SInce my Anſwer to yours, in ſlight obſervations, on <hi>Pereat Papa,</hi> I find the Author ſo fond of
his folly, as to put it in print, though with a little alteration, I ſuppoſe by direction from the
Printer, for he has chang'd his firſt Preſident; not into better ſenſe, nor a jot more to his purpoſe,
but into ſomething that ſhews he has been told by ſome body, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> was
the rejected King of <hi>Navar;</hi> but his Hiſtorian, it ſeems, could not inform him, that the Crown was
ſetled on his Head, and that he had a long, glorious, and proſperous Reign, till aſſaſſinated by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate,
barbarous, and irreligious Villain, upon a private revenge as was ever believed, and has been
ſince confeſt by <hi>Ravillacks</hi> Brother on his Death-bed in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Printer too had the manners, I
ſuppoſe, againſt the Authors will, to leave out the witty Epithet of tame Owls, given to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
obedience in his ſixth Reaſon; other material change there is none, and you muſt pardon this,
being printed ſince: 'Tis pity the World ſhould ſee the Coxcomb uncorrected, and that by the hand
of a Woman, the provocation whereof, I ſuppoſe, made him appeal to the more Judicious in print,
and has forced me to do the ſame, with this addition to my firſt Sentence—<hi>Bray a Fool in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and he will not return from his folly.</hi>
