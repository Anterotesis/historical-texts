            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all ſuch as Complain that they want Power,
not applying themſelves to yeild ſubjection to
what of God is made manifeſt in them, upon
a pretence of waiting for Power ſo to do.</head>
            <p>THe Lord God of eternal power, who made Man in his
own Image, he ſtretcheth forth his Arm to ſave and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
his loſt Creature. It is his power alone, that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
the work of Redemption. He quickneth man,
who is dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins. He keepeth alive, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on the quickned ſoul in the path of Life. He conquereth,
ſcattereth, and ſubdueth all the enemies round about the Soul,
even all the loſts, corruptions and temptations, which lead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
and entangle in Perdition.</p>
            <p>Yet the Lord God requireth ſomewhat of the man whom he
ſaveth, without which being found in man, and returned to
him from man, he ſaveth him not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What doth he require of Man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He requireth of Man, <hi>Repentance, Faith and Obedience.</hi>
That he ſhould turn at his Call, from the Darkneſs to the Light;
that he ſhould truſt in, and cleave to the Light, but believe the
ſpirit of Darkneſs no more; and laſtly, that he ſhould obey the
Light, follow the Light, walk in the footſteps of the living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Land of Light; work the Works of God in the Light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How can Man do this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Of himſelf he cannot: But being touched, being
quickned by the Eternal Power, being turned by a ſecret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and ſtirring of life in his Heart, then he can turn towards
that which turneth him. Being drawn by the Life, by the Power;
he can follow after the Life, and after the Power. Finding the
ſweetneſs of the Living Vine, and his ſoul made alive by the
Sap of the Vine, his heart can now cleave to, and abide in the
Vine, and bring forth the Fruit of the living faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Husband-man, who daily dreſſeth the Heart, that
waiteth in the Living Principle for further life from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93156:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it may bring forth the fruits of Life more and more.</p>
            <p>Now mark: Is it poſſible for any man to come to the Eternal
Reſt, that travels not the Path? Or is there any Path, but the
repentance, faith and obedience of the Living Spirit, even of the
Child begotten by the Eternal Power, who is taught by its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to abide and walk in the Life, and in the Power?</p>
            <p>God putteth forth his Hand all the day long, to fetch home
loſt man. He hath given him a Talent, a living Talent, which
is able to work man into the life, and to bring forth the fruits of
life in man. Man overlooks the Talent, joyns not his heart to it,
brings not forth the fruits of Life to the giver, but cries he wants
power, and <hi>what is he? what can he do? can he cleanſe his own
heart? can he kill his corruptions? can he quicken himſelf?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now mark again. There are ſeveral diſpenſations of God to
mankind, in all which man (of himſelf) falls ſhort of the Life,
of the Power, of the Glory, an comes under Condemnation.
God layes the blame on man, for not hearkning, for not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for not walking with him. Man layes the blame on God,
and ſays he wants power. Look on him who is not obedient to
the light, which he cannot but confeſs to ſhine in his heart, and
often to reprove him; ask him why he doth not obey it? is not
this his plea, that he wants power? Now let men conſider, will
this ſtand before the Throne of God? This is the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that men do not believe the Light of Life, do not obey the
Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; do not truſt and follow the
Light which would lead them to Life, but truſt and follow the
darkneſs which leads into death and into everlaſting Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Their plea is, they want power ſo to do. Is this true?</p>
            <p>I confeſs the power doth not ſo flow forth to man, as man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
it: but the power of life works man out of death in a miſtery,
and begins in him as weakneſs. There is all the ſtrength, all
the power of the enemy, againſt the work of God in the heart.
There is but a little thing (like a grain of muſtard-ſeed) a weak
thing, a fooliſh thing, even that which is not (to man's eye) to
overcome all this: and yet in this is the power. And here is the
great deceit of man: He looks for a great manifeſt power in or
upon him to begin with, and doth not ſee how the power is in
the little weak ſtirings of life in the heart, in the riſing up of
ſomewhat againſt the mighty ſtrength of corruption in him,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93156:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which he turning towards, cleaving to, and wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap> upon the

               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> in its ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ, and he will be drawn nearer and nearer to the Lord, and his enemies be overcome and fall he knows not how. But he that
waits for ſuch a mighty appearance of power at firſt, looking ſo
to begin, and after that manner to be preſerved and carried on,
can never in this capacity ſo much as walk in the path Eternal,
nor is not in the way of receiving the power, which ſprings up
as weakneſs, and leads on and overcomes enemies in a myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
way of working, and not in ſuch a manifeſt and direct way
of conqueſt, as man's wiſdom expects.</p>
            <p>The ſeed of the kingdom is ſown man knows not how, even
by a ſound of the Eternal Spirit, which he is not a fit Judge of:
and it grows up he knows not how: and the power appears and
works in it, in away that he is not aware of. He looks for the
Kingdom, the Power and the Life, in a way of his obſervation,
anſwerable to the thoughts and expectations of his heart. But
thus it never comes, but in the way of its own eternal motion,
it ſprings in the hearts of many, and they overlook the thing,
and turn from it daily, not knowing its proper way of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but expecting it ſome other way. And thus the enemy
holds them in the bands of death, and they are captives in the
ſtrange land, refuſing the Prince of Life in his daily offers of
Life, becauſe they look not for him thus, but after another way
and manner. And till this eye of obſervation be put out in them,
they can never clearly ſee the appearance of the Saviour to them,
not feel the efficacy of his ſaving of them from that, from which
none but he can deliver.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſakes of ſuch as are ſingle-hearted, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
from the enjoyment of the Life of God and of his pure Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
through away of wrong expecting it, I ſhall ſay a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the operation of the power in quickning, and leading on
the quickned ſoul, as alſo concerning the way of its ſpringing
up in the heart, and the neceſſity of this way.</p>
            <p>I my ſelf was long withheld from obedience to the Light Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
in its low appearance of diſcovering and convincing of ſin,
through this very deceit, believing that my condition required
the manifeſt appearance of a very great power to help me: and
ſo when ſin overcame me, I did only mourn over it, crying af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93156:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and waiting for power, but was kept from joyning with and
cleaving <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that, wherein the power ſprings up and manifeſts it ſelf according to its own pleaſure, quite contrary to the way of
man's expectation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The operations of the Power</hi> are divers and gradual, according
to the condition and neceſſity of the ſoul whom it viſits, and
reacheth forth its hand unto.</p>
            <p>1. There is a diſcovery of the darkneſs, and of the erring of
the heart from God. This is power; for this ſhould never be
in any heart, could all the powers of darkneſs there withſtand it.</p>
            <p>2. There is a riſing of the heart againſt the evil, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of deliverance from it, and of the ſpringing up of the good
in ſuch power as might conquer it. This is a further appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of power than the former, and a good beginning towards
believing or joyning with the redeeming Arm, which all the
Powers of darkneſs (with all manuer of ſubtilty) endeavour
to divert the heart form.</p>
            <p>3. There is an upright frame of ſirit begotten, and a truth
of heart formed towards the Lord, from which deſires, and
cries, and groanes after his life and preſence, and for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the enemy, and from under the power of his deceit,
ſpring more and more.</p>
            <p>4. There is a fear begotten in the heart of being deceived by
the enemy, of being drawn from the feeling of and panting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Life and Power of God.</p>
            <p>5. There is an hope and truſt in the Lord's Goodneſs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
with a daily waiting for his appearance, for the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Spirit and pure Preſence, and for the ſpringings up of
his frſh Life and precious Vertue.</p>
            <p>6. There are overturnings of the enemy, battering down his
ſtrong holds, breaking of many ſnares, beating back of many
furious aſſaults, and cauſing the plant of Life to grow up, and
Triumph over all the powers of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>7. There are ſecret ſtayings and upholdings of the heart in
the hour of darkneſs, when God ſees neceſſary to let forth the
power thereof upon the Soul, and to Eclipſe his own Power.
when the enemy buffets, tempts, prevails, and gets ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Soul, is drawing it back under the vail, even into the Pit,
and nothing appears near to ſtop it or Reſcue the Soul from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93156:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
death, and from the power of the Grave, but the ſting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
enters and deeply wounds the Soul; yet even then the power
is near, ſecretly upholding, preſerving and watching over the
Soul, and waiting for the proper ſeaſon of Deliverance. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
I am continually with thee, thou ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t holden me by my right
hand,</hi> ſaid David, when his feet had almoſt ſlipped into the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſnare of deſperate unbelief, and murmuring againſt God's
dealings with him and the reſt of his people.</p>
            <p>Many more operations of the Power might be mentioned, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of its tabernacling and glorious appearing in ſome veſſels in
various wayes, both delighting it ſelf in the heart, and alſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the heart with delight and joy in the pure Life: but theſe
things are better enjoyed and ſweetly felt, in the ſilence of the
fleſhly part, then ſpoken of to that ear, which is not fit to hear
the ſound thereof.</p>
            <p>2dly. <hi>The way of the Powers ſpringing up in the Heart,</hi> which is,
1. In its turning from the Darkneſs, in the Faith and in the
pure Obedience, which flowes from the faith. For us the Soul
turns, from the power of darkneſs and death towards the living
Power, towards the power of the Eternal Spirit of Light: ſo the
Power meets it, embraces it, appears to it, and manifeſts it ſelf
in it, proportionable to its preſent capacity and condition. And
as the ſoul, being touched with the living Vertue, gives it ſelf up
to believe, &amp; to truſt the power which draws: ſo the power mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
it ſelf in the heart, according to the proportion of the faith
which the Eternal Vertue hath begotten there. And as the ſoul, in
the faith gives it ſelf up to obey: ſo the power appears &amp; works the
obedience. For we can do nothing of our ſelves: but being called,
being drawn, being required to do that which is far beyond our
ſtrength, and giving up thereto, the Life ſprings, the Power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
which does the work. This the <hi>Philippians</hi> had experience
of, to whom the Apoſtle gave that exhortation, <hi>Work out your own
Salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God which worketh in
you, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> It is the unbeliever
hangs back, and cries where ſhall I have power? But the faith fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the moving and drawing of the ſpirit, and the Power never
fails the Faith. But that which cries, how ſhall I get out of <hi>Egypt?</hi>
which way ſhall I ever be able to paſs through this intricate
wilderneſs? how ſhall I overcome thoſe mighty Enemies, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93156:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
already have the poſſeſſion of the Land I ſhould inherit, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſtrongly ſenced in it, and mighty in ſtrength to keep their hold
therof? This is not the right Seed, this is not the true Iſrael,
for whom the everlaſting inheritance of the life, and of the pure
Power is prepared.</p>
            <p>2. Under the Croſs, under the yoak to the corrupt (yea and
to the very natural) the power ſprings. The falſe birth would
have the power ſpring in a way pleaſing to it ſelf; at the time
its Wiſdom ſees neceſſary, and in the way its Will would have it:
but the power ſprings up according to its own wiſdom, at its
own time, and after its own way. When the man would have it,
then it flyes from him: and when it is not expected nor perhap<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> deſired, (at leaſt in that way wherein it chuies to appear) then
it ſprings up and puts forth it ſelf. Moſt men, that have felt any
thing of God, cannot but deſire his Life and Power: But moſt
fly the Croſs, wherein it hath choſen to appear; and ſo they
can never meet with, but are ſtill complaining for the want of it.
In the power is the eaſe, the reſt of the Goſpel. <hi>Take my Yoak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and learn of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and ye ſhall find the reſt which flowes from the Power. This made <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyce in the Croſs of Chriſt, whereby the fleſhly luſts were brought down in him, and the Life and Eternal Power ſprang in the Seed of the
Kingdom: For under the Croſs the ſeed grows up and flouriſhes,
and the fleſh withers and dies. And as the power of fleſh and
death waſts, ſo the Power of Spirit and Life Increaſes.</p>
            <p>3. The power ſprings under the fear, and in the uprightneſs
and love which God hath begotten. I put theſe together, for
there is a cloſe unitie between them. The fear is the dwelling
of the upright heart, and the love is within the fear. He that
diſtruſts himſelf, feels his own nothingneſs, finds no power to
do any thing God requireth; and yet alſo fears to ſtay behind
the light of God's Spirit, in any thing it requires; and ſo finds <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> putting on forward in the faith; in him the power delights to
appear. He that would feel ſtrength beforehand, and act in
the ſence of that ſtrength, from him the power withdraws: But
he that is weak and hath no ſtrength, but ſtill as it freely drops
into him from moment to moment, this is the veſſel the power
chuſeth to manifeſt it ſelf to, and to be continually appearing in.
This is the New Covenant, <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93156:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where the fear of the New Covenant is found, ſo much life, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and
eternal vertue, as is neceſſary for the preſent ſtate of that
heart, cannot be far off. So in the <hi>upright-hearted,</hi> in the heart
that is true to God, the power of deceit cannot dwell, but the
Power of Truth delights to fill it, in a way ſutable to the ſtate
of the Spirit, and ſo as may be ſeen by the eye of the ſpirit, and
felt by the spiritual ſence. And in the <hi>Love</hi> is the conſtraining
power, which conſtrains from the evil path, from the path of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
and diſobedience, into the Path of Life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The neceſſity of this way of the ſpringing up of the Power,</hi>
and not in ſuch a manifeſt way as man's heart deſires, and as
man's eye expects.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary in ſeveral reſpects. <hi>In reſpect of God, in reference
to the creature, and in reference to the Soul's enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>In reſpect of God.</hi> It is neceſſary that his Power and Life
ſhould ſpring up in the creature in its own way, according to the
counſel of his own wiſdom, ſuitable to his own nature, and not
in the way which the creature chalks out and expects it in. God
muſt be like himſelf, and walk in his own Path in every thing he
does. He is a God that hideth himſelf in the myſtery of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
throughout the whole trac<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of man's redemption: and man
muſt be wrought out of himſelf, out of his own thoughts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
gathered apprehenſions concerning the Kingdom
and way to Life, &amp; led in a path he doth not know (nor ever can
know any longer than he is in it) and in wayes he hath not been
acquainted with. The way of Life is ſtill new, every moment
freſh and living; and the earthly part of thoſe, who may have
in ſome meaſure felt the power of regeneration, cannot know it,
nor walk in it. Conſider this, O ye that fence your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the preſent appearance of the Spirit, and againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
Demonſtrations and Drawings of its Eternal Light and
Power, by ſomewhat which ye have formerly felt and known.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In reference to the Creature,</hi> the Power of God muſt needs
appear thus hiddenly and in ſuch a miſterious way.</p>
            <p>1. That the creature might go through all thoſe exerciſes of
Spirit, which are neceſſary to fit it for its inheritance in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Land. There are <hi>Straits, Wants, Tryals, Temptations, inward
Weakneſſes, buffetings from the Enemy, withdrawings of the life,</hi> &amp;c.
which God ſeeth neceſſary to Excerciſe the Spirits of his with,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93156:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he might fit them for himſelf, and for a ſafe enjoyment of
his life in fulneſs; which could not be, if there were ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
power to begin with, and continually at hand to perform
all in and for the Soul, as many men wait for and think neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to have.</p>
            <p>2. That the fleſhly part might be throughly worn out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
When the Power appears and works mightily in the
ſoul, there is ſomewhat apt to get up, to exalt it ſelf by the
Power, and to abuſe the Power: and if the Power were not
withdrawn, and this tormented and famiſhed in the abſence of
the Power, and in the withdrawing of the ſweet appearance of
Life, a wrong thing would be ſtealing into the Inheritance, and
the ſoul would never be throughly purified, nor come to a pure
enjoyment of the Power. Therefore doth the Lord appear
in this miſterious way, <hi>that the promiſe might be ſure to the
Seed;</hi> that the Seed which is the right Heir of the Power, might
come alone to inherit the Power, and the falſe birth not touch
the leaſt enjoyment of it, but feel the bitter ſtroaks of death and
deſtruction from it. What had become of <hi>Paul,</hi> if he had had
Power to reſiſt the buffettings of the enemy, as he deſired? would
not his fleſhly part have remained in the exaltation, and not
have been brought down? (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.)</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In reference to the Enemy.</hi> The enemy could never be
wholly conquered, his ſtrong holds in the heart broken down, &amp;
the redemption from under his hand perfected, were it not for
this miſterious way of the appearing and working of the Power,
even out of the ſight of man's eye, and contrary to his will and
expectation. For had man ſuch a power as he deſires, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with him; had he faith in his power, or obedience in his
power, or could he take up the Croſs in his power, or have
ſtrength to fight againſt the enemy as he deſires and expects, the
enemy would ſtill find enterance into him, and keep his hold
of him. But God, who knoweth the ſtate of the creature,
with the ſtrength and paſſages of the enemy into man, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his mighty power in man according to his own will,
and in the way of his own Wiſdom (contrary to what man can
deſire or expect, but as he is taken into, and comprehended in
the Eternal Will) carries on his work ſweetly and ſafely, and
perfects the ſalvation of thoſe who will not, who run not, who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93156:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deſire not to be any thing, but wait to feel and know his Power,
and to become ſubject to it, and lie under, even in the loweſt way
of its manifeſtation and appearance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> This may be true in the ordinary way of Redemption of
Souls; but there are deep captivities (even the captivity of Babylon
inwardly and ſpiritually) which ſurely will need a very great appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Power of God to deliver out of: and what can that ſoul do,
but wait there under the captivity, untill that mighty power ariſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true; The Power muſt needs be very great, and the
appearance of it wonderful, which delivers out of ſuch a captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
but yet the beginnings of it may be ſmall, and out of the
ſight of that eye, which looks and waits for ſo great an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Haſt thou not light enough already to begin thy travel
out of <hi>Babylon?</hi> Haſt thou begun thy travel? Doſt thou walk in
the light, which ſhineth upon thee in that dark land, to gather
and lead thee out of it? Or wilt thou not begin to come out, till
the very glory and brightneſs of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhine upon thee? If there be
but light &amp; power enough, to lead thee one ſtep out of the land of
darkneſs, &amp; confuſion of Spirit, towards obedience to the loweſt
or meaneſt Truth, that is ſufficient for thee at preſent: &amp; as thou
art found faithful here, more will ſpring in thee. But if thou ſtop
here (or at any time after thou haſt begun and made ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
becauſe of any thing which falleth out contrary to thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation)
then that, which ſhould lead thee on and ſtrengthen
thee, ſtops alſo; &amp; thou meeteſt nor with that, which is found &amp;
enjoyed by other in the way, because thou paſſeſt not on in it,
but baulkeſt thy proper path, judging ſomewhat more neceſſary
towards thy beginning or progreſs, then the Lord judgeth or
yet ſeeth fit to impart to thee. Thus the enemy betrayes thee, &amp;
holds thee in his chains, which might be looſed &amp; caſt off by little
and little, didſt thou ſingly give up, to the little appearance of
that light and power which is able to unbind them, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
more at firſt (or afterwards) then the Lord hath allotted
for thy preſent condition. And let me tell thee this from certain
knowledge and experience; That thou, who haſt been high, and
haſt taſted much of God, but haſt abuſed it, and fed the wrong
part with it, both in thy ſelf and others: Thou muſt be brought
lower than the reſt, and for a long ſeaſon be kept lower, that the
pure ſeed (which hath deeply been buried in thee) may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow
and ſink all thy knowledge, experiences and obſervations
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93156:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concerning the Eternal Life, and its way of appearance, which
formerly thou hadſt ſome true taſte of, but now holdeſt out of the
Life. Thou muſt come down, thou muſt become nothing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
thou muſt lie at the foot of the reprovings of that Light,
which thou thinkeſt thou haſt gone far beyond, and be glad of a
little help now and then in the lowlineſs and humility of thy
Heart, which muſt not chuſe what appearance and manifeſtation
it will have from God, before it will begin to follow him, but be
glad of never ſo little, that the infinite Wiſdom ſees good to
give forth by the hand of his Mercy.</p>
            <p>Who ever have been high, and are ſtill waiting and expecting
in the heights of their own wiſdom and obſervations concerning
the Kingdom, let them take heed of <hi>deſpiſing the day of ſmall things,</hi>
and know that their proper beginning (yea the very path of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life it ſelf) lies in the lowneſs, in the humility, even in that
nothingneſs which bows before the leaſt light of the day, and
with gladneſs of heart enters into, and walks in it. For this I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know, The wiſe, the obſerving-eye, the vaſt comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heart, which waits for ſuch an extraordinary Power, judging
it cannot begin following the Light, which daily appears to
check and reprove, without ſome great manifeſt appearance of
power, This cannot ſee the low little path of Life, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for it to walk in, and to the end whereof it muſt travel, if
ever it come to ſit down in the Kingdom, or to inherit the
power of the endleſs Life. Pretious is the diſpenſation of this
Age, great is the Power and Glory which is ariſing: but the wiſe
and knowing of this Age, are ſhut out of it, as they have been
out of the life and truth of the diſpenſations of God in all Ages,
Happy is he who is not above that, wherewith God viſiteth his
Soul to redeem it.</p>

            <head>A POST-SCRIPT.</head>
            <p>THat perſons, who have not travelled into the Land of Life,
want power, that is out of doubt. The ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in its
travels, is a ſtate of weakneſſes and wants. How can they in the
Wilderneſs but want that, which is to be poſſeſſed in the Holy
Land? But doſt thou want power to begin the travel with? doſt
thou want what proportion of power the Lord fees neceſſary for
thee in thy preſent eſtate? Is there nothing at all diſcovered to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93156:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thee which is contrary to God, either in thy Heart, or in thy
Converſation, or in thy Worſhip, which thou doſt not ſo much as
ſtrive to give up to the Lord in, waiting upon him for his
power and ſtrength to appear in helping thee. The Light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to diſcover and lead out of the Darkneſs. Now in giving
up to the Light, and not doubting but that, which calls and
draws out will give ſtrength; and enable to come out, the Power
is met with unawares. But that which ſtands gazing and looking
out after a power, which it expects to meet with, before it will ſo
much as begin to follow the Light; that cannot but abide in the
captivity, and miſs of that Power which redeemeth from it.
Therefore,</p>
            <p>I. Wait to feel the Light of Life diſcovering and drawing
from the evil: and let it chuſe what it ſhall pleaſe firſt to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and draw from. And though it be little, and very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
in thine eyes, yet diſpute not, but where the light firſt
begins to lead, do thou there begin to follow.</p>
            <p>Then in this waiting and ſubjecting to the manifeſtations of
the light, out of the ſelf-will, ſelf-wiſdom, ſelf-knowledge, ſelf-judgement,
in the lowlineſs and abaſedneſs of the mind and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
before the Lord, the begettings of life in the light are felt, and
the renewing into his pure Image.</p>
            <p>Afterwards that which is begotten (and begun to be renewed
in the Divine Image) is by degrees taught more diſtinctly to
know, diſcern and walk in the path of Life.</p>
            <p>And after this, to that which is thus begotten, and taught the
living faith and obedience (which is wrought by the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God, though running in alow, ſecret, hidden way from
the eye of the creature) the great Power is Revealed, and he
grows ſtrong in the Power for God, and againſt the enemies of
his Soul: and by this ſtrength and feeling of Gods preſence,
they fall daily and continually before him, and then his victory
over them goes on with joy.</p>
            <p>But he that ſtops at firſt may grow wiſe and conceited, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the things of the kingdom after the fleſh, and may hope
for great things at laſt; but by the deceit of the ſubtilty, is kept
out of the living path, wherein they are to be waited for, reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Now for the encouragement of ſuch, as are willing to travel
on in the weakneſs, yeilding up their members to the preſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93156:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the light, and waiting for the further appearance
of the Power: It is on my heart to add a letter of a dear friend
and brother of mine in the Truth, who hath been a deep traveller
and fellow-ſufferer with me formerly, before this help came forth
from the Throne of God, ſince the day-ſpring from on high
hath vouchſafed to viſit us, and to guide our feet in the way of

Truth to all men, ſo as they may come to the knowledge thereof and

in the Riches of his Grace, towards ſome more than others: as to the
Jews under the Law, and to the Diſciples of Chriſt under the Goſpel:

the involving in the guilt of Adams ſin, the outward knowing

               <hi>Query</hi> 6. Whether True Religion, Spiritual Worſhip, &amp; the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Soul do not depend upon the Spirit of the Lord, who is near
to every heart with his eternal Light, which he can eaſily convey to
any heart, whoſe ear is opened to hearken to his breathings and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
So that it is eaſy to the Lord to ſave any of the Sons of men,
even in the darkeſt and remoteſt corners of the earth: and he can caſt
off thoſe who ſeem higheſt in zeal, and moſt flouriſhing under any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means of Salvation.</p>
            <p>Oh wonderfully infinite is the Lord! who ſhall bound his Spirit? Happy is
he that feareth before him, and in his fear learneth to depart from iniquity,
and walk in the good Path that his Spirit teacheth. He is near to God, and
ſhall taſt of the good things, and ſhall not be rejected for want of outward
knowledge; but what ever was done for loſt man, he that is found in the
light of Life (and in the obedience to the ſpirit of Life) ſhall reap the benefit
of. But he that boaſts in his knowledge of theſe things, and of his Faith in
Chriſt Jeſus; yet not being found in the true, living, eternal light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
(but an enemy to it, and ignorant of it) the Lord will rend his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from him, in a day that he is not aware of.</p>
            <p>'Glorious was the diſpenſation of the Law, and great was the advantage to
the Jew thereby above the Gentiles. Yet they miſſing the Spirit and Life of it,
(and growing wiſe in their own apprehenſions and interpretations about it)
fell beneath the Gentiles, becoming greater ſtrangers to the power &amp; wiſdom
of God, &amp; harder to be reached &amp; brought in under the ſubjection of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
More glorious was the diſpenſation of the Goſpel to the Chriſtians, and
much greater was their advantage, than that of the Jews. But an Apoſtacy
coming, and they looſing the true Power and Spirit, &amp; growing wiſe by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
knowledge of ſome of the things of God in the earthly part, &amp; forming
interpretations of Scriptures, and entring into practiſes in that wiſdom; they
are now become at as great a diſtance from this powerfull viſitation of God by
his Spirit (which raiſeth the Seed, and ſpringeth up freſhly in the hearts of
thoſe, whom the Lord our God doth call out of their fenced Cities, and allure
into the Wilderneſs) as the Jews were at from that appearance before the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy:
and in as great danger are the Children of the Kingdom to be caſt out
now, as then. Oh that my God would pleaſe to open the ear of ſome tender
and upright-hearted among them to hear this teſtimony, that they might no
longer ſtumble at that, which alone is able to lead them to God, and to
make them happy in God.</p>

Is there any uniting with God, or enjoying of God, but by his Spirit? is there
any receiving of Gods Spirit, but within in the heart? doth he not appear

to help out of the deep &amp; intricate Apoſtacy (wherein have been ſo many
twiſtings &amp; twinings of the ſubtle Serpent, about every ſtep or appearance of
Reformation) and to gather the wandring ſheep, who were ſcattered up and
down, and ſorely diſtreſſed, for want of the Tongne of the Learned, to ſpeak
a word in ſeaſon to their eſtates and conditions? Have not every ſort bent the
Scriptures, in the Reaſonings of their own Minds, and made them ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own hearts Luſts? And is not every one wiſe in his own
Eyes, and ſtrong in his own Tower and fenced City? Surely there was great
need of an appearance of the Lord to ſhut out the Wiſdom of Man, and to
help the Poor, the Needy, the Fatherleſs, the weak Panting-Babes. And bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
