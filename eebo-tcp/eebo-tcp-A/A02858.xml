            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as he was destituted of the helpes of nature at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and was faine to haue his way made into the world with a knife; so in his life was there continuall imployment of either Sword or Axe; of that, either at home against his Rebells, or against his enemies abroad; of this, vpon his Nobles, and particularly vpon his owne vncles by the mothers side; of which the Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set's</hi> case is very remarkable. As his birth was violent, and his reigne troublesome, so was his death praemature, &amp; not without suspicion of some
<pb facs="tcp:4095:3"/>
practice; of which, (besides vulgar rumour,) <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> in calculating his scheme, seemes to haue some iealous coniecture. For whether he diuined it by his art in Astrology, or apprehended it by the course and carriage of businesse, hee made a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous praediction: when hee foresaw, that the King should shortly dye a violent death, and (as he reporteth) fled out of the kingdome, for feare of further danger. Howsoeuer, he was as noble a branch as euer sprung out of the Royall stocke, worthy (if so it had seemed good to God) of a more fauourable birth, a quieter reigne, and a longer life. But as the notable accidents in his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous times doe deserue to be recorded; so doth the King himselfe for his sweet condition, for his minde as innocent as his yeares, for his rare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments well deserue to be commended to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting memory; that he may bee permanent so much the longer in the life of an history, by how much the threed of his naturall life was cut shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Fates. And indeed as he had the birth of <hi>Caesar,</hi> so had he beene worthy to haue had the fortune and fame of <hi>Caesar;</hi> but a better conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This history is left vs from the pen of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Author, of whom we haue another essay in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This comes out into the world

            <p>Here he remained about three weekes, and in the meane time the counsaile appointed vnto him by his <hi>Fathers</hi> will dayly sate for ordering the affaires of the Kingdome.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4095:7"/>
was Lord great Master of the <hi>Kings</hi> houshold. But this wound of disgrace never left bleeding, vntill it was stopped by the <hi>Protectors</hi> fall.</p>
            <p>It is certaine that from the first entrance of this <hi>King,</hi> to his raigne never was <hi>King</hi> either more loving to others, or better beloved generally of all. The one whereof proceeded from the goodnes of his disposition, the other from many graces and vertues illustrious in him, for besides his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty and modestie beseeming a <hi>Prince,</hi> besides his sweet humanity the very life of mortall condition, besides a naturall disposition to all literature, whereto he seemed rather borne then instructed, many noble and high virtues sparck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in him, especially <hi>Clemencie, Courage, Care,</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in affaires of <hi>state.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>Clemencie</hi> he was much enclined, especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of blood, and most especially if it were for Religion, a vertue so much the more esteemed, by how much it had beene lesse vsed before, insomuch that albeit hee was most earnestly affected to that religion wherein hee had beene brought vp, yet none were executed in his time for other religion, but only two blasphemous <hi>Heretickes, Ioane Butcher</hi> and <hi>George</hi> a <hi>Dutchman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Ioane Butcher</hi> was to be burned, all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile could not procure him to set his hand to the warrant. Wherefore they employed <hi>Thomas Cranmer Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to deale privatly with him for his subscription. But the <hi>King</hi> remained firme both in reason and resolution, affirming that he would not driue her headlong to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</hi> but because <hi>Heretickes</hi> for the most part haue a straine of madnesse, he thought it best to apply her with some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall chastisem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>nts which with respit of time might happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reduce her to good order. The <hi>Archbishop</hi> was violent both by perswasions and entreaties, and when with meere importunity he had prevailed. The <hi>King</hi> in subscribing his name said, that he would lay all the charge thereof vpon the <hi>Archbishop</hi> before <hi>God.</hi> Not many yeares passed, but this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4095:8"/>
               <hi>Archbishop</hi> also felt the smart of the fire, and it may be that by his importunity for bloud, hee did offend, for a good thing is not good if it be immoderatelie desired or done.</p>
            <p>His courage did appeare in the great delight he tooke in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of Battailes, Skirmishes, Assaults, and of all kinde of military exercises, his iudgment was great either for errors or fine contriuances in the field. And no actions of Armes were executed in his time, but he would perfectly vnderstand, by what aduantages on the one side or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights on the other the euent succeeded. He tooke great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in exercises of actiuity whereto he much trained his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And to that end he often appointed challenges among them for wrestling, leaping, running, riding, shooting at roues, and at rounds and such like games, and at riding and shooting, would sometimes be of one of the sides. He had 100 archers of his ordinary guard, who once mustering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him shot two arrowes euery man together against an inch board of well seasoned timber. All stroke through the board, and their arrowes stucke in another board behinde, and divers pierced both the boards; generally none might be of his guard, but besides of tall and comely stature, such as were either good archers or wrastlers or easters of the barre or leapers or runners or of some other man-like qualitie. He was exceeding skilfull in fortifications, and bestowed great cost in strengthening <hi>Calleis, Berwicke,</hi> and other parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, He knew all the principall ports in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ireland, France,</hi> and other countries not farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, how they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Touching his care and knowledge in affaires of state, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more conspicuous in him. He was much conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant amongst his counsaile, and would well vnderstand what matters passed their iudgments, and vpon what grounds. In matters discoursed by them, he would often encounter their reasons, and adde most liuely reasons of his owne. In
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4095:8"/>
so much that at last they made an order that no matters of weight, should be debated vnlesse he were present. Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable he was to collect the speeches and opinions of many, and to draw their differences to a true head, alwaies ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe rather iudiciously to resolue, then by doubts and distinctions to perplex a businesse, he had a chest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he alwaies carryed the key about him, for keeping record of such matters as were concluded by his counsaile. And em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing businesse for part of his solace, hee appointed set times with <hi>Doctor Coxe Master</hi> of his Requests for speeding poore mens causes without tedious attendance or delay. Of all the Magistrates Iustices and Gentlemen of sort within his realme, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> their names, their housekeeping, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and manner of life. Hee was skilfull in the exchange beyond the seas, and in all the circumstances and practises thereof. And so was he both skilfull and provident in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Mint at home. To <hi>Embassadors</hi> hee would giue answere vpon the suddaine and touch both orderly and fully vpon every part of their orations, to the delight and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the hearers. He much frequented sermons and penned notes with his owne hand, his notes hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>yphered with <hi>greeke</hi> characters to the end that they who waited on him should not read them. His disports were ingenuous and man-like whereby he alwaies learned somewhat. And yet as well from these as from his businesses of state, he dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served some houres for his private studies and exercises with his Teachers. These endeavours fell vpon so excellent a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie that in every short distance of time, he made incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible increase both in learning and experience of affaires and consequentlie in loue of all men.</p>

            <p>The authority and reasons of this letter weighed much with persons of most weighty iudgements, but others more powerful in that state partly vpon vaine hope in regard of the young yeares of the <hi>king,</hi> partly vpon feare of alteration in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and partly in favour of their ancient amitie with the <hi>French,</hi> and doubting to be brought vnder by the <hi>English,</hi> were altogether carryed another way, yet they dispatched an Embassador into <hi>England,</hi> but neither was any thing done, neither do I finde what was propounded to haue bin done.</p>
            <p>Herevpon diverse hostilities began to be practised. And first a small ship of the <hi>kings</hi> called the <hi>Pensie</hi> hovering at sea, was assailed by the <hi>Lyon</hi> a principall shippe of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The sight began farre off and slow, but when they approached, it grew very furious, wherein the '<hi>Pensie</hi> so applyed her shot, that therewith the <hi>Lyons</hi> or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> loope was broken, her sailes and tacklings torne: and lastly, shee was boarded and taken. But as shee was brought for <hi>England,</hi> shee was cast away by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest and negligence neere <hi>Harewich</hi> haven, and most of her men perished with her. I would not haue staide vpon this small adventure, but that it seemed a presage to the succeeding warre, wherein the <hi>English</hi> acquired a glorious victorie, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4095:11"/>
lost the fruit thereof, by reason of their stormie disorders at home.</p>
            <p>Many such small actions were enterprised dayly, which were but scattering drops in regard of the great tempest which did ensue. For in the meane season an armie was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for invasion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> vnder the fortune and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande of the <hi>Lord Protector.</hi> The souldiers first assembled at <hi>Newcastle</hi> and were there mustred by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke.</hi> Heere they so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Bottomes, whereof one galley and 34. tall ships were well appointed for fight, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue served for carriage of munition and victuals. Of this sleete <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton</hi> was <hi>Admirall,</hi> and Sir <hi>William UUoodhouse</hi> his <hi>Uiceadmirall,</hi> in this time also a generall muster was taken and order appointed for the March.</p>
            <p>In the whole armie were betweene 12. and 1300 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foot, 1300 men at Armes, 2800 light horse, being such men for their goodly personages, their ready horses their braue apparell, their armour and weapons, as never before was an armie set forth into those parts in all points better appointed. The <hi>Lord Protector</hi> being <hi>Generall,</hi> represented the person and Maiestie of the <hi>king.</hi> The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> was Lieutenant generall. The <hi>Lord Gray</hi> of <hi>UUilton</hi> was Marshall of the field, and captaine generall of the horsemen. Sir <hi>Ralph Uane</hi> Lieutenant of all the men at Armes and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milances, Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler</hi> was generall Treasurer, other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had their particuler charges. But vpon the Generall and the <hi>Earle of Warwicke</hi> both the hopes and hazards of the maine adventure did wholy turne. And because much shalbe said of these two hereafter, because during the raigne of <hi>king Edward,</hi> they were the principall actors in every sceane, I will briefly declare both what persons, and of what demerits at that time they were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Seymer</hi> Duke of Somerset, <hi>Lord Generall</hi> was a man little esteemed either for wisedome or personage, or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in armes. But being in favour with <hi>king Henry</hi> and by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4095:12"/>
him much imploied, was alwaies observed to be both faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fortunate as well in giving advise, as in managing a charge. About fiue yeares before hee being Warden of the Marches against <hi>Scotland,</hi> the invasion of <hi>Iames</hi> the 5. was by his direction encountred, and broken at <hi>Solome Mosse,</hi> whereof diverse of the <hi>Scottish</hi> nobility were taken prisoners. The yeare next after, hee and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> with a handfull of men to speake of, fired <hi>Lieth</hi> and <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and returned by a leasurely march 44 miles through the body of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The yeare next ensuing he invaded the <hi>Scottish</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Iohn 'Dudley Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> was a man of ancient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, comely in stature and countenance, but of little gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or abstinence in pleasures, yea sometimes almost dissolute, which was not much regarded, if in a time when vices began to grow into fashion, a great man was not over severe. He was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4095:12"/>
of a great spirit and highly aspiring, not forbearing to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mischiefe the meanes for attaining his ambitious endes. Hereto his good wit and pleasant speeches were altogether serviceable, having the art also by emptie promises and threats to draw others to his purpose, in matters of armes he was both skilfull and industrious, and as well in fore-sight as resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on present and great. Being made <hi>L. Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Bulloine,</hi> when it was first taken by the <hi>English,</hi> the walls sore beaten &amp; shaken, and in very truth searce mainetaineable, he defended the place against the <hi>Dolphine</hi> whose armie was accounted to consist of 52000 men. And when the <hi>Dolphine</hi> had entred the base towne, not without slaughter of divers of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> by a braue sally he cast out the <hi>French</hi> againe with the losse of aboue 800 of their men esteemed the best souldiours in <hi>France.</hi> The yeare next ensuing when the <hi>French</hi> had a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>leete at sea for invasion of <hi>England,</hi> he was appointed <hi>Admirall</hi> and presented battaile to the <hi>French</hi> Navy, which they refused and returned home with all their threats and cost in vaine. Herevpon he landed 5000 men in <hi>France,</hi> fired <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> and diverse villages there abouts &amp; returned to his ships with the losse only of one man. To say truth for enterprises by armes, he was the Minion of that time, so as few things he attempted, but he atchieued with honour, which made him more proud and ambitious when he had done. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally he alwaies encreased both in estimation with the <hi>king,</hi> and authority among the <hi>Nobility,</hi> doubtfull whether by fatall destinie to the state, or whether by his vertues, or at least by his appearances of vertues.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Generall</hi> in this voyage was diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to perfect all practises which might serue to advance the adventure, as to giue good contentment to all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. These also were of good confidence and cheere, as well out of their owne courage, as for the skill, valour, and fortune of their commanders. And first every souldier was commanded to take with him provision for foure daies, and so were let out of <hi>Berwicke</hi> and encamped about two slight
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4095:13"/>
shootes off the towne vpon the sea side towardes <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Lord Clynton</hi> also put to sea with his fleete, alwaies holding his course With the army to relieue them if neede should require. Here proclamation was made in three parts of the field, declaring the causes of this iourney, and offering not only peace, but loue and rewards to all such as would either advance or favour the marriage betweene the two princes. Hereof it was conceiued that the <hi>Scots</hi> had good intelligence, hauing some factors doubtlesse at this mart, albeit, (as wisdome was) they did not openly trade.</p>
            <p>The next day they began to march, wherein the <hi>Lord Gray</hi> and <hi>Sir Francis Bryan</hi> led aboue 800 lighthorsemen as a scout a mile or two before the army, aswell to giue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement of appearance or approach of enimies as to provide lodging both commodious and safe, <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Francis Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was so regardfull of his charge as he neuer disposed any matter of weight but first he acquainted the <hi>Generall</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, neither did he at any time forsake his saddle, vntill the army were quartered, and seated in such order, as if any alarme should be giuen, the horsemen might issue forth without disturbance of the foote, and the <hi>Avauntguard</hi> without shufling with the battaile or <hi>Arriere,</hi> next to the light horsemen followed the Auantguard, in number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene 3 and 4000 foote, 100 men at armes and 600 light horsemen led by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke.</hi> The Battaile fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed consisting of about 6000 foote, 600 men at armes, and about 1000 light horsemen conducted, by the Lord <hi>Generall</hi> himselfe. Lastly followed the Arrier wherein were betweene 3 and 4000 foote, 100 men at armes and 600 light horse vnder the conduct of the <hi>Lord Dacres</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuely aged gentleman no lesse setled in experience then in yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vpon one wing the Artillery was drawn being 16 peeces, euery peece hauing his guard of pioners to plain the waies, the other wing was made by men at armes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milances for the Avantguard and halfe the battaile ridinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

two flight shoote from their side. The other halfe of the battaile and the whole flancke of the Arrier was cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the carriages being 900 cartes, besides wagons. The residue of the men at armes and Demilances marched behinde.</p>
            <p>In this order both beautifull and firme they marched two daies vsing no hostility, least peace thereby might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely be hindred. The second day they arriued at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Peathes,</hi> a valley stretching towards the sea 6 miles in length, about 20 score in breadth aboue, and 5 score in the bottome wherein runnes a little riuer. The bankes are so steepe on either side, that the passage is not direct, but by paths leading sloopewise, which being many the Place is therevpon called the <hi>Peathes.</hi> It was giuen forth in the army that here the Scots prepared to resist them, howbeit no forces appeared. Only the Pathes were cut in diuers places with trauerse trenches, which much encumbred the carriages vntill the Pioners had leveld them againe, Assuredly a small power ioyned to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the place might haue troubled the <hi>English</hi> very much. For albeit no resistance was made yet the <hi>English</hi> had much to doe in surmounting the naturall difficulties of the place, the greatest part of one day.</p>
            <p>Passage being made the <hi>generall</hi> summoned three castles that were neere. One desperate of succor and not desirous to dispute the defence presently yeelded, but two stood vpon their aduenture. So the Cannon was planted a breach made and the place entered, but, then the moderation of the <hi>Generall</hi> was both vnusuall and vnexpected, in sparing the Defendants liues, for it hath bin a long observed <hi>law of the field. That if a small company of better courage then iudgment, will contrary to all military discipline maintaine a feeble place against royall forces, if they will offer to impeach the purposes of an army, which they haue no reason to thinke themselues able to resist, after battery presented they put themselues out of all ordinary expectation of mercy</hi> and so

And in this case I conceiue the law of God to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; which spareth not those citties that will not yeeld vntill they be beseiged, meaning doubtlesse when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants haue little reason to thinke themselues able to<note place="margin">Deut. 20.</note> make defence, I will not involue in silence with what a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine statagem of wit, the defendants of one of these peeces escaped extremities, when they vnderstood both that they were not able to defend themselues, and that their obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey had excluded all hope of pardon. They made petition that they might not presently be slaine; but haue some time to recommend their soules to God, and afterwards be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, this respite being first obtained their pardon did more easily ensue.</p>
            <p>Vpon the first newes of the approaches of the <hi>English</hi> and all truths enlarged by report. The <hi>Gouernor</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> was somewhat appalled, as neither furnished at that time with forraine aide, nor much trusting his forces at home yet resuming his accustomed courage well acquainted with both fortunes, he sent his heralds through all parts of the realme, and commanded the <hi>firecrosse</hi> to be carried (an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient custome in cases of importance) namely two fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands set in fashion of a crosse, and pitched vpon the point of a speare, therewith proclamation to be made that all men aboue 16 yeares of age, and vnder 60 should resort forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to <hi>Muscleborough</hi> with convenient provision of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als with them.</p>
            <p>Herevpon they flocked to the place in so great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that it was thought sit not only to stay further resort, but making choice of the most serviceable, to discharge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the rest.</p>
            <p>Now as the <hi>English</hi> directed their way towards the place where they vnderstood the <hi>Scots</hi> assembled, they came to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4095:14"/>
a riuer called <hi>Lynne</hi> crossed with a bridge of stone. The horsemen and carriages passed through the water, the foote men ouer the bridg, which because it was narrow the army was long in setting ouer, The Avantguard marched forth and the battaile followed, but as the Arriere was passing ouer, a very thicke mist did arise. The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> hauing before espyed certaine plumpes of <hi>Scottish</hi> horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ranging the field rerurned towards the Arriere to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent such danger as the thicknesse of the mist, the neerenes of the enimy, and the disarray occasioned by the narrownes of the bridg might cast vpon them. The <hi>Scots</hi> coniecturing (as it was) that some personage of honor staied to haue a view of the <hi>Arriere,</hi> called to the <hi>english</hi> to know if any noble man were neere, for that one whom they named (well knowne to be of honourable condition) would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe to the <hi>Generall</hi> in case he might safely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted. Certaine young souldiers not vsed to such traines made rash and suddaine answere that the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> was neere, vnder whose protection he might be assured. Herevpon they passed the water placed 200 of their prickers behinde a hillocke, and with 40 more cast about to finde the Earle. Now the <hi>Earle</hi> espying 6. or 7. of them seattered neere the army and taking them to be of the <hi>English</hi> sent one to command them to their <hi>Arra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> and to that end himselfe rode an easy pace towards them followed only with 10 or 12 on horsebacke. He that had beene sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was so heedlesse either to obserue, or to advertise what they were, that the Earle did not discouer them to be eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vntill he was in the middest among them.</p>
            <p>Certainely <hi>a commander should not carelesly cast himselfe into danger, but when either vpon necessity or misadventure he falleth into it,</hi> it much aduanceth both his reputation and enterprise if brauely he behaue himselfe. Now the <hi>Earle</hi> espying where he was gaue so rude a charge vpon a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the <hi>Scots</hi> named '<hi>Dandy Care,</hi> that he forced him to turne, and chased him aboue 12 score at the lances
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4095:15"/>
point. Herewith the residue retyred deceitfully towards the place of their <hi>Ambush,</hi> from whence issued about 60 more. Then the <hi>Earle</hi> gathered his small company about him, and with good countenance maintained the fight. But the enimy in the end whether perceiuing some succors advancing from the army where the Alarme was then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or whether intending to draw the <hi>English</hi> further into their <hi>Ambush,</hi> turned away an easy pace. The <hi>Earle</hi> forbad his men from following, fearing a greater ambush behind the hill as in truth there was. At his returne he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with great applause by the <hi>English</hi> souldiers, for that he did so well acquit himselfe in the danger, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by error and not by rashnes he had bin carryed. One of his men was slaine, another hurt in the buttocke, a third named <hi>Uane</hi> so grieuously hewne that many thousands haue dyed of lesse then halfe his hurts, whereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, he was cured afterwards; of the <hi>Scots</hi> 3 were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoners and presented to the generall by the <hi>Earle,</hi> of whom one had receiued many great entertainments and curtesies in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may happely be thought tedious in setting downe these occurrences which may seeme small. But besides that in actions of armes small matters are many times of very great moment, especially when they serue to raise an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of commanders, I intend to describe this battaile ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to derogate thereby any thing from the one nation, or to arrogate to the other. For what honor riseth vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of a battaile, when oftentimes the smallest accident ouerthroweth a side? And when victory doth more often fall, by error of the vanquished then by valor of the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>But my purpose is to make it appeare what myseries both nations haue avoided, and what quietnesse and security they haue attained by their peaceable vnion, when as either of them being able to bring such forces into the field for then mutuall ruine, they may now doe the like for their common ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory or necessity.</hi> Againe this battaile being partially
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4095:15"/>
described heretofore by the writers of either nation and not without vncivill termes, I will now set it forth so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently and fairely as I can. Lastly this battaile is not slightly to be slipped ouer, being the last (wherein I pray that I may prophesie truly) that was or euer shall be strooke betweene the two nations. But I returne to my purpose.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Scottish</hi> horsemen began to houer much vpon the <hi>English</hi> army, and to come pricking about them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times within the length of their staues, vsing some liberty of language to draw the <hi>English</hi> from their strength. But the <hi>Generall</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> knowing right well, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were expert in tumultuous fights, restrained his horse from falling forth, and maintained a close march vntill they came to <hi>Salt Preston</hi> by the Frith. Here they encamped within view of the <hi>Scottish</hi> army, little more then two miles distant from them. About a mile from the <hi>English</hi> another way, the Scottish horsemen were very busy, vpon a hill, and emboldened much partly vpon their former approaches, and partly by the neerenesse of their army, but cheifly vpon an opinion which they conceiued, that the English horsemen were young and vnskilfull, and easy to be dealt with, came vpon the <hi>English</hi> with enereased troopes, to the number of 1200 besides 500 foote which lay in ambush behind the hill. The <hi>Lord Gray</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Bryan</hi> impatient of braueries obtained leaue of the <hi>Generall</hi> a little to assay them, and so as they came seattered vpon the spurre within a stones cast of the <hi>English</hi> and were beginning to wheele about, the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> with some troopes of lighthorsemen charged them home. These were forthwith seconded by certaine numbers of dimilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and both backed with about 1000 men at armes. The <hi>Scots</hi> meant not to depart before they had done their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, wherefore turning their faces boldly maintained the fight, three houres and more. In the end ouerlaied with numbers they were put to slight and chased almost to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4095:16"/>
edge of their campe, in this fight the chiefest force of the Scottish horsemen was defeated, to their great disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage afterwards. The <hi>Lord Hume</hi> by a fall from his horse lost his life. His sonne and heire with two Preists and 6 gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were taken prisoners, and about 1300 slaine. Of the <hi>English</hi> one <hi>Spanish</hi> hackbutter was hurt, and three cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the light horse, by vnadvised pursuite were taken prisoners.</p>
            <p>The day next following the <hi>Lord Generall</hi> and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> rode towards the place where the <hi>Scottish</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my lay to view the manner of their eneamping, as they were returned an herald and a trumpeter from the <hi>Scots</hi> overtooke them, and hauing obtained audience the <hi>Herald</hi> beganne, <hi>That he was sent from the</hi> Lord Governor of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>partly to enquire of prisoners, but chiefly to make offer, that because he was desirous to avoide not only profusion but the least effusion of Christian blood, and for that the English had not done any vnmanlike outrage or spoile, he was content they might returne, and should haue his safe conduct for their peaceable passage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Trumpeter, that the <hi>Lord Huntly</hi> his master sent message by him, that aswell for breefe expedition, as to spare expence of christian blood, he would fight vpon the whole quarrell either with 20 against 20 or with 10 against 10 or more particularly by single combate betweene the <hi>Lord Generall</hi> and himselfe, which in regard the <hi>Scots</hi> had advantage both for number and freshnesse of men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard also that for supply, both for provision and succors they were at home, he esteemed an honourable and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table offer.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Herald</hi> the <hi>Lord Generall answered that as his comming was not with purpose or desire to endammage their Realme, as he was there, he would neither intreat nor accept of him leaue to depart, but would measure his marches in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing or retiring, as his owne iudgment, guided by advice of his counsaile should deeme expedient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:4095:16"/>To the <hi>Trumpeter</hi> he returned answere, that the <hi>L. Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley his master was a young gentleman full of free courage, but more desirous of glory then iudicious, as it seemed, how to win it. That for number of Combatants it was not in his power to conclude a bargaine, but was to employ all the forces put vnder his charge to the best advantage that he could, that in case this were a particular quarrell betweene the Governour and him, he would not refuse a particular combat, but being a difference betweene the 2 kingdomes, it was neither fit, nor in his power either to vndertake the adventure vpon his owne fortune, or bearing a publike charge to hazard himselfe against a man of private condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> said, <hi>I marvaile</hi> Trumpeter <hi>that thy master would make his challenge so fond, as he might well knowe it could not be accepted. For tell mee</hi> Trumpeter, <hi>can he thinke it fit, that he, to whose charge is committed the command of all this Army abroad, and at home the</hi> Kings <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and protection of all his Realmes, should vndertake a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with a particular man. But he might haue found others his equals amongst vs, by whom he might haue beene assured that he should be answered?</hi> And (therewith turning his speech to the L. Generall) <hi>vnder your</hi> Graces <hi>favour, I accept the challenge. And bring me word Trumpeter that thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster will performe with mee as thou hast said, and thou shalt haue</hi> 100 <hi>crownes for thy travaile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>answered</hi> the L. Generall, <hi>you haue a great charge in the Army, which vpon a private mans challenge you must not abandon. But Herault tell the L. Governor, and the</hi> L. Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, <hi>That we haue entred your country with a sober company</hi> (for so the Scots terme a thing that is meane) <hi>your army is both great and fresh, but let them appeare vpon indifferent ground, and assuredly they shall haue fighting enough. And bring me word Herault that they will so doe, and I will reward thee with</hi> 1000 <hi>crownes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Huntley</hi> was a man young, bold, advente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, of very good resolution and skill in Armes. But this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4095:17"/>
challenge was so farre beyond the point both of discretion and honor, that the <hi>English</hi> that knew his noble spirit, did beleeue that his name was therein abused, which hee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to be true by disavowing it openly afterwards. For it is not fit that a man should abandon his publike charge to vndertake both the office and danger of a private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. And therefore the like challenge of <hi>Tullus</hi> was refused by the commander of the <hi>Albanes.</hi> For that the contention was not betweene their persons, but between the Citties of <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> So <hi>Sertorius</hi> was refused by <hi>Metellus, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> by <hi>Augustus,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Emperor of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by a king of <hi>Scythia,</hi> So <hi>Antonius Caracalla</hi> by reason of his often challenges, was esteemed not to be so valiant as vaine. And herevpon the histories of our times forbeare not to blame <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, <hi>Emperour, Henry</hi> the eight, king of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> the first, king of <hi>France,</hi> for that they often adventured rather as Souldiers then as Commanders.</p>
            <p>But doubtlesse the <hi>L. Governour</hi> made a most honourable offer, and the rather for that it was conceiued by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> that he held himselfe no lesse assured of victory then he was of his owne resolution to fight, whereto it seemed that he wanted not good reason, cheifly vpon confidence of his owne forces, and partly vpon expectation of 12 Gallies and 50 ships well appointed out of <hi>France</hi> to assayle the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> at their backs. All the chiefe Captaines yeelded to the same advice of giving battaile, as out of their owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, because they saw it agreeable to that which the L: <hi>Governour</hi> had determined. To these the residue attributed so much, that albeit diverse were of a different opinion, yet they chose rather to condemne their owne vnderstanding then to question theirs.</p>
            <p>During this enterparlance the <hi>Scots</hi> discharged 4 great shots against the <hi>English</hi> campe, without harme as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but not without breach of the <hi>Laws of the field, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only publike messengers are priviledged to passe without either danger or scorne, but vntill they haue discharged their</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:4095:17"/>
               <hi>message all hostility should surcease.</hi> Howsoeuer this happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Generall of the <hi>English</hi> army vnwilling to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in any equall or honourable offer, sent letters to the L. Governour of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Wherein <hi>he desired him and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the</hi> Scottish <hi>nobility to consider, That both armies consisted of Christians, to whom nothing should be more deere then peace, nothing more detestable then effusion of humane blood. That the cause of this warre did not proceed from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, avarice, or hate, but from desire of perpetuall peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their people and nations, which could no way so firmely be knit as by knitting their Princes together in marriage. That many other respects, set aside their</hi> King <hi>for his birth, his yeares, his royall estate, his princely personage, education, and qualities was such a marriage for their</hi> Queene, <hi>that a more convenient could not be found, that in case all the</hi> Nobility of Scotland <hi>were not of one minde. The</hi> English <hi>would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that their</hi> Queene <hi>should bee brought vp amongst them, vntill she should be of age to make her owne choice. Provided that in the meane time she should not bee transported to any forraigne country, or any agreement made for any other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. That vpon this condition there should be an abstinence of hostility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all that time, and they would in quiet manner withdraw their army, and repaire all dammages which indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Commissioners should adiudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No answere was hereto returned, but rumors ran freshly among the <hi>Scottish</hi> souldiers, that the intention of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> was to take away their <hi>Queene</hi> by force, and vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of marriage to reduce the kingdome vnder their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and verily it may seeme almost incredible that all these faire ouertures, made by men well esteemed for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest dealing, could take no place, that nothing could moue the <hi>Scots</hi> to forsake their distant and heavy helps, and to embrace friends, both ready and at hand. But besides that, the long continued warres betweene the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> had then raised invincible iealousies and hate, which long continued peace hath since abolished, I doe herein ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4095:18"/>
the vnsearchable working and will of God, by whose inflexible decree the vnion betweene the two Realmes did not then take effect, when by the death of K. <hi>Edward</hi> it should haue beene of short continuance, (as by the death of <hi>Francis</hi> the second, the vnion betweene <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did suddenly dissolue) but was reserued vnto a more peaceable and friendly time, so for a person in whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny it hath taken deepe and durable root. And so for that time no conditions of peace being regarded, both sides ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed themselues to their adventure.</p>
            <p>The places where the two Armies lay encamped, were divided by the river <hi>Eske,</hi> the banks whereof were almost so deepe as the bankes of the <hi>Peathes</hi> mentioned before. The <hi>Scots</hi> lay somewhat neere the one side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the <hi>English</hi> about two miles from the other. The <hi>English</hi> first raised their Campe, and began to march towards the river <hi>Eske,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to possesse a hill called <hi>Vnder-Eske,</hi> which commanded the place where their enimies lay. The <hi>Scots</hi> coniecturing so much, cast their Tents flat vpon the ground, passed the River and mounted the Hill before the <hi>English</hi> could come neere. Herevpon the <hi>English</hi> turned aside to another hill called <hi>Pinkenclench,</hi> which afterwards fell much to their Advantage, aswell for that they were then in place to bee ayded by their ships which rode neere in <hi>Edenburgh Frith,</hi> as also for that they gained thereby the advantage both of winde and Sunne, a great part of the strength of an Army, and lastly for that their enimies were thereby cast into a cruell errour.</p>
            <p>For no sooner did they espy the <hi>Eenglish</hi> turning from them, but forthwith they were of opinion that they fled towards their shipping, This surmise was first occasioned for that the English ships remoued the day before from <hi>Lieth</hi> to <hi>Muscleborough Frith,</hi> which was conceiued to be for taking in their foote and carriages, that the horsemen might with lesse encumbrance and more hast returne backe vpon the spurre. Hereupon they had appointed the same

night, (whose darknesse would haue encreased the feare) to haue giuen a camisado vpon the <hi>English.</hi> But vnderstanding that they were well entrenched hauing good es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>out abroad and sure watch within, they brake that purpose, but vpon this declining of the <hi>English</hi> from them, the conceit did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine reuiue, not only as a thing desired, but because the <hi>English</hi> were inferior vnto them in number, and had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed farre, and were well knowne to grow short in their provisions. Yea whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> they were discerned to make stand vpon the first ascent of <hi>Pinkenclench</hi> hill, the coniecture ran that their flight, was only deferred vntill they might couer their disorders by the dead darknesse of the night. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous security and alwaies dangerous, when men will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue any bees to be in a hiue vntill they haue a sharpe sense of their stings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Scots</hi> heaued vp into high hope of victory, tooke the <hi>English</hi> fallen for foolish birds fallen into their nette, and seeming to fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>re nothing more then that they should escape, forlooke their hill and marched into the plaine directly towards the <hi>English. Here the Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor put them in remembrance, how they could neuer yet be brought vnder by the</hi> English, <hi>but were alwaies able either to beate them backe, or to weary them away. He bad them looke vpon themselues and vpon their enimies, themselues dreadfull, their enimies gorgeous and braue, on their side men, on the other spoil, in case either through slownesse or cowardise they did not permit them to escape, who (lo now) already haue began their sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole army consisted of 35 or 36000 men of whom they made three battaillons. In the Auantgard comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Earle of Angus</hi> about 15000 were placed about 10000 in the battaile, over whom was the <hi>Lord Governor</hi> and so many in the Arriere, led by the valiant <hi>Gordone Earle of Huntley.</hi> Hackbutters they had none, no men at armes but about 2000 horsemen, prickers as they are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, fitter to make excursions and to chase then to sustaine

any strong charge. The residue were on foote well furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed With Iacke and skull, pike, dagger, bucklers made of boorde, and sliceing swords, broad, thinne and of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper. Every man had a large kerchiefe folded twice or thrice about the necke, and many of them had chaines of latten drawne three or foure times along their hoses and doublet sleeues, they had also to affright the enimies horses, big rattles couered with parchment or paper, and small stones within, put vpó staues about three els long. But doubtles the ratling of shot might haue done better service.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Angus</hi> led the Avantguard with a well measured march, whereupon the <hi>Lord Governor</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him by a messenger to double his pace, thereby to strike some terror vnto the enimy. Himselfe followed with the battaile a good distance behinde, and after came the Arrier well nigh euen with the battaile on the left side, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vauntguard was slanked on the right side with 4 or 5 pieces of Artellery drawne by men, and with 400 horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men prickers on the left. The battaile and Arriere were likewise guarded with Artillery in like sort drawne, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 4000 <hi>Irish</hi> Archers brought by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Argile,</hi> serued as a wing to them both, rightly so termed as being the first who began the flight,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Generall</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> were together when the <hi>Scots</hi> thus abandoned the hill, which they espying gaue thankes to God, holding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in good hope of the euent, forthwith they ordered the artillery, and taking a louing leaue departed to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall charge, the <hi>Generall</hi> to the battaile, where the <hi>Kings</hi> standard was borne, the <hi>Earle</hi> to the Avantguard, both on foote, protesting that they would liue or dy with the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>whom also with bold countenance and speech</hi> (which serue souldiers for the best eloquence) <hi>they put in minde of the honour, their ancestors had acquired, of their own extreme disgrace and danger if they fought not well, that the iustice of their quarrell should not so much encourage as enrage them,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:4095:19"/>
               <hi>being to revenge the dishonor done to their King, and to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise the deceitfull dealings of their enimies, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their enimies should nothing dismay them, because they Who come to maintaine their owne breach of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that the checke of their consciences much breaketh their spirit, haue the omnipotent arme of God most furious against them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herewith arose a buzzing noise among them as if it had bin the rustling sound of the sea a farre of, euery man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing himselfe to his office, and encouraging those who were neerest vnto them. The <hi>Earle</hi> ranged his Avauntguard in Array vpon the side of the hill, expecting vntill the enemy should more neerely approach. The generall after he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Battaile, parte vpon the hill, and parte vpon the plaine, somewhat distant from the Avantguard on the right side, mounted the hill to the great artillerie, to take a view of both the Armies, and to giue directions as occasions should change. The Arrier stood wide of the battaile vpon the same side, but altogether vpon the plaine. The L. <hi>Gray</hi> Captaine of the men at Armes, was appointed to stand somewhat distant from the Avantguard on the left side, in such sort as he might take the flanke of the enimie, but was forbidden to charge, vntill the foot of the Avantguard were buckled with them in front, and vntill the battaile should be neere enough for his reliefe.</p>
            <p>Now after that the <hi>Scots</hi> were well advaunced in the field, marching more then an ordinary pace, the great shot from the <hi>English</hi> ships, and especially from the galley began furiously to scoure among them, whereby the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> of <hi>Grime</hi> and diuers others about were torne in peices; especially the wing of the <hi>Irish</hi> was so grievously either galled or fearred there with, that (being strangers and in a manner neutralls) they had neither good heart to goe forward, nor good likeing to stand still, nor good assurance to run away. The <hi>Lord Gray</hi> perceiued this amazement, and conceiued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by occasion to be ripe, wherevpon when the enimy was not

about two slight shot from the <hi>English</hi> avantguard, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly and against direction with his men at armes, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them on head.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> were then in a fallow field, whereinto the <hi>English</hi> could not enter, but ouer a crosse ditch and a slough, in passing whereof many of the English horse were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and some mired, when with some difficulty and much disorder they had passed this ditch, the ridges of the fallow field lay trauerse, so as the <hi>English</hi> must crosse them in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the charge. Two other disadvantages they had, the enimies pikes were longer then their staues, and their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were naked without any barbs. For albeit many brought barbes out of <hi>England,</hi> yet because they expected not in the morning to fight that day, few regarded to put them on.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> confident both in their number, order, and good appointment, did not only abide the <hi>English,</hi> but with some biteing termes provoked them to charge. They cloased and in a manner locked themselues together, shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to shoulder, so neere as possibly they could, their pikes they strained in both hands and therewith their buckler in the left, the one end of the pike against the right foote, the other breast high against the enimy. The fore ranke stooped so low as they seemed to kneele, the second ranke close at their backs, crossed their pikes ouer their shoulders, and so did the third and the rest in their order, so as they appeared like the thornie skinne of a hedghogge, and it might be thought impossible to breake them. Notwithstanding the charge was giuen with so well gouerned fury, that the left corner of the <hi>Scots</hi> battaillon was enforced to giue in, But the <hi>Scots</hi> did so brauely recouer and acquit themselues, that diverse of the <hi>English</hi> horsemen were overthrowne, and the residue so disordered as they could not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently fight or fly, and not only iustled &amp; bare downe one another, but in their confused tumbling backe brake a part of the Avantguard on foote. In this encounter 26 of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4095:21"/>
English were slaine most part Gentlemen of the best esteem. Divers others lost their horses, and carried away markes that they had beene there. The L. <hi>Gray</hi> was dangerously hurt with a pike in the mouth, which strucke two inches into his necke. The L. <hi>Edward Seymer</hi> sonne to the L. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi> lost his horse, and the English Standard was almost. lost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Assuredly albeit encounters betweene horsemen on the one side, and foot on the other are seildome with the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of danger, because as horsemen can hardly breake a battaile on foot, so me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on foot cannot possibly chase horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Yet hearevpon so great was the tumult and feare a mong the <hi>English,</hi> that, had not the commanders bin men both of approued courag and skill, or happely had the <hi>Scots</hi> bine well fonrnished with men at Armas the army had that day beene vtterly vndone. For an army is commonly like a flocke of fowles when some begine to flie all will follow. But the <hi>Lord Gray</hi> to repaire his error endevoured with all industrie to vallye his horse: The <hi>Lord Generall</hi> also moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horsebacke and came amongst them both by his presence &amp; aduice to reduce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into order. <hi>Sr</hi>. <hi>Ralph Vane &amp; Sr</hi> 
               <hi>Ralph Sadler</hi> did memorable service. But espcially the <hi>Earle of Warwicke</hi> who was in greatest danger declared his resolution and judgment to bee most present in reteyning his men both in order and in heart. And hauing cleered his foot from disturbance by the horsemen, hee sent forth before the front of his Avantgard S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Peter Mewcas</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all the Hackbutters on foot, and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Peter Gamboa,</hi> a Spaniard Captaine of 200 Hackbutters <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> on horse. These brought their men to the slough men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, who discharging liuely almost close to the face of the enimy did much amaze them, being also disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the late pursuit of the <hi>English</hi> horsemen, and by spoiling such as they had ouerthrowne. At the backes of these the Archers were placed, who before had marched on the right wing of the Avantguard, and then sent such
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4095:22"/>
showers of shot ouer the Hackbutters heads, that many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their enimies being but halfe armed, were beaten downe and buried therewith. And besides the Master of the Artillery did visit them sharply with murthering haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot from the peeces mounted towards the top of the hill, also the Artillery which slanked the Arriere executed hotly. Lastly the ships were not idle, but especially the galley did play vpon them and plague them very sore.</p>
            <p>The Scots being thus applied with shot, and perceiuing the Avantguard of the <hi>English</hi> to be in good order, neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to approach, &amp; the men at armes to haue recouered their Array, turned their Avantguard somewhat towards the South, to win, as it was thought, some advantage of ground. By this meanes they fell directly on head on the <hi>English</hi> battaile, wherevpon the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> addressed his men to take the slanke. The Avantguard of the <hi>Scots</hi> being thus vpon, and beset with enimies, began a little to retire towards their great battaile, either to be in place to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued by them, or happely to draw the English more sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and apart. The <hi>Irish</hi> Archers espying this and surmising the danger to be greater then it was, suddenly brake vp &amp; committed the saftie of their liues to their nimble foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship. After whose example all the rest threw away their weapons, and in headlong hast abandoned the field, not one stroke hauing beene giuen by the <hi>English</hi> on soot. But then the horsemen comming furiously forward had them very cheap.</p>
            <p>The slight was made three waies, some running to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> some along the sands towards <hi>Lieth,</hi> but the most to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Dake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>th,</hi> which way by reason of the marish the <hi>English</hi> horse were least able to pursue. The chase was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from one of the clocke in the afternoone till almost six. It reached fiue miles in length, and foure in breadth, all which waies the <hi>Scots</hi> scattered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their flight <hi>Iackes, Swords, Bucklers, Daggers,</hi> or whatsoeuer was either cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome, or of weight to impeach their hast, yea some cast
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4095:22"/>
off their shooes and dublets and fled in their shirts. Divers other devises were practised to avoid or deferre the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent danger. Some intreated and offered large ransomes, some being pursued only by one, sodainly turned head and made resistance, by whom many horses were disabled, and some of their horses either slaine or hurt. The Earle of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> a man of assured both hardinesse and vnderstanding, couched in a furrow and was passed ouer for dead vntill a horse was brought for his escape. 2000 others lying all the day as dead departed in the night, Divers others plunged into the river <hi>Eske,</hi> and couered themselues vnder roots &amp; branches of trees, many so streined themsesues in their race that they fell downe breathlesse and dead, whereby they seemed in running from their deaths to runne vnto it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> discerned in their retreit that the execution had beene too cruell, and farre exceeding the bounds of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hostility, which happely was a cause in the secret iudgment of God, that they had no better fruit of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. The dead bodies l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>y all the way scattered so thicke as a man may see sheepe grazing in a well stored pasture, most slaine in the head or necke for that the horsemen could not well touch lower with their swords, and scarse credible it is how soone they were stripped and laid naked vpon the ground. But then againe the eyes of all men were fastned vpon them with pitty and admiration, to behold so many naked bodies, as for talnesse of stature, whitnesse of skinne, largenesse and due proportion of limbes, could hardly be equalled in any one country. The ground where their severall battailons first brake, lay strewed with pikes so thicke as a sloore is vsually strewed with rushes, whereby the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ces could hardly be passed ouer either by horse or by foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the riuer <hi>Eske</hi> ran red with blood, so as they who perished therein might almost bee said to bee drowned in their fellowes blood.</p>
            <p>On the otherside when they came to the place where the English men at Armes had beene defeated, many of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4095:23"/>
their horses were found grieuously gashed or goared to death. The English who there perished were so deeply wounded, especially on the head that not one could be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by his face. Braue <hi>Edward Shellie,</hi> who was the first man that charged, was knowne only by his beard, Little <hi>Preston</hi> for that both his hands were cut off being known to haue worne bracelets of gold about his wrests, others were brought to knowledge by some such particular marks. <hi>Hereby appeareth (as I said before) what blessing is growne to both nations by their late happy vnion when before they were like two rude encountring Rammes, whereof he that escapes best is sure of a blowe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divers of the Nobilitie of <hi>Scotland</hi> were here slaine, and many Gentlemen both of worth and noble birth, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior sort about 10000, &amp; as some say 14000 lost their liues. Of the English were slaine 51 horsemen &amp; one foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but a farre greater number hurt. The <hi>Scottish</hi> priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners accounted by the <hi>Marshals</hi> booke, were about 1500. The chiefe whereof were the Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> the Lords <hi>Yester Hoblie,</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of <hi>Sampoole,</hi> and the L. of <hi>Wimmes.</hi> A Herault was also taken but discharged forthwith. The execution was much maintained by the <hi>Scots</hi> owne swords, scattered in every place. For no sooner had an English horseman brake his sword, but forthwith he might take vp another. Insomuch that many of them brake three or foure before their returne. <hi>So apparant is the hand of God against violation of faith, that it is often cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised by the meanes appointed to defend it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all other the English men were least favourable to the Priests and Monkes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Scots called <hi>Kirkmen,</hi> who had beene equally troublesome in peace and vnprofitable in warre. To whom many as well English as Scots imputed the calamity of that day these made a band of 3 or 4000, as it was said, but they w'ere not altogether so many, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit many Bishops and Abbots were amongst them, from these divers Scots feared more harme by victory, then they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4095:23"/>
found among their enimies by their ouerthrow. After the field a banner was found of white sarc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>net, whereon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was painted, her haire about her shoulders kneeling before a crucifix, on her right hand a church, and along the banner in faire letters written <hi>Afflictae ecclesiae ne obliuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caris.</hi> This was supposed to haue beene the Kirkemens banner. But could this crucifix haue spoken, as one is said to haue spoken to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Francis</hi> and another to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I must not forget the fidelity of a <hi>Scottish</hi> souldier to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Huntly.</hi> He finding the <hi>Earle</hi> assaulted by the <hi>English,</hi> and without his helmet, tooke of his owne headpeece and put it on the <hi>Earles</hi> head. The <hi>Earle</hi> was therewith taken prisoner but the souldier for want thereof was presently stroke downe. This <hi>Earle</hi> was of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage &amp; for this cause much loued of his souldiers, to whom he was no lesse louing againe. This he manifested by his great care for such Scottish prisoners as were either woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or poore, providing at his proper charge, cure for the one and releife for the other. This <hi>Earle</hi> being asked whilst he was prisoner, how he stood affected to the marriage, answered that he was well affected to fauour the marriage but he nothing liked that kinde of wooing.</p>
            <p>Certaine of those who escaped by slight excused their dishonor, not without a sharpe iest against some of their leaders, affirming that as they had followed them into the field, so it was good reason they should follow them out.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4095:24"/>
ioy among the <hi>English</hi> partly because it came so cheape, &amp; partly by reason of the great danger and greater terror that had bin cast vpon them by reason of the repulse and disarray of their men at Armes.</p>
            <p>Now as se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For whilst the <hi>English</hi> army had thus drawne both the preparations and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Scots</hi> wholly vpon them. The <hi>Lord Wharton</hi> and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Leuenoxe</hi> entred <hi>Scotland</hi> on the west marches with 5000 men, and hauing marched two miles they wonne the church of <hi>Anan,</hi> a strong place and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies much annoying the <hi>English,</hi> there they tooke 62 prisoners, fired most part of the spoyle, and ouerthrew the fort with powder, passing 16 miles further they tooke the castle of <hi>Milke,</hi> which they fortified strongly and planted a garrison therein, and after much spoile and wast of the country returned safely into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These successes did strike such a terror into many of the <hi>Scots</hi> that the <hi>Earle Bothwell</hi> and diuerse cheife gentlemen of <hi>

               </hi> and <hi>Meers</hi> supposing to finde more easy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions by yeelding then by striuing, submitted themselues to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and were receiued by the <hi>Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi> into protection. But it is most cerraine that the <hi>English</hi> made not their best improuements of these fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate euents, and that especially by two miserable errors, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>unctation in prosecuting, and haste in departure. But doubtlesse the vnion of these two realmes was a worke most proper to Gods omnipotent arme, which afterwards effected the same, as by milder meanes, so in a more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner then they could haue bin vnited by Armes. This high appointment of God we must reuerence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, but not omit to obserue the errors committed.</p>
            <p>First therefore after the retreit, the <hi>English</hi> lodged the same night in the place where the battaile had bin fought. Where and in the villages not farre distant they soiourned
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4095:24"/>
fiue daies, without doing any thing, in the meane time the <hi>English</hi> searched the riuers and hauens whether the <hi>Scottish</hi> ships were retyred, in such sort as they left few ships of war vnspoiled or vntaken, the army also gathered the spoile of the field, whereof 30000 iacks and swords, &amp; 30 peices of great artillery were shipped for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> hauing thus long breathed and thereby gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen breathing to their enimies fired <hi>Lieth</hi> tooke S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Herewith as if they had beene weary of their faire fortunes, they suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brake off the enterprise and returned another way into <hi>England,</hi> hauing staid not aboue 25 daies in Scotland, and lost vnder 60 men. The pretence of their departure was worse then the departure it selfe, namely for that the yeare and their prouisions were far spent, and the country affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded little forrage.

            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Lord Gouernor</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> being of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and sober iudgement, as a man might well read in his face, as he had amply performed his duty both before the battaile and in the field, so especially after the fight he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himselfe to be of a stout and vnbroken spirir.

               <hi>I assure my selfe that many of you my Lords and more of the vulger are much displeased with me for that I haue advised this warre whereof so sad euents haue followed, for this cause I haue assembled you together to reduce you to a better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to blame you deepely, either if you remaine offended, or if you cast downe your courage throw feare, the betrayer of all succors which reason can afforde, for tell me if you are discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with me for aduising this warre, doe you not condemne your selues for following the aduice? It is certaine that at the first you were all of my opinion, and that I did nothing without your approuement. If now vpon one misadventure you change your iudgements, and charge the fault only vpon me, you doe me wrong and discouer your owne weaknesse, in being vnable to endure those things which you knew were casuall, and which you were resolued to endure. But I make no doubt but the same reasons which induced you to entertaine this warre, will induce you also to prosecute the same, howsoeuer sodaine and vnexpected euents dismay your iudgments, for the present.</hi>

               <hi>society, no sodeyne alteration can almost be made therein, but many will be induced thereby to attempt some alteration in rule, whence (saith</hi> Dio) <hi>conspiracies &amp; seditions are often occasioned. For Religion being seated in the high throne of conscience is a most powerfull ruler of the soule and farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before estimation of life, or any other worldly respect, for this advanceth man to the highest happinesse, It leadeth him to his last end, all other things are but instruments, this is the hand, all other things are but accessaries this is the principall. And therefore as all men are naturally moued by religion, so when they are violently thrusted forward by those who</hi> (as Liuie speaketh) <hi>make it their purpose to possesse soules by superstition, then doe they breake all bands of reason and of rule, no persuasion of the one, no command of the other can then restrame them.</hi> Multitudo vbi religione capta est melius vatibus quam ducibus suis paret, <hi>Curt. lib.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">0</hi>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will not deny but that some change in religion is often expedient and sometimes necessary because more in that then in any other thing, it is hard to containe men from running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of these extreames either of vaine superstition or of carelesse contempt, but this must be done with a lost and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand, &amp; as Cicero speaketh,</hi> vt quum minimo sonitu orbis in republica convertatur. <hi>Some respect should also haue been given to those greene times, to the monstrous multitude muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with</hi> 2 <hi>great plagues &amp; corruptions of iudgement, custome and ignorance, whereto may be added griefe at their owne wants, and envy at the prosperity of others, especially for that many bold spirits were busied, not only to incense but to lead them into much variety of mischiefe. And if it be said that</hi> K. Henry the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

            <p>Now in this meane time the commissioners before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were earnest in executing their authority. And ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pulled downe or defaced all images in Churches, and that in such vnseasonable &amp; vnseasoned fashion as if it had beene done in hostility against them, hereat many did expresse a sense of distast, some for religious respects, others in regard of the excellent artifice of some of their pieces, affirming that albeit religious reverence migh happily haue beene either taken away or moderated, yet the civill regard which all men doe not only afford but affect, in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the memory of those whom they honour or loue, night be endured without offence.</p>

Albeit the ancient <hi>Germans</hi> &amp; from the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> and the <hi>Gaules</hi> had neither Images nor Temples, albeit the Iewes, and in imitation of them, the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> abhorre nothing more then Images, either in their temples, or in their houses, because the lawe of God forbiddeth not onely to adore but to make any image. Albeit the <hi>Christians</hi> continued a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Images in their Churches, yet were they never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained into any religion, but presently they tooke deepe root in the hearts and consciences of the common people.

These issued into the base court, through a pryuie posterne, and sharpely visited the Assailants with Halbeards and swordes. Here the fight grew hot, the darkenes and danger terrifying some and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimating others. Blowes flew at all adventures, woundes and deathes given and taken vnexpected, many scarce knowing their enimies from their friends: But shame wrought such life and courage in the <hi>English,</hi> as very few of the enimies who entered the court escaped aliue, leauing their fellowes bleeding in their deadly wounds, yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>After divers like adventures the <hi>English</hi> perceiving that the towne could not bee kept without danger, nor lost without dishonour, The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Rutland</hi> was sent with 3000 <hi>Almaines</hi> and as many borderers to demolish the towne and to bring the artillerie a way to Barwicke, The Earle not only accomplished his Charge but made wide wast in his passage by ruine and spoyle, Herewith the castle of <hi>Hame</hi> was sodenly surprised by the <hi>Scots</hi> and all the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> therein either taken or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But in this meane time such tempests of sedition tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>England</hi> more by default of governors then the peoples impatience to liue in subiection, that not only the honour but the safetie of the state was thereby endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

            <p>The seditious as men alwaies dangerous when they haue once broken awe, interpreted this or any other milde dealing to proceed from some faining or fainting disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either doubting or daring most when they are most fairely entreated, and the more to enslame the popular rage,

fresh rumors were devised and divulged, that the people should be constrained to pay a ratable taxe for their sheep and other cattle, and an excise for every thing which they should eat or drinke, by which and other like reports the simple were blinded, the malitious edged, all hardned from applying to any peaceable perswasion.</p>

Wherevpon they resolued to apply their endeauours for taking the citty, and either by destroying it to increase terror, or else by sparing it to winne an opinion of moderation, they had no great artillery to open a breach, and yet without reason they gaue an assault, and vsed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers meanes to mount the walls, but the more madnesse they shewed in their attempt, with the greater losse they were driuen b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After this they mined the walls, laid the powder and rammed the mouth, but the citizens made a countermine, whereinto they powred such plentie of water, that the wet powder could not be fired.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the <hi>L.

The <hi>Lord privy seale</hi> had but a small company in regard of the seditious. Yet with good order and courage hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the bridge but could not force it, at the last find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the riuer to be fordeable at the foot of the bridge, he there set ouer his horse, wherevpon the guardes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to defend the bridge forsooke their charge, and rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their strength in the meddow. Then the kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces charged liuely vpon them, and they againe as stoutly receiued the charge, but being an vntrained multitude without either souldier or guide, they were soone broken and put to slight, yet they valued themselues and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously charged vpon the kings forces, but were presently rowted and cast out of the field, the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And that for his part he would feed on the one arme and fight with the other before he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to put the citty into the seditious hands.

            <p>Divers others were executed by martiall law, &amp; a great part of the country was abandoned to the spoile of the souldiers, who not troubling themselues to discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a subiect and a rebell, whilest their liberty lasted made indifferently profit of both.</p>
            <p>The seditious in <hi>Northfolke</hi> were somewhat dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, both because their strength was greater, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the citty of <hi>Norwich</hi> was a friend vnto them, or at least wished them no great harme, and being faithfull to neither side, was alwaies ready to entertaine the stronger, their first attempt was made at <hi>Attleborough</hi> where they threw downe the fences of one <hi>Greene of Wilbie,</hi> who was supposed to haue enclosed a parte of <hi>Attleborough</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon adioining to the common pasture of <hi>Harsham.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they assembled at a play accustomed yeerely to be kept at <hi>Wimondham,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Morley</hi> a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4095:40"/>
mile distant, and there cast downe the ditches of one <hi>Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barde,</hi> next by incitement of <hi>Iohn Flowerdew of Netheset,</hi> a gentleman of good estate, but neuer expressing desire of quiet, they did the like to certaine enclosures of <hi>Robert Ket</hi> a tanner in <hi>Wimondham,</hi> and receiued of him 38<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi> for their labour, this <hi>Ket</hi> who hath made his obscure beginning well knowen by his mischievous attempts to require <hi>Flowerdew</hi> carried them to <hi>Netheset,</hi> where they cast down all the enclosed pasture of <hi>Flowerdew,</hi> and not stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there he led them indifferently to divers other places, laying all enclosures where hee came rather wast then open.</p>
            <p>And the rather to traine them to his allure, he told them both often and with vehement voice, how they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver topped and trodden downe by gentlemen, and other their good masters, and put out of possibility ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover foote, how whilest rivers of riches ran into their landlords coffers, they were pared to the quicke, and sed vpon pease and oats like beasts, how being sleeced by these for privat benefit, they were slayed by publique burthens of state, wherein whilest the richer sort favoured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they were gnawen to the very bones, how the more to terrify and torture them to their mindes, and winde their necks more surely vnder their arme, their tyrannous masters did often implead arrest, cast them into prison, and thereby consume them to worse then nothing, how they did palliat these pillaries with the faire pretence of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and of law, fine workemen I warrant you, who can so closely carry their dealings, that then men only discouer them, how harmelesse counsailes were fit for tame fooles, but for them who had already stirred there was no hope but in adventuring boldly.</p>
            <p>The likenes of affection and the masking of vices vnder pleasant tearmes, procured not only assent, but applause to all that he said, and so by often and earnest repeating of these and the like speeches, and by bearing a confident
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4095:40"/>
countenance in all his actions, the vulgars tooke him to be both valiant and wise, and a fit man to be their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being glad they had found any captaine to follow.</p>
            <p>Their numbers encreased daily, and therewith their boldnesse and power to doe harme, they were largely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied at the first both with victualls and armes, albeit not with open consent of the places adioining, yet with much private goodwill, for many did not only secretly favour but openly approue their designes. Generally every good man was much grieued, many vpon some dislikes before reioiced in their greater harmes, and not regarding in what liberty they stood, were ready to runne into any bondage. The <hi>Sheriffe</hi> of <hi>Northfolke</hi> resorted vnto them, and made proclamation in the <hi>Kings</hi> name, that forthwith they should peaceably depart, and had he not beene ready &amp; his horse swift to depart in time, hee should hardly haue departed from them aliue.</p>
            <p>After this they drew towards <hi>Norwich</hi> and seated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues at <hi>Monshold</hi> neere <hi>Mount Surrey</hi> and vpon S. <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hards</hi> which hangeth ouer <hi>Norwich,</hi> another company sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Rising</hi> neere <hi>Lynne,</hi> but they were dislodged by the gentlemen of the countrey, and forced to draw to their fellowes at <hi>Monsholde.</hi> Here the maine body encamped and sent divers light companies forth to terrifie and roue. To this place many resorted out of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and from all places of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> many for want, but most vpon a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent minde, and in all places thereabout beacons were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and bells rung, as a roaring furtherance to his vproare, so as in short time the multitude encreased to 16000, and yet rather to be esteemed a number then an army.</p>
            <p>Their actions were couered and disguised with mantles very vsuall in time of disorder of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; iustice, for they had one <hi>Coniers</hi> for their chaplaine, a man brought vp in idle and dead studies, who both morning and evening read solemne prayers, many sermons they also had either by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie or enforcement. But <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker</hi> afterwards <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:4095:41"/>
               <hi>of Canterbury</hi> in his sermon before them touched them for their liuing so neere, that they went neere to touch him for his life, as for Iustice they had a bench vnder a tree where <hi>Ket</hi> vsually sate, and with him two of euery hundred whence their companies had beene raised, here complaints were exhibited and examined aswell against those of their owne company, who receiued iudgement for their offences as against any gentleman or other in the country, by commandment from hence many were very violently pulled from their houses, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to follow them, others were cast into prison, &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily fettered with irons, and not a few rudely and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously entreated, from hence also warrants were sent forth in the kings name, whereby ordinance, powder and shot were commanded out of ships and any other furniture of warre out of houses where it could be found. This tree was ever since termed the <hi>oake of reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the seditious being advanced vnto the height both of their power and of their pride, presented certaine complaints to the <hi>King,</hi> and desired that a <hi>herald</hi> or some other messenger of credite may be sent vnto them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue articles of all those matters wherewith they concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themselues to de grieued. The <hi>King</hi> tooke it for a great indignity that base traitors &amp; theeues should offer to capitulate with him as enimies law: fully holding the field, and yet knowing right well, that as good counsailes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strength by time, so vpon a little respite evill advices either vanish or grow weaker to winne some advantage of time, returned an answere. That seeing he was ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to receiue and relieue the quiet complaints of any of his subiects, he marvailed much either vpon what opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of necessity in themselues or of iniustice in him, they should first put themselues into armes, as a partie against him, and then present him with their bold petitions, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at such a time when hauing fully reformed many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, he had lately set forth a proclamation against
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4095:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
excessiue prices of victualls, and had also appointed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners with ample authority for divers other things, whereof many doubtlesse had beene by that time redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, had not these disordes giuen impediment to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, generally when they might well discerne both his care and endeavours to set all matters in a right frame of reformation, as might best stand both with his honour and their sureties, and with iustice and providence towards all. Touching their particular complaint for reducing lands &amp; farmes to their ancient r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nts although it could not be done by his ordinary power without a parliament, yet he would so farre extend his authority roiall and absolute as to giue charge to his commissioners to trauaile with all persons within their counties, to reduce lands to their former rents where at they were farmed 40 yeares before, and that rents should be paid at <hi>Michelmas</hi> then next ensuing according to that rate, &amp; that such as would not presently yeeld to his commissioners for that redresse, should at the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he would forthwith summon be overruled.</p>
            <p>Concerning their complaint for price of wolles hee would forthwith giue order that his commissioners should cause clothiers take wolles paying only two partes of the price, wherat they were commonly sold the yeare next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and for the other third part, the owner and the buyer should stand to such order as the parliament should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. At which time also he would giue order that landed men to a certaine proportion should be neither clothiers nor farmers, and farther that one man should not vse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers occupations, nor haue plurality of benefices, nor of farmes &amp; generally that he would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue order for all the residue of their requests, in such sort as they should haue good cause not only to remaine quiet, but to pray for him, and to adventure their liues in his service.</p>
            <p>This parliament he promised should beginne in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of October then next ensuing, against which time they should appoint 4 or 6 of their countey, to present bills
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4095:42"/>
of their desires, and in the meane season apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to their harvest and other peaceable businesse at home, and not to driue him to necessity (whereof he would be sorry) by sharper meanes to maintaine both his owne dignity and the common quiet.</p>
            <p>These letters carrying the Kings name in the front, and the protectors with the kings signature at the foote, were sent by a <hi>heralde</hi> to <hi>Monsholde,</hi> a place guarded with great, but confused and disordered strength of the seditious, herewith also the <hi>King</hi> sent his generall pardon, in case they would quietly desist and dissolue. But the seditious were so farre from accepting these of any other offers of accord that herevpon they discharged the first shot against the citty, and because their Artillery being planted on a hill could little or nothing endammage the walls, they remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their batterie to a lower ground, but because their cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was weake, and the cittizens but weakely disposed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, with no danger and little travaile they made themselues masters thereof. Here they imprisoned the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior</hi> and many other of the chiefe cittizens, and ordered all things at their pleasure, but maintained the chiefe seat at <hi>Mansholde,</hi> where it was before. The <hi>Maior</hi> of <hi>Norwitch</hi> and some other gentlemen of credite they constrained to be present at all their counsells, with intention to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance their actions with some authority, but in no sort to be guided by them, All this time the <hi>Kings</hi> forces ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced but slowly, being imploied in appeasing the like disorders more neere the heart of the kingdome. So that it is most certaine, that had these seditious beene so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievously bent as in number they were great, they might haue proued more dangerous then they were, but they ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not at ambitious ends, their rude earthly spirits were neuer seasoned with any manly adventurous thought, and therefore they were content with a licentious &amp; idle life, wherein they might fill their bellies by spoile rather then by labour, to this side their companies ranged in all parts
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4095:42"/>
thereabouts, and tooke away for their vse much houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuffe and goods, but especially they brought to their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions many droues of cattle, for besides deere out of parkes, besides beeues, besides fowles of all kinds within a few daies were brought out of the country 2000 mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, such numbers of sheepe were daily brought in, that a fat weather was sold for 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. This was interpreted for a present plentie but it made such scarcitie afterwards, as could not in many yeares be repaired, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Edmond Kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet Knight</hi> with such company as he could assemble, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon one of their watches by night, but he was so farre inferior vnto them, that it was esteemed a great fortune that he departed from them with his life.</p>
            <p>But soone after the <hi>Lord William Parre Marquis of Northampton</hi> was sent against them with 1500 horsemen, and a small band of <hi>Italians</hi> vnder a Captaine named <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latesta,</hi> he was accompanied with the <hi>Lord sheffield, the L. Wentworth</hi> with divers knights and gentlemen of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall estimation, when he approached within a mile of the citty, the magistrates and chiefe cittizens vpon summons, resorted to his standard, yeelded vnto him the citty sword, and professed their owne loialty, and excused others of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior force, who neither by ignorance fauoured the sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, or through feare durst not declare against them; with these the <hi>Lord Marquis</hi> entred the citty at Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> gate, the citty sword being borne before him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with caused the chiefe cittizens to assemble in the market place, both to giue aduice and to take direction how the citty might best be defended.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the strangers who came with him whether by appointment or by adventure, issued forth of the citty, to view both the numbers and orders of the sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. They againe first put forth their Archers, then their horsemen, lastly a company ran furiously forth without either direction of others or iudgement in themselues, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to haue enclosed the <hi>Italians,</hi> but here might haue
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4095:43"/>
beene a great difference betweene men practised to fight, and men accustomed only to spoile. For the <hi>Italians</hi> in so well advised order receiued the seditious coming rashly vpon them without either feare or skill, that divers of the tumultuous numbers were slaine, at the last the <hi>Italians</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing themselues almost invironed, cast themselues into a ring and retired backe into the citty. But they left one gentleman of their company behinde, who being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne from his horse fell into the hands of the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who like sauages spoiled him of his armour and of his apparell, and hanged him ouer the walls of <hi>Mount Surrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This caused the seditious to remaine the first part of the night within their station, which by reason of the nastines of the beastly multitude, might more fitly be termed a ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell then a campe. Within the citty diligent watch was kept, which was often visited and relieued. The souldiers remained in their armor all night, and kept so great a fire in the market place that all parts of the citty were lighted therewith. The seditious about midnight began to shoote off their great artillerie very liuely and thicke, hereupon the <hi>Lord Marquis</hi> directed part of his forces to rampart the gates and ruinous places of the walls, which the sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious espying, with a hideous roaring and rage they pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselues vpon the citty, some endeavoured to fire the gates, some to mount ouer the walls, and some to passe the riuer, the fight continued three houres, and it is almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible with what rude rage the seditious maintained their assault, some being almost disable to hold vp their weapons would striue what they could to strike their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, others being thrust through the body with a speare, would runne themselues further to reach those who gaue them that deadly wounde, at the last their obstinacy was overcome, and they returned to their cabbines with losse of 300 of their company,</p>
            <p>The residue of the night which was not much, the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4095:43"/>
within the citty applied in refreshing themselues, but the next morning the seditious both with greater strength and better order entered the citty by the hospitall and began a most desperate surprise, the forces of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> albeit inferior in numbers, yet by reason of the fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the place might haue beene sufficient, if they had charged in order, and together, but being scattered in the streets, they were not able to make resistance, herewith they were much endammaged by the cittizens from their houses, so as 100 of them perished, many were hurt, and the residue driven to forsake the citty, the <hi>Lord Shiffields</hi> horse fell with him into a ditch, wereby hee fell into the power of the seditious, and as he pulled off his helmet to shew them who he was, a butcher slew him with the stroak of a club. Divers gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the number of 30 were taken and committed to streight prison, where they were vexed alike with scarcity and scorne. The seditious lost a bout seauen schoore of their company, and yet much sleshed with this successe, they spoiled many parts of the citty, and fired the houses of those whom they esteemed not to bee their friends, but the rage of the fire was at first hindred and then appeased by fall of a suddaine shower of raine, wherevpon many presaged that the flames of this sedition should neither spread farre nor long endure. The report of this repulse flying to <hi>London,</hi> the most made of that which was true, and many falsities added thereto. The <hi>Earle of Warwicke</hi> was sent with such forces both <hi>English</hi> and strangers, wherewith hee had appointed for seruice in <hi>Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> when he came to <hi>Cambridge</hi> the <hi>Lord Marquis</hi> resorted vnto him, and also the <hi>Lord Willoughby, Powes</hi> and <hi>Bray,</hi> his two sonnes <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> and many <hi>knights</hi> and <hi>gentlemen</hi> of name, with these hee marched somewhat leasurely because the importance of the danger might make the service the more esteemed, At length h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e presented his forces consisting of 6000 foote and 1500 horse before the citty vpon the plaine, and forthwith sent
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4095:44"/>
to summon the seditious and to offer pardon if it would be accepted, but neither summons nor pardon was any thing regarded. Insomuch as when the <hi>Kings</hi> pardon was offred by a <hi>herault,</hi> a lewd boy turned towards him his naked britch, and vsed words sutable to that gesture, one standing by and moued with this barbarous behaviour discharged a harquebur vpon the boy, and stroke him with the shot a little aboue the reines. Hereat those seditious that seemed moderate before became desperate, and those who were desperate seemed starke mad, whence such tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, such confused hollowings and howlings ensued, that the <hi>heralde</hi> was glad to withdraw himselfe.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Earle</hi> planted his cannon against S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Stephens</hi> gate, and se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> pioners to worke against the brazen gate. The cannon against S. <hi>Stephens</hi> gate executed so well, that in short time the <hi>Port<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ullis</hi> and gate were broken, and entry opened into the city. Others entered at the brazen gate but in that entrance some were slaine. Also the <hi>Maiors</hi> deputy opened <hi>Westwicke</hi> gate where the <hi>Earle</hi> himselfe entred without resistance and possessed himselfe of the market place, at these entrances 130 of the seditious were slaine 60 were taken and forthwith executed by martiall law. As the <hi>Earles</hi> carriages were brought into the citty nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther garded norregarded as they should, divers of them were surprised by the seditious and driuen to <hi>Monsholde.</hi> At this bootie they were more ioyfull then grieued at the losse, either of the cittie or of their companions, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that they were supplied thereby with good store of powder and shot, wherein their want did most consist.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earle</hi> being in possession of the citty rampared all the gates except those who opened towards <hi>Monsholde,</hi> wherein he planted good artillerie. But the seditious the more terrible by reason of their more desperate fury fell vpon those gates albeit without order, yet with such rude and carelesse courage and cries, that they beat backe the guardes, slew the principall gunners, carried away their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4095:44"/>
and therewith certaine carts laden with munition, here were boies obserued to be so desperatly resolued as to pull arrowes out of their owne flesh, and deliuer them to be shot againe by the archers on their side, herevpon the <hi>Earle</hi> was enforced to blocke vp those gates as hee had done the rest, but the citty was so weake that it could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be defended.</p>
            <p>For the seditious being now furnished with artillerie powder and shot battered <hi>Bishopsgate,</hi> and cast downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great part of the walls vpon that side of the citty. They afterwards passed the riuer likewise and assailed the <hi>Earles</hi> men vpon advantage in the streets, of whom many they slew, &amp; fired divers places prostrating two parishes almost entirely, so they did mischiefe they little cared what they did or to what end, and in such sort the danger encreased that many perswaded the <hi>Earle</hi> to submit courage to rage, and for a time to abandon the citty. But he not easily vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible in spirit, and well assured that hauing stopped all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages for reliefe, shortnesse of provision would in very short time draw the obstinacy of the seditious to shorter limits, drew his sword and caused others to doe the like, &amp; (according to a souldiery custome in cases of extremity by enterchange of a kisse by every of them vpon the swords of others, sealed a resolution to maintaine the place.</p>
            <p>Assuredly as it is advantageable to a physition to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the cure of a declining disease, so it is for a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to suppresse a sedition which hath passed the height, for in both alike the noxious humor doth first weaken and afterwards wast and weare to nothing, and besides it is scarce possible that a rude and ruinous multitude should continue long together, if any pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4095:45"/>
their hill, and entrenched them at the foote thereof in a valley called <hi>Dussendale</hi> where they invited the Earle to a present encounter, and as there hath seldome hapned any sedition within this realme, but the chiefe actors therein haue beene abused with some <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>prophecies of doubtfull construction, so the seditious were moued to remoue to this place vpon a prophecy much credited among them, that they should fill it with slaughtered bodies, but whether of their enimies or of their owne it was left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, the words of the prophecy were these.</p>
            <lg>

            </lg>
            <p>The <hi>Earle</hi> being newly supplied with 1400 horse was glad that the seditious had forsaked their hill, for that his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in whom consisted his greatest strength, could there performe but little service, so the next morning he sent forth all his horsemen of whom 1000 were <hi>Almaines,</hi> as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed so aduentrous in armes, his foote hee retained within the towne. The seditious ranged themselues for the sight, placing all the gentlemen whom they had taken in front every two couple together to make them sure from starting away. The Earle before he would charge sent to them an offer of a generall pardon, one or two of the principall excepted. But this more chafed the rage of those who were resolued either to liue or dye together &amp; what cared they for pardon, who haue nothing but a vile and servile life to loose. For no more could be gotten from their estates, then from the shauing of an egge, wherefore in a proud scorne they answered this offer with a great shot, that stroke the kings standard bearer on the thigh, and his horse on the shoulder, Herevpon the <hi>Earle</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his artillery to be applied, the <hi>Almaines</hi> also and captaine <hi>Drury</hi> with his troopes gaue a resolute charge, &amp; yet with such discretion that most of the captiue gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4095:45"/>
who were placed in the front escaped without harme, these were so well seconded by the light horse, that in short time they brake the seditious, chased them aboue three miles, and silled themselues with blood vntill night, there dyed of them 2000 as K. <hi>Edward</hi> tooke the number, but our histories report more then 3500.</p>
            <p>In the meane time they who guarded the artillerie and baggage, encloased themselues with carriage and a trench, and pitched stakes to beare of the approach of horses, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to stand stifly vpon their desence. The <hi>Earle</hi> returning from the execution, did certifie them by message, that because the <hi>King</hi> his master was desirous to establish peace rather by benignity then by blood, hee did assure them their pardon if they would submit, otherwise they might expect nothing but death. Answere was made that they expected nothing but death, and that they respected nothing at all, but it was by the sword if they stood vpon defence, and by the halter if they should yeelde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made choice to dye rather as souldiers then as dogges. The <hi>Earle</hi> sent againe to know if they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine their pardon in case he should come in person and assure it, they answered, they did conceiue him to be so honourable, that from himselfe they would most thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embrace it; So hee roade and caused their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pardon to be read to them, and engaged his honour that it should be performed. Then seeming to respect life more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, threw away their weapons and disloialty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and with voices so lowd as before they were lewd wished all ioy and prosperity to the <hi>King.</hi>

            <p>The commander <hi>Ket.</hi> hauing a good horse sled away with the first, and the next day was taken with his brother <hi>William</hi> in a barne, and brought with a guard of 20 horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to <hi>Norwich</hi> both of them hauing made good proofe that they were no lesse peaceable to guide an army in war, then they were to governe themselues in peace. Nine of the principall were hanged vpon the <hi>tree of Refomation,</hi> of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4095:46"/>
whom two were sedueing prophets, a third was a most excellent cannonier, whose good skill euelly imploied did much endammage the forces of the <hi>King. Robert Ket</hi> and his brother were sent to <hi>London,</hi> and from thence returned to be executed in <hi>Northfolke. Robert Ket</hi> was hanged in chaines vpon <hi>Norwich</hi> castle, his brother <hi>William</hi> was in like sort executed vpon <hi>Wimondham</hi> steeple, but not without some murmuring. For that church dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the seruice of God, and which is polluted by violent death, should be made a place of publique execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The day of this defate of the seditious was a long time after yearely obserued for a festivall day by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Norwitch,</hi> as well by cessation from labour, as by resorting to Church to giue publique thankes for their deliuerance,</p>
            <p>About the same time another sedition was raised at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> in the <hi>Northriding of Yorkeshire</hi> where of the chiefe mouers were <hi>William Ombler</hi> a gentleman, <hi>Thomas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dale</hi> a patish clarke, &amp; <hi>Steuenson a post.</hi> They tooke encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a clarke and deceivable prophecy, a. common law both of obedience and peace, which did foretell that <hi>the time should arriue when there should be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The pretences were to restore the church to her ancient Rights (for that was alwaies one note in their musique) to relieue the poore, to abate the rich, and generally to disburthen the Realme of all grieuances, a seemely taske for such vndertakers.</p>
            <p>And now for execution hereof, first by firing of beacons and ringing of bells (as if the coast had beene assailed by enimies) they assembled about 3000 in armes, whom they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4095:46"/>
drew to be appliable to their purpose. Then to beginne their great worke of refomation they slew one <hi>White</hi> a <hi>Gentleman, Sauage</hi> a <hi>Merchant</hi> and two others of mea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ner quality, and left their bodies naked vpon the wild neere <hi>Semor.</hi> After this they passed to the <hi>Eastriding</hi> in <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> their company daily increasing like a snowball in rowling, and many they tooke with them much against their mindes. But no sooner was the kings pardon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, but most of them sell off and dispersed, leauing <hi>Ombler</hi> and <hi>Dale</hi> almost alone. These as they were riding like mad men from towne to towne charging people in the <hi>Kings</hi> name to assemble at <hi>Hummanby</hi> were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and with foure others of the most tumultuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> soone after executed at <hi>Yorke</hi> whose speedie punishment staid others who were thought to wauer betweene obedience and revolt.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>French king</hi> supposing to make his hand by these rude rauages in <hi>England</hi> brake of his treaty of peace proclaimed hostilitie &amp; denounced the same by his <hi>Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador</hi> to the <hi>King.</hi> Hereupon all <hi>French</hi> men in <hi>England</hi> not <hi>Denizens</hi> were taken prisoners, &amp; all their goods seized for the <hi>Kinge.</hi> The <hi>French Kinge</hi> vnderstandinge that certaine <hi>English</hi> ships lay at <hi>Iersey</hi> set forth a sleete of gallies &amp; ships intending to surprise them as they lay at Anchore. But the <hi>English</hi> being both vigilant &amp; well appointed in such sort did entertaine them, that their ships departed terribly torn with losse of 1000 men at the least, The <hi>French King</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing least that the bad successe of this first enterprise, might both discourage his peope and bring di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

diuers <hi>Almaines,</hi> who serued in the garrisons, who being meerely mercenarie did easily encline to the strongest.</p>
            <p>From whence the <hi>French King</hi> marched towardes Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine vpon whose approach <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Nicholas Arnault</hi> captaine of <hi>Bullingberge</hi> holding the place not of strength to be held withdrew all the ordinance &amp; matters of worth into high <hi>Boullaine</hi> and with gunpowder blew vp the Forte. So the <hi>French Kinge</hi> brought his armie before <hi>Boulline,</hi> but because the plague raged amongst his souldiers &amp; the weather was vnseasonable by reason of much fall of raine, he departed from his army and left <hi>Chastilion</hi> gouernor in his steed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chastilion</hi> bent his siege against the <hi>Pierre,</hi> which was erected in <hi>Boulline haven</hi> and after batterie of 20000 shot or more the breach was thought reasonable and therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the assault was giuen. But the same was so well encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the valour of the defendants, helped with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of place, that the obstinacy of the assaila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts did nothing but increase their losse, so as the first fury being broken and spent, The <hi>French</hi> resolued to attempt the peice no more by assault, notwithstanding they continued the seige, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented diuers skermishes &amp; false attempts, but they spent both their labour &amp; shot without putting the defendants in any feare. Then they planted their artillery against the mouth of the hauen, to impeach supply of victualls to the towne. Yet the <hi>English</hi> victualers surceased not at the <hi>Kings</hi> adventure to bring all things necessary, vntill the end the souldiers of the towne set vpon the <hi>French</hi> sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly by night, slue many of them and dismounted their pieces.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>French</hi> applied their batterie againe, wherein they sometimes spent 1500 shot in one day. But finding this to be a fruitlesse fury they afterwards vsed it more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly and rather vpon a shew of hostility then vpon any hope thereby to prevaile. In the meane season they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a galley with grauel and stones, and prepared to sinke it in the middest of the hauen. But the <hi>English</hi> tooke the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4095:48"/>
galley before it sunke and drew it to the shoare, and vsed the stones to reenforce the Pierre. After this they made faggots of light matter, mixed with pitch, tarre, tallow, rosin, powder, and wildfire, with intention to fire the ships in the hauen, but that enterprise was defeated by the <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenois,</hi> and their fagots taken from the <hi>French.</hi> During these enterfeits diverse skirmishes passed betweene the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> about the frontires of <hi>Calleis,</hi> which as they were but light, so most of them ended with disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the <hi>French.</hi>

            <p>And now if all these troubles had not beene sufficient to trauaile the realme of <hi>England,</hi> at once a great diuision fell among the nobility, so much the more dangerous, by how much the spirits were more actiue and high.

               </gap> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelme the whole realme with disquiet, and here of the most apparent originall was this.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> had two vnkles brothers to <hi>Queene Iaue</hi> his deceased mother, <hi>Edward D. of Somerset Lord Protector, &amp; Thomas Lord Seymer Baron of Sudley,</hi> high <hi>Admirall</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Duke</hi> was elder in yeares, so was hee more staied in behauiour. The <hi>Lord Sudley</hi> was fierce in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, courtly in fashion, in personage stately, in voice mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, but somewhat empty of matter, both were so faithfully affected to the <hi>King</hi> that the one might well bee termed his sword, the other his target. The <hi>Duke</hi> was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test in fauour with the people, the <hi>Lord Sudley</hi> most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected by the nobility, both highly esteemed by the <hi>King,</hi> both fortunate alike in their advancements, both ruined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like by their owne vanity and folly, whilest these two brothers held in amity, they were like two armes, the one defending the other, and both of them the <hi>King,</hi> but many things did moue together to dissolue their loue and bring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4095:49"/>
them to ruine. First their contrary disposition, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tractable and milde, the other stiffe and impatient of a superior, whereby they liued but in cunning concord as brothers glued together but not vnited in graine, then much secret enuy was borne against them, for that their new lustre did dimme the light of men honoured with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient nobility. Lastly they where openly minded, as hasty and soone moued, so vncircumspect and easy to be minded. By these the knot not only of loue but of nature between them was dissolued, so much the more pitty for that the first cause proceeded from the pride, the haughty hate, the vnquiet vanity of a mannish or rather of a diuelish wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Lord Sudley</hi> had taken to wife <hi>Katharine Parre Queene Dowager</hi> last wife to <hi>King Henry the</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, A woman beautified with many excellent vertues, especially with humility the beauty of all other vertues. The <hi>Duke</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to wife <hi>Anne Stanhope</hi> a woman for many imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons intollerable, but for pride monstrous, she was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both subtle and violent in accomplishing her ends, for which she spurned ouer all respects both of conscience and of shame. This woman did beare such invincible hate, first against the <hi>Q. Dowager</hi> for light causes and womans quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells, especially for that she had precedency of place before her, being wife to the greatest Peere in the land, then to the <hi>Lord Sudley</hi> for her sake. That albeit the <hi>Q. Dowager</hi> dyed by childbirth, yet would not her malice either dye or decrease. But continually she rubbed into the <hi>Dukes</hi> dull capacity, that the <hi>Lord Sudley</hi> dissenting from him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of religion, sought nothing more then to take away his life, as well in regard of the common cause of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as thereby happely to attaine his place. Many other things she boldly fained being assured of easie beliefe in her heedlesse hearer, alwaies fearfull and suspitious (as of feeble spirit) but then more then euer by reason of some late opposition against him. Her perswasions she cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4095:49"/>
intermixed with teares, affirming that she would depart from him, as willing rather to heare both of his disgraces and dangers, then either to see the one or participate of the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> embracing this womans counsaile (a womans counsaile indeede and nothing the better) yeelded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe both to aduise and deuise for destruction of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>Earle</hi> of Warwicke had his finger in the businesse and drew others also to giue either furtherance or way to her violent desires. Being well content she should haue her minde, so as the <hi>Duke</hi> might thereby incurre infamy and hate. Herevpon the <hi>Lord Sudley</hi> was arrested and sent to the tower, and in very short time after condemned by act of parliament. And within few daies after his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation a warrant was sent vnder the hande of his brother the <hi>Duke,</hi> whereby his head was deliuered to the Axe. His owne fierce courage hastened his death, because e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ballanced betweene doubt and disdaine, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous rather to dye at once, then to linger long vpon cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie and in feare.</p>
            <p>The accusations against him contained much friuolous matter, or terme them pittifull if you please. The act of parliament expresseth these causes of his attaindor. For attempting to get into his custody the person of the <hi>King,</hi> and gouernment of the realme. For making much prouision of mony and of victualls, for endeauouring to marry the <hi>Lady Elizabeth</hi> the Kings sister, for persuadinge the <hi>Kinge</hi> in his tender age to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the Rule &amp; order of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: The proofes might easily be made because he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer called to his answeare. But aswell the protestations at the point of his death, as the open course &amp; carriage of his life cleered him in opinion of many. So doubtfull are all weighty matters whilest some take all they heare for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, others making question of any truths, posterity enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging both D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Latymer</hi> pretending all the grauity and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of a professed diuine, yet content to be seruiceable

And because the worke could not be ther with finished, the cloister of <hi>Paules</hi> on the north side of the church in a place called <hi>Pardonne church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yearde and the dance of death,</hi> very curiously wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cloister, and a chappell that stood in the midst of the church-yeard, also the charnell house that stood vpon the south side of <hi>Paules</hi> (now a carpenters yeard) with the chappell tombes and monuments therein were beaten downe, the bones of the dead carried into <hi>Finsbury</hi> fields and the stones conuerted to his building.

            <p>And now hath the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> played the first act of the tragedie of his life, namely his high and prosperous estate, he is now stopping into the second act, wherein he beginneth mainly to decline.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Earle of Warwicke</hi> espying opportunity shewing him selfe and knowing that in troublesome times the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of great persons is most easily shaken, drew about 18 of the priuy counsaile to knit with him against the <hi>Lord</hi>

They were all desirous that the <hi>Protectors</hi> greatnesse should be taken lower, but none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that the <hi>Earles</hi> malice did extend vnto death. But the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> as humble then as he had beene haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before sent secretary <hi>Peeter</hi> to them in the <hi>Kings</hi> name to vnderstand the causes of their assembly, and to declare vnto them that he would thanke them for hating him in case they did it in loue to the King, intreating them for the Kings sake if not for his safetie yet for his quiet, that they would forbeare open shew of hostility and resort vnto him peaceably that they might commune together as friends. In the meane time he armed 500 men parte of the kings &amp; parte his owne, the court gates were rampard and people raised both by letters and proclamation to aide the King, and the more to encrease the present terror he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued the king by mightfro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>On the other side the <hi>Lords</hi> at <hi>London</hi> first taking pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the <hi>tower</hi> sent for the <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> of the citty to the <hi>Earle of Warwicks</hi> lodging at <hi>Ely</hi> house in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi> here they presented themselues secretly armed, and the <hi>Lord Rich</hi> then <hi>Lord Chancellor of England,</hi> a man of quicke and liuely deliuery of speech, but as of meane birth so prone to thrust forwards the ruine of great persons, in this manner spake vnto them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am not ignorant into what aduenture I now plunge my selfe in speaking against a man both high in honour and great in fauour both with the</hi> King <hi>and many of the people. But my duty prevailing against respect of danger, I will plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the discontentments of the Lords of his Maiesties coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile, haue already conceiued against the actions past of the</hi> Lorde Protector, <hi>as also their fears touching matters to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:4095:51"/>
               <hi>that with your aide they may in good time happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the one and remoue the other, assuring you all that as I will not vtter any thing falsly, so will I forbeare to tell many truths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And first to touch vpon his open ambition, with what good reason or purpose thinke wee did he being a man of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imperfections, as want of eloquence, personage, learning, or good wit aspire to the great offices of gouerning all affaires of state, sit for none but whom God hath fauoured with fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting graces. And albeit these defects might haue beene well supplied by sufficiency of others of the counsaile, yet was hee so peeuishly opiniatiue and proud, that he would neither aske nor heare the advice of any, but was absolutely ruled by the obstinate and imperous woman his wife, whose ambitious and mischieuous will so guided him in the most weighty affaires of the realme, that albeit he was counsailed by others what was best, yet would he doe quite contrary, least he should seeme to need their aduice, And yet this was not enough, as auarice and ambition haue neuer enough, but to adde dignity to authority, and to make sure that as no man should as in power so in title surmount him, he would be aduanced to the Degree of</hi> Duke of Somerset, <hi>which hath alwaies beene a title for one of the kings sonns inheritable to the crowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And albeit it may seeme a light matter to speake of bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and extortion against him, yet his robberies and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions haue beene such, that no man would willingly haue adventured to commit them, vnlesse he thought by treason so to assure himselfe as he could not be called to answere for them. For he hath laid his rauenous hands vpon the</hi> Kings <hi>treasure and Iewels left by his Father, which were knowne to be of an inestimable value, that it might well be said euen as he had giuen forth, that</hi> K. Henry <hi>died a very poore prince, and had beene vtterly shamed in case he had liued one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a yeare longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then also what hauocke hath he made of the</hi> Kings <hi>lands and inheritance? What sales and exchanges vpon pretence of</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:4095:52"/>
               <hi>necessity? And yet what a high deale hath he transported to himselfe? Without regard of others who haue emploied their trauailes &amp; estates in seruice of the</hi> King <hi>&amp; of his deceased Father? What artes hath he vsed to spend those &amp; spare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against the time of his mischievous purpose. How greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how insatiably hath he neuer ceased the whilest to rake &amp; gleane mony together? What shamefull sale of offices &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments hath he made, nothing regarding the worthinesse of the person, but the worth and weight of the gift. Betraying thereby the administration of the realme into the hands both of worthlesse and corrupt men. To speake nothing the whilest of his minte at</hi> Duresme place <hi>erected &amp; vsed for his priuate profit. To speake nothing of the great Boutisale of colledges and chantries, to speake nothing of all his other particular pillages, all which were so farre from satisfying his bottomles desires that he proceeded to fleece the whole Commonwealth, to cut and pare it to the very quicke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For vnder colour of warre, which either his negligence drew on or his false practises procured, he leuied such a subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vpon the whole realme as neuer was asked a greater at once, which should not haue needed, albeit the warres had beene iust, in case he had not imbereled the</hi> Kings <hi>treasure as he did, for besides he extorted money by way of loane from all men who were supposed to haue it, and yet left the</hi> Kings <hi>souldiers and servants vnpaid. But in all these pretended ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, how profuse was he in his priuate expences? Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe rather as fitting his owne greatnesse then the common good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How did he riot surfeit vpon vaine hopes, as if new supply for wast would neuer want? What treasures did he bury in his sumptuous buildings? And how foolish and fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full were they? A fit man forsooth to gouerne a realme, who had so goodly gouernment in his owne estate. All these things as there are but few but know, so we may be assured that hee neuer durst haue committed halfe of them with a minde to haue remained a subiect vnder the law, and to be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his actions afterwards, but did manifestly intend to</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:4095:52"/>
               <hi>heape his mischiefs with so high a treason as he might climbe aboue his soveraigne and stand sure beyond reach of law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for inducement to this his traiterous designe he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned his seruants and certaine preachers to spread abroad the praises of his government, with as much abasing the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> King Henry <hi>as without impudence they could deuise. Following therein the practises of</hi> K. Richard <hi>the tyrant, by deprauing the Father to honour the sonne, to extinguish the loue of the people to the young</hi> King, <hi>by remembring some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of his Father; which example both traiterous and vnnaturall who doubts but his heart was ready to follow, whose heart was ready to defame his father, and set nought by his mother (as it is well knowne) and to procure, yea labour the death of his brother, whom albeit the law and consent of many had condemned vpon his owne speeches yet his earnest endeauor therein did well declare what thoughts can sinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his vnnaturall breast, &amp; what foule shifts he would haue made, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that his brother should haue escaped death, to that end that he might remoue at once both an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his poysenous purposes &amp; a surety to the</hi> Kings <hi>life &amp; estate. To this ende he also practised to dispatch such of the nobility as were like to oppose against his mischeiuous drift, &amp; in such sort either to encumber &amp; weaken the rest, that they should be noe impediments to him. In the meane time he endeauored to winne the common people both by strayned cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy &amp; by loosenes of life, whereto he gaue not only licence, but encouragement and meanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the better to advance his intents he deviseth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the realme not only with outward warre that with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor thereof his dangerous diuices might be obscured, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> but with inward sedition by stirring and nourishing discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments among the nobility gentry and commons of the realme. This he did vnder pretence of such matters as all men desired might be redressed more gladly then hee, but in a more quiet and setled time. But the time seemed most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for him when vnder the sweete pretence of release and</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:4095:53"/>
               <hi>libertie to the people might haue destroied the Nobility and gentry, who are the defence and safety of the people, and so at pleasure haue reduced all vnder his tyrannous subiection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which how insupportable it would haue beene may well be coniectured by his actions already past, what pride and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his men made vp of naught? What instruments had he in euery shire to worke his purposes, to spread his rumors, to harken and to carry tales? And those what flatterers? What lyers? How greedily gaping for other mens liuings? How vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant to grope mens thoughts, and to picke out somewhat whereof they might complaine? and such vile vermine how deere were they to him? and namely</hi> Iohn Bonham <hi>his one hand in Wiltshire,</hi> Sir Gyles Partridge <hi>his other hand in</hi> Glocestershire, <hi>his customer in</hi> Wells, Piers <hi>country, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in</hi> Deuonshire, <hi>besides many his bad conditioned mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in courte, what monsters were they? How esteemed they his fauour aboue all mortall respects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further to accomplish his ambitious ends, he devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make the</hi> French king <hi>his friend, by bewraying vnto him the</hi> Kings <hi>fortresses beyond the seas, which the late noble</hi> K. Henry <hi>with great charge courage and glory, had brought vnder his power, which practise was so caryed, that no man but such as discerned nothing but did perceiue it. And that aswell by his often private conference with the</hi> French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors <hi>and their secretaries, as by failing to furnish those pieces with necessarie supplies, as also by the speeches which himselfe and his servants cast abroad, that</hi> Bulloine <hi>and the fortresses about it were an vnprofitable burthen to the realme. But for the charge no man will conceiue that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted money to keepe them, who vndertooke so great a charge as the conquest of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and wasted euery day a</hi> 100<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Besides it hath beene often heard from his owne communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, how he intended to procure a resignation of the rights of the</hi> Kings Maiesties sisters, <hi>and others who are entitled to the possession of the Crowne, and to haue entailed the same</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:4095:53"/>
               <hi>vpon his owne issue, which when he had effected, and hauing the</hi> Kings <hi>person in his power, the chaine of soueraignty could not long haue tied him short, he might haue atchieued all his ambitious intentions at will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore surely he hath thus put on the person not only of a robber, and of a murtherer, but of a traitor to the state, since we haue euidently discouered both his lofty and bloody minde. It behoueth you to ioyne in aide with the</hi> Lords <hi>of his Maiesties privy counsaile, as in extinguishing a raging fire, as in repelling a cruell enimie, for assuredly wee must either weakly yeelde to his rule and commande, or else the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous author must be taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the afternoone of the same day the <hi>Lord Maior</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled a common counsaile in <hi>Guildhall,</hi> where two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters arriued almost in one instant, one from the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> for 1000 men to be armed for defence of the <hi>Kings</hi> person, another from the <hi>Lords</hi> at <hi>London</hi> for 2000 men to aide them in defence of the <hi>Kings</hi> person, both parties pretending alike, but both intending nothing lesse. The <hi>Recorder</hi> whose voice accordeth commonly with the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> did so well set forth the complaints of the <hi>Lords</hi> against the <hi>Protector,</hi> that many were inclinable to fauour their side. But one named <hi>George Stadlowe</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better aduised stept vp and spake vnto them as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This businesse (right Honorable Lord Maior &amp; the residue of this court) as it is a very high passage of state, so it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of serious consideration, &amp; that vpon sodeine aduice no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done or determined them, least happely by being ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the designes of other men whose purposes we know not, we cast our selues into the throat of danger which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wee doe not see, two things I much feare in case wee afford present aide to the Lords, either of which should cast vpon vs a bridle rather for stopping a while, then for stepping or stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring too soone or too fast at their incitement. One is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dangers of the citty, the other the vncertaine aduenture</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:4095:54"/>
               <hi>of all the realme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First then if wee adioine to the Lords, whether they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile or not wee engulph our selues into assured danger, an example whereof I finde in Fabian whose report I entreat you all to obserue. In the time of</hi> King Henry <hi>the third, the Lords in a good cause for maintenance of divers beneficiall lawes desired aide of the citty ogainst the King. Ayde was granted and the quarrell brought to the arbitrement of the sword. In this battaile the King and his son <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e were taken prisoners, &amp; vpon their enlargement free pardon was granted not only to the Lords but the cittizens of London which was afterwards confirmed both by oath and by act of Parliament. But what followed? Was the displeasure forgotten? Noe verily, nor euer forgotten during that Kings life, for afterwards the liberties of the Citty were taken away, strangers were appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and the cittizens perpetually vexed, both in their persons and in their estates. So heauy and durable is the wrath of</hi> Kings. <hi>That</hi> Solomon <hi>saith: The indignation of the</hi> King <hi>is death. For it is naturall for princes to vphold their sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and to holde it in highest esteeme, in no case to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure their supreame authority to be forceably either oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or dispressed by their subiects. Insomuch as they mortally hate such subiects as haue once attempted either to ouerrule them by power, or to cast any terror vpon them. And howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they may be either constrained or content to beare saile for a time, yet are they so sure paymasters in the end, that few haue held out their liues, I will not say prosperously but safely, who haue offered enforcements against their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now touching my seare for the commonwealth, I much suspect these considerations. I alwaies expect from them some lurking mischiefe, which the more cunningly it be kept in, the more dangerously it will breake forth. For albeit there be many hands in this action, yet one is the head who doubtlesse hath skille to play his owne game, and albeit the pretences giuen forth are alwaies faire, and for the publique good, yet are the secret intentions commonly ambitions, &amp; only aime at</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:4095:54"/>
               <hi>priuate ends, yea many times the end is worse then the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Because when a subiect hath obtained the hand against his prince, I will not say he will be loath, but doubtlesse it is not safe for him to giue ouer his advantage, wherefore I am of opinion, that for the present if wee will not be so vneurteous as to delay, and suspend our giuing aide to the Lords for a time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon this aduice the <hi>courte</hi> resolued to arme 100 horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and 400 foote for defence of the Citty. To the King they returned answere that they would be ready vpon any necessity to apply all their forces either for his defence or for his honour. But they intreated him to bee pleased to heare such complaints as were obiected against the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> before he assembled forces in the field, which in those tempestuous times as it could not be done without great danger, so without great cause it should not: To the Lords they answered that they were ready to ioyne with them in any dutifull petition to the <hi>King,</hi> but to ioyne with them in armes, they could not vpon the sodaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue.</p>
            <p>The next day the <hi>Lordes</hi> at <hi>London</hi> dispatched a letter to the <hi>Lords</hi> at <hi>Windesore,</hi> wherein they charged the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector with many disorders both in his priuate actions, and in his manner of gouernment, requiring that hee would disperse the sorces which he had raised, and withdraw himselfe from the King, and be content to be ordered by iustice and reason. That this done they would gladly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with the rest of the counsaile for the surety of the Kings person, and for ordering of his estate, otherwise they would make no other accompt of them then they might trust to finde cause, and would assuredly charge them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their demerits.</p>
            <p>The King all this time was so farre from gouerning his Lords, that he was scarce at his owne liberty, and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the late rebellions had but newly weared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into quiet, and fearing new rages among the vnstabie

But neither did hee returne to <hi>Windesore,</hi> neither was any answere returned from the <hi>Lordes.</hi> After this he wrote two letters, one in his owne name to the <hi>Earle of Warwicke,</hi> the other in the name of the <hi>Lords</hi> at <hi>Windesore</hi> to the <hi>Lords</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> in both which he so weakly complained, expostulated, intreated, yeelded vnder their hande, as it was sufficient to haue breathed courage into any enimy once declared against him.</p>

That hereupon the <hi>Lords</hi> of the counsaile for preuenting aswell present dangers to the <hi>Kings</hi> person, as the vtter subuersion of the state of the realme, concluded to haue talked to him quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without disturbance to the King, or to the people, for reducing him to liue within reasonable limits, and for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting order for safety of the kings person, and preseruation of the commonwealth of the realme, and so to haue passed ouer his most vnnaturall and trait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Instantly after the publishing of this proclamation the Lords directed their letters to <hi>Windesore,</hi> ond addressed to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4095:57"/>
the <hi>King,</hi> another to the <hi>Protector,</hi> the third to the <hi>houshold</hi> which was openly read. The letter to the <hi>Protector</hi> was guilded ouer with many smooth words intimating faire promises and full of hope, but the other two did fully and fowly set forth his obstinacie, his auarice his ambition, his rash engagements into warres, in the <hi>Kings</hi> vnsetled, both age and estate, his negligences, his deceits, and all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiences mentioned before.

               <hi>Robert Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> captaine of the guarde was sent from the <hi>Lords</hi> to <hi>Windesore</hi> who so well persuaded the <hi>King</hi> both of the loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all affection of the <hi>Lordes</hi> towards him and of their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate desires against the protector (who then was in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence) that partly thereby but chiefly in regard of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent times the <hi>Protector</hi> was remoued from the <hi>Kings</hi> person, &amp; a guard set vpon him vntill the next day, when the <hi>Lords</hi> at <hi>London</hi> were appointed to be there.</p>

            <p>To this I make no other defence, but intreat the reader not to condemne him for perishing so weakly, and for that he who should haue lost his life to preserue his honour, cast away both his life and honour together. Assuredly he was a man of a feeble stomacke, vnable to concoct any great fortune prosperous or aduerse. But as the iudgement of God, and malice of a man concurre often in one act, although it be easie to discerne betweene them; so is it lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be maruailed, that he who thirsted after his brothers blood, should finde others to thirst after his; Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing for that present his blood was respited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but hee was stripped of his great offices of being <hi>Prote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

neuer intend to contend with them nor any action to iustifie himselfe, as well for that he was none of the wisest and might easily erre; as for that it is scarce possible for any man in great place so to beare himselfe, that all his actions in the eye of iustice shall be blamelesse; so hee did then submit himselfe wholly to the Kings mercy, and their discretions for some moderation; desiring them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that what he did amisse was rather through rudenes, and for want of iudgement, then from any malitious meaning, and that he was therefore ready both to doe and suffer what they would appoint. Finally hee did againe most humbly vpon his knees entreat pardon, and fauour, and they should euer finde him so lowly to their honours, and obedient to their orders, as hee would thereby make amends for his former follies.</p>
            <p>These subiections, obiections, deiections of the <hi>Duke</hi> made a heauenly harmony in his enimies eares. But they wrought such compassion with the King, that forthwith he was released out of the Tower, his fines discharged, his goods and lands restored, except such as had beene giuen away, either the malice of the <hi>Lords</hi> being somewhat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, or their credit not of sufficient strength to resist, within a short time after he was entertained and feasted by the King with great shew of fauour, and sworne againe of the priuy counsaile, at which time betweene him and the <hi>Lords</hi> perfect amity was made, or else a dissembling hate And that all might appeare to be knit vp in a comicall conclusion, the <hi>Dukes</hi> daughter was afterwards ioined in marriage to the <hi>Lord L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Many secret conferences they had at their seuerall houses, which often held the greatest part of the night. But they accustomed to afford at other times either silence, or shorte assent to what he did propose, did then fall off and forsake him, procuring thereby danger to themselues without doing good to any other. For when the <hi>Earle of Warwicke</hi> could by no meanes draw them to his desires, hee found means that both of them were discharged from the counsell, and commanded to their houses. Against the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> obiections were framed that he tooke away bolts and locks at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and gaue away the Kings stuffe.

Diuers like attempts were made in other places, but the authors were not so readily followed by the people as others had done before.

dislodge the <hi>French,</hi> or otherwise to annoy them. But the <hi>French</hi> perceiuing that the troubles in <hi>England</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly appeased, and that the <hi>King</hi> thereby was much strengthened in his estate, for that the vicious humors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him were either corrected or spent, finding also that he daily grew rather into admiration then loue, aswell for that it was apparant, that hee had so well improued that little stocke which his father left, as he was like to proue a thriuer in the end, also weary in maintaining warres with <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well in regard of the charge, as for that his people were nothing desirous of seruice in that distant country. Lastly hauing tried aswell the strength as curtesy of the <hi>English</hi> nation, and doubtfull of the estates of the empire and of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by whom not only the wings of his Kingdome had beene clipped on euery side, but the whole body thereof dangerously attempted, he resolued to fasten peace with <hi>England</hi> if he could.</p>
            <p>Herevpon he dispatched to the <hi>English</hi> court <hi>Guidolti</hi> an <hi>Italion</hi> borne in <hi>Florence</hi> who made many ouertures to the <hi>Lords</hi> of the counsaile, but all as from the <hi>Cunstable</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and espying with a nimble eye that matters of consaile were chiesly swayed by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> by great gifts and gretter hopes he wrought him to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to his desires. In the end it was concluded that <hi>foure Embassadors</hi> should be sent from the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land into France,</hi> and foure from the <hi>French King</hi> to treat with them that the <hi>English</hi> commissioners should come to <hi>Guisnes</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Arde,</hi> and that their meeting should be chiefly at <hi>Guisnes.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> yeelding to all with sincerity of minde, the <hi>French</hi> accepting all but with intentions reserued to themselues. The <hi>Lords</hi> appointed by the <hi>English</hi> were <hi>Iohn Earle</hi> of <hi>Bedforde, William Lord Paget, St</hi>

was made <hi>Lord</hi> great M<hi rend="sup">•</hi> another feather to his mounting minde.</p>
            <p>The day wherein the <hi>English Embassadors arriued</hi> at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luis, Guidolti</hi> resorted vnto them with a letter from <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier Rochpot</hi> whereby he signified that the <hi>French</hi> intended not to come to <hi>Arde,</hi> but desired that the <hi>English</hi> would goe to <hi>Bouline,</hi> and that the meeting might be besides the Towne. For this he alleadged that he was so weakly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in health that he could not trauaile farre, and that he being Gouernor of <hi>Picardie</hi> and <hi>Chastilion</hi> of <hi>Newha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi> they might not depart such distance from their charge, and further that there must be much wast of time if the <hi>English</hi> should lye at <hi>Guisnes</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Ardes,</hi> and that the equality would be more, and the dishonour to one of the sides lesse, if the enterview should be vpon the <hi>Frontires,</hi> then if one part should be drawen into the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the other.</p>
            <p>Vpon this rubbe the <hi>English Embassadors</hi> thought fit to demurre, and so sent into <hi>England</hi> to receiue directions from the <hi>Lords</hi> of the counsaile. They againe referred the matter wholly to the iudgement of the <hi>Embassadors,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that it was a circumstance not much to bee stood vpon in case it were not vpon some sinenesse, but for ease and commodity of them and their traine, which indeed they might better finde neere <hi>Bouline</hi> then at <hi>Ardes,</hi> in case also they could discerne no deepe inconuenience which might hinder the good issue of the good busines in hande, which they esteemed sufficient if in substance it might be effected, albeit in all points they had not so much of their mindes, as they then desired, and as at another time they would expect, and so the <hi>English</hi> Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners went to <hi>Bouline,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> came to one of their forts neerest to <hi>Bouline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long before the <hi>Emperour</hi> had beene assailed by the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to aide him in defence of <hi>Bouline</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>French,</hi> which he expresly refused, alleaging
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4095:62"/>
that he was not bound so to doe by conditions of the league. For that <hi>Bouline</hi> was a piece of new conquest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the <hi>English</hi> since the league was made, then the <hi>King</hi> offered to yeelde the Towne absolutely into his hands in case he would maintaine it against the <hi>French,</hi> which offer also he refused to accept. At the arriuall of the <hi>English</hi> embassadors the souldiers were sharply assailed with wants. There was not one drop of beere in the Towne. The bread and breadcorne sufficed not for six daies. Herevpon the souldiers entred into proportion, and to giue them example the <hi>Lord Clinton</hi> being <hi>Lord Deputie</hi> limited himselfe to a loafe a day. The <hi>King</hi> was indebted in those parts aboue 14000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> besides for the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dons</hi> numbers which were about 1300 foote, besides al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the increases daily rising, for the monethly pay of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and strangers amounted to 6000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> besides allowance for officers. Hereof the band of horsemen out of <hi>Germany</hi> tooke little lesse then 800<hi rend="sup">l</hi> the moneth, and the <hi>Almains</hi> on foote 4000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> accounting the gulden at 3<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, but account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more, as without a higher valuation little seruice &amp; happily some mischiefe might be expected, the monethly pay to strangers amounted higher. Hereby a great error was discouered, in that the strangers for defence of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine</hi> were of greater strength then were the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>English</hi> commissioners hauing first procured some releife both for victualls &amp; pay, prepared a tent without the towne for meeting with the <hi>French.</hi> But they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> erected a house on the further side of the water within their owne territory, in a manner halfe way betweene their forte and the towne. The <hi>English</hi> perswaded the <hi>French</hi> to surcease their building, pretending but for their fantasies it was not necessarie, because neither their treaty was like to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long neither was it by solemne meeting that the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse in hand must be effected. But in truth they feared least if peace should not follow, the <hi>French</hi> might in short time either with filling or massing the house, or else by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4095:63"/>
make such a piece as might annoy the hauen or the towne. Notwithstanding the <hi>French</hi> not only procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but refused any other place of enteruiew.</p>
            <p>At their first meeting much time was spent in ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of salutation. Then the commissions were read, then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>de Mortier</hi> in a sharpe speech declared that the <hi>French King</hi> their M<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had vpon iust grounds entred the warre for recouery of his right, and defence of his allies, yet was he well minded for an honourable peace, so as the things for which the warre began, might be brought to some reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable appointment; and hearing of the like disposition of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> he had sent them to treat of those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, nothing doubting but that the <hi>English</hi> would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to the restitution of <hi>Bouline,</hi> and other pieces of their late conquest, which so long as they should keepe, so long they may be assured the warre would continue. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added that <hi>Bouline</hi> was but a bare ruinous Towne, without territory or any other commodity to ballance the charge of defending it against the power of <hi>France.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he said there should want no good will in them to bring matters to good appointment, hopeing to finde the like affection in the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that the <hi>English</hi> commissioners had conferred a while, the <hi>Lord Paget</hi> answered that the causes of the warre both with them and their <hi>Allies</hi> (whom he tooke to be the <hi>Scots</hi>) being iust and honourable. The towne of <hi>Bouline</hi> &amp; other pieces subdued aswell by their late great master against them, as by the <hi>K.</hi> their then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> against their <hi>Allies</hi> were acquired by iust title of victory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in keeping of them no iniury was offered, either to the <hi>French King,</hi> or to the <hi>Scots.</hi> But the further declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee left off vntill their next meeting, because both the time was spent and the tide summoned them to departe. Touching the good inclination of the <hi>King</hi> their M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> hee had declared it well by sending them thither, in whom they should fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e such good conformity, that if good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4095:63"/>
ensued, not the fault should be which they expected not in the <hi>French.</hi> Nothing else was done sauing a surcease of hostility concluded for 15 daies, which was proclaimed in both the frontires.</p>
            <p>At the next meeting the <hi>Lord Paget</hi> spent much speech in setting forth the <hi>King of Englands</hi> title to <hi>Bulloine</hi> and to his debts and pension from the <hi>French king,</hi> with all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerages; together with the iustice of his warre against the <hi>Scots.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> were as earnest in maintaining the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, wanting no words whatsoeuer their reasons were. For betweene great Princes, the greatest strength carrieth the greatest reason. At the last M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>de Mortier</hi> roundly said that to cut off all contentions of words, he would propose two means for peace. All that for old matters of pensions, debts and arrerages, the <hi>English</hi> should make white books and neuer mention them more, but for <hi>Bulloine</hi> to set the higher value, (or else said he) let old quarrells remaine, so as your right may be reserued to clime, and ours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende. And let vs speake frankly of some recompence for <hi>Boulloine.</hi> As for the <hi>Scottish Queene.</hi> (For this had beene also mentioned before) our <hi>King</hi> is resolued to keepe her for his sonne and therefore we desire you to speake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no more, but of what other points you please, so as we may draw shortly to an end.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Paget</hi> answered for the other commissioners that they had greatest reason to desire a speedy end, but the matters whereupon they stood were of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance then to be determined vpon the sodaine. For said he you may make doubts as you please. But if the debt to our King be not iust, being confessed, iudged, sworne, and by many treaties confirmed, wee know not what may be deemed iust, neither is it a summe to be slenderly regarded being 2000000 crownes cleere debt, besides 12000 crowns resting in dispute. The iustice of the warres against <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he maintained aswell in regarde of breach of treatise with themselues as for that contrarie to their comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4095:64"/>
in the last treaty of <hi>France</hi> they had inuaded <hi>England</hi> in these entercourses, the whole afternoone being spent, it was agreed that both parties should advise vpon such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as had beene propounded vntill the next meeting.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>French</hi> either hauing or supposing that they had aduantage ouer the <hi>English</hi> partly by reason of their firme intelligence in the <hi>English</hi> court, and partly because they found the <hi>English</hi> commissioners much yeelding to their desires, as first in cumming into <hi>France,</hi> then to <hi>Bouline,</hi> lastly to a house of their owne erecting began to be stiffe and almost intractable, sharpely pressing both for speedie resolution and short times for meetings But <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolti</hi> continually trauailed to draw both parties to confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the <hi>French</hi> being willing to be entreated by their friend to their most dissembled desires. <hi>Guidol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in steed of the <hi>Queene of Scots</hi> propounded that the <hi>French kings</hi> daughter should bee ioyned in marriage to the King of <hi>England,</hi> affirming that if it were a drie peace, it would hardly be durable, but hereto the <hi>English</hi> gaue no inclinable care. Then he deliuered 17 rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in writing, for which he said it was necessarie for the <hi>English</hi> to conclude a peace. The <hi>English</hi> demanded how many reasons he had for the <hi>French;</hi> he answered that he had also his reasons for them, which he intended likewise to deliuer in writing.</p>
            <p>At the next meeting the <hi>French</hi> shewed themselues as before peremptory and precise, standing stifly vpon their owne ouertures, which they had they said no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to exceede, and therefore they refused to treat ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the pension or debt demanded by the <hi>English,</hi> and declared themselues rather desirous then willing to breake off the treaty. The <hi>English</hi> answered that before their comming <hi>Guidolti</hi> had declared from the <hi>French</hi> King that so as Bulloine might be rendred, all that was owing from him to the King of <hi>England</hi> should be paid, which <hi>Guidolti</hi> being present affirmed to be true; well said they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4095:64"/>
what our King told <hi>Guidolti</hi> we know not, but to vs hee hath giuen no other commission then you haue heard, which in no case wee must exceede. As for the pension whereof you speake, thinke you that a King of France will be tributary to any? No, No, assure you he will not, and touching the debt because the K. of <hi>England</hi> gaue occasion to the warres wasted the <hi>French</hi> Kings countrey, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by caused him to expend such summes of mony as exceeded the debt, he tooke himselfe to be acquitted thereof.</p>
            <p>Hereto the <hi>English</hi> answered that the <hi>French</hi> King might take matters as he pleased, but in honour iustice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science no debt was more due, and the warres being made for deniall thereof, he could not be for that cause acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. That the pension was also granted vpon diuers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses both weighty and iust, and amongst other by reason of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> vncontrouleable title to <hi>Normandie Gascoine</hi> and other parts of <hi>France.</hi> Here they were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Rotchpot,</hi> who brake forth into warme words, and was againe as warmely answered, but the <hi>French</hi> would nothing moue from their owne ouertures which they stood vpon by way of conclusions.</p>
            <p>At the last the <hi>English</hi> said that they might doe well to report these differences to their <hi>Masters</hi> on both sides &amp; that their pleasures might therein be knowne. Hereto the <hi>French</hi> answered that they knew their Kings pleasures so well, that if they should send to him againe, he would and might thinke them of small discretion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and herewith they offered to breake. The <hi>English</hi> told them that if they would breake they might, but they intended to conclude nothing vntill they had further instructions from <hi>England;</hi> which they would procure as soone as they could. To this the <hi>French</hi> did easily incline.</p>
            <p>These matters aduertised into <hi>England</hi> much troubled the counsaile, and the rather for that the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> was at that time retired, pretending much infirmity in his health. Hereupon many sinister surmises began to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4095:65"/>
spring vp among some of the counsaile, partly probable &amp; parte happely deuised, for as they knew not whether hee were more dangerous present or away; so as the nature of all feare is they suspected that which happened to be the worst. From hence diuerse of the counsaile began in this manner to murmure against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What said they is he neuer sicke, but when affaires of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test weight are in debating? Or wherefore else doth hee withdraw himselfe from the company of those who are not well assured of his loue? Wherefore doth he not now come forth and openly ouerrule, as in other matters hee is accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Would he haue vs imagine by his absence that he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing? Or knowing that all moueth from him, shall wee not thinke that he seeketh to enioy his owne ends, which bearing blame for any euent? Goe to then; let him come forth and declare himselfe, for it is better that should finde fault with all things whilest they are doing, then condemne all things when they are done; with those and the like spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he came to counsaile more ordinary then before, and at last partly by his reasons and partly by his authority, peace with France was esteemed so necessarie, that new instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were sent to the</hi> English <hi>Embassadors, according whereto peace was concluded vpon these articles.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>To these articles the <hi>French King</hi> was sworne at <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> Commissioners being especially appointed to take their oaths, and for further assurance 6 Hostages were deliuered for the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Ards</hi> and 6 for the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Guisnes,</hi> and it was agreed that at the deliuery of <hi>Bulloine</hi> the English hostages should be discharged, &amp; that vpon the paiment of the first 200000 crownes 3 of the <hi>French</hi> hostages should be discharged, and other 3 vpon paiment of the last 200000 crownes. In the peace the Emperor was comprised in case he would consent, and further to cut off future contentions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners were appointed both by the English and French to make certaine the limits betweene both territories.

Soone after the first paiment of money was made by the <hi>French</hi> to certaine English com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners wherevpon 3 of their hostages were dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the other three namely <hi>Count de Anguien</hi> next heire

to the crowne of <hi>France</hi> after the Kings children, the <hi>Marquis de Meaux</hi> brother to the <hi>Scottish Queene,</hi> and <hi>Montmorencie</hi> the constables sonne who at that time chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided the affaires of <hi>France,</hi> came into <hi>England.</hi> They were honourably accompanied and with great estate brought to <hi>London,</hi> where euery of them kept house by himselfe.</p>
            <p>Of the monies of the first paiment 10000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>Calais</hi> 8000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> 10000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> for the <hi>North,</hi> and 2000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> for the Nauie, the residue was earefully laid vp in the Tower. Likewise of the second paiment (wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hostages aforenamed returned into <hi>France</hi>) 8000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> was appointed for <hi>Calais</hi> 5000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> for the <hi>North<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 10000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> was emploied for enerease towards outward paiments, certaine persons vndertaking that the mony should bee doubled euery<note n="*" place="margin">Or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely yeare.</note> moneth, the residue was safely lodged in the tower.</p>
            <p>And now it remained that the chiefe actors in this peaee (whatsoeuer their aimes were) must be both honoured &amp; enriched with great rewards, &amp; first <hi>Guidolti</hi> the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the treaty was recompenced with knighthood, 1000 crownes rewards, 1000 crownes pension &amp; 250<hi rend="sup">c</hi> pensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his sonne. The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> was made generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the <hi>North,</hi> had 1000 markes land granted to him and 100 horsemen of the <hi>Kings</hi> charge. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Herbert</hi> his chiefe instrument was made president of <hi>Wales</hi> and had a grant of 500<hi rend="sup">l</hi> land, and thus whether immoderate fauours breed first vnthankfulnesse and afterwards hate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ambitious desires, or whether God so punisheth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate affections, it often happeneth that men are prone to raise those most who worke their ruine in the end. Also the Lord <hi>Clinton</hi> who had beene deputie of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loine</hi> was made <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> The captains and officers were rewarded with lands, leases, offices and annuities, the ordinary souldiers hauing all their pay, and a moneths pay ouer were sent into their countries, and great
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4095:66"/>
charge giuen that they should be well obserued, vntill they were quietly setled at home. The light horsemen &amp; men at armes were put vnder the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Northhamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> captaine of the <hi>Pensioners.</hi> All the guarde of <hi>Bulloine</hi> were committed to the <hi>Lord Admirall,</hi> The chiefe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines with 600 ordinaries were sent to strengthen the <hi>Frontires</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Lastly strangers were dispatched out of the realme, who after some idle expence of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp; time were likest to be forward either in beginning or in maintaining disorders.</p>
            <p>Presently after this agreement of peace. The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brunswicke</hi> sent to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to offer his seruice in the <hi>Kings</hi> warres with 10000 men of his bande, and to entreat a marriage with the <hi>Lady Mary</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> eldest sister. Answere was made touching his offer of aide, that the <hi>Kings</hi> warres were ended. And touching marriage with the <hi>Lady Mary</hi> that the King was in speech for her marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined without effect, he should fauourably be heard. Vpon this also the <hi>Emperors Embassadors</hi> did expostulate with the <hi>King</hi> that he had broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his league with the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> To this the <hi>King</hi> answered that because the <hi>Emperor</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his performances the <hi>King</hi> was enforced to prouide for himselfe. The <hi>Embassador</hi> desirous as it seemed to make a breach, demanded boldly that the <hi>Lady Mary</hi> should haue the free exercise of the masse. This did the King not only constantly deny, but herevpon sermons were encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at court and order taken that no man should haue any benefice from the King but first he should preach before him, and in short time after vnder pretence of preparing for sea matters 5000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> were sent to relieue Protestants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the seas, and further because the <hi>Emperor</hi> made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers streight lawes against those of the religion. Merchants were charged to forbeare their trade into <hi>Flanders</hi> so much as they could. So as it appeares, had some of the English nobility beene either lesse powerfull or more
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4095:67"/>
faithfull then they were, the King had eares enough and hands enough aswell at home as among good friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, either to haue maintained warres against the <hi>French</hi> or to haue reduced them to a more honourable peace.</p>
            <p>Warres being thus at good appointment, peaceable bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines was more seriously regarded, and whereas an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador</hi> arriued from <hi>Gostaue King</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> to knit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the King for entercourse of merchants. At last these articles were concluded.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 That if the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> sent <hi>Bullion</hi> into <hi>England</hi> he might carry away <hi>English</hi> commodities without custome.</item>
               <item>2 That he should carry <hi>Bullion</hi> to no other Prince.</item>
               <item>3 That if he sent Ozimus, steele, copper, &amp;c. he should pay custome for <hi>English</hi> commodities as an <hi>English</hi> man.</item>
               <item>4 That if he sent other merchandise he should haue free entercourse paying custome as a stranger.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The mint was set to worke so as it gained 24000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the King, which should beare his charges in <hi>Ireland</hi> and bring 10000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> to the treasure. 400 men were sent into <hi>Ireland</hi> and charge giuen that the lawes of <hi>England</hi> should there be administred, &amp; the mutinous be seuerely suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Verily it may seene strange that among all the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hurries in <hi>England, Ireland</hi> was then almost quiet. But besides that the King drew much people from thence for seruice in his warres, who happely would not haue remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned quiet at home, the gouernors at that time were men of such choice, that neither the nobility disdained to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure their commande, nor the inferior sort were suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to supply their wants.</p>
            <p>Further 20000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> weight was appointed to be made so much baser as the King might gaine thereby 160000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. Agreement was also made with <hi>Yorke</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of one of the mints, that he should receiue the profit of all the Bullion which himselfe should bring, and pay the Kings debts to the value of 120000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> and remaine accountable for the rest, paying six shillings 8d the ounce vntill the exchange were
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4095:67"/>
equall in <hi>Flanders</hi> and afterwards six shillings 8d and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he should declare his bargaine to any that should be appointed to ouersee him, and leaue off when the King should please, that for this the King should giue him 15000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> in prest, and license to transport 8000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> beyond the seas to abase the exchange. Herewith the base monies formerly coined were cried downe.</p>
            <p>Now it is certaine that by reason of the long hostility which <hi>England</hi> held against <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> peace was not so hardly concluded as kept. But albeit occasions of breach were often offered, yet the iudgement &amp; modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both parts sufficed either to auoide or apease them. The <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Glasco</hi> comming into <hi>England</hi> without safe conduct was taken prisoner. The <hi>French Embassador</hi> made means to the King for his discharge, but answere was made that the <hi>Scots</hi> had no such peace with the <hi>English</hi> that they might passe without safe conduct. This was not denied by the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of <hi>Erskine,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Archbishop</hi> was retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned prisoner, but after a short time remitted to his liberty. After this the <hi>Queene Dowag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>r</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> going from <hi>France</hi> to her countrey, passed through <hi>England</hi> but the <hi>French Embassador</hi> first obtained her safe conduct, she ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at <hi>Portsmouth</hi> and was there encountered by diuers of the <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>English</hi> nobility of highest quality and estimation as well for doing her honour as for that hauing such pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges she neede not feare, at <hi>London</hi> she soiourned 4 daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lodged in the <hi>Bishops</hi> pallace, and defraied at the charge of the Citty, in which time she was roially feasted by the King at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> At her departure she was attended out of the Citty with all ceremonies pretending to state, the Sheriffes of euery shire through which she passed receiued her accompanied with the chiefe gentlemen of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as also they conveied her from one shire to another (making alwaies prouision for her entertainment vntill shee came into the borders of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Maxwell</hi> came with a strong hand to the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4095:68"/>
borders of <hi>England,</hi> against certaine families of <hi>Scots</hi> who had yeelded to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Dacre</hi> brought his forces to their aide, in which seruice his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and discretion did equally appeare. For albeit the <hi>gentlemen</hi> of those families did often skirmish with the <hi>Earles</hi> men, and slew many of them, yet were they neuer therein aided by the <hi>English,</hi> neither would they assaile him vpon any aduantage. But when any of these <hi>gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> were distressed by the <hi>Earle</hi> the <hi>English</hi> did then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him by armes. Generally the <hi>English</hi> would not offer to offend the <hi>Scots,</hi> but only in defending their friends.</p>
            <p>About this time the <hi>French king</hi> sent <hi>Mounsier Lansat</hi> to request of the King of <hi>England,</hi> that the fishing of <hi>Twe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>de, Edrington,</hi> the debatable ground, and the <hi>Scottish</hi> Hostages which had beene sent into <hi>England</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> might be restored to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that the <hi>English</hi> prisoners who were bound to pay their ransomes, before the peace should not be comprised in the conditions thereof. The King sent S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>William Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> to declare to the <hi>French</hi> King, that to the last demand he agreed without exception, and albeit he had to the places required, yet he was content as well for them as for other demands, to performe whatsoeuer should be agreed on by commissioners on both sides, so commissioners were appointed and the matters setled in quiet agreement.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the King sent new supply of forces and other prouisions into the <hi>North</hi> parts of the Realme, wherevpon the <hi>French</hi> King sent a nauie of 160 saile into <hi>Scotland,</hi> laden with graine, powder, and ordinance, of these 16 of the greatest perished vpon the coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> two charged with Artillery and 14 with graine, the residue so shaken and torne, that it gaue a maine checke to their further designes, but because many saued themselues in the harbors of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The King sent thither 4 ships, 4 barkes, 4 pinnaces, and 12 victualers. These possessed themselues
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4095:68"/>
of three hauens, two on the south side towards <hi>France</hi> and one towards <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Lord Cobham</hi> was appointed <hi>Generall lieuetenant,</hi> who fortified those hauens and drew downe the chiefest forces of the country towards the south parts thereof, and thus euen in peace either of the Kings so vigilantly obserued euery motion of the other, as if they had liued vpon the Alarme. The will of friends is best assured when they haue no power to doe hurt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France</hi> a difference did rise about a place called <hi>Fines wood,</hi> whether it pertained to the <hi>English</hi> or to the <hi>French.</hi> On the <hi>French</hi> part 800 men assembled at armes vpon this quarrell, on the <hi>English</hi> 1000. But the readines of the <hi>English</hi> to fight moued the <hi>French</hi> to abstaine from blowes, and to permit the <hi>English</hi> to enioy their ground. Herevpon the King fortified <hi>Calais</hi> and his other pieces in <hi>France,</hi> in such sort as they had neuer beene in like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of defence. And whereas one <hi>Styward</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in <hi>England</hi> and imprisoned in the Tower, for intending to poison the young <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> the King as well to manifest his iustice as his loue and respect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the young <hi>Queene,</hi> deliuered him to the <hi>French</hi> King vpon the frontires of <hi>Calais</hi> to be iusticed by him at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>And yet this aduice was not approued by many, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be both honourable and iust, that they who offend against their proper prince, should be deliuered to him to be punished, yet is it growne out of common vse. And for this cause the condition is often expressed in leagues, that the subiects of one <hi>Prince</hi> should be deliuered by the other in case they be required, the contrary custome may happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holde reasonable in ordinary offences, in which case the Scripture forbiddeth to deliuer a slaue to his angrie <hi>Lord,</hi> but in grieuous and inhumane crimes, in such as ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the foundation of state, in such as shake the surety of humane society, I conceiue it more fit that offenders should be remitted to their <hi>Prince</hi> to be punished in the place where they haue offended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:4095:69"/>But of all other the Kings amity with the <hi>Emperor</hi> was least assured, being as fullest both of practise and distrust, so in danger euery houre to dissolue. Certaine ships were appointed in the <hi>Lowe Countreys</hi> with men and furniture sutable to the attempts to transport the <hi>Lady Mary</hi> either by violence or by stealth out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Antwerpe.</hi> Diuerse of her gentlemen departed thither before, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine shipheres as they are termed, were discouered to view the <hi>English</hi> coast, Hereupon S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn Gates</hi> was sent with forces into <hi>Essex</hi> where the <hi>Lady</hi> then lay, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> was sent with 200 men, the <hi>Lord Priuy seale</hi> with other 200, and M<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Sentlegier</hi> with 400 men more to seuerall coasts vpon the sea; diuerse of the <hi>Kings</hi> ships were addressed to be in readines for the sea. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Chamberlaine Embassador</hi> for the <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Hungarie</hi> in the <hi>Lowe Countries</hi> aduertised by his letters, that it was intended by this means to raise an outward warre to ioine with some sedition within dores, &amp; that the <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Hungarie</hi> had openly saide, that the Shipheres were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; who for feare of one gentleman durst not proceede in their attempt. Vpon these either dangers or feares the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> &amp; <hi>Secretary Peeter</hi> were sent to the <hi>Lady Mary,</hi> who after some conference brought her to the <hi>Lord Chancellors</hi> house at <hi>Lyes</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi> and from thence to <hi>Hunsdon.</hi> and from thence to the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Westminster.</hi> Here the counsell declared vnto her how long he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her the vse of the <hi>Masse,</hi> and perceiuing by her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters how vnmoueable she was, he was resolued no longer to endure it, vnlesse she would put in hope of some confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity within short time. To this she answered that her soule was Gods, and touching her faith as shee could not change so she would not dissemble it. Reply was made that the King intended not to constraine her faith, but to restraine the outward profession thereof, in regard of the danger the example might draw. After some other like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange of speeches the <hi>Ladie</hi> was appointed to remaine
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4095:69"/>
with the <hi>King,</hi> but <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mallet</hi> her chaplaine was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted prisoner to the fleete, and almost herewith arriued an <hi>Embassador</hi> from the <hi>Emperor,</hi> with a menacing messu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of warre, in case his cozen the <hi>Lady Mary</hi> should not be admitted the free exercise of the masse. The <hi>King</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently aduised with the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and with the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rochester</hi> who gaue their opinion that to giue license to sinne was sinne, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niue at sinne might be allowed in ease it were neither to long nor without hope of reformation. Then was answere giuen to the <hi>Embassador</hi> that the King would send to the <hi>Emperor</hi> within a moneth or two to giue him what satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction should be fit.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the counsaile considering how preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall it would be to the realme if the subiects should loose their trade in <hi>Flanders,</hi> that the <hi>Flemmings</hi> had cloath for a yeere in their hands, that the King had 500 quintals of powder and much armor in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the merchants much goods at the woll fleete, they aduised the <hi>King</hi> to send an <hi>Embassador</hi> legier for the <hi>Emperor,</hi> as well to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him for other matters by him required, as to winne time, thereby both to prepare a mart in <hi>England</hi> and to withdraw their goods out of <hi>Flanders.</hi> So M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wotton</hi> was dispatched with particuler instructions to desire the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> to be lesse violent in his requests. And to aduertise him that the <hi>Lady Mary</hi> as she was his cozen, so was she the Kings sister, and which is more his subiect, that seeing the <hi>K.</hi> was a soueraigne <hi>Prince</hi> without dependancy vpon any but God, it was not reason that the <hi>Emperor</hi> should entermeddle either with ordering his subiects, or with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the affaires of his realme. Thus much hee offered that what fauour the <hi>Kings</hi> subiects had in the <hi>Emperors</hi> dominions for their religion, the same should the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> subiects receiue in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Emperor</hi> pereeiuing that his threats were little regarded, regarded little to threaten any more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:4095:70"/>About the time that the <hi>Lady Mary</hi> should haue beene transported vnto <hi>Antwerp,</hi> a rebellion was attempted in <hi>Essex</hi> where she then lay. For furtherance whereof spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were cast forth, that strangers were arriued in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> either to rule or to spoile the naturall inhabitants, vpon this surmise many appointed to assemble at <hi>Chelins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde,</hi> and from thence to make pillage as their wants or wanton appetites should leade, but the <hi>Principall</hi> being put to death and the residue pardoned, all remained quiet. Many <hi>Londoners</hi> also hunting after riot and ease, contriued to tumult vpon <hi>May</hi> day, pretending grieuances and fears from strangers, but because where many are of counsaile counsell is hardly kept, the enterprise was discouered and defeated before it was ripe, herewith <hi>Lyon, Gorran</hi> &amp; <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> persons of meane condition but desperate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, endeauoured to raise a rebellion in <hi>Kent.</hi> They often met and had conferences both priuate and long. They seemed highly busied in minde, and their heads tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing with troubled thoughts, which they often dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with impertinent speeches, this was first discouered by one of their seruants, doubtfull whether before know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mischiefe, and vntill then secret or ignorant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and then first apprehending suspitions. So they were apprehended and after conuiction the danger deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by their deaths. Herewith rumors were raised of great discord and practises among the nobility, for this cause the <hi>Lords</hi> assembled at <hi>London,</hi> and feasted diuers daies together, giuing order to apprehend the reporters of these surmises, albeit happely not altogether vntrue. For this cause <hi>gentlemen</hi> were newly commanded to remaine in the countrey, to gouerne the people easy to be dealt with whilest they stand in feare.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> being thus vncertaine of the faith both of his subiects and of his confederats, intended by aliance to strengthen himselfe. To this purpose one <hi>Bortwicke</hi> was sent to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmarke</hi> with priuate instructions to

treat of a marriage betweene the <hi>Lady Elizabeth</hi> the Kings sister and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmarks</hi> eldest sonne. But this <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> albeit she was furnished with many excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of nature and education, yet could shee neuer be induced to entertaine Marriage with any.</p>
            <p>After this the <hi>Lord Marquis</hi> of <hi>Northampton</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected with a solemne embassage to the <hi>French King,</hi> aswell to present him with the order of the garter, as to treat with him of other secret affaires, with him were ioyned in commission the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Elie,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

The <hi>Earles</hi> of <hi>Worcester, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Ormond</hi> were appointed to accompany them, and likewise the <hi>Lordes Lisle, Fitswater, Bray, Abergauennie,</hi> and <hi>Yuers,</hi> with other <hi>knights</hi> and <hi>gentlemen</hi> of note to the number of 26 and for auoiding immoderate and burthensome traine, order was giuen that euery <hi>Earle</hi> should haue foure atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, euery <hi>Lord</hi> three, euery <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Gentleman</hi> two, The commissioners were not limitted to any number.</p>
            <p>They arriued at <hi>Nants</hi> and were there receiued by <hi>Mounsier Chastilion</hi> and by him conducted to <hi>Chasteau Bryan</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> King then lodged, they were twice banquetted by the way, and the neerer they approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the castle, the more encreased the resort of the <hi>French</hi> nobility to doe them honour, being come to the court they were forthwith brought to the King abiding then in his bedchamber. Here the <hi>Marquis</hi> presented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the order of the garter, wherewith he was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inuested, and thereupon gaue for the garter a chaine worth 200<hi rend="sup">l</hi> and his gowne addressed with aglets esteemed worth 25<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi> in a short speech declared how desirous the King of <hi>England</hi> was not only to continue but to encrease amity with the <hi>French</hi> King. That to this purpose he had sent the order of the garter to be both a testimony and tye of loue betweene them, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4095:71"/>
chiefly those societies of honour were first deuised. He further declared that they had commission to make ouerture of some other matters, which was like to make the concord betweene the Kinges &amp; their realmes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more durable, but in all expectation perpetuall desiring the King to appoint some persons enabled with authority to treat with them.</p>
            <p>To this speech the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Lorraine</hi> answered that the <hi>French</hi> King was ready to apprehend and embrace all offers tending to encrease of amity, and the rather for that long hostility had made their new friendship both more weake in it selfe, &amp; more obnoxious to ielosies &amp; distrusts, and therefore he promised on the Kings behalfe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners should be appointed to treat with them about any matters which they had in charge, praying to God that it might be a means not only to assure but to enlarge their late setled loue, so a commission went forth to the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Lorraine</hi> and <hi>Chastilion</hi> the Constable, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guise</hi> and certaine others; at the first the <hi>English</hi> demanded that the young <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> might be sent into <hi>England</hi> for perfection of marriage betweene K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and her, but hereto the <hi>French</hi> answered that they had taken too much aduenture, and spent too many liues vpon any conditions to let her goe, and that conclusion had beene made long before for her marriage with the <hi>Dolphine</hi> of <hi>France</hi> Then the <hi>English</hi> proposed a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age between their King and the <hi>Lady Elizabeth</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings eldest daughter, to which the <hi>French</hi> did cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encline.</p>
            <p>So after agreement that neither partie should be bound either in conscience or in honour vntill the <hi>Ladie</hi> should accomplish 12 yeares of age, they fell to treat of the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which should be giuen with her in marriage. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> first demanded 150000 crownes, and offered that her dowrie should be so great as K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> had giuen with any of his wiues. The offer of dower was not disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4095:71"/>
but for the portion some of the <hi>French</hi> wondred, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers smiled, that so great a summe should be demanded The <hi>English</hi> descended to 1400000 crownes &amp; after by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees fell so low as 800000, but the <hi>French</hi> as they held the first summe to be vnreasonable, so all the other they estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med excessiue. Then the <hi>English</hi> demanded what the <hi>French</hi> would giue, first they offered 100000 crownes, afterwards 200000, which they said was the most &amp; more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer had bin giuen with a daughter of <hi>France,</hi> they followed a stiffe contention both by reasons, &amp; precedents, but the <hi>French</hi> in no case would rise any higher, only they agreed that the <hi>French</hi> K. at his proper charge should send her to the K. of <hi>England</hi> 3 moneths before she should accomplish her age for marriage, sufficiently appointed with Iewells, apparell, &amp; furniture for house, &amp; that bands for the performances should then be deliuered at <hi>London</hi> by the K. of <hi>England</hi> and at <hi>Paris</hi> by the <hi>French King,</hi> and that in case the <hi>Lady</hi> should not consent after she should be of the said age for marriage, the penalty should be 150000 crownes, the <hi>French</hi> set downe these offers in writing, and sent them to the King of <hi>England.</hi>

the King remoued to <hi>Hampton</hi> court with very few fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
            <p>The same day the <hi>Marshall</hi> and other <hi>French</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners were brought by the <hi>Lord Clinton Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> of <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Grauesend</hi> to <hi>London.</hi> They were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by the way with all the shot of more then 50 of the <hi>Kings</hi> great ships, and with a faire peale of Artillery from the Tower, and lastly were lodged in <hi>Suffolke</hi> pallace in <hi>Southwarke,</hi> and albeit they had more then 400 <hi>gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in their traine, yet was not one of them nor any other stranger in <hi>England</hi> touched with the sweating disease, and yet the <hi>English</hi> were chased therewith not only in <hi>England,</hi> but in other countries abroad, which made them like ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants both feared and auoided wheresoeuer they came.</p>
            <p>The next day the <hi>French</hi> were remoued to <hi>Richmond</hi> whence euery day they resorted to <hi>Hampton</hi> court, where the <hi>King</hi> remained, the first day after they had performed the Ceremonies of court, and deliuered to the King their letters of credence, they were led to a chamber richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for their repose, the same day they dined with the <hi>King,</hi> and after dinner being brought into an inner cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the <hi>Marshall</hi> declared that they were come not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deliuer vnto him the order of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Lastly he desired in case any new controuersie should ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise it might be determined by commissioners on both sides and not by conflicts the parent of warre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:4095:72"/>To this the <hi>King</hi> both suddenly and shortly answered, that he much thanked the <hi>French King</hi> for his order, as for the large expression of his loue, which he would be ready in all points to requite. Touching rumours they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be credited, nor alwayes to be contemned, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no lesse vaine to feare all things, than dangerous to doubt of nothing, and in case at any time hee listned to them, it was only to prouide against the worst, and neuer to breake into hostilitie: concerning officers, he appointed such as hee esteemed good, and yet preferred the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtfull before the ouer-credulous and secure, new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies he would alwaies be readie to determine by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son rather than by force, so farre as his honour should not thereby be diminished.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> after this returne to their lodging at <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and the next day resorted againe to the King, inuested him with garments of the order, and accompanied him to the Chappell, the King going betweene the <hi>Marshall</hi> &amp; <hi>de Guise,</hi> both which after the Communion kissing his cheek. The residue of that day and a few dayes following were passed ouer with pastimes and feasts. At the last the <hi>Lord Marquis</hi> of <hi>Northampton</hi> and the residue, who had beene formerly sent with commission from the King into <hi>France,</hi> were appointed to treat with the <hi>French</hi> Commissioners touching the great matters of their Embassage. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>French</hi> could be serued no higher than their offer of 200000. crownes it was accepted. The one moitie to be paid vpon the day of marriage, and the other six moneths after, the Dote was agreed to be 10000. markes of <hi>English</hi> money, and not to be paid in case the King should die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4095:74"/>
Heere he declared that vpon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>George</hi> day last before, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> being vpon a iourney towards the <hi>North,</hi> in case S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>William Herbert</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of the horse had not assured him that he should receiue no harme, would haue raised the people, and that he had sent the <hi>Lord Gray</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to know who would be his friends, also that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the <hi>Marques</hi> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> and other <hi>Lords</hi> should be inuited to a banquet, and if they came with a bare company to be set vpon by the way, if strongly, their heads should haue beene cut off at the place of their feasting, he declared fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Ralph Uane</hi> had 2000 men in a readinesse, that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> had assured the tower, that <hi>Seymor</hi> and <hi>Hamond</hi> would waite vpon him, and that all the horse of the <hi>Gendarmorie</hi> should be slaine. To this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Secretary Cecill</hi> added, that the <hi>Duke</hi> had sent for him and said that he suspected some ill meaning against him, whereto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary</hi> answered, that if he were not in fault, hee might trust to his innocencie, if he were, he had nothing to say but to lament him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> being aduertised of these informations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him by some who had some regard of honestie did forthwith defie the <hi>Secretary</hi> by his letters. Then he sent for Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> to vnderstand what he had reported of him, who denied all that he had said, but by this hot &amp; humorous striuing he did but draw the knots more fast.</p>
            <p>A few daies being passed the <hi>Duke</hi> either ignorant of what was intended, or fearing if he seemed to perceiue it, came to the court, but somewhat later then he accustomed, and as too mindes possessed with feare, all things vnvsuall seeme to menace danger, so this late coming of the <hi>Duke</hi> was enforced as a suspition against him, and so after dinner he was apprehended. Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundell, Hamonde Nudigates: Iohn Seymor</hi> and <hi>Dauid Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> were also made prisoners, the <hi>Lord Gray</hi> being newly come out of the country was attached. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Ralph Uane</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4095:74"/>
twice sent for fled, vpon the first message it was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he said that his <hi>Lord</hi> was not stout, and that if he could get home he cared not for any, but vpon pursuit he was found in his seruants stable at <hi>Lambeth</hi> couered with straw, he was a man of a fierce spirit both sodaine &amp; bold, of no euill disposition sauing that he thought scantnesse of estate too great an euill. All these were the same night sent to the tower except <hi>Palmer, Arundell,</hi> and <hi>Vant,</hi> who were kept in the court well guarded in chambers apart. The day following the <hi>Dutches</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> was sent to the Tower, no man grieuing thereat because her pride and basenesse of life ouerballanced all pitty, and doubtlesse if any mischiefe were then contriued, whereof many were doubtfull (euery one giuing forth as he belieued) it was first hammered in the forge of her wicked working braine, for shee had alwaies wicked instruments about her, whom the more she found appliable to her purposes, the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors she bestowed vpon them, who being engaged by her into dangers held it dangerous to fall from her, also with her were committed one <hi>Crane</hi> and his wife, and her own chamberwoman. After these followed S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Miles Partridge,</hi> Sir <hi>Michaell Stanhope, Wingfield, Banister, Vaughan,</hi> and some others. In diuers of these was then neither any cause knowne or afterwardes discouered, but the number raised the greater terror, and doubled the conceit of the danger.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer</hi> being againe examined added to his former detection, that the <hi>Gendarmorie</hi> vpon the muster day should be assaulted by 2000 foote vnder Sir <hi>Ralph Vane,</hi> and by 100 horses of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somersets,</hi> besides his friends which should stand by, and besides the idle people which were thought inclineable to take his part, that this done he would runne throw the cittie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime liberty, and in case his attempt did not succeed hee would goe to the <hi>Ile</hi> of <hi>Wight</hi> or to <hi>Poole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crane</hi> confessed for the most part as <hi>Palmer</hi> had done
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4095:75"/>
and futher added that the <hi>Lord Pagets</hi> house was the place, where the nobility being inuited to a banquet should haue lost their heads, and that the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Arundell</hi> was made acquainted with the practise by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Michaell Stanhope,</hi> and that it had bin done but that the greatnesse of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise caused delaies and sometimes diuersity of aduice, and further said that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> once faining himselfe to be sicke, went to <hi>London</hi> to assay what friends he could procure. This <hi>Crane</hi> was a man who hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed his owne estate had armed himselfe to any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hamonde</hi> confessed that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somersets</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber had beene strongly watched at <hi>Greenwich</hi> by night.</p>
            <p>All these were sworne before the counsaile, and the greatest part of the nobility of the realme, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions were true. and as fauourably set downe in behalfe of the <hi>Duke,</hi> as with a safe conscience they could, and forthwith vpon the information of <hi>Crane</hi> the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundell</hi> and the <hi>Lord Paget</hi> were sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> so were <hi>Stradley,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Albones</hi> seruants to the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Arundell,</hi> the <hi>Lord Strange</hi> voluntarily enformed, how the <hi>Duke</hi> desired him to moue the <hi>King</hi> to take to wise his third daughter the <hi>Ladie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Herevpon to giue some publique satisfaction to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> who had words at will &amp; wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to apply them, declared openly in the starre chamber all these accusations against the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset,</hi> letters were allso published to all <hi>Emperors, Kings, Embassadors,</hi> &amp; chiefe men in any state, wherein these matters were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised. By other letters the muster of the <hi>Gendarmorie</hi> was deferred for certaine moneths, other letters were directed to Sir <hi>Arthur Darcy</hi> to take charge of the tower, and to discharge Sir <hi>Arthur Markham.</hi> For that without acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

any of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the counsaile, he suffered the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> to walke abroad and permit entercourses of letters betweene <hi>Dauid Seymor</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>Poynes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilest these matters were in trauerse, messengers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from <hi>Duke Mauris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Marques</hi> of <hi>Brandenburge, Princes</hi> of the religion in <hi>Germanie,</hi> to vnderstand the <hi>Kings</hi> minde whether he would agree to aide them with 400000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in case any necessity should assaile them, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to doe the like to him in case he should be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with warre, the <hi>King</hi> gaue them an vncertaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, but gentle and full of faire hopes, that because their message was only to know the <hi>Kings</hi> inclination, and not to conclude he could giue them no other answere then this, that he was well enclined to ioyne in amity with them whom he knew to agree with him in religion, but first he was desirous to know whether they could procure such aide from other <hi>Princes</hi> as might enable them to maintaine their warres, and to assist him if need should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and therefore he willed them to breake this matter to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Prussia</hi> and other <hi>Princes</hi> about them, and to procure the good will of <hi>Hamborough, Lubecke,</hi> and <hi>Breme,</hi> then he desired that the matter of religion should be plainly set downe, least vnder pretence thereof warres should be made for other quarrells, lastly he willed that they should furnish themselues with more ample instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from their <hi>Lords</hi> to commune and conclude of all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances pertaining to that businesse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kings</hi> answere was framed with these vncertainties and delaies, least if the <hi>King</hi> had assured his consent at the first, it might haue beene taken as breach of league with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> afterwards they and other <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> made a league offensiue and defensiue with the <hi>French King</hi> against the <hi>Emperor,</hi> into the which the <hi>French King</hi> desired the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to come, but because the <hi>French</hi> K. was the chiefe of the league, the <hi>King</hi> did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4095:76"/>
perceiue that the warre was not for the cause of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherefore he answered that he could not doe it with breach of his league with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> against whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no pretence of hostility, he was not so desirous of warres as without iust cause of his owne to pull them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
            <p>About the same time the <hi>Lord admirall</hi> was sent into <hi>France</hi> as the <hi>Kings</hi> deputie to be Godfather at the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of the <hi>French Kings</hi> sonne, also a <hi>French</hi> man who had committed a murther at <hi>Diepe,</hi> and fled into <hi>England</hi> was remitted into <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and deliuered vpon the borders to receiue iustice by the same lawes against which he had offended.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> being impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of long working wickednesse, the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> act of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somersets</hi> tragedie must not be delaied, least thereby feare abating, (as being false it could not be durable) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Kings</hi> gentle disposition, or the loue which he had formerly borne to his vnkle might happily returne to their naturall working. So the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> after a short aboad in the tower was brought to his triall at <hi>Westminster.</hi> The <hi>Lord William Paulet Marques</hi> of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> and <hi>Lord treasurer</hi> sate as high <hi>Steward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> vnder a cloath of estate on a bench mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted three degrees, the <hi>Peeres</hi> to the number of 27 sate on a bench one step lower.

            </p>
            <p>First the inditements were read in number 5 contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a charge of raising men in the north parts of the realme, &amp; at his house of assembling men to kill the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> of resisting his attachment, of killing the

               <hi>Gendarmorie,</hi> of raising <hi>London,</hi> of assaulting the <hi>Lords,</hi> and deuising their deaths, when the prisoner had pleaded not guilty and put himselfe vpon triall of his Peeres, the examinations before mentioned were read, and by the Kings learned counsaile pressed against him. Hereto albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it he was both vnskilfull and much appalled (causes suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to driue him out of matters) yet after a short entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that words either idly or angerly spoken might not be enforced to any high crew, to the points obiected he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
            <p>That he neuer intended to raise the north parts of the realme, but vpon some brutes he apprehended a scare, which moued him to send to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>William Herbert</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine his friend. That he determined not to kill the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> or any other <hi>Lord,</hi> but spake of it only and determined the contrary. That it had beene a mad enterprise with his 100 men to assaile the Gendarmory consisting of 900, when in case he had preuailed, it would nothing haue auailed the pretended purpose, and therefore this being senselesse and absurd, must needs dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>redid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, which otherwise might haue beene belieued. That at <hi>London</hi> he neuer proiected any stirre but euer held it a good place for his surety. That for hauing men in his chamber at <hi>Greenwich</hi> it was manifest he meant no harme, because when he might haue done it he did not, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the persons of them, whose examinations had beene read against him he obiected many things, desiring they might be brought to his face, which in regard he was a person of dignity and estate he claimed to be reasonable, especially against S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Palmer</hi> he spake much euill, and yet in opinion of many farre short of the truth. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no answere was made but that the worse they were, the fitter they were to be his instruments, fit instruments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (said he) but rather for others then for me.</p>
            <p>The fast being made the Kings learned counsaile auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the law to be to assemble men with intent to kill the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4095:77"/>
               <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was treason, by a statute of the 3 &amp; 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, or <hi>K. Edward</hi> then raigning, made against vnlawfull assemblies, that to raise <hi>London</hi> or the North parts of the realme was treason, that to minde resisting his attachment was felony, that to assault the <hi>Lords,</hi> and to devise their deaths was felony. But vnder fauour of their iudgement the statute alleaged bears no such sense, either for treason or for felony, indeed by a statute of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 7 it is felony for inferior persons to contriue the death of a <hi>Lord</hi> of the counsaile, but <hi>Lordes</hi> are therein expresly excepted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lordes</hi> went together and first the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi> nobly said that he held it not reasonable, that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a contention betweene priuate subiect, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention thereof, any meane action should to draw to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of treason. The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (in countenance bearing shew of sadnesse but in truth stifly obstinate) denyed that he would euer consent that any practise against him should be either imputed or reputed to be treason, yet this was not taken to proceede from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty as he expected, but for that he could not with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or with reason so enforce it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marques</hi> of <hi>Northampton</hi> was crossed and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious with many, but neuer replied to any answere a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest marke of no strong spirit. Some of the rest plainly brake forth that they held it vnfit that the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> the <hi>Marques</hi> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> should be of the triall, because the prisoner was chiefly charged with practises intended against them. But hereto answere was made that a <hi>Peere</hi> of the Realme might not be challenged. After much variation of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the prisoner at the barre was acquit of treason, but by most voices (most fauouring the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi>) he was sound guilty of felony. Hereupon iudgement fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that he should be hanged, but this would neuer haue gone so hard, had they not prosecuted all vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of treason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:4095:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> might haue craued his clerge, but he suffered iudgement to passe, thanked the <hi>Lords</hi> for his gentle triall, craued pardon of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Marques</hi> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke,</hi> for his ill meaning against them, and made suit for his life, in pitty to his wife, children, and seruants, and in regard of paiment of his debts. As he departed because he was acquit of treason, the axe of the tower was not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried, whereupon the people supposing that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together acquit, shooted halfe a dozed times so loud that they were heard beyond <hi>Charing Crosse.</hi> It is certaine the people fauoured him the more because they saw that there was much secret hate borne against him. But as this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate fauour of the multitude did him no good, so will it vndoe so many as shall trust vnto it. It was told the <hi>King</hi> that after the <hi>Dukes</hi> returne to the tower, he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to certaine <hi>Lords,</hi> that he had hired <hi>Bartuile</hi> to make them away, that <hi>Bartuile</hi> confessed so much, and that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was not ignorant thereof, which whether it were true, or whether deuised to make the <hi>King</hi> more estranged from him, of iudgement could not hold themselues as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Cuthbert Tonstall Bishop</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> a man famous in those times for learning, and integrity of life, was sent to the tower for concealement of (I know not what) treason, written to him I know not by whom, and not discouered vntill (what shall I call) the party did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it. But the <hi>Lord Chancellor Rich</hi> hauing built a faire estate, and perceiuing what nimble ears were borne to listen after treason, also for that a parliament was towards wherein he was doubtfull what questions might arise, made suit to the <hi>King</hi> that in regard of the infirmities of his body, he might be discharged of his office, giuing good example to men sometimes by their owne moderation to auoid disgrace. So he deliuered the seale at his house in great S <hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Bartholomewes</hi> to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> &amp;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4095:78"/>
the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> sent by the <hi>King</hi> with commission to receiue it. The same seale was forthwith deliuered to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Godricke Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> a man if happily able to discharg the place, assuredly no more. It was first deliuered vnto him only during the sicknesse of the <hi>Lord Rich,</hi> but in short time after he was sworne <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> because as keeper of the seale he could not then execute such matters as were to be dispatched in parliament.</p>
            <p>And now after iudgement against <hi>Somerset</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> were not negligent to entertaine the <hi>King</hi> with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights they could deuise, partly to winne his fauour, but especially to conuert his thoughts from his condemned <hi>Vnkle,</hi> to this end they often presented him with stately masques, braue challenges at title and at barriers, and whatsoeuer exercises or disports they could coniecture to be best pleasing to him, then also he first began to keepe hall, and the Christmas time was passed ouer with banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, masques, plaies, and much other variety of mirth. Often they would call him to serious affaires wherein he tooke especiall pleasure. Sometimes they would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him how dangerous the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> was, who hauing made away his only brother, contriued the death of the chiefe of the nobility. And where (say they) would his mischiefe haue rested? Would it haue raged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all and left the <hi>King</hi> only vntouched? Verily hauing beene alwaies both cruell and false, there would haue beene no end of his mischiefe, and all his submissions must now be taken for counterfeit and dissembled. But his auarice and ambition once remoued, the way will be laid open to vertue and merit.</p>
            <p>So about two moneths after his iudgement the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and last act of his tragedie was brought vpon the stage. When being so often exposed to fortunes mercy before he was placed by a strong guard vpon a seaffold at <hi>tower hill,</hi> about eight of the clocke in the morning to suffer death, &amp; albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it straight charge had beene giuen the day before to euery
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4095:78"/>
housholder in the citty, not to permit any to depart out of their houses before ten of the clocke that day, yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the more vnruly by this restraint, by such thick throngs swarmed to the place, that before seauen of the clocke the hill was couered and all the chambers which opened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the seaffold were taken vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Duke</hi> first aduowed to the people, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions had beene not only harmelesse in regard of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler persons, but driuing to the common benefit both of the <hi>King</hi> and of the Realme. Then he exhorted them vnto obedience, assuring them that no persons could iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auouch their faith to God, who were not faithfull to their <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But herewith behold certaine persons of a hamlet neere who had beene warned by the <hi>Lieuetenant</hi> of the tower to attend that morning about seauen of the clocke, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their hower through the posterne, and perces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the prisoner to be mounted vpon the seaffold, began to runne and to call to their fellowes to come away. The sodaine of their coming, the hast that they made, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons they carried, but especially the word, come away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often doubled, moued many of the neerest to surmise that a power was come to receiue the <hi>Duke,</hi> whereupon many cried with a high voice. Away, Away, the cry of those and the coming on of the other cast amazement vpon the rest, so much the more terrible because no man knew what he feared or wherefore, euery man conceiuing that which his astonished fancie did cast in his minde, some imagined that it thundred, others that it was an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, others that the powder in the armorie had taken fire, others that troopes of horsemen approached. In which medly of conceits they bare downe one another, and iost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many into the tower ditch, and long it was before the vaine tumult could be appeased.</p>
            <p>No sooner was the people setled in quiet, and the <hi>Duke</hi> beginning to finish his speech, but vpon another idle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4095:79"/>
they fell to be no lesse riotous in ioy then they had beene in feare. For S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Anthony Browne</hi> coming on horsebacke vpon the spurre gaue occasion, whereby many entertained hope that he brought a pardon, whereupon a great shout was raised, A pardon, A pardon, God saue the <hi>King.</hi> But the <hi>Duke</hi> expressed great constancy at both these times, often desiring the people to remaine quiet that he might quietly end his life. For said he I haue often looked death in the face vpon great aduentures in the field, he is now no stranger to me, and among all the vaine mockeries of this world I repent me of nothing more then in esteeming life more deare then I should I haue endured the hate of great persons, so much the more dangerous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vniust. I haue incurred displeasure from inferiors, not alwaies for any great faults of mine owne, (albeit I was neuer free) but for giuing way to the faults of others, and now being constantly resolued, I neither feare to dy nor desire to liue, and hauing mastered all griefe in my selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I desire no man to sorrow for me, so hauing testified his faith to God, and his faithfulnesse to the <hi>King,</hi> he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his body into the executioners hand, who with one stroake of the axe cut off all his confused cogitations and cares, the more pitied by the people for the knowne hate of <hi>Northumberland</hi> against him.</p>
            <p>Assuredly he was a man harmelesse and faithfull, and one who neuer hatched any hopes preiudiciall to the <hi>King,</hi> but alwaies intended his safety and honour, but hard it is for greatnesse to stand when it is not sustained by the proper strength. The people whose property it is by excessiue fauour to bring great men to miserie, and then to be excessiue in pitty departed away grieued and afraid, and yet feared to seeme to be afraid, and for this cause chiefly did neuer beare good minde to <hi>Northumberland</hi> afterwards although in shew they dissemble the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for nothing is more easie then to discerne when people obserue great men from the heart, or when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4095:79"/>
they doe it for fashion or for feare, and as it often happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that men oppressed worke reuenge after their deaths. So the remembrance of <hi>Somerset</hi> much moued the people to fall from <hi>Northumberland</hi> in his greatest attempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to leaue him to his fatall fall, whereat they openly reioyced and presented to him handkerchiefes dipped in the blood of <hi>Somerset,</hi> for whom they thought he deserued rather late then vndeserued punishment. So certaine it is that the debts both of cruelty and mercy goe neuer vnpaied, I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the meane scourges of conscience. For assuredly a body cannot be so torne with stripes, <hi>as</hi> a minde is with remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of wicked actions, but of him more hereafter shall be said, and how his greatnesse turned to be fortunes scorne.</p>
            <p>But outwardly and for the present he gained a great hand ouer the nobility, who soone obseruing that he was able to endanger the estate of the greatest, &amp; that the more respect they did beare to him, the more safely they liued &amp; the more easily aduanced to honour, they all contended to creepe into his humor, to watch his wordes, his gestures, his lookes, &amp; to doe that as of themselues which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued he had a desire they should doe.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>King</hi> albeit at the first he gaue no token of any ill tempered passion as taking it not agreeable to maiesty, openly to declare himselfe, and albeit the <hi>Lordes</hi> did much helpe to dispell any dampie thoughts which the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his vnkle might raise, by applying him with great variety of exercises and disportes, yet vpon speech of him afterwards he would often sigh and let fall teares, sometimes he was of opinion that he had done nothing that deserued death, or if he had, that it was very small, and proceeded rather from his wife then from himselfe. And where th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n said he was the good nature of a nephew? where was the clemency of a <hi>Prince?</hi> Ah how vnfortunate haue I beene to those of my blood? My mother I slew at my very birth, and since haue made away two of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4095:80"/>
and happily to make away for the purposes of others against my selfe. Was it euer knowen before that a <hi>Kinges</hi> vnkle, a <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> one whose fortunes had much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced the honour of the realme, did loose his head for felony, for a felony neither cleere in law and in fact weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued? A lasse how falsely haue I beene abused? How weakly caried? How little was I master ouer my owne iudgement? That both his death and the enuy thereof must be charged vpon mee?</p>
            <p>Not long after the death of <hi>Somerset,</hi> because it was not thought fit that such a person should be executed alone, who could hardly be thought to offend alone. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Ralph Uane</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Miles Partridge</hi> were hanged on tower hill, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Michaell Stanhope,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> were there also beheaded. All these tooke it vpon their last charge that they neuer offended against the <hi>King,</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any of his counsaile, God knowes whether obstinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly secret, or whether innocent, and in the opinion of all men <hi>Somerset</hi> was much cleered by the death of those who were executed to make him appeare faulty.</p>
            <p>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Ralph Uane</hi> was charged with conspiring with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset,</hi> but his bold answeres termed rude and russianlike, falling into yeares apt to take offence, either only caused or much furthered his condemnation. For besides his naturall fiercenesse enslamed by his present disgrace, he was the more free by reason of his great seruices in the field. The time hath beene, said he, when I was of some esteeme, but now we are in peace which reputeth the coward and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious alike, and so with an obstinate resolution he made choice rather not to regard death then by any submission to entreat for life, indeed it was wellknowne that he had beene famous for seruice, but therewith it was well knowen by whose fauour he had beene famous.</p>
            <p>S <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> was with some difficulty condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for his cause was brought to triall about seauen of the clocke in the morning, about noone the Iurors went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4095:80"/>
and because they could not agree, they were shut in a house all the residue of that day, and all the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the next morning they found him guilty, vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man, who found the doing of any thing or of nothing dangerous alike.</p>
            <p>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Miles Partridge,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Michaell Stanhope</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as consociates in the conspiracy of <hi>Somerset.</hi> Both reputed indifferently disposed to bad or good, yet neither of them of that temper as to dare any dangerous fact: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because they were so indeed, or because their fauour or alliance with the dutchesse of <hi>Somerset</hi> made them to be of lesse esteeme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Garter</hi> K. at armes was sent to the <hi>Lord Paget</hi> prisoner in the tower to take from him the garter and the George, and to discharge him of that order. The pretence of this dishonour was because he was said to be no gentleman of blood, neither by Father nor by Mother. The Garter and the George were Forthwith bestowed vpon the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> eldest sonne to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> about this time the order was almost wholly altered, as by the statutes thereof then made it appeares.</p>
            <p>After these times few matters of high nature or obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable note happened in <hi>England</hi> during <hi>King Edwards</hi> life. Of these I will select such as I esteeme most fit for history, both as being publique, and as contained matter of some regard, not alwaies obseruing the iust order of time, but sometime coherence or propinquity of matter.</p>
            <p>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Philip Hobby</hi> was sent to pay 62000 pounds at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerp,</hi> for paiment of which summe the <hi>King</hi> stood to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers persons engaged. This done he went to the <hi>Regent,</hi> then lying at <hi>Brussels</hi> to declare vnto her certaine grieuances of the <hi>English</hi> merchants aduentures, but he receiued nothing but faire promises which proued, deceiuable. Afterwards <hi>Mounsier de Couriers</hi> came from the <hi>Regent</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> to vnderstand more particularly the complaints of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and therewith to desire that her subiects ships
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4095:81"/>
might safely take harbour in any of the <hi>Kings</hi> hauens. For the first a note of the merchants complaints was deliuered in writing, but answere was deferred for want of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, an vsuall pretence in like affaires. Touching the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, answere was made, that the <hi>King</hi> had giuen order that <hi>Flemmish</hi> shipps should not be molested in any of his hauens, which appeared in that they were there alwaies rescued from the pursuit and chase of the <hi>French.</hi> But hee thought it not fit that more should enter his hauens at once then he had power to gouerne. Assuredly the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant aduenturers haue beene often wronged and wringed to the quicke, but were neuer quicke and liuely in thankes to those by whose endeauours they were freed.</p>
            <p>The same merchants exhibited a bill at the counsaile table against the Merchants of the <hi>Stilliard.</hi> After an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere by those of the <hi>Stilliard,</hi> and reply by the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, it was conceiued vpon view of diuers Charters, that the Merchants of the <hi>Stilliard</hi> were no sufficient corporation, and that their number, names, and nation could not be knowen. Also that when they had forfeited their liberties, <hi>King Edward</hi> the fourth restored them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, that they should couer no strangers goods which they had not obserued. And againe whereas at the beginning they shipped not aboue 80 cloathes after that 100, afterwards 1000, after that 6000, at that time 44000 cloathes were shipped euery yeare in their names, and not aboue 1100 by all strangers besides, wherefore albeit cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Embassadors</hi> from <hi>Hamborough</hi> &amp; <hi>Lubeck</hi> spake much in their behalfe, yet a decree was made, that they had forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their liberties &amp; were in the same condition with other strangers. And albeit they made great moanes afterwards, yet could they not procure this sentence to be reuersed.</p>
            <p>A commission was granted to viii <hi>Bishops,</hi> viii other <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,</hi> viii <hi>Ciuilians,</hi> and viii common <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and in all xxxii to set forth ecclesiasticall lawes, agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both of the people and of the religion then established
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4095:81"/>
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but it tooke no effect. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the number of the commissioners being many, nor the quality of them being persons both in great offices and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers farre remote could afford meetings for so great a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Also the difference both of porsessions &amp; of ends, did of necessity raise much difference in iudgment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> had sixe Chaplaines in Ordinary, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whose attendance in court an order was made, that two should remaine with the <hi>King</hi> by turnes, and fower should trauaile in preaching abroad. The first yeare two in <hi>Wales,</hi> and two in <hi>Lincolneshire,</hi> the next yeare two in the Marshes of <hi>Scotland</hi> and two in <hi>Yorkeshire.</hi> The third yeare two in <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> &amp; two in <hi>Hampshire.</hi> The fourth yeare two in <hi>Northfolke,</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> and two in <hi>Kent</hi> &amp; <hi>Sussex,</hi> &amp; so throw all the shires in <hi>England,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily did not only serue for a spirituall end, namely instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in religion, but did also aduance a temporall purpose of peaceable obedience. For as rude vntrained mindes are not only easily drawen but inclineable of themselues to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and tumult, so by learning and religion men are especially both reduced and retained in ciuill quiet.</p>
            <p>For better dispatch of businesse of diuers natures, the body of the counsaile was diuided into seuerall commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Some were appointed for hearing those suits which were vsually brought before the whole table, to send mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of iustice to their proper courts, to giue full deniall to such as they should not esteeme reasonable, to certify what they thought meet to be granted, and vpon allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof to dispatch the parties. Others were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to consider of penall lawes and proclamations in force and to quicken the execution of the most principall. These were directed first to consider what principall lawes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> proclamations were most needfull to be executed. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> to enquire into the countries how they were disobeyed and first to punish greatest offendors, and afterwards to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to the rest. Lastly that they should enquire what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4095:82"/>
disorders were either dangerous or offensiue in euery shire, and either to punish the offendors or else to report their iudgement therein. Others were appointed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend occurrences of state at large, with whom the <hi>King</hi> did sit once euery weeke to heare matters of greatest moment debated, because in these high passages nothing was thought to be done truly with maiesty, nothing agreeable to the dignity of the state, but in the presence of the <hi>King.</hi> Generally all the counsaile agreed that none of them should make suit to the <hi>King</hi> for land or forfeitures aboue xx<hi rend="sup">l</hi> or for reuersion of leases, or any other extraordinary matter vntill the state of his Reuenewes should be further knowen.</p>
            <p>Besides these commissions another went forth to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and order the Kinges reuenewes, and to cut off super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous charges, to ouersee all courts, especially those of new erection, as the court of augmentation, and of first fruits and tenths, and to prouide that the reuenewes were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered euery halfe yeare, another went forth for debts owing to the King, and to take accompt of paiments since the 35 of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and in what manner the King had beene deceiued, either by not accompting or accompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falsely.

               </gap>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, by vertue whereof, diuerse were dimolished vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sea coasts, in peace chargeable and little seruiceable in warre. And further for more orderly and speedy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of causes, the King deliuered to his counsaile these Articles following.</p>

               <item>10 That if they assemble to the number of fower, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the number of sixe, then they may reason or examine the commodities or inconueniences of matters proposed, and make things plaine which seeme diffused at the first opening, and if they agree then at the next full assembly of sixe, a perfect conclusion thereof shall be made.</item>
               <item>11 That if there be vnder fower and a matter arriseth requiring expedition, they shall declare it to the <hi>King,</hi> but not giue answere vnlesse it requires extraordinary hast.</item>

               <item>13 That if such matter arise as cannot be ended without long debating, the counsaile shall not intermeddle with other causes vntill they haue concluded the same.</item>

            <p>Assuredly albeit the <hi>King</hi> declared both his iudgment and his diligence and care of affaires of the realme. Yet is there one rule more (and not by him neglected) for all great officers, which if it be not sufficient in itselfe to hold matters in order, yet are no rules sufficient without it.</p>
            <p>And this is to choose persons both for ability and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity well reputed, albeit happily they be not alwaies vsed. For besides that these will be a rule to themselues, it is a great satisfaction to the people, and keepeth them both from murmuring and curious enquiring into counsailes of State, which is neuer good and often dangerous when they know or at least suppose matters to passe vnder such mens iudgements,</p>
            <p>In theese times it was conceiued by many that by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4095:83"/>
of a Mart in <hi>England,</hi> the realme would be much enriched and made more famous, and lesse obnoxious to other countries. The time was then esteemed fit by reason of the warres betweene the <hi>Emperor</hi> and the <hi>French King.</hi> The places deemed most meete were <hi>Hull</hi> for the east coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and <hi>Southampton</hi> for the South. <hi>London</hi> was thought no ill place, but <hi>Southampton</hi> was iudged most conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the first beginning. This matter detained the <hi>Lords</hi> of the counsell in a deliberation both serious and long, with great strength and variety of reasons on both sides, which because they may giue some light to the like question, which in times ensuing may happily againe be set on foot. I will here declare them in the same manner as they were collected by the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against the Mart these octiections were made.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 That strangers could haue no accesse into England by land, which they had at <hi>Antwerp</hi> where the Mart then was.</item>
               <item>2 That the ill working of <hi>English</hi> cloaths made them lesse esteemed abroad.</item>

            <p>1 Herevnto answere was made that at the time when the Mart should beginne at <hi>Southampton,</hi> the <hi>French King</hi> and the <hi>Almans</hi> would stop entercourse to <hi>Antwerp</hi> by land, so as nothing should passe that way but in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4095:84"/>
Againe as <hi>South ampton</hi> wanteth the commodity of accesse of merchandise by land, so it hath the commodity that there can be no accesse of enimies by land, and if warres should be raised then the Nauie of <hi>England</hi> is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to defend them. And further that trafique that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>Antwerp</hi> by land is almost only from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who may with greater ease, and lesse danger transport their merchandises into <hi>England</hi> by sea. That the ill making of cloathes was fit to be redressed by the Parliament, then sitting, and the matter was then reduced to some ripenesse, the vpper house hauing one bill and the neither house ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in good forwardnesse. Neither were they so ill made but that the <hi>Flemmings</hi> did easily desire them, offering ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Pay the imposition of the <hi>Emperor</hi> then to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
            <p>That it were necessarie that the passage of ships should be staied vntill the Mart should aduance to some ripenesse, and that cloathes should be bought with the <hi>Kinges</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and conueied to <hi>Southampton</hi> to be there vttered at the Mart, which should helpe the inconuenience very well. That merchants neuer binde themselues to any mansion, which either to atchieue gaine or to auoide danger they will not readily forsake, for so they remoued from <hi>Bruges</hi> to <hi>Antwerp</hi> only for the <hi>English</hi> commodities. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing they shall haue a good commodity by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Southampton,</hi> and be rid of great feare of danger both in their liues and goods, in forsaking <hi>Antwerp,</hi> there is little feare that they will be curious in making the change.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Emperor</hi> was then so neerely driuen, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he willing to attend the impeachment of the Mart, neither could he at that time doe it, for the <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> vnder him could more hardly be without the <hi>English,</hi> then the <hi>English</hi> without them, and therefore would hardly be brought to forbeare that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, and besides they liued then in feare of loosing all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:4095:84"/>That it were good that for the present the <hi>Stilliard</hi> me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> were generally answered, and triall made whether by any gentle offer of some part of their liberties they might be brought to ship, and their wares vnto the mart. The <hi>French</hi> also might easily be drawen ouer, hauing one trafique at that time but with <hi>England.</hi> That these two might suffice to beginne a Mart.</p>
            <p>That the merchants would make good shift for their lodging, and it is not the ability of the place that maketh a mart, but the resort of Merchants, as <hi>Spaniards, Almans, Italians, Flemmings, Uenetians, Danes,</hi> in exchanging their commodities one with another. With whom also would concurre the Merchants of <hi>London, Bristowe,</hi> and other places of <hi>England,</hi> and some of the cloaths which should be carried thither at the first might be taken vp with the <hi>Kings</hi> money and there be vttered.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Bruges</hi> where the Mart was before standeth not vpon the <hi>Rheene</hi> neither doth <hi>Antwerp</hi> where the Mart was then. <hi>Frankeford</hi> doth and may well serue for a faire for high <hi>Almaine,</hi> but <hi>Southampton</hi> serueth better for all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries vpon the sea, for few of these resort to <hi>Frankeford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herewith diuerse reasons were alleaged for the Mart, and namely that the vent of <hi>English</hi> cloathes would hereby be open in all times of watre, that the <hi>English</hi> merchants goods would be out of danger of strangers, and without feare of danger of arresting vpon euery light cause. That it would much enrich the Realme, because as a Market en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth a towne, so doth a Mart enrich a Kingdome. That vpon occasion great summes of money might be borrowed of them who frequent the Mart. That the <hi>King</hi> might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a great number of strangers ships to serue in his warres. That warre being made all goods should be in the <hi>Kings</hi> danger. that the <hi>English</hi> should buy all things at the first hand of strangers. Wheras then the strangers sold their wares to the <hi>Flemings,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Flemings</hi> to the <hi>English.</hi> That
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4095:85"/>
the townes towards the sea would hereby be made more populous, rich, beautifull and strong. That the merchants insteed of Tapistrie, points, glasses and other laces, would then bring in bullion, and other substantiall merchandizes to haue the <hi>English</hi> cloath, and tinne That by this means the <hi>English</hi> should abate the power of their enimies, and not be enforced to borrow of Merchants but when they list, and that in no great quantity or summe.</p>
            <p>The time was then esteemed most conuenient, because the warres betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Emperor</hi> caused the <hi>Italians, Genowaies, Portugals,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> to forbeare their trade to <hi>Antwerp.</hi> The <hi>Prussians</hi> also and other East countries hauing 14 ships against the <hi>Emperor</hi> would not be very forward to aduenture thither. Againe the <hi>French</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uading <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and menacing <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> lying on the riuer of <hi>Rheene,</hi> did stop the course of merchants out of <hi>Italie,</hi> as well to <hi>Frankeford</hi> as to <hi>Antwerp.</hi> And further the putting of souldiers into <hi>Antwerp</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Merchants to forbeare their trafique, and to looke to their safety. Also the breach which a late tempest had made, was like to make the channell vncertaine, and the hauen naught. Lastly the stop of the exchange to <hi>Lyons</hi> would make many <hi>Flemmings</hi> bankrupts. And because these nations cannot liue without a vent. These things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying the Mart of <hi>Antwerp</hi> &amp; <hi>Frankeford</hi> they would most willingly vpon erecting a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Mart resort to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here the towne of <hi>Southampton</hi> was esteemed most sit because the <hi>Spaniards, Brittaines, Gascoins, Lombards, Genowaies, Normans, Italians,</hi> the Merchants of the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the <hi>Prussians, Danes, Swedens</hi> &amp; <hi>Norwegians</hi> might indifferently resort thither, &amp; more easie than to <hi>Antwerpe.</hi> And wheras the <hi>Flemmings</hi> hauing few commodities haue allured Merchants by their priuiledges to settle a Mart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, much more easily should the <hi>English</hi> doe it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing both opportunity &amp; meanes, as cloath, tinne, seacoale lead, bellmettall and such other commodities, as few chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4095:85"/>
countries haue the like.</p>
            <p>Lastly the meanes to establish this mart were contriued to be these. First that the <hi>English</hi> merchants should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare their resort for a mart or two beyond the seas vnder pretence of the impositions there charged vpon them. Then that proclamation should be made in diuerse parts of this Realme where Merchants chiefly resort, that there shalbe a free Mart kept at <hi>Southampton</hi> to beginne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after whitsontide and to continue fiue weekes, so as it should be noe hindrance to <hi>St</hi> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> faire at <hi>Bristow</hi> nor to <hi>Bartholomew</hi> faire in <hi>London.</hi> The priuiledges of which Mart should be expressed to be these.</p>
            <p>That all men should haue free libertie for resort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne without arresting, except in cases of treason, murther or selony. That for the time of the Mart all men should pay but halfe the custome due in other places of the Realme. That during the time noe shipping should be made from any place betweene <hi>Southwales</hi> &amp; <hi>Essex</hi> but only to <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton.</hi> That in <hi>Hampshire, Wiltshire, Sussex, Surry, Kent, Dorse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>shire,</hi> and no bargaine should be made for wares dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that time but only at that Mart. That a court should be erected to punish offendors with liberties of good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That some one commodity as happily some one kind of cloath should be assigned as proper to the Mart. That some liberties must be giuen to the inhabitants of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi> and some monies lent to them if it might be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to beginne their Trafique. That ships should attend the safegard of Merchants so well as they could, and that if this Mart tooke good effect, another might be erected at <hi>Hull</hi> for the <hi>Northeast</hi> countries, to beginne presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Sturbridge</hi> faire, so as they might returne before the great Ices stopped their seas.</p>
            <p>Thus it was concluded but the execution was for a time delaied because the wooll fleete of 60 saile, was lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore departed for <hi>Antwerp,</hi> &amp; could not possibly be called backe. But to make the first preparation because a Mart
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4095:86"/>
could not subsist without exchang<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liberty was granted to the <hi>English</hi> Merchants, to exchang and rechange money for money. As vpon this occasion this profitable purpose was first delaied, so afterwards it was altogether dashed, first by the <hi>Kinges</hi> sicknesse, after by his death.</p>
            <p>Now albeit the <hi>King</hi> was both deepely in debt, and had many extraordinary occasions, yet in regard of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome times he did forbeare to charge his subiects with such loanes and impositions as vsually in peace breed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and in turbulent times disquiet, but he chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deale with the <hi>Foulker</hi> in the <hi>low Countries</hi> for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys vpon loane at a very high rate. And hereupon letters were directed from the <hi>Lords</hi> of the counsell to the Foulker at <hi>Antwerp</hi> that he had receiued from the <hi>King</hi> 63000 punds <hi>Flemmish</hi> in Februarie, and 24000 in Aprill next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which amounted to 87000 pounds <hi>Flemmish.</hi> A faire summe to be paid in one year, especially in that busy world when it was necessarie for <hi>Princes</hi> not to be without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Hereupon and for that they vnderstood that at that time he was well able to forbeare money, they aduised the <hi>King</hi> to pay to him only 5000 pounds of the 45000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> which then remained vnpaid, and to continue the rest at the vsuall yearly interest of 14<hi rend="sup">l</hi> for euery hundred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they desired him to retaine good patience. Hereto the Foulker answered that as he had found faire dealings before, so he would rest content to deferre pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ment of 30000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> so as 20000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> thereof might be well assured to be paid within some conuenient time. All this was presently agreed, and no lesse faithfully performed afterwards. And assuredly as God is the word and cannot but make good his word, so a Prince so much looseth of his dignity as hee declineth from his word.</p>
            <p>About this time a garrison pay of 10000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> was sent to the Frontires of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the like to <hi>Calais,</hi> and in the same yeere 5000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> hereto if we adde the <hi>Kings</hi> great charges in fortification vpon both the frontires of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4095:86"/>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> the particulars wherof I omit as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now altogether of no vse, it may easily be be discerned that the hostility with <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> and the inciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Ireland</hi> were a great part of the cause which held this frugall <hi>King</hi> thus diued in debt.</p>
            <p>And for another means of raising of mony commissions went forth for selling chantry lands, and houses for paiment of the <hi>Kings</hi> debt giuen forth to be 251000 pounds sterl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the least. Also to enquire of all Church goods either remaining in Cathedrall or parish Churches or embes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>sse place of emploiment, found means to aduance themselues to so great estate as they left their posterity ranged among the nobility of this realme.</p>
            <p>Of these church purchasers, I haue seene many melt to nothing, and the residue shall be obserued either by riot or by improuidence to consume.</p>
            <p>At the same time for more assured strength of the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vpon <hi>Scotland</hi> order was setled that no man in those parts should beare two offices at once, which not well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in later years hath much derogated both from the dignity and discharge of offices aswell in state as in some inferior places.</p>
            <p>Another means for raising mony was practised no lesse pleasing to the people then profitable to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, And that was by enquiring after offences of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in great place, who as by vniust dealing they became most odious, so by iustice in their punishments, the <hi>Prince</hi> acquireth both loue and applause. And so one <hi>Beamont</hi> M<hi rend="sup">•</hi> of the Rolles was conuinced, that in his office of wardes
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4095:87"/>
he had purchased lands with the <hi>Kinges</hi> mony, also that he had lent aboue 700<hi rend="sup">l</hi> of the <hi>Kinges</hi> mony, and forborne 11000 of the <hi>Kinges</hi> debts for his owne profit. Also that being M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of the Rolles he dealt corruptly in a case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and the <hi>Lady Powes.</hi> For he bought the <hi>Ladies</hi> Tithe and caused an indenture to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> a little before decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, purposing a grant of the lands in question from <hi>Duke Charles</hi> to the <hi>Lady Powes.</hi> Also that he had concealed the felony of his seruant, who hauing stolne from him 200<hi rend="sup">l</hi> he tooke the mony to himselfe againe. Hereupon he surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the <hi>King</hi> all his offices, lands &amp; goods in satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well for the monies due by him to the <hi>King,</hi> as of the fines which his offences had merited, he was a man of a dull and heauy spirit, and therefore the more senslesly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted in his sensuall auarice.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Whalie</hi> receiuer of <hi>Yorkeshire</hi> acknowledged how he had lent the <hi>Kinges</hi> mony for gaine, how he euer paid one yeares reuenue with the arrerages of the yeare before, how he had bought the Kinges land with the Kinges mony, how he had made diuerse false accompts, how vpon fall of mony he borrowed diuerse summes, whereby he gained 500<hi rend="sup">l</hi> at one crying downe. For these misdemeanors he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred his office and submitted himselfe to pay such fines as the <hi>King</hi> or his counsell should charge vpon him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Paget</hi> Chancellor of the '<hi>Duchie</hi> was conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that he had sould the <hi>Kings</hi> landes and timber woods without commission, that he had taken great fines for the <hi>Kings</hi> lands and applied them to his proper vse, and that he had made leases in reuersion for more then xxi years, for these offences he surrendred his office and submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be fined at the pleasure of the <hi>King.</hi> So his fine was gessed at 6000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> whereof 2000 were remitted vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the other 4000 should be paid within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of that yeare.</p>
            <p>This he endured with a manly patience as knowing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4095:87"/>
right well that he held all the residue of his estate vpon cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie of those who hated him at the heart. It was at the first suspected and afterwards expected by all that among other matters obiected against the <hi>Lord Paget</hi> the chiefe or at least one should haue beene for contriuing to Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet the <hi>Lords</hi> at his house, and vnder pretence thereof to take off their heads, which was the only cause for which the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> lost his head. But because no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made thereof, because about the same time the <hi>Lord Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton, Bannister</hi> and <hi>Crane,</hi> and a little after the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Arundell</hi> were freely discharged hauing beene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned for this conspiracy, the conceit was taken that the <hi>Dukes</hi> head was the only aime, and that the residue were vsed but as a countenance of state to dazle the people.</p>
            <p>Letters were sent to the gouernor of <hi>Gernesey,</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine seruice should there be vsed according to the forme of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> A King of <hi>Armes</hi> named <hi>Vlster</hi> was newly instituted for <hi>Ireland,</hi> his prouince was all <hi>Ireland,</hi> and he was the first 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> King of Armes, the first herald appointed for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilest these matters were in action the <hi>Emperors Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador</hi> in <hi>England</hi> deliuered letters to the King from the Regent in the <hi>low Countries,</hi> importing that whereas the King was bound by a treaty betweene the <hi>Emperor</hi> and the Kinges Father at <hi>Lutrect</hi> in the yeare 1542, that if the <hi>low Countries</hi> should be inuaded the King should aide him with 5000 foote, or 70 crownes a day during 4 moneths and that this aide should be performed within one moneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter request. For so much as the <hi>French King</hi> inuaded <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> required aide of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> according to the effect of that treaty.</p>
            <p>Herevpon order was giuen that if the <hi>Embassador</hi> did moue for answere to this letter, he should be told by two of the counsell, that during the Kinges progresse his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell was dispersed, whose aduice he was desirous to heare. And further that the K. had committed the same treaty to be perused by men whose iudgments as he did much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4095:88"/>
so would he expect a time vntill their opinions might be heard. And in case that after this the <hi>Embassador</hi> should againe require an answere, then they should say that the King hauing lately wrestled out of most dangerous warres, wherewith his yong years were ouerburthened, he hoped well that the <hi>Emperor</hi> would not desire to thrust him into the like againe. That he had sworne amity with the <hi>French King</hi> which he could not with his honour breake, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the <hi>Emperor</hi> should deeme it so meete he would mediate a peace as a friend to both, which he should best effect by forbearing to vse hostility against either. And in case the <hi>Embassador</hi> should still perseuere to vrge the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they were lastly directed to answere that the King did not hold himselfe bound by that treaty, as both made by his Father and euidently preiudiciall to his real<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit agreements of peace are perpetuall &amp; bind the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, yet it is not so in agreements of society &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sederation. And this the <hi>Emperor</hi> did right well vnderstand, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King in his last warres desired to enter a new treaty with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> he returned answere that it should not need, for albeit the King were discharged by his Fathers death yet the <hi>Emperor</hi> was still bound. And againe the <hi>Emperor</hi> had not for his part performed the treaty, as well in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the carriage of horses, armor, and munition, which the King had prouided for his warres, as also in neglecting to send aide when the low <hi>Country</hi> of <hi>Calais</hi> was forraged, and therefore he did not iustly demand performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from the King.</p>
            <p>I know it hath beene often in like sort answered, that treaties dissolue by death of those who made them, for so the <hi>Fidenates</hi> held themselues discharged of the league which they had made with <hi>Romulus</hi> after his death. And the <hi>Latines</hi> did the like after the death of <hi>Tullus,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise after the death of <hi>Ancus.</hi> The <hi>Etrurians</hi> affirmed the like after the death of <hi>Priscus.</hi> And the <hi>Sabines</hi> after the death of <hi>Seruius.</hi> And againe after that <hi>Tarquinius</hi> was

cast out of state. I know also that the difference is great betweene a league of peace and a league of society &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation. But I will not touch euery string of this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which <hi>Hottoman</hi> calleth a noble question, and much tossed and debated, partly because it consisteth of many knotty and thorny distinctions, wherein approued authors doe not well agree, but chiefely because at this time it fell not to be a difference betweene the <hi>Emperor</hi> and the King.</p>
            <p>For when the <hi>Embassador</hi> first came for answere to this letter M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wotton</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hobbie</hi> answered according to the first branch of their instructions, wherewith he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted well satisfied for the present, and before he called for answere againe one <hi>Stukely</hi> arriued out of <hi>France</hi> and declared to the counsell how the <hi>French</hi> King being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that <hi>Stukely</hi> would neuer returne into <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he departed without leaue vpon apprehension of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset,</hi> his master bewraied to him that if he could procure peace with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> he intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege <hi>Calais</hi> and was in hope to carry the towne by way of the sand hills, and that from thence winning rice banke he might both famish the Towne, and beate the market place, how he further said that he intended to land in some angle of <hi>Scotland</hi> about <hi>Falmouth</hi> because boule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes there might easily be wonne, and the people were for the most part <hi>Catholiques.</hi> And further how at the same time <hi>Mounsier de Guise</hi> should enter <hi>England</hi> by the way of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not only with good leaue, but with aide and conduct from the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon this discouery the King assembled his counsell at <hi>Windesor,</hi> &amp; entred with them into deliberation, whether it were either safe from him or to no disaduantage to rely so securely either vpon the strength or faith of <hi>France,</hi> as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to refuse or neglect to afford aide vnto the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and thereby happily incurre his hostility.</p>
            <p>Many were of opinion that the King should condescend to aide the <hi>Emperor.</hi> First for that if the King were desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

to hold the <hi>Emperor</hi> bound by the treaty made with the <hi>Kinges</hi> father he must also be obliged thereby. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it was a lame halting league and could not possibly goe vpright. Then for that if the <hi>Emperor</hi> should not be aided the house of <hi>Burgundie</hi> was like to be deuoured by the <hi>French,</hi> whereby their greatnesse might grow dreadfull especi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>by as the cause was common so would there be more parties to it. And this also would moderate the charge of aiding the <hi>Emperor</hi> according to the treaty, and whensoeuer the <hi>Emperor</hi> should die or breake off, it was likely that some of those <hi>Princes</hi> and parties should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine so as the King should not stand alone. Moreouer this friendship would much advance the Kinges other affaires in <hi>Germany,</hi> and finally it would be honourable to breake with the <hi>French</hi> King vpon this common quarrell.</p>
            <p>Against this advise of the King, two obiections were made, one that the treaty must be entertained with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that it could not be speedily or secretly concluded. The other that in case the purpose should be discouered and not concluded the <hi>French</hi> might be prouoked thereby to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the like confederation against the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these the King did knit vp in this conclusion, first that the treaty should be made only with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and by the <hi>Emperors</hi> means with other <hi>Princes.</hi> Secondly that the <hi>Emperors</hi> acceptance should be well vnderstood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any treaty were either entered or entertained against the <hi>French.</hi>

Lastly he desired no more words but deeds.</p>
            <p>And now were letters returned from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pickering</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> wherby he aduertised the <hi>King</hi> how <hi>Stukely</hi> neuer discouered any of those speeches to him, which since he had charged vpon the <hi>French King.</hi> And further that he neuer was either in credite or conuersant with the <hi>French</hi> King or with the Constable, nor euer resorted vnto them except once when he was interpreter betweene the Constable &amp; certaine <hi>English</hi> pioners, wherfore as it was very like so did he verily belieue that as the <hi>French</hi> King was alwaies close &amp; reserued amongst his best knowne friends, so would he not be open and vncircumspect to impart a matter of such import to a meere stranger and in a most vnseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time.</p>

            <p>In <hi>Ianuary</hi> about the beginning of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeare of the <hi>Kings</hi> raigne his sicknesse did more apparantly shew it selfe, especially by the symptome of a tough strong strein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cough.

Some compared him with the greatest persons that had beene, both for warre and peace, because in the like pitch of yeares, none of them attained to the like perfections. Haply hee did not appeare in souldiery so great, but that was because he was not so rash, being also drawne backe from his pursu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>It hapned during his sicknesse that Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> preached before him, and in his Sermon much commended workes of charitie, which as they were a dutie for all men to performe, so most especially for men in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Kings sicknesse daily increased, and so did the Duke of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> diligence about him; for he was little absent from the King, and had alwayes some well assured to espie how the state of his health changed euery houre, and the more ioyfull hee was at the heart, the more sorrowfull appearance did he outwardly make, whether any tokens of poyson did appeare, reports are various, certainly his Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians discerned an inuincible malignitie in his disease, and the suspition did the more increase, for that the complaint being chiefly from the lights, a part as of no quicke sense, so no seat for any sharpe disease, yet his sicknesse towards the end grew highly extreme; but the Duke regarded not much the muttering multitude, knowing right well that rumours grow stale and vanish with time, and yet somewhat either to abate or delay them for the present, hee caused speeches to be spread abroad, that the King was well recouered in health, which was readily beleeued, as most desired to be true.</p>

            <p>Whilest the King remained thus grieuously sicke, diuers notable mariages were solemnized at once in <hi>Durham</hi> place; The Lord <hi>Guldford,</hi> fourth sonne to the Duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> married Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolkes</hi> eldest daughter, by <hi>Frances</hi> daughter to <hi>Mary</hi> second sister to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: also the Earle of <hi>Pembrokes</hi> eldest sonne married the Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolkes</hi> eldest daughter by the said Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> who then was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: and <hi>Martin Kayes,</hi> Gentleman Porter, married <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the third daughter of the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> by the said

               </gap>rre their hatred against the Duke, or pitie towards the King: but the Duke was nothing moued herear, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally obstinate both in purpose and desire, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hopes aboue the pitch of reason, he resolued then to dissemble no longer, but began openly to play his game.</p>
            <p>For albeit the Lady <hi>Iane</hi> married to his fourth sonne, had not right to the succession of the Crowne, for that shee was excluded, first, by the two Ladies <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> daughters of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; next, by the issue of Lady <hi>Margret</hi> married into <hi>Scotland,</hi> eldest sister to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: lastly, by her owne mother, the Ladie <hi>Frances,</hi> who then was liuing, yet <hi>Northumberland,</hi> sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mad with ouer great fortune, procured the King by his Letters Patents vnder the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> to appoint the Lady <hi>Iane</hi> to succeed him in the inheritance of the Crowne; in this contriuance he vsed the aduice of two espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, Lord chiefe Iustice <hi>Montague,</hi> who drew the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, and Secretary <hi>Cecil:</hi> these furnished the Patent with diuers reasons, whereof some were of Law and some of policie in State: The pretensions of Law were these, that albeit the Crowne of the Realme, by an Act of the fiue and thirtieth of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, was in default of his issue of his body, and of the body of <hi>Edward</hi> his sonne lawfully begotten, limited to remaine to the Lady <hi>Mary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> his eldest daughter, and to the heires of her body lawfully begotten; and in default of such issue, the remainder thereof to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> his second daughter, and to the heires of her body lawfully begotten, vnder such conditions as should be limited by the said King vnder his Letters Patents, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Seale, or by his last Will in writing, signed with his hand; yet because the said limitations were made
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4095:98"/>
to persons illegitimate, both the marriages betweene King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth and their seuerall mothers, being vndone by sentences of diuorce, and the seuerall diuorcements rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by authoritie of Parliament in the eight and thirtieth yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which Act remained then in force, both the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were thereby disabled to claime the Crowne, or any honours or hereditaments as heires to King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth or any other person.</p>
            <p>And againe, the said two Ladies, <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being but of the halfe bloud to King <hi>Edward,</hi> albeit they had beene borne in lawfull matrimony, yet by the ancient Lawes of the Realme they were not inheritable to him by descent, and had no capacitie in any degree to receiue any inheritance from him.</p>
            <p>The reasons or pretexts of necessitie to the State were these: In case the Ladie <hi>Mary</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should enioy the Crowne, they would assuredly ioyne in marriage with some stranger, who would reduce this noble and free Realme into the seruitude of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereby bring in forren customes and Lawes, abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those whereupon the rights of all natiue subiects depend, and haply the whole body of the Realme should hereby be annexed as a member to some other greater Kingdome, to the vtter subuersion of the ancient dignitie and Estate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the people were not vnlike to elect a King of some priuate Stocke, a popular and seditious man, peraduenture one who to countenance his own vnworthinesse and obscurity, would little regard what contumely he cast vpon the falling Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Kings before him; wherefore he held it the most prouident aduice, that the King by his authoritie should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, not only his next Successour, but others also in reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that the Crowne might not be subiect to risling, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to those whom hee loued, and who humoured him best.</p>
            <p>These reasons did more easily sinke into the Kings iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4095:98"/>
partly by meanes of the great affection which he bare to the Religion that he had established, of the change wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was assuredly perswaded in case the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> his sister should succeed, and partly by reason of the entire loue hee bare to his Cosin the Ladie <hi>Iane,</hi> a woman of most rare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nd incomparable perfections: For besides her excellent beautie adorned with all varietie of vertues, as a cleere skie with starres, as a princely Diadem with Iewels, shee was most deare to the King in regard both of her religion and of her education in the knowledge of the liberall Sciences, and skill in Languages, for in Theologie, in Philosophie, in all liberall Arts, in the Latine and Greeke tongues, and in the Vulgar Languages of diuers neere Nations; shee farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all of her sex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and any of her yeares, vnlesse haply the King himselfe.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the King consented that Letters Patents should be drawne, importing that in case the King should die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out issue of his bodie lawfully begotten, then the Imperiall Crowne of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with his title to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and all things to them belonging should remaine and come to the eldest sonne of the Ladie <hi>Frances,</hi> daughter to the Ladie <hi>Mary,</hi> youngest sister to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in case such issue should be borne into the world, during the life of King <hi>Edward;</hi> and after to the heires male of the said issue, and in like sort from sonne to sonne of the said Ladie <hi>Frances</hi> lawfully begotten, as they should be in prioritie of birth, and borne during the Kings life; and in default of such sonnes and of heires male of euery such sonne lawfully begotten, that then the said Crowne and all the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Lastly, for that her children borne, and to be borne, were so carefully and orderly remembred, and no mention made of herselfe, from whom their title must be deriued, yet these Letters were subscribed by all the Priuic Counsellours, the greatest part both of number and power of the Nobilitie of the Realme, the Bishops, the Kings learned Councell, and all the Iudges at the Common Law, except only Sir <hi>Iames Holles,</hi> one of the Iustices of the Common Pleas, a man well obserued to be both religious and vpright, who worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to subscribe, and was vnworthily requited by Queene <hi>Mary</hi> afterwards.</p>
            <p>It is very like that some of these were guided with respect of their particular interest, for that they were possessed of diuers lands which once pertained to Monasteries, Chantries, and other religions houses not long before dissolued, of these they held themselues in some danger to lose, in case religion should change to the ancient forme, which by succession of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> they did euidently fore-see.</p>
            <p>Others were drawne partly by feare, and partly by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who then was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding poten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4095:100"/>
was resolued that the Physitians should be discharged, and the cure committed to her alone: the apparant defect both of her iudgement and experience, ioyned to the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the aduenture, caused many to maruell, and some deeply to suspect that shee was but an instrument of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; this surmise was strongly confirmed within a very short time ensuing, when the King did fall into desperate extremities, his vitall parts were mortally stuffed, which brought him to a difficultie of speech and of breath, his legs swelled, his pulse failed, his skin changed colour, and many other horrid symptomes appeared.</p>
            <p>Then were the Physitians called againe, who espying him in that fearefull estate, departed from him with a sad silence, leauing him to the miserable mercy of neere approaching death, some of these whispered among their priuate friends, that they were called for fashion only, but neither their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice nor appliances were any deale regarded, but the King had beene ill dealt with more than once, and that when by the benefit, both of his youth and of carefull meanes, there was faire means of his recouery, he was againe more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerlaid.</p>
            <p>Yet as crueltie and wrong neuer stand secure, so the Duke thought one thing more expedient for assuring his designes, and that was to draw the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> wholly into his power: to this purpose Letters were directed to her in the Kings name from the Councell, willing her forth with to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to the King, as well to be a comfort to him in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as to see all matters well ordered about him; the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die suspecting no lurking mischiefe, addressed herselfe with all speed to the iourney, expressing great ioy, that either her company or her seruice, should be esteemed needfull to the King; but as she was vpon the way, and within halfe a daies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
