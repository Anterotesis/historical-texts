            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HENRY, Earl of Rumney, Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

Lord-Warden of the Cinque-Ports.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BE pleas'd, from your humble and most oblig'd
Servant, to accept this Off-spring of my Muse,
which I am the more incourag'd to lay at your Feet,
because it formerly had the Honour to be look'd upon
with a gracious Regard by the <hi>best of Queens, of late
happy and glorious Memory,</hi> before whom it had been
presented in her Court, if the ensuing <hi>National Fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
had not, in the interim, unfortunately happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
however, not to let it be intirely a Prey to ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny,
I have, with great Care and Pains, at last, made
shift to strip it from its Mourning, into a Dress
proper to be seen by the Town, tho' it may want
that Illustration which the Court-Ornament had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
it with: And therefore most humbly beg your
<hi>Lordship</hi> to make one Addition more to the many repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Condescentions and Favours you have conferr'd on
me, which is, to let it be honour'd with a Place in
your Esteem; and then I shall never have occasion to
value what Malice, Ill-nature, or any unjust Criticism,
shall inveterately expose to its Prejudice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:30283:3"/>
You are one, <hi>my Lord,</hi> that all Eyes are so much
upon, all Hearts so much inclin'd to honour, serve,
and love, and all Pens so oblig'd and ready to praise,
that, tho' my Heart be as full of desire to do it as is
possible, yet I find there is no place left void for me
to express my Duty; there is nothing to be said, which
has not been already, and perhaps too with more Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
on the Writer's side, than I have Partiality
enough for my self to pretend to.</p>
            <p>There is another significant Reason too, <hi>my Lord,</hi>
which wholly deters me from the common Custom of
<hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Dedicators,</hi> which is, your Scorn and Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of Flattery, wherein you nobly imitate the
Royal Inclination and Humour of our Glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> who never fail'd to shew
his frowning Dislike of that <hi>Frenchified</hi> Vice, nor ever
gave Incouragement for its Seeds to be planted and
grow in his Dominions: To whom I wish Eternal
Honour, Successful Victory, and Long Life: And that
you, <hi>my Lord,</hi> in reward of your Indefatigable Duty,
Care and Zeal for his Service, may always be happy
in the Station you now are in. The Blessing of his
Smiles and Favour, is the Perpetual Wish of,</p>

            <l>Lest you are Damn'd yourselves these devilish Times;</l>

            <l>You'd hear the Parson oftner than you do;</l>

            <l>Little did I think, in that Station, new,</l>
            <l>To find so much Acquaintance 'mongst that Crew;</l>
            <l>But there they were! A sad Tale, but 'tis true;</l>

            <l>The Cit, the Lawyer, and the Soldier bold,</l>

            <l>'Twas answer'd, No: But he was sure to come.</l>
            <l>Shock'd at that News, I ran away, for fear;</l>

            <l>Take good Example then, and mend your Lives;</l>
            <l>Beat all your Whores, good Sirs, and Buss your Wives;</l>
            <l>On Wit no more a barbrous Censure pass,</l>
            <l>But let Good-nature shew that you have Grace;</l>

                  <p>Why then, Odsheartlikins, I must say that this <hi>Iupiter</hi> is of all
the rest, the most powerful: when he's pleas'd, the World rejoyces, but
bless us, when he's angry, Oh! how I tremble at his Lightning and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <p>Oh! Lord, did you ever hear such a damn'd silly puppy, come you
shall hear me tell the whole story of him. Look ye, this same <hi>Iupiter</hi> you
must know being sent as soon as he was born, away by his Mother, amongst
the <hi>Couribaates,</hi> a sort of poor fellows that belong'd to Powder-mills, for
fear his greedy gut Father <hi>Saturn,</hi> who us'd to breakfast on all his Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brats,
should eat him, got the knack there of making Sky-Rockets, Squibbs,
and such like, and now when the maggot bites him, he's always whizzing
and popping 'em about, and this poor Animal takes 'em for Lightning and
Thunder; ha, ha, ha. Heark ye, Neighbour <hi>Hob,</hi> bid him tell us e're a
one of his friend <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s good deeds, and then you shall see how I'll
feague him.</p>

                  <speaker>Clout.</speaker>
                  <p>Good Deeds; why I heard he conquer'd the monstrous Giants,
which I think folks call <hi>Titau</hi>'s, and releas'd his old Father from Prison.</p>
