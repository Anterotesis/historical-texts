            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T made <hi>S. Chrysostom</hi> tremble when ever he reflected on the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which those that went the <hi>narrow</hi> way, bore to those which marched in the <hi>broad,</hi> how <hi>many</hi> were the Called, &amp; how <hi>few</hi> the Chosen, how many they were that were created for and in a capacitie of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beatitude, and how few attained it. This consideration certainly would make a man look upon the holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> among <hi>Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> as the greatest indulgence of heaven, being all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections it hath been pleased to afford poor <hi>man</hi> in so difficult a journey as that of his eternal bliss or miserie.
<pb facs="tcp:62168:3"/>
But when a man cometh to look into those transcendent writings, he finds them to be the works of a sort of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent harmless men, that had little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance or familiaritie with the world, and consequently not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in the troubles and quarrels of several Countries; That though they are all but necessarie, yet were they written occasionally, rather than out of design; and lastly, that their main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is, to abstract man from this world, and to perswade him to preferr the bare hope of what he can neither <hi>see, hear,</hi> nor <hi>conceive,</hi> before all the present enjoyments this world can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. This begat a reverence and esteem to them in all those who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to work out their salvation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of renouncing the world, they endeavour to raise themselves into the greatest promotions, leisure, and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urie; that they make them the decoys of the people, to carrie on designes and intriques of State, and studie the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this world more than any other people, he will find some grounds to conclude, the practices of such men to be the greatest disturbance, burden, and vexation of the Christian part of the world. The complaint is as true as sad; Instead of acquainting the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous vulgar, with the main end of their functions, and the great business of their embassy, what a great measure of felicitie is prepared for them, and how easily it may be forfeited? they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve their consciences in the bryars of a thousand needless scruples, they spin out volumes out of half sentences, nay, out of points and accents, and raise endless Controversies about things (were men free from passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:62168:4"/>
prejudice) in themselves clear enough, and when they have canvas'd their questions, till they are wearie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and have wearied hearers, and readers, and all they have to do with, every one sits down under his own vine, and hugs his own apprehensions, so that after all their pains, bandings, and implacable adhesion to parties, the inconvenience remains still, and we as far from any solid conviction, as at first setting out.</p>
            <p>The Controversies betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Reformation,</hi> are long since beaten out of the pit, by other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>batants of their own brood, so that if we speak of <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Catholick,</hi> they are in a manner content to sit down with their present acquests; for as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction he certainly is a rare <hi>Proso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> at whose conversion, <hi>interest, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, discontent, inclination,</hi> are not admitted to the debate.</p>
            <p>But to come yet nearer our purpose,
<pb facs="tcp:62168:4"/>
Let us consider our own fractions, of fractions of <hi>Religion</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> where if that saying, That, <hi>It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to live where nothing is lawfull, than where all things,</hi> be as true in <hi>Religion</hi> as <hi>Policie,</hi> Posteritie may haply feel the sad consequence of it. What I pray is the effect of so many <hi>sermons, teachings, preachings, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,</hi> and <hi>exercising of gifts, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, disputations, conferences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, Printed books,</hi> written with so much distraction and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon God Almightie, and abuse of his holy Word? Marry this, It is the seminarie of a many vexatious, endless and fruitless controversies, the consequence whereof, are jealousies, heart-burnings, exasperation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the introduction of factions, and National quarrels into matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and consequently all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of war and devastation. Besides, they are good lawfull diversions for
<pb facs="tcp:62168:5"/>
the duller sort of <hi>Citizens,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract diseases for want of motion; They supply the building of Pyramids a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by diverting the thoughts of the people from matters of State, and consequently from Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>They find work for <hi>Printers,</hi> &amp;c. if the parties interessed are troubled with the itch of popularitie, and will suffer themselves to be scratch'd out of somewhat by way of Contribution to the Impression. Hence are the <hi>Stationer's</hi> shop furnished, and thence the <hi>Minister's</hi> studie in the Countrey, who, having found out the humour of his auditorie, consults with his Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, on what Books his money is best bestowed, who very gravely, it may be, will commend <hi>Cole</hi> upon the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> before the excellent (but borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>Caryll</hi> upon <hi>Job.</hi> But as to any matter of conviction, we see every one <hi>acquiesces</hi> in his own sentiments,
<pb facs="tcp:62168:5"/>
every one hears the Teacher who is most to his humour, and when he hath been at Church, and pretends to have sat at his feet, comes home &amp; censures him as he pleases.</p>
            <p>To be yet a little more particular, what shall we think of those vast and involuble volumes concerning <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination, Free-wil, Free-grace, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Reprobation,</hi> &amp;c. which fill, not onely our Libraries, but the world with their noise and disturbance, whereof the least thing we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect is <hi>conviction;</hi> every side endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make good their own grounds, and keep the cudgels in their hands as long as they can? What Stir is there between the <hi>Molinists</hi> and <hi>Jansenists</hi> about <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Merits,</hi> and yet both pretend <hi>S. Augustin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Must we not expect, that the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits will, were it for no other end but to vindicate that reputation of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have obtained in the world,
<pb facs="tcp:62168:6"/>
endeavour to make good their Tenets, though the other were the truer opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is Truth then retired to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible rock that admits no repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? or are we all turn'd <hi>Ixion's,</hi> and instead of enjoying that <hi>Juno,</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our selves with the <hi>clouds</hi> of our own perswasions, of which unnatural coition, what other issue can there be but <hi>Centaurs</hi> and monstrous opinions? To these questions I shall not presume to answer, but in the words of this great Author, who answering the charge of <hi>Impietie,</hi> laid upon the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Necessitie,</hi> says thus; <hi>If we consider the greatest part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, not as they should be, but as they are, that is, as men, whom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the studie of acquiring</hi> wealth and preferment, <hi>or whom the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of</hi> sensual delights, <hi>or the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of</hi> meditating, <hi>or the</hi> rash <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of</hi> wrong <hi>Principles, have made unapt to discuss the</hi> truth <hi>of things, I must confess,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62168:6"/>Certainly we have some reason to expect an effectual cure from this man, since he hath so fortunately found out the disease. Now if he in so few sheets hath performed more than all the voluminous works of the <hi>Priests &amp; Ministers,</hi> and that in points of soul-concernment and Christian interest, as <hi>Predestination, Free-will, Grace, Merits, Election, Reprobation, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,</hi> and <hi>Libertie</hi> of actions, and others, the main hinges of human <hi>Salvation,</hi> and to do this, being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whom not onely the aversness of his nature to engage himself in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Controversie of this kind, but his severer studie of the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> might justly exempt from any such skirmishes; We may not stick to infer, that the <hi>Black-Coats,</hi> generally taken, are a sort of ignorant <hi>Tinkers,</hi> who in matters of their own profession, such as is the <hi>mending</hi> and <hi>sodering</hi> of mens <hi>consciences,</hi> have made more
<pb facs="tcp:62168:7"/>
               <hi>holes</hi> than they sound; nay, what makes them more impardonable, they have neither the gratitude nor inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie to acknowledge this repairer of their breaches, and assertor of their reputation, who hath now effected what they all this while have been tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about. I know this Author is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beholding to the <hi>Ministers,</hi> &amp; they make a great part of the Nation, and besides them, I know there are a many illiterate, obstinate, and inconvincible spirits, yet I dare advance this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, how bold soever it may seem to some; That this Book, how little and contemptible soever it may seem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more evidence and conviction in the matters it treats of, than all the volumes, nay Libraries, which the <hi>Priests, Jesuits,</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> have, to our great charge, distraction, and loss of precious time, furnished us with. Which if so, I shall undertake for any rational man, That all the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sial
<pb facs="tcp:62168:7"/>
Labors concerning Religion in the world, all the Polemical Treatises of the most antient or modern, shall never breed any maggots of scruples, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactions in his brains, nor shall his eyes or head ever ake with turning them over, but he shall be so resolved in mind, as never to importune God Almighty with impertinent addresses, nor ever become any of those Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical <hi>spiritati,</hi> who as the most Learned M. <hi>White</hi> says, <hi>expound Scripture without sence or reason,</hi> (and are not to be disputed with, but with the same success<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as men write on sand) and trouble their neighbours with their dreams, revelations, and spiritual whimsies. No; here is solid conviction, at least, so far as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical Mysteries of our Religion will admit. If God be <hi>omnipotent,</hi> he is <hi>irresistible;</hi> if so, <hi>just</hi> in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though we (who have as much capacitie to measure the justice of
<pb facs="tcp:62168:8"/>
Gods actions as a man born blind to judge of colours) haply may not discern it. What then need any man trouble his head whether he be Predestinated or no? Let him live justly and honestly according to the <hi>Religion</hi> of his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> and refer himself to God for the rest, since he is the Potter, and may do what he please with the vessel. But I leave the Reader to finde his satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Treatise it self, since it may be I derogate from it by saying so much before it. This Book, I doubt not will find no worse entertainment than the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> both in regard of its bulk, and that it doth not strike so home at the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> partie as that did. And yet here we must complain of want of sufficiencie or ingenuitie, to acknowledge the truths, or confute the errors of that book, which till it is done, we shall not count the Author an Heretick. On this side the sea, besides the dirt and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had once resolved to answer my <hi>Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> Objections to my Book <hi>De</hi> CIVE in the first place as that which concerns me most, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to examine his discourse of LIBERTY and NECSSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, which (because I had never uttered my opinion of it) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me the less. But seeing it was your Lordships and my Lord Bishops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that I should begin with the <hi>latter,</hi> I was contented so to do, and here I present and submit it to your Lordships judgement.</p>
            <p>And first I assure your Lordship
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62168:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I finde in it no new argument nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Scripture</hi> nor from <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> that I have not often heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is as much as to say, I am not surprized.</p>
            <p>The <hi>preface</hi> is a handsome one, but it appeareth even in that, that he hath mistaken the question. For whereas he sayes thus, <hi>If I be free to write this discourse, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Cause,</hi> I deny that to be true, for 'tis enough to his freedom of writing, that he had not written it unless he would himself. If he will obtain the cause, he must prove that before he writ it, it was not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it afterward. It may be his Lordship thinks it all one to say; <hi>I was free</hi> to write it, and <hi>It was not necessary</hi> I should write it, but I think otherwise; for he is <hi>free</hi> to do a thing that may do it if he have the will to do it, and may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, if he have the will to forbear.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62168:10"/>
And yet if there be a <hi>necessity</hi> that he shall have the <hi>will</hi> to do it, the action is necessarily to follow; and if there be a <hi>necessity</hi> that he shall have the <hi>will</hi> to forbear, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing also will be necessary. The Question therefore is not whether a <hi>man</hi> be a <hi>free Agent,</hi> that is to say, whether he can write or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, speak or be silent according to his <hi>will,</hi> but whether the <hi>will</hi> to write and the <hi>will</hi> to forbear come upon him according to his <hi>will,</hi> or according to any thing else in his own power. I acknowledge this <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> that I <hi>can</hi> do if I <hi>will,</hi> but to say, I can <hi>will</hi> if I <hi>willt.</hi> I take to be an absurd speech, wherefore I cannot grant my Lord the cause upon his <hi>preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place he maketh cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain distinctions of <hi>Libertie,</hi> and saies he meaneth not <hi>Libertie</hi> from <hi>sin,</hi> nor from <hi>servitude,</hi> nor from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62168:11"/>
               <hi>violence,</hi> but from <hi>Necessitie Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation, inevitabilitie,</hi> and <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had been better to <hi>define Liberty</hi> than thus to <hi>distinguish,</hi> for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand never the more what he means by <hi>Libertie,</hi> and though he say he means <hi>Libertie</hi> from <hi>necessitation,</hi> yet I understand not how such a <hi>Libertie</hi> can be, and tis a taking of the Question without proof, for what is else the Question between us, but whether <hi>such</hi> a Liberty be possible or not?</p>
            <p>There are in the same place other distinctions, as a Liberty of <hi>Exercise onely</hi> (which he calls a <hi>Libertie of contradiction,</hi> namely of doing not good or evil <hi>simply,</hi> but of doing this or that good, or this or that evil <hi>respestively</hi>) and a <hi>Libertie of specification and exercise also</hi> (which he calls a Liberty of <hi>contrarietie</hi>) namely a Liberty not onely to do
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62168:11"/>
good or evil, but also to do or not do this or that good or evil.</p>
            <p>And with these <hi>Distinctions</hi> his Lordship saies he <hi>clears the coast,</hi> whereas in truth, he darkneth his own meaning and the Question, not onely with the jargon of <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise onely, specification also, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, contrarietie,</hi> but also with pretending distinction where none is; For how is it possible that the <hi>Libertie</hi> of doing or not doing this or that good or evil, can consist (as he saies it does in God and good Angels) without a Liberty of doing or not doing good or evil?</p>
            <p>The next thing his Lordship does, after clearing of the coast, is the dividing of his forces (as he calls them) into <hi>two</hi> squadrons, <hi>one</hi> of places of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Reasons,</hi> which allegory he useth I suppose, because he addresseth the discourse to your Lordship, who is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62168:12"/>
military man, All that I have to say touching this is, that I observe a great part of those his <hi>forces</hi> do look and <hi>march</hi> another way, and some of them <hi>fight</hi> amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>And the first place of <hi>Scripture</hi> taken from <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.14. Is one of those that look another way; the words are. <hi>If a wife make a vow it is left to her husbands choice either to establish it or make it void.</hi> For it proves no more but that the husband is a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary Agent,</hi> but not that his <hi>choice</hi> therein is not <hi>necessitated</hi> or not <hi>determined</hi> to what he shall choose, by precedent <hi>necessary</hi> causes.</p>
            <p>For if there come into the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands minde greater good by esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing than abrogating such a vow, the establishing will follow necessarily, and if the evil that will follow in the husbands opinion out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the good, the contrary must
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62168:12"/>
needs follow, and yet in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ones <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the nature of <hi>Election.</hi> So that a man may both choose this, and cannot but choose this, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>choosing</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> are joyned together.</p>
            <p>The second place of Scripture is <hi>Joshua</hi> 24.15. The third is 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.12. whereby 'tis clearly proved, that there is <hi>election</hi> in <hi>man,</hi> but not proved, that such <hi>election</hi> was not <hi>necessitated</hi> by the <hi>hopes,</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> and considerations of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> to follow, which depend not on the <hi>will,</hi> nor are subject to <hi>election.</hi> And therefore one answer serves all such places, if there were a thousand.</p>
            <p>But his Lordship supposing, it seems, I might answer as I have done, that <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>election</hi> might stand together, and instance in the actions of <hi>children, fools,</hi> or <hi>bruit beasts,</hi> whose <hi>fancies,</hi> I might say, are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62168:13"/>
               <hi>necessitated</hi> and <hi>determined</hi> to <hi>one</hi>; before these his proofs out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture desires to prevent that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and therefore saies that the actions of <hi>children, fools, mad men,</hi> and <hi>beasts,</hi> are indeed <hi>determined,</hi> but that they proceed not from <hi>election,</hi> nor from <hi>free,</hi> but from <hi>Spontaneous Agents.</hi> As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that the <hi>Bee,</hi> when it maketh hony, does it <hi>Spontaneously,</hi> and when the <hi>Spider</hi> makes his web, he does it <hi>Spontaneously</hi> but not by <hi>election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though I never meant to ground my Answer upon the experience of what <hi>Children, Fools, Mad men,</hi> and <hi>Beasts</hi> do, yet that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship may understand what can be meant by <hi>Spontaneous,</hi> and how it differeth from <hi>voluntary,</hi> I will answer that <hi>distinction,</hi> and shew that it <hi>fighteth</hi> against its fellow Arguments.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship therefore is to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62168:13"/>
consider, that all <hi>voluntary</hi> actions, where the thing that induceth the <hi>will</hi> is not <hi>fear,</hi> are called also <hi>spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous,</hi> and said to be done by a mans <hi>own</hi> accord. As when a man giveth money voluntarily to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Merchandise or out of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he is said to do it of his own accord, which in <hi>latine</hi> is <hi>sponte,</hi> and therefore the action is <hi>sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi> (though to give ones mony willingly to a thief to a void killing, or throw it into the Sea to avoid drowning, where the motive is <hi>fear,</hi> be not called <hi>spontaneous.</hi>) But every <hi>spontaneous</hi> action is not therefore <hi>voluntary,</hi> for <hi>voluntary</hi> presupposes some precedent <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> that is to say, some <hi>conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and <hi>meditation,</hi> of what is likely to <hi>follow,</hi> both upon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abstaining from the action deliberated of; whereas many acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are done of our <hi>own</hi> accord,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62168:14"/>
and are therefore <hi>spontaneous,</hi> for which nevertheless, as my Lord thinks, we never <hi>consulted</hi> nor <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated</hi> in our selves. As when making no question nor any the least doubt in the world, but the thing we are about is good, we <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>walk,</hi> or in anger <hi>strike</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> which my Lord thinks <hi>spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous,</hi> but not <hi>voluntary</hi> nor <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> actions, and with <hi>such</hi> kinde of actions he saies <hi>necessitation</hi> may stand, but not with such as are <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> and proceed upon <hi>election</hi> and <hi>deliberation.</hi> Now if I make it appear to your Lordship, that those actions, which he saies, proceed from <hi>spontanity,</hi> and which he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to <hi>Children, Fools, Madmen</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> proceed from <hi>election</hi> and <hi>deliberation,</hi> and that actions <hi>inconsiderate, rash,</hi> and <hi>spontaneous</hi> are ordinarily found in those, that are by themselves and many more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62168:14"/>
thought as <hi>wise,</hi> or wiser than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily men are, then my Lord Bishops Argument concludeth, that <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>election</hi> may stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which is contrary to that which he intendeth by all the rest of his Arguments to prove.</p>
            <p>And first your Lordships own experience furnishes you with proof enough, that <hi>Horses, Doggs,</hi> and other Bruit <hi>Beasts,</hi> do <hi>demur</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon the way they are to take, the Horse retiring from some strange figure that he sees, and coming on again to avoid the spur. And what else doth a man that <hi>deliberateth,</hi> but one while <hi>proceed</hi> toward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, another while <hi>retire</hi> from it, as the <hi>hope</hi> of greater <hi>good</hi> draws him, or the <hi>fear</hi> of greater evil <hi>drives</hi> him away.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Child</hi> may be so young as to do what it does without all <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> but that is but till it have the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62168:15"/>
chance to be hurt by doing of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, or till it be of age to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the rod, for the actions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath once had a check, shall be <hi>deliberated</hi> on the second time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Madmen</hi> manifestly <hi>deliberate</hi> no less than the <hi>wisest</hi> men, though they make not so good a <hi>choice,</hi> the images of things being by disease altered.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Bees</hi> and <hi>Spiders,</hi> if my Lord Bishop had had so little to do as to be a spectatour of their actions, he would have confessed not onely <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> but <hi>art, prudence</hi> and <hi>policy</hi> in them, very near equal to that of mankinde. Of <hi>Bees, Aristotle</hi> saies, <hi>their life is Civil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, his Lordship is deceived if he think any <hi>spontaneous</hi> action after once being checked in it, differs from an action <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>elective,</hi> for even the setting of a mans foot, in the posture for <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62168:15"/>
and the action of ordinary <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was once <hi>deliberated</hi> of how and when it should be done, and though afterward it became <hi>easie</hi> &amp; <hi>habitual</hi> so as to be done without <hi>fore-thought,</hi> yet that does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that the act is <hi>voluntary</hi> and proceedeth from <hi>election.</hi> So also are the <hi>rashest</hi> actions of <hi>cholerick</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>voluntary</hi> and upon <hi>delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for who is there but very young children, that hath not <hi>considered</hi> when and how farr he <hi>ought,</hi> or safely <hi>may</hi> strike or revile? Seeing then his Lordship agrees with me that such actions are <hi>necessitated,</hi> and the <hi>fancie</hi> of those that do them <hi>determined</hi> to the action they do, it follows, out of his Lordships own doctrine, that the liberty of <hi>election</hi> does not take away the <hi>necessitie</hi> of <hi>electing</hi> this or that <hi>individual</hi> thing. And thus one of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fights against another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62168:16"/>The 2 Argument from <hi>Scripture</hi> consisteth in histories of men that did one thing, when if they would, they might have done another, the places are two. One is 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.11. where the history saies, God was pleased that <hi>Solomon,</hi> who might if he would, have asked <hi>Riches,</hi> or <hi>Revenge,</hi> did nevertheless aske <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> at Gods hands; the other is the words of S. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias,</hi> Acts 5.4. <hi>After it was sold, was it not in thine own power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the answer is the same with that I answered to the former places, that they prove there is <hi>elction,</hi> but do not disprove the <hi>necessity,</hi> which I maintain of what they so elect.</p>
            <p>The fourth Argument (for to the 3 and fifth I shall make but one answer) is to this effect. <hi>If the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, or his foreknowledge, or the influence of the stars, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of causes, or the physical or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62168:16"/>
moral efficacy of causes, or the last dictate of the understanding, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be, do take away true liberty, then</hi> Adam <hi>before his fall had no true liberty. Quicquid ostendes mihi sic incredulus odi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> which I say <hi>necessitateth and determinateth every action,</hi> (that his Lordship may no longer doubt of my meaning) is the <hi>summ of all things, which being now existent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and concurr to the production of that action hereafter, whereof if any one thing now were wanting, the effect could not be produced.</hi> This <hi>concourse</hi> of <hi>causes,</hi> whereof every one is <hi>determined</hi> be such as it is by a like concourse of <hi>former</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, may well be called (in respect they were all set and ordered by the eternal cause of all things, God Almighty) the <hi>Decree</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>But that the <hi>foreknowledge</hi> of God should be a cause of any thing,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62168:17"/>
cannot be truely said, seeing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge is knowledge, and knowledge depends on the exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the things known and not they on it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>influence of the Starres</hi> is but a small part of the whole cause, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the concourse of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
            <p>Nor does the <hi>concourse of all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> make one simple <hi>chain</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catination, but an innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of chains, joyned together, not in all parts, but in the first link God Almighty, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the whole cause of an event, doth not always depend on one single chain, but on many together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Natural</hi> efficacy of <hi>objects</hi> does <hi>determine voluntary</hi> Agents and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitates</hi> the <hi>will,</hi> and consequently the <hi>action</hi>; but for <hi>moral</hi> efficacy, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not what he means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The last dictate of the judgement,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62168:17"/>
concerning the good or bad that may follow on any action, is not properly the <hi>whole cause,</hi> but the last part of it, and yet may be said to Produce the effect <hi>necessarily,</hi> in such manner as the last feather may be said to break a horses back, when there were so many laid on before as there wanted but that one to do it.</p>
            <p>Now for his <hi>Argument</hi> that <hi>if the concourse of all the causes necessitate the effect, that then it follows,</hi> Adam <hi>had no true liberty,</hi> I deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, for I make not onely the <hi>effect,</hi> but also the <hi>election</hi> of that particular effect <hi>necessary,</hi> in as much as the will it self, &amp; each propension of a man during his deliberation, is as much necessitated, and depends on a sufficient cause as any thing else whatsoever. As for example, it is no more necessary that fire should burn than that a man or other creature,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62168:18"/>
whose limbs be moved by fancy, should have <hi>election,</hi> that is <hi>liberty,</hi> to do what he hath a fancy to do, though it be not in his <hi>will</hi> or <hi>power</hi> to <hi>choose</hi> his <hi>fancie,</hi> or choose his <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This doctrine, because my Lord Bishop saies he hates, I doubt had better been suppressed, as it should have been, if both your Lordship and he had not pressed me to an answer.</p>
            <p>The Arguments of greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, are the third and the fifth, and they fall both into one, namely; <hi>If there be a necessity of all events, that it will follow, That praise and reprehension, and reward and punishment are all vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, and that if God should openly forbid, and secretly necessitate the same action, punishing men for what they could not avoid, there would be no belief among them of Heaven and Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62168:18"/>To oppose hereunto I must bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row an answer from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9.11. From the 11 <hi>verse</hi> of the Chapter to the 18 is laid down the very same objection in these words. <hi>When they</hi> (meaning <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob) were yet unborn, and had done neither good nor evil, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God according to election, not by works, but by him that calleth, might remain firm, it was said unto her (viz</hi> Rebecca) <hi>that the elder should serve the younger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What then shall we say? Is there injustice with God? God forbid. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy. For the Scripture saith to Pharaoh, I have stirred thee up that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be set forth in all the earth. Therefore whom God willeth he hath mercy on, and whom he willeth he hardeneth.</hi> Thus you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62168:19"/>
see the case put by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> is the same with that of my Lord Bishop, and the same objection in these words following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou wilt aske me then, why does God yet complain, for who hath resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this therefore the Apostle answers, not by denying it was Gods <hi>will,</hi> or that the decree of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Esau</hi> was not before he had sinned, or that <hi>Esau</hi> was not necessitated to do what he did; but thus; <hi>Who art thou O man that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatest God? shall the work say to the workman, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay, of the same stuff to make one vessel to honour another to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi> According therefore to this answer of S. <hi>Paul</hi> I answer my Lords Ojection, and say, the <hi>power</hi> of God alone without other helps is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>justification</hi> of any action he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62168:19"/>
doth. That which men make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves here by pacts and covenants, and call by the name of justice, and according whereunto men are accounted and tearmed rightly just or unjust, is not that by which God Almighties actions are to be measured or called just, no more than his counsels are to be measured by humane wisdom. That which he does is made just by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, just I say in him, though not always just in us.</p>
            <p>For a man that shall command a thing openly, and plot secretly the hinderance of the same, if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he punish him that he so commandeth for not doing it, it is unjust. So also, his counsels are therefore not in vain, because they be his, whether we see the use of them or not. When God afflicted <hi>Job,</hi> he did object no sin unto him, justified his afflicting of him by telling him of his <hi>power. Hast
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62168:20"/>
thou, saith God, an arm like mine? Where wert thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? and the like.</hi> So our <hi>Saviour,</hi> concerning the man that was born blinde, said it was not for his sin, or for his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents sin, but that the power of God might be shewn in him. <hi>Beasts</hi> are subject to death and torments, yet they cannot sin, it was Gods will they should be so. <hi>Power irresistible justifies all actions, really and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> in whomsoever it be found, less power does not, and because such power is in God onely, he must needs be just in all his actions, and we, that not comprehending his Counsels call him to the Barr, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit injustice in it.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant of the usual reply to this answer, by distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between <hi>will</hi> and <hi>permission,</hi> as that God Almighty does indeed sometimes <hi>permit</hi> sins, and that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62168:20"/>
also foreknoweth that the sin he permitteth shall be committed, but does not <hi>will</hi> it, nor <hi>necessitate</hi> it.</p>
            <p>I know also they distinguish the action from the sin of the action, saying, that God Almighty does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cause the <hi>action</hi> whatsoever action it be, but not the <hi>sinfullness</hi> or <hi>irregularity</hi> of it, that is, the <hi>discordance</hi> between the <hi>action</hi> and the <hi>Law.</hi> Such distinctions as these dazle my understanding; I finde no difference between the <hi>will</hi> to have a thing done, and the <hi>permission</hi> to do it, when he that permitteth can hinder it, and knows that it will be done unless he hinder it. Nor finde I any difference between an <hi>action</hi> &amp; the <hi>sin</hi> of that action, as for example, between the killing of <hi>Vriah,</hi> and the sin of <hi>David</hi> in killing <hi>Vriah,</hi> nor when <hi>one</hi> is <hi>cause</hi> both of the <hi>Action</hi> and of the <hi>Law,</hi> how <hi>another</hi> can, because
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62168:21"/>
of the <hi>disagreement</hi> between them, no more than how one man making a longer and a shorter garment, another can make the inequality that is between them. This I know, God cannot sin, because his doing a thing makes it just and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, no sin, as also because whatsoever can sin is subject to anothers Law, which God is not. And therefore 'tis blasphemy to say God can sin; but to say, that God can so order the world, as a sin may be necessarily caused thereby in a man, I do not see how it is any dishonour to him. Howsoever, if such or other <hi>distinctions</hi> can make it clear, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not think <hi>Esaus</hi> or <hi>Pharaohs</hi> actions proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>purpose</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or that proceeding from his will, could not therefore without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice be blamed or punished, I will, assoon as I understand them,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62168:21"/>
turn unto my Lords Opinion, for I now hold nothing in all this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion betwixt us, but what seemeth to me, not obscurely, but most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely said in this place by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> And thus much in answer to his places of Scripture.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To the Arguments from Reason.</head>
               <p>OF the Arguments from <hi>Reason,</hi> the first is that which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship saith is drawn from <hi>Zeno's</hi> beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his man, which is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Argumentum baculinum,</hi> that is to say, a wooden Argument. The sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is this, <hi>Zeno</hi> held, that all actions were necessary, his man therefore being for some fault beaten, excused himself upon the necessity of it, to avoid this excuse, his Master pleaded likewise the necessity of beating
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62168:22"/>
him. So that not he that maintained, but he that derided the necessity, was beaten, contrary to that his Lordship would inferr. And the Argument was rather withdrawn than drawn from the story.</p>
               <p>The second Argument is taken from certain inconveniences which his Lordship thinks would follow such an opinion. It is true that ill use might be made of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Lordship and my Lord Bishop, ought at my request to keep private what I say here of it. But the inconveniences are indeed none, and what use soever he made of truth, yet truth is truth, and now the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not, what is fit to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but what is true.</p>
               <p>The first inconvenience he saies is this. <hi>That the Laws, which prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit any action, will be unjust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That all consultations are vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That admonitions to men of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62168:22"/>
understanding, are of no more use, than to children, fools, and mad men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That praise, dispraise, reward and punishment are in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5.6. <hi>That Counsels, Acts, Arms, Books, Instruments, Study, Tutours, Medicines, are in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which arguments his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship expecting I should answer, by saying, the ignorance of the event were enough to make us use the means, adds (as it were a reply to my answer foreseen) these words. <hi>A lass! how should our not knowing the event be a sufficient motive to make us use the means?</hi> Wherein his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship saies right, but my answer is not that which he expecteth, I answer.</p>
               <p>First, that the <hi>necessity</hi> of an <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> doth not make the <hi>Laws</hi> that prohibit it <hi>unjust.</hi> To let pass that not the <hi>necessity,</hi> but the <hi>will</hi> to break the <hi>Law,</hi> maketh the action <hi>unjust,</hi> because the <hi>Law</hi> regardeth the <hi>will</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62168:23"/>
and no other precedent causes of action. And to let pass, that no <hi>Law</hi> can possibly be <hi>unjust,</hi> in as much as every man maketh (by his consent) the Law he is bound to keep, and which consequently must be just, unless a man can be unjust to himself. I say what <hi>necessary</hi> cause soever precede an <hi>action,</hi> yet if the action be <hi>forbidden,</hi> he that doth it <hi>willingly</hi> may justly be punished. For instance, suppose the Law on pain of death prohibit stealing, and that there be a man, who by the strength of temptation is <hi>necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to steal, and is thereupon put to death, does not this punishment deter others from Theft? is it not a cause that others steal not? Doth it not frame and make their wills to justice?</p>
               <p>To make the <hi>Law,</hi> is therefore to make a <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Justice,</hi> and to <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate</hi> Justice, and consequently
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62168:23"/>
'tis no injustice to make such a Law.</p>
               <p>The intention of the <hi>Law</hi> is not to grieve the <hi>Delinquent</hi> for that which is past, and not to be undone, but to make him and others <hi>just,</hi> that else would not be so, and respecteth not the evil act <hi>past,</hi> but the <hi>good to come,</hi> in so much as without the good intention for the future, no past act of a Delinquent could justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his killing in the sight of God. But you will say how is it just to kill one man to amend another, if what were done were <hi>necessary?</hi> To this I answer, that men are justly killed, not for that their <hi>actions</hi> are not <hi>necessitated,</hi> but because they are <hi>noxious,</hi> and they are spared and preserved whose actions are not noxious. For where there is no Law, there no killing nor any thing else can be unjust, and by the right of nature, we destroy (without being unjust) all that is noxious both
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62168:24"/>
Beasts and Men, and for Beasts we kill them justly when we do it in order to our own preservation, and yet my Lord himself confesseth, that their actions, as being onely <hi>spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous,</hi> and not <hi>free,</hi> are all <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated</hi> and determined to that one thing they shall do. For men, when we make Societies or Common-Wealths we lay not down our right to kill, excepting in certain cases, as murther, theft or other offensive action; so that the right, which the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> hath to put a man to death for crimes is not created by the <hi>Law,</hi> but remains from the first right of <hi>nature,</hi> which every man hath to preserve himself, for that the Law doth not take the right away in the case of Criminals, who were by the Law excepted. Men are not therefore put to death, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for that their theft proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from <hi>election,</hi> but because it was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62168:24"/>
                  <hi>noxious</hi> and contrary to mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and the punishment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the preservation of the rest, in as much as to punish those that do voluntary hurt, and none else, frameth and maketh mens <hi>wills</hi> such as men would have them. And thus it is plain, that from the <hi>necessity</hi> of a <hi>voluntary</hi> action, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be inferred the <hi>injustice</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> that forbiddeth it, or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate that punisheth it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I deny that it maketh <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations</hi> to be in <hi>vain,</hi> 'tis the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation</hi> that <hi>causeth</hi> a man, &amp; <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitateth</hi> him to <hi>choose</hi> to do one thing rather than another, so that unless a man say that that cause is in vain which necessitateth the effect, he cannot infer the superfluousness of consultation out of the necessity of the election proceeding from it. But it seemeth his Lordships reasons thus, If I must do this rather than
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62168:25"/>
that, I shall do this rather than that, though I consult not at all, which is a false proposition and a false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and no better than this, if I shall live till to morrow, I shall live till to morrow, though I run my self through with a sword to day. If there be a <hi>necessity</hi> that an action shall be done, or that any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect shall be brought to pass, it does not therefore follow, that there is nothing necessarily requisite as a means to bring it to pass, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it is determined, that one thing shall be chosen before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 'tis determined also for what <hi>cause</hi> it shall so be chosen, which cause, for the most part, is <hi>deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> or <hi>consultation,</hi> and therefore consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is not in vain, and indeed the less in vain by how much the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more necessitated, if <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> had any place in <hi>necessity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same answer is to be given
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62168:25"/>
to the third supposed inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, namely that <hi>admonitions</hi> are in <hi>vain,</hi> for the Admonitions are parts of consultation, the admonitor being a Councellour for the time to him that is admonished.</p>
               <p>The fourth pretended inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, that <hi>praise, dispraise, reward</hi> and <hi>punishment</hi> will be in <hi>vain.</hi> To which I answer, that for <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>dispraise,</hi> they depend not at all on the <hi>necessity</hi> of the action praised or dispraised. For what is it else to <hi>praise,</hi> but to say a thing is good? good I say for me, or for some body else, or for the State and Common-Wealth? And what is it to say an action is good, but to say it is as I would wish? Or as another would have it, or according to the will of the State? that is to say, according to the Law. Does my Lord think that no action can please me, or him, or the Common-Wealth that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62168:26"/>
should proceed from <hi>necessity</hi>? things may be therefore <hi>necessary,</hi> and yet <hi>praise worthy,</hi> as also <hi>necessary,</hi> and yet <hi>dispraised,</hi> and neither of them both in vain, because <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise,</hi> and likewise <hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Punishment,</hi> do by example make and conform the will to good and evil. It was a very great praise in my opinion, that <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> gives <hi>Cato,</hi> where he saies that he was good by <hi>nature, Et quia aliter esse non potuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the fifth and sixth inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, that <hi>Counsels, Arts, Arms, Instruments, Books, Study, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines</hi> and the like would be <hi>superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> the same answer serves as to the former, that is to say, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, <hi>If the effect shall necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily come to pass, then it shall come to pass without its causes</hi> is a false one, and those things named Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, Arts, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the causes of these effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62168:26"/>His Lordships <hi>third</hi> Argument consisteth in other <hi>inconveniences,</hi> which he saith will follow, namely <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>negligence</hi> of religious duties, as Repentance, and <hi>Zeal</hi> to Gods service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I answer as to the rest, that they follow not. I must confess, if we consider the greatest part of Mankinde, not as they should be, but as they are, that is, as men, whom either the study of acquiring wealth, or preferment, or whom the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of sensual delights, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of meditating, or the rash embracing of wrong principles have made unapt to discuss the truth of things, I must I say confess, that the dispute of this question will rather hurt than help their piety, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if his Lordship had not desired this answer, I should not have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, nor do I write it but in hopes your Lordship and his will keep it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62168:27"/>
private. Nevertheless in very truth, the <hi>necessity</hi> of events does not of it self draw with it any <hi>impiety</hi> at all. For <hi>piety</hi> consisteth onely in <hi>two</hi> things; one that we honour God in our hearts, which is, that we think as highly of his <hi>power</hi> as we can, (for to honour any thing is nothing else but to think it to be of great power.) The other is, that we signifie that honour and esteem by our words and actions, which is called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Cultus,</hi> or <hi>worship of God.</hi> He therefore that thinketh that all things proceed from Gods <hi>eternal will,</hi> and consequently are <hi>necessary,</hi> does he not think God <hi>Omnipotent</hi>? Does he not esteem of his <hi>power</hi> as highly as is possible? which is to honour God as much as may be in his heart. Again, he that thinketh so, is he not more apt by <hi>external</hi> acts and words to acknowledge it, than he that thinketh otherwise? yet is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62168:27"/>
this external acknowledgement the same thing which we call <hi>worship.</hi> So that this opinion fortifies <hi>piety</hi> in both kinds, external and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, therefore is far from destroying it. And for <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a glad returning into the right way after the grief of being out of the way; though the cause that made him go astray were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, yet there is no reason why he should not grieve; and again though the cause why he returned into the way were necessary, there remained still the causes of joy. So that the <hi>necessity</hi> of the actions taketh away neither of those parts of <hi>Repentance,</hi> grief for the errour, and joy for returning.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>prayer,</hi> whereas he saith that the <hi>necessity</hi> of things destroy <hi>prayer,</hi> I deny it, for though <hi>prayer</hi> be none of the <hi>causes</hi> that <hi>move</hi> Gods <hi>will</hi> (his will being unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62168:28"/>
yet since we finde in Gods word, he will not give his blessings but to those that aske, the motive of prayer is the same. <hi>Prayer</hi> is the gift of God no less than the <hi>blessing,</hi> and the prayer is decreed together in the same decree wherein the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is decreed. 'Tis manifest that <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is no cause of the blessing past, and that which is past is sure and necessary, yet even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men thanks is in use as an acknowledgement of the benefit past, though we should expect no new benefit for our gratitude. And prayer to God Almighty is but thanksgiving for Gods blessings in general, and though it precede the particular thing we ask, yet it is not a cause or means of it, but a signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that we expect nothing but from God, in such manner, as he, not as we, will, and our Saviour by word of mouth bids us pray <hi>thy will,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:62168:28"/>
not our will, <hi>be done,</hi> and by example teaches us the same, for he prayed thus, <hi>Father if it be thy will let this cup pass,</hi> &amp;c. The end of prayer, as of thanksgiving, is not to <hi>move</hi> but to <hi>honour</hi> God Almighty, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that what we ask can be effected by him onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth Argument from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is this, The order, beauty and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the world requireth that in the universe should be Agents of all sorts; some necessary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some free, some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent. He that shall make all things necessary, all things free, or all things contingent doth overthrow the beauty and perfection of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which Argument I observe first a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> for seeing he that <hi>maketh</hi> any thing in that he maketh it, maketh it to be <hi>necessary,</hi> it followeth that he that maketh all things, maketh all things necessarily to be; As if a work-man make a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62168:29"/>
the garment must necessarily be, so if God make every thing, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing must necessarily be. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the beauty of the world requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth (though we know it not) that some Agents should work without deliberation (which his Lordship calls <hi>necessary</hi> Agents) and some Agents with deliberation (and those both he and I call <hi>free</hi> Agents) and that some Agents should work, and we not know how (and their effects we both call <hi>Contingents</hi>) but this hinders not but that he that electeth may have his <hi>election</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily determined to <hi>one</hi> by <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> causes, and that which is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent</hi> and imputed to fortune, be nevertheless <hi>necessary</hi> and depend on <hi>precedent</hi> necessary causes. For by <hi>contingent,</hi> men do not mean that which hath <hi>no</hi> cause, but that which hath not for cause any thing that we perceive; As for example,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62168:29"/>
when a Traveller meets with a shower, the journey had a cause, and the rain had a cause sufficient to produce it, but because the journey caused not the rain, nor the rain the journey, we say they were conting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent one to another. And thus you see that though there be three sorts of events, <hi>necessary, contingent, and free,</hi> yet they may be <hi>all</hi> necessary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out destruction of the beauty or perfection of the universe.</p>
               <p>To the first Argument from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which is, <hi>that if liberty be taken away, the nature and formel reason of sin is taken away,</hi> I answer by denying the consequence; The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sin consisteth in this, that the <hi>action</hi> done proceed from our <hi>will</hi> and be against the <hi>Law.</hi> A Judge in judging whether it be sin or no which is done against the Law, looks at no higher cause of the action, than the will of the doer.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62168:30"/>
Now when I say the action was <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> I do not say it was done <hi>against</hi> the will of the doer, but <hi>with</hi> his will, and <hi>necessarily,</hi> because mans will, that is every volition or act of the will and purpose of man had a <hi>sufficient,</hi> and therefore a <hi>necessary</hi> cause, and consequently every <hi>voluntary</hi> action was <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated.</hi> An action therefore may be <hi>voluntary</hi> and a <hi>sin,</hi> and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less be <hi>necessary,</hi> and, because God may afflict by a right derived from his <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> though sin were not, and because the example of punishment on voluntary sinners, is the cause that produceth justice, and maketh sin less frequent, for God to punish such sinners (as I have said before) is no injustice. And thus you have my answer to his Lordships Objections both out of Scripture and from Reason.</p>

being joyned together and subordinate one to another do make but one total cause, if any one cause (much more the first) in the whole series or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of causes be necessary, it determines the rest, and without doubt maketh the effect necessary.</hi> For that which I call the <hi>necessary</hi> cause of any effect, is the <hi>joyning</hi> together of all causes subordinate to the first into one total cause. <hi>If any of these</hi> saith he, <hi>especially the first, produce its effect necessarily, then all the rest</hi> are determined. Now it is manifest, that the first cause is a necessary cause of all the effects that are next and immediate to it, and therefore by his Lordships own reason all effects are necessary.</p>
               <p>Nor is that distinction of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in respect of the <hi>first cause,</hi> and necessary in respect of <hi>Second causes</hi> mine, it does (as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship well notes) imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62168:31"/>
But the distinction of <hi>free</hi> into <hi>free from compulsion</hi> and <hi>free from Necessitation,</hi> I acknowledge, for to be <hi>free from compulsion</hi> is to do a thing so as <hi>terror</hi> be not the cause of his <hi>will</hi> to do it; for a man is then onely said to be compelled, when fear makes him willing to it. As when a man willingly throws his goods into the sea to save himself, or submits to his enemie for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed. Thus all men that do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>revenge,</hi> or <hi>lust</hi> are <hi>free from compulsion,</hi> and yet their actions may be as necessarie as those that are done by compulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for sometimes other passions work as forcibly as fear. But <hi>free from Necessitation.</hi> I say, no man can be, and 'tis that which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship undertook to disprove.</p>
               <p>This <hi>distinction,</hi> his Lordship says, uses to be <hi>fortified</hi> by two reasons (but they are not mine.) The first
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62168:32"/>
he says, is, that it is granted by all Divines, that an <hi>Hypothetical neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,</hi> or Necessitie upon supposition, may stand with <hi>Libertie.</hi> That you may understand this, I will give you an example of <hi>Hypothetical necessity.</hi> If <hi>I shall live, I shall eat.</hi> This is an <hi>Hypothetical necessitie.</hi> Indeed it is a necessarie proposition, that is to say, it is necessarie that that proposition should be true whensoever uttered, but 'tis not the necessitie of the thing, nor is it therefore necessarie that the man should live, nor that the man should eat. I do not use to <hi>fortifie</hi> my distinctions with such reasons, let his Lordship confute them how he will, it contents me; but I would have your Lordship take notice hereby, how easie and plain a thing, (but withal false) with the grave usage of such terms as <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical necessitie,</hi> and <hi>Necessitie</hi> upon <hi>supposition,</hi> and such like terms
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62168:32"/>
of School-men may be obscured and made to seem <hi>profound learning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second reason that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the distinction of <hi>free from compulsion,</hi> and <hi>free from necessitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he says is, that God and good Angels do good necessarily, and yet are more free than we. This reason, though I had no need of, yet I think it so farforth good, as it is true that God and good Angels do good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, and yet are free; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I find not in the Articles of our Faith, nor in the decrees of our Church, set down in what manner I am to conceive God and good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to work by necessitie, or in what sence they work <hi>Freely,</hi> I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend my sentence in that point, and am content that there be a <hi>freedom from Compulsion,</hi> and yet no <hi>freedom from Necessitation,</hi> as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in that a man may be necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to some action without threats
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62168:33"/>
and without fear of danger. But how my Lord can avoid the consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> supposing God and good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are freer than men, and yet do good necessarily, that we must exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. I confess, saith he, <hi>that God &amp; good Angels are more free than we, that is, intensively in degree of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not extensively in the latitude of the object, according to a libertie of exercise, not of specification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, we have here two distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that are no distinctions, but made to seem so by terms invented by I know not whom, to cover ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and blind the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Reader: For it cannot be conceived that there is any libertie greater, than for a man to do what he will. One heat may be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive than another, but not one libertie than another; he that can do what he will, hath all libertie possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62168:33"/>
and he that cannot hath none at all. Also <hi>Libertie</hi> (as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship says the Schools call it) of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,</hi> which is as I have said before, a libertie to do or not to do, cannot be without a <hi>Libertie</hi> (which they call) of <hi>Specification,</hi> that is to say, a libertie to do, or not to do this or that in particular. For how can a man conceave he hath libertie to do any thing, that hath not libertie to do this, or that, or somewhat in particular? If a man be forbidden in Lent to eat this, and that, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other particular kind of flesh, how can he be understood to have a libertie to eat flesh, more than he that hath no licence at all? You may by this again see the vanitie of distinctions used in the <hi>Schools,</hi> and I do not doubt but that the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them, by Authoritie of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> hath been a great cause that men have labored,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62168:34"/>
though by Sedition and evil courses, to shake them off, for nothing is more apt to beget hatred, than the tyrannizing over mens reason and understanding, especially when it is done, not by the Scriptures, but by the pretence of Learning, and more judgement than that of other men.</p>
               <p>In the next place his Lordship bringeth two Arguments against distinguishing between <hi>free from compulsion</hi> and <hi>free from necessitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is, that <hi>election</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite not onely to <hi>Coaction</hi> or <hi>compulsion,</hi> but also <hi>Necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or determination to one. This is it he was to prove from the beginning, and therefore bringeth no new Argument to prove it, and so those brought formerly I have already answered. And in this place I deny again, that election is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to either, For, when a man is compelled for example to subject himself to an enemy or to die, he hath
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62168:34"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>till election left him, and a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to bethink which of the two he can better endure. And he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>led to prison by force hath election <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd may deliberate whether he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e hal'd and traind on the ground, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r make use of his own feet: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when there is no <hi>compulsion,</hi> but the strength of <hi>temptation</hi> to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n evil action, being greater than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he motives to <hi>abstain,</hi> it necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determines him to the doing of it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et he deliberates while sometimes the motives to do, sometimes the motives to forbear are working on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im, and consequently he <hi>electeth</hi> which he will. But commonly when we see and know the strength that moves us, we acknowledge <hi>necessity</hi>; but when we see not or mark not the force that moves us, we then think there is none, and that it is not <hi>causes</hi> but <hi>liberty</hi> that produceth the <hi>action.</hi> Hence it is that they think he does not choose this that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62168:35"/>
choose it, but they might as well say, fire doth not burn because it burns of necessity.</p>
               <p>The second Argument is not so much an argument as a distinction, to shew in what sence it may be said that <hi>voluntary</hi> actions are <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated</hi> and in what sence not. And therefore his Lordship alledgeth as from the authority of the <hi>Schools</hi> (and that which rippeth up the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the <hi>Question</hi>) that there is a double act of the <hi>will.</hi> The one he says is <hi>Actus imperatus,</hi> an act done at the command of the will, by some inferiour faculty of the soul; As to open or shut ones eyes, and this act may be compell'd, the other he saies, is <hi>Actus elicitus,</hi> an act allured or drawn forth by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement out of the will, as to <hi>will,</hi> to <hi>choose,</hi> to <hi>elect,</hi> this he saies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compelled. Wherein (let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pass that metaphorical speech
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62168:35"/>
of attributing command and subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the faculties of the soul, as if they made a Common-Wealth or family within themselves, and could speak one to another, which is very improper in searching the truth of a question) you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, first, that to compel a <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> act, is nothing else but to will it, for it is all one to say, my will commands the shutting of my eyes, or the doing of any other action, and to say, I have the will to shut my eyes; so that <hi>Actus impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi> here, might as easily have been said in English a <hi>voluntry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> but that they that invented the term understood not any thing it signified.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you may observe, that <hi>Actus elicitus,</hi> is exemplified by these words, to <hi>will,</hi> to <hi>elect,</hi> to <hi>choose,</hi> which are all one, and so to will is here made an act of the will; and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62168:36"/>
indeed as the will is a faculty or power in a mans soul, so to will is an act of it according to that power; but as it is absurdly said, that to dance is an act allured or drawn by fair means out of the ability to dance, so is it also to say, so that to will is an act allured or drawn out of the power to will, which pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is commonly called the will. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be, the sum of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships distinction, is, that a <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> act may be done by <hi>compulsion,</hi> that is to say, by foul means, but to will that or any act cannot be but by <hi>allurement,</hi> or fair means. Now seeing fair means, allurements, and enticements produce the action which they do produce, as <hi>necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> as foul means and threatening, it follows, that to <hi>will</hi> may be made as <hi>necessarie</hi> as any thing that is done by <hi>compulsion.</hi> So that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of <hi>Actus imperatus,</hi> and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62168:36"/>
                  <hi>Actus elicitus</hi> are but words, and of no effect against necessitie.</p>
               <p>His Lordship in the rest of his discourse, reckoneth up the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of certain professions of men, touching the causes wherein the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of things (which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) consisteth. And first he saith, the <hi>Astrologer</hi> deriveth his <hi>necessitie</hi> from the <hi>stars</hi>; Secondly, that the <hi>Physitian</hi> attributeth it to the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> of the bodie. For my part, I am not of their opinion, because, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the stars alone, nor the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the Patient alone is able to produce any effect, without the concurrence of all other Agents. For there is hardly any one action, how casual soever it seem, to the causing whereof concur not what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a great paradox, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on many antecedent specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I do not press in this place.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62168:37"/>
Thirdly, he disputeth against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of them that say, <hi>external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> presented to men of such and such temparatures, do make their actions <hi>necessarie,</hi> and says, the power such objects have over us, proceeds from our own fault, but that is nothing to the purpose, if such fault of ours proceedeth from causes not in our own power, and therefore that opinion may hold true for all that answer.</p>
               <p>Further he says, <hi>Prayer, Fasting,</hi> &amp;c. may alter our <hi>habits</hi>; 'tis true, but when they do so, they are <hi>causes</hi> of the contrarie <hi>habit,</hi> and make it <hi>necessarie,</hi> as the former habit had been necessarie if <hi>Prayer, Fasting,</hi> &amp;c. had not been. Besides, we are not moved or disposed to prayer or any other action, but by outward objects, as pious company, godly preachers, of something equivolent. Fourthly, he says a resolved mind is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62168:37"/>
not easily surprised, as the mind of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> who when others wept, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone wept not, and of the <hi>Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,</hi> that abstained from striking, because he found himself angrie; and of him that poured out the water when he was thirstie, and the like. Such things I confess have, or may have been done, and do prove onely that it was not necessarie for <hi>Vlysses</hi> then to weep, nor for that <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> to strike, nor for that other man to drink, but it does not prove that it was not necessarie for <hi>Vlysses</hi> then to abstain (as he did) from weeping, nor for the <hi>Philosopher</hi> to abstain (as he did) from striking, nor for the other man to forbear drinking, and yet that was the thing his Lordship ought to have proved. Lastly, his Lordship confesses, that the <hi>dispositions</hi> of objects may be <hi>dangerous</hi> to <hi>libertie,</hi> but cannot be <hi>destructive.</hi> To which I answer, it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62168:38"/>
is impossible; for <hi>libertie</hi> is never in any other danger than to be lost, and if it cannot be lost (which he confesses) I may infer it can be in no danger at all.</p>
               <p>The fourth opinion his Lordship rejecteth, is of them that make the will necessarily to follow the last dictate of the understanding; but it seems his Lordship understands that Tenet in another sence than I do; for he speaketh as if they that held it, did suppose men must dispute the sequel of every action they do, great and small, to the least grain, which is a thing his Lordship (with reason) thinks untrue. But I understand it to signifie, that the <hi>will</hi> follows the <hi>last</hi> opinion or <hi>judgement</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately proceding the <hi>action,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether it be good to do it or not, whether he have weighed it long before, or not at all, and that I take to be the meaning of them that hold it. As for example, when
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62168:38"/>
a man strikes, his will to strike fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows necessarily that thought he had of the sequel of his stroak, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the lifting up of his hand. Now if it be understood in that sence, the <hi>last</hi> dictate of the understanding does <hi>necessitate</hi> the <hi>action,</hi> though not as the whole cause, yet as the last cause, as the last feather necessitates the breaking of a horses back, when there are so many laid on before, as there needed but the addition of one to make the weight sufficient.</p>
               <p>That which his Lordship allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth against this, is, First out of a <hi>Poet,</hi> who in the person of <hi>Medea</hi> says,
<q>
                     <l>— Video meliora, probo<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan>
                     </l>
                     <l>Deteriora sequor.</l>
                  </q>
but that saying (as prettie as it is) is not true: for though <hi>Medea</hi> saw many reasons to forbear killing her children, yet the last dictate of her judgement was, that the present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on her husband out-weighed them all, and thereupon the wicked
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62168:39"/>
action <hi>necessarily</hi> followed. Then the story of the <hi>Roman,</hi> who of two competitors, said, one had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason, but the other must have the office. This also maketh against his Lordship, for the last dictate of his judgement that had the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the office, was this, That it was better to take a great bribe, than reward a great merit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he objects that things nearer the sence move more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than reason; what followeth thence but this, the sence of the present good is commonly more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate to the action than the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of the evil consequence to come? Fourthly, whereas his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship saies that do what a man can, he shall sorrow more for the death of his Son than for the sin of his soul, makes nothing to the last di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of the understanding, but it argues plainly that sorrow for sin is not <hi>voluntary,</hi> and by consequence,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62168:39"/>
that <hi>Repentance</hi> proceedeth from <hi>Causes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last part of this discourse containeth his Lordships opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout reconciling <hi>liberty</hi> with the <hi>prescience</hi> and <hi>decree</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than some <hi>Divines</hi> have done, against whom, he saies, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly written a Treatise, out of which he repeateth onely two things. One is, <hi>that we ought not to desert a certain truth, for not being able to comprehend the certain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it.</hi> And I say the same, as for example, that his Lordship ought not to desert this certain truth, <hi>That there are certain and</hi> necessary causes <hi>which make every man to</hi> will <hi>what he willeth, though he do not</hi> yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in what manner the <hi>will</hi> of man is <hi>caused.</hi> And yet I think the manner of it is not very hard to conceive, seeing we see daily, that <hi>praise, dispraise, reward and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> sequels of mens
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62168:40"/>
                  <hi>actions</hi> retained in <hi>memory,</hi> do frame and make us to the <hi>election</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be that we elect, and that the <hi>memory</hi> of such things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>sences,</hi> and <hi>sence</hi> from the operation of the <hi>objects</hi> of sence (which are external to us and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned onely by God Almighty) and by consequence all <hi>actions,</hi> even of <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> Agents are <hi>necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other thing that he repeateth is, that the best way to reconcile <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> with <hi>Prescience</hi> and the <hi>decrees</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is to subject future <hi>contingencies</hi> to the <hi>Aspect of God.</hi> The same is also my opinion, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to what his Lordship all this while laboured to prove. For hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he held <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>necessity,</hi> that is to say, <hi>liberty</hi> and the <hi>decrees</hi> of <hi>God</hi> irreconcileable, unless the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God</hi> (which word appeareth now the first time in this discourse) signifie somewhat else besides <hi>Gods
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62168:40"/>
will</hi> and <hi>decree,</hi> which I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. But he adds that we must subject them, according to that <hi>presentiality</hi> which they have in <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> which he saies cannot be done by them that conceive <hi>Eternity</hi> to be an <hi>everlasting succession,</hi> but onely by them, that conceive it as an <hi>Indivisible point.</hi> To which I answer, that assoon as I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Eternity</hi> to be an <hi>Indivisible point,</hi> or any thing, but an <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing succession,</hi> I will renounce all, that I have written on this subject. I know S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> calls <hi>Eternity, Nunc. stans.,</hi> an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>ever-abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding now,</hi> which is easie enough to say, but though I fain would, yet I could never conceive it, they that can, are more happy than I. But in the mean time his Lordship alloweth all men to be of my opinion save onely those that can conceive in their minds a <hi>nunc stans,</hi> which I think are none. I understand as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

how it can be true his Lordship saies, that <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>just</hi> but <hi>justice</hi> it self, not <hi>wise,</hi> but <hi>wisdom</hi> it self, not <hi>Eternal,</hi> but <hi>Eternity</hi> it self, nor how he concludes thence that <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is a <hi>point indivisible,</hi> and not a <hi>succession,</hi> nor in what sence it can be said, that an <hi>infinite point,</hi> and wherein is no <hi>succession,</hi> can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all <hi>time,</hi> though time be <hi>successive.</hi> These phrases I finde not in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> I wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what was the design of the <hi>School-men</hi> to bring them up, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they thought a man could not be a true <hi>Christian</hi> unless his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding be first strangled with such hard sayings. And thus much for answer to his Lordships dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, wherein I think not onely his <hi>Squadrons</hi> of <hi>Arguments,</hi> but also his <hi>Reserve</hi> of <hi>Distinctions</hi> are defeated. And now your Lordship shall have my doctrine concerning the same question, with my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62168:41"/>

               <head>My Opinion about LIBERTIE and NECESSITIE.</head>
               <p>FIrst I conceive, that when it cometh into a mans mind to do or not to do some certain action, if he have no time to <hi>deliberate,</hi> the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it or abstaining <hi>necessarily</hi> follow the <hi>present</hi> thought he hath of the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof to himself. As for example, In sudden <hi>anger,</hi> the <hi>action</hi> shall follow the thought of <hi>revenge,</hi> in sudden <hi>fear</hi> the thought of <hi>escape.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62168:42"/>
when a man hath time to <hi>deliberate,</hi> but deliberates not, because never any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that could make him doubt of the consequence, the <hi>action</hi> follows his opinion of the <hi>goodness</hi> or <hi>harm</hi> of it. These actions I call VOLUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TARY, (my Lord) if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him aright that calls them SPONTANEOUS. I call them <hi>voluntarie,</hi> because those <hi>actions</hi> that follow immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>last</hi> appetite are <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie,</hi> and here where is one onely appetite, that one is the last. Besides, I see 'tis reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to punish a <hi>rash</hi> Action, which could not be justly done by man to man, unless the same were <hi>voluntarie.</hi> For no <hi>action</hi> of a man can be said to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62168:42"/>
be without <hi>deliberation,</hi> though never so sudden, because it is supposed he had time to <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate</hi> all the precedent time of his life, whether he should do that kind of action or not. And hence it is, that he that killeth in a sudden passion of <hi>Anger,</hi> shall nevertheless be justly put to <hi>death,</hi> because all the time, wherein he was able to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether to kill were good or evil, shall be held for one continual <hi>deliberation,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the killing shall be judged to proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I conceive when a man <hi>deliberates,</hi> whether he shall do a thing or not do it, that he does nothing else but consider whether it be better for himself to do it or not to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62168:43"/>
do it. And to <hi>consider</hi> an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to imagine the <hi>consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of it both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi> From whence is to be inferred, that <hi>Deliberation</hi> is nothing else but <hi>alternate</hi> imagination of the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> sequels of an <hi>action,</hi> or (which is the same thing) alternate <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> or alternate <hi>appetite</hi> to do or quit the action of which he <hi>deliberateth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I conceive that in all <hi>deliberations,</hi> that is to say, in at alternate <hi>succession</hi> of contrary <hi>appetites,</hi> the last is that which we call the WILL, &amp; is immediately next before the doing of the action, or next before the doing of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impossible. All other <hi>Appetites</hi> to do, and to quit,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62168:43"/>
that come upon a man during his deliberations, are called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi> &amp; <hi>Inclinations,</hi> but not <hi>Wills,</hi> there being but <hi>one</hi> will, which also in this case may be called the <hi>last</hi> will, though the <hi>Intentions</hi> change often.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I conceive that those <hi>actions,</hi> which a man is said to do upon <hi>deliberation,</hi> are said to be <hi>voluntarie,</hi> and done upon <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>election,</hi> so that <hi>voluntarie</hi> action, and action proceeding from <hi>electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is the same thing, and that of a <hi>voluntarie Agent,</hi> it is all one to say, he is <hi>free,</hi> and to say, he hath not made an end of <hi>deliberating.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, I conceive <hi>Libertie</hi> to be rightly defined in this manner; <hi>Libertie is the absence
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62168:44"/>
of all the impediments to Action that are not contained in the nature and intrinsecal qualitie of the Agent.</hi> As for example, the water is said to descend <hi>freely,</hi> or to have <hi>libertie</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend by the channel of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, because there is no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment that way, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross, because the banks are impediments. And though the water cannot ascend, yet men never say it wants the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie</hi> to ascend, but the <hi>faculty</hi> or power, because the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in the nature of the water, and intrinsecal. So also we say, he that is tied wants the <hi>libertie</hi> to go, because the impediment is not in him, but in his bands, whereas we say not so of him that is sick or
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62168:44"/>
lame, because the impediment is in himself.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I conceive that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing taketh beginning from <hi>it self,</hi> but from the <hi>Action</hi> of some other immediate <hi>Agent</hi> without it self. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when first a man hath an <hi>appetite</hi> or <hi>will</hi> to something, to which immediately before he had no appetite nor will, the <hi>cause</hi> of his <hi>will,</hi> is not the <hi>will</hi> it self, but <hi>something</hi> else not in his own disposing. So that whereas it is out of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, that of <hi>voluntarie</hi> actions the <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>necessarie</hi> cause, and by this which is said, the <hi>will</hi> is also <hi>caused</hi> by other things whereof it disposeth not, it followeth, that <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> actions have all of them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62168:45"/>
                  <hi>necessarie</hi> causes, and therefore are <hi>necessitated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, I hold that to be a <hi>sufficient cause,</hi> to which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wanting that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the producing of the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> The same also is a <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie</hi> cause. For if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a <hi>sufficient</hi> cause shall not bring forth the <hi>effect,</hi> then there wanteth somewhat which was needfull to the producing of it, and so the <hi>cause</hi> was not <hi>sufficient,</hi> but if it be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a <hi>sufficient</hi> cause should not produce the <hi>effect,</hi> then is a <hi>sufficient</hi> cause a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> cause (for that is said to produce an effect <hi>necessarily</hi> that cannot but produce it.) Hence it is manifest, that whatsoever is produced is produced <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily,</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62168:45"/>
for whatsoever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced hath had a <hi>sufficient</hi> cause to produce it, or else it had not been, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>voluntarie</hi> actions are <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, should that Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Definition</hi> of a <hi>free Agent,</hi> namely, <hi>That a</hi> free Agent <hi>is that, which, when all things are present which are needfull to produce the</hi> effect, <hi>can never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless not produce it,</hi> implies a contradiction, and is non-sence, being as much as to say, The cause may be <hi>sufficient,</hi> that is to say, <hi>necessarie,</hi> and yet the <hi>effect</hi> shall not follow.</p>

               <head>My Reasons.</head>
               <p>FOr the first five points, wherein it is explicated 1. what <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanity</hi> is. 2. what <hi>Deliberation</hi> is. 3. what <hi>Will, propension</hi> and <hi>appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi> is. 4. what a <hi>free Agent</hi> is. 5. what <hi>Liberty</hi> is, there can no other proof be offered but every mans own experience, by reflection on himself, and remembring what he useth in his minde, that is, what he himself meaneth when he saith an action is <hi>Spontaneous,</hi> a man <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berates</hi>; such is his <hi>will,</hi> that <hi>Agent</hi> or that <hi>action</hi> is <hi>free,</hi> Now he that, reflecteth so on himself, cannot but be satisfied, that <hi>Deliberation,</hi> is the <hi>consideration of the good and evil se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quels of an action to come</hi>; that by <hi>Spontanity</hi> is meant <hi>inconsiderate action</hi> (or else nothing is meant by it) that <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>last act of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,</hi> that a <hi>free Agent</hi> is he <hi>that can do if he will,</hi> and <hi>forbear if
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62168:46"/>
he will,</hi> and that <hi>Liberty</hi> is, <hi>the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of external impediments.</hi> But, to those that out of custom speak not what they conceive, but what they hear, and are not able, or will not take the pains to consider what they think when they hear such words, no Argument can be sufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>experience</hi> and <hi>matter of fact</hi> is not verified by other mens Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but by every mans own <hi>sence</hi> and <hi>memory.</hi> For example, how can it be proved that to <hi>love</hi> a thing and to think it <hi>good</hi> is all one, to a man that doth not mark his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by those word? Or how can it be proved that <hi>Eternity</hi> is not <hi>nunc stans</hi> to a man that saies those words by custom, and never consider how he can conceive the thing in his minde?</p>
               <p>Also the sixth point, that a man cannot imagine any thing to begin <hi>without a cause,</hi> can no other way be made known, but by trying how
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62168:47"/>
he can imagine it, but if he try, he shall finde as much reason (if there be no cause of the thing) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it should begin at one time as another, that, he hath equal reason to think it should begin at all times which is impossible, and therefore he must think there was some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial cause why it began then, rather than sooner or later; or else that it began never, but was <hi>eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the seventh point, which is that all <hi>events</hi> have <hi>necessary</hi> causes, it is there proved in that they have <hi>sufficient</hi> causes. Further let us in this place also suppose any event never so casual, as the throwing (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.) <hi>Ames Ace</hi> upon a pair of dice, and see, if it must not have been <hi>necessary</hi> before 'twas thrown. For seeing it was thrown it had a <hi>beginning,</hi> and consequently a <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> cause to produce it, consisting partly in the <hi>dice,</hi> partly in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, as the posture of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62168:47"/>
parts of the <hi>hand,</hi> the measure of <hi>force</hi> applied by the caster, the posture of the parts of the <hi>Table,</hi> and the like. In sum there was nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which was necessarily requisite to the producing of that particular cast, and consequently the cast was necessarily thrown, for if it had not been thrown, there had wanted som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what requisite to the throwing of it, and so the cause had not been <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi> In the like manner it may be proved that every other ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ident how <hi>contingent</hi> soever it seem, or how <hi>voluntary</hi> soever it be, is produced <hi>necessarily,</hi> which is that that my L. Bishop disputes against. The same may be proved also in this manner. Let the case be put, for example, of the weather. <hi>'Tis necessary that to mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row it shall rain or not rain.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be not <hi>necessary</hi> it shall rain, it is <hi>necessary</hi> it shall not rain, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there is no necessity that the proposition, <hi>It shall rain or not rain,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:62168:48"/>
should be true. I know there be some that say, it may necessarily be true that one of the two shall come to pass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not, singly that it shall rain, or that it shall not rain, which is as much as to say, <hi>one</hi> of them is <hi>necessary,</hi> yet <hi>neither</hi> of them is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> and therefore to seem to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void that absurdity, they make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, that neither of them is true <hi>determinate,</hi> but <hi>indeterminate,</hi> which distinction either signifies no more but this, One of them is true but we know not which, and so the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remains, though we know it not, or if the meaning of the distinction be not that, it hath no meaning, and they might as well have said, One of them is true <hi>Titirice</hi> but neither of them, <hi>Tu patulice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last thing in which also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the whole controversie, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly that there is no such thing as an Agent, <hi>which when all things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to action are present, can neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62168:48"/>
forbear to produce it, or</hi> (which is all one) that there is no such thing as <hi>freedom from necessity,</hi> is easily inferred from that which hath been before alledged. For if it be an <hi>Agent</hi> it can <hi>work,</hi> and if it <hi>work,</hi> there is nothing wanting of what is requisite to produce the <hi>action,</hi> and consequently the cause of the action is <hi>sufficient,</hi> &amp; if <hi>sufficient,</hi> then also <hi>necessary,</hi> as hath been proved before.</p>
               <p>And thus you see how the <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,</hi> which his Lordship ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth must follow upon the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>necessity,</hi> are avoided, and the <hi>necessity</hi> it self <hi>demonstratively</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. To which I could add, if I thought it good <hi>Logick,</hi> the <hi>inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience</hi> of denying <hi>necessity,</hi> as that it destroyeth both the <hi>decrees</hi> and the <hi>prescience</hi> of <hi>God Almighty</hi>; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>purposed</hi> to bring to pass by <hi>man,</hi> as an instrument, or foreseeth shall come to pass, a man,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62168:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if he have <hi>Liberty</hi> (such as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship affirmeth) from <hi>necessitation,</hi> might frustrate and make not to come to pass, and <hi>God</hi> should either not <hi>foreknow</hi> it, and not <hi>decree</hi> it, or he should <hi>foreknow</hi> such things shall be, as shall never be, and <hi>decree</hi> that which shall never <hi>come to pass.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is all hath come into my minde touching this question since I last considered it. And I humbly beseech your Lordship to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it onely to my Lord Bishop. And so praying God to prosper your Lordship in all your designes, I take leave and am,</p>
