            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>ADVICE to the</hi> Livery-men <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>in their Choice of a</hi> LORD-MAYOR, <hi>on</hi> Michaelmas <hi>Day,</hi> 1692.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was a Cuſtom among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever procured them new, or maintained their old Liberties, were made <hi>Patricii</hi> of that Noble City: It ought therefore certainly to be the equal Care of the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in their preſent Election of a <hi>Lord-Mayor.</hi> In order to which, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſider whether it be reaſonable to ſide or join with thoſe who leave no Stone unturn'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and ſubvert the preſent Government; and whether 'tis ſitting to Poll for ſuch Men whom all the <hi>Jacobites</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> make their Intereſt for, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Perſons of known Loyalty, Honeſty, and Zeal to the preſent Government, and Rights and Libertics of the City: which makes us fear they have the ſame ill Deſign now in hand, as they had when the French Fleet was invited upon our Coaſt. And now I humbly offer to your Conſideration, whether Sir <hi>Jonathan R—d</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter D—l</hi> be Men qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for that great Honour and Truſt, conſidering,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. We ſuppoſe Sir <hi>Jonathan R—d</hi> was for the ſurrendring of the Charter of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe after Judgment entred againſt it, 8 worthy Aldermen that would not comply, were turned out, and 16 or 17 kept in by Commiſſion during Pleaſure, of which number Sir <hi>Jonathan R—d,</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter D—l,</hi> were two.</item>
               <item>2. Sir <hi>Jonathan R—d</hi> being Alderman (in the Mayoralty of Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi>) of <hi>Biſhopſgate-Ward,</hi> he adjourn'd the <hi>Wardmote</hi> for the Service of his Party five Weeks, in order to the Choice of ſuch <hi>Common-Council-Men,</hi> as would comply with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring of the City-Charter.</item>
               <item>3. That day my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was convicted, the ſaid Sir <hi>Jonathan R—d</hi> came rejoicing from the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions-Houſe to the King's-Head-Tavern in <hi>Leadenhall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> and declared the Jury had done like honeſt Men.</item>
               <item>4. Sir <hi>Jonathan R—d</hi> recommended a <hi>Jacobite Parſon</hi> to preach laſt Summer at <hi>Tunbridg-Wells</hi> to the Nobility and Gentry, who omitted praying for King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY,</hi> nay not ſo much as any King or Queen at all; for which he received a ſevere Reprimand from a Perſon in great Authority.</item>
               <item>5. His only Son Sir <hi>Gemmitt Raymund</hi> pays double Taxes for not taking the Oaths to the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and keeps one <hi>Hart,</hi> a non-ſwearing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for his Chaplain, who quitted two Preferments rather than he would comply to take the ſaid Oaths.</item>
               <item>6. And now conſider whether ſo weak and eaſy a Man (to ſay no worſe) as Sir <hi>Jonathan R—d</hi> is by his very Friends eſteemed to be, and who is wholly under the Government of his Wife and Deputy <hi>L—m,</hi> is fit to be Lord-Mayor for the Year enſuing.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And for Sir <hi>Peter D—l;</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He was Sheriff of <hi>Surry,</hi> and impannell'd that Jury who gave 800 Pounds Damages to <hi>Boldſworth</hi> the Powder-man at <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> againſt Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkington,</hi> late Lord-Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> when upon the Trial not two Pence Damage did appear; and ſome ſhort time after the ſaid Trial, being in Company, he declar'd it to be an honeſt Verdict.</item>
               <item>2. We ſuppoſe Sir <hi>Peter D—l</hi> was for the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the Charter of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe he was ſo zealous for the ſurrender of the <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he was Maſter of that Company; at which time, he put theſe two enſnaring Queſtions to the ſaid Company, <hi>viz. As many of you as are for ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring your Charter, hold up your Hands.—And ſo many of you that are againſt the King, and will not comply to ſurrender your Charter, hold up your Hands.</hi> And accordingly the Charter was ſurrendred.</item>
               <item>3. Sir <hi>Peter D—l</hi> being choſe a Member of Parliament for the Borough of <hi>Southwark</hi> in K. <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, declared the Letter <hi>E</hi> ought to be branded in the Forehead of all thoſe who were for the Bill of <hi>Excluſion;</hi> and voted for and ſided with thoſe who were for making the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom uſeleſs, and for keeping up a ſtanding Army to inſlave the Nation; which was carried in the Negative but by one Voice, upon which the Parliament was ſoon after diſſolved.</item>
               <item>4. And when that <hi>Wicked Deſign</hi> was on foot, to ſubvert the <hi>CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCH OF ENGLAND,</hi> in order to eſtabliſh Popery, (and as the proper means to effect it) K. <hi>James</hi> then cloſetted, among others, this Gentleman Sir <hi>Peter D—l,</hi> who promiſed him to take off the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſt</hi> in the new Parliament he was then preparing to call; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Sir <hi>Peter D—l</hi> was left in Commiſſion of the Peace in the County of <hi>Surry,</hi> when ſeveral worthy Gentlemen, refuſing to comply, were turned out.</item>
               <item>5. In the aforeſaid Reign he was look'd upon to be a Spy upon the Court of <hi>Aldermen,</hi> betrayed their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to K. <hi>James,</hi> and was thereupon deſervedly nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Sir <hi>Peter Tell Tale.</hi> Sir <hi>R. J.</hi> amongſt ſeveral other Aldermen, reſenting his Treachery to that Court, meeting him upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> threathed to cut him over the Pate.</item>
               <item>6. The ſame Sir <hi>Peter D—l</hi> was the firſt Perſon preſumed to act as <hi>Sheriff</hi> by <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> not being elected by the <hi>Livery-men</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> and returned that Jury who murdered Colonel <hi>SYDNEY,</hi> and aſſiſted at his Execution.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now, Gentlemen, conſider the Characters of the above-mentioned Perſons in theſe few things offered to your Conſideration; and beſides, the preſent <hi>Lieutenancy</hi> of <hi>London</hi> make their whole Intereſt for them, which, if carried, they doubt not upon the leaſt Alarm to bring out the Trained Bands, which if out but for a Week, will put each Houſe-keeper in the City to near twenty Shillings Charge or more.</p>
            <p>Now (Fellow-Citizens) if we have two ſuch good Men as Sir <hi>JOHN FLEET</hi> and Sir <hi>JOHN HO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>BLON,</hi> Perſons of unſpotted Reputation, both to the Intereſt of the preſent Government in general, and to the Rights and Liberties of this City in particular; Why ought we not to give our Votes for theſe Gentlemen, rather than for Men guilty of the aforementioned Crimes?</p>
