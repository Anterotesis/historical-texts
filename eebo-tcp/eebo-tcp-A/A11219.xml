            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Auguſtine therfore hath aptly ſaid,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> that loue is a certain coupling of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> louer with the beloued, which ſaying of Augu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtine may be approued true, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle and<note place="margin">1.

            <p>Which loue of God is powred into the harts of Gods children, by the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God, by the means of Chriſte, for the ſpirit of loue was louingly giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſte vnto this end, that he ſhoulde powre it into his members.</p>
            <p>And although the ſame loue, in the chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren of God is vnperfit during this theyr

            <p>The manner and order of which loue, is explicated and ſet foorth, as wel by that ſeruant of God, <hi>Moyſes</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Booke called Deutronomium, &amp; ſixt Chapter in theſe woords:<note place="margin">Deu. 6.</note> Thou ſhalt loue the Lorde thy God, with all thy hart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy might: as alſo the very ſame woords, reherſed or rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by our ſauiour Chriſte, in the 22.

            </p>
            <p>To loue God with all thine hart, is to take dilligent héed, that thine hart hée not inclined to the looue of any thinge, more then to the loue of thy God: To loue him with all thy ſoule, is to ſtay the truſt of thy ſaluation and ſafety of thy ſoule, onely on Jeſus Chriſte the ſonne of God To loue him with all thy might, is to ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply all thy ſences, to the ſetting foorth of his honour and glory.

And ſo in ouer much louing of any theſe thinges, make himſelfe vnfit to be loued of God: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of our Sauiour Chriſt <hi>Qui amat Patrem aut matrem pluſquam<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> me, non eſt me dignus: et qui amat: ſiliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aut filiam ſupra me, non eſt me dignus.</hi>

            <p>If thou wilt therfore loue any of the creatures of GOD, O man loue them but as thinges ſubiecte vnto thée, as a gift of thy fréende, as a benefite of the LORD, as a pledge of thy ſpouſe

doctrine, which thing if they doo not, their hearers may ſay vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſayd vnto <hi>Iacob.</hi> Thy voice is <hi>Iacobs</hi> voice<note place="margin">Geneſis. 27.</note> but thy handes, are the handes of <hi>Eſau:</hi> Of ſuch diſſemblers our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh in the twenty thrée Chapter of Saint <hi>Mathew:</hi> They (ſayth hée) ſaye but doo not: Such builde the Temple of God with the right hand of good doctrine, but put it downe agayne with the lefte hande of their euill liues, well, hée that knoweth the Fathers will and dooth it not, is worthy to be beaten with many ſtripes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>So if the Miniſters and Preachers of the worde of God enter into that functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſiniſter and corrupt meanes, as by fréendſhip, kinred or for money, if they ſléep &amp; loyter in their office, if they preache for promotions and liuings, or to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their eloquence or to pleaſe men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to edefie the Church of Chriſt, or if they teach well and liue euill, they hinder the frée paſſage of the Goſpell, and ſhall make accounte therof before the Lorde God.</p>
               <p>Now as it is the office of the Biſhops and Miniſters to Preache the woorde:


<pb facs="tcp:12419:14"/>
So it is the ofice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Magiſtrats, Rulers and gouernours of this Realm to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame with the ſword, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the offendor. For they rightly cannot be ſaid to be rulers, which rule not, which ſpeak of the Law but vſe it not. Such may be likened to S. George fighting with the Dragon, but ſtriketh not, to a man pai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted on a wall, drawing a bow, with an arrow but ſhooteth not, ſuch haue the work of the Lord in hand but execute it not: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g not what the Lord hath ſaid by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Curſed bée hée that dooth the worke of the Lord negligently.<note place="margin">Ieremi, 48.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Rulers therfore ought not onely to make good Lawes for the ſetting forth of gods worde, but alſo diligently to ſee, that ſuch holeſome Lawes be obſerued, &amp; kept, as did good <hi>Ezechias, Ioſias</hi> &amp; others we haue in this land a law made, that euerie ſubiect that is able, ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e vnto the Church to hear Gods word read and preached, and to haue the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſtred vnto them, but how it is kept of ſome people in ſome cûtries it is known. You wil peraduenture ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhops be in fault, if this law be not kept, I grant there may bée ſome fault found in them,


<pb facs="tcp:12419:14"/>
touching this matter: but what and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be to mightye, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhop to deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, it ſéemeth that the papiſts wexe very bold wel it were good that the Magiſtrate and thoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bée in authoritie, ſhold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuch yea, if it were a noble man, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his alege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Prince, to come to the Church. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth teſtifie that through the ſtraight co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperor, his church of <hi>Hippo</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> &amp; were brought vnto the trueth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preching of the word of God, for as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Roma. 10.</note> faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by hearing: &amp; ſurely this is not only a gret hindrance of the frée paſſage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, when men ſée the magiſtrats neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in puniſhing of ſuch tranſgreſſors of Gods lawes, &amp; the princes, but alſo if they ſée &amp; vnderſtand that the rulers themſelues, their familie, and houſhold regard litle the word of God.</p>
               <p>The third ſorte of people that are to bée blamed, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God is no more regarded in theſe our daies, be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon multitude.
