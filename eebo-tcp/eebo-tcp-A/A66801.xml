         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>The Stationer <hi>sends Greeting:</hi>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas I have undertaken to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a <hi>Miscellany</hi> of all Humours which our Fam'd Comedies have exquisitely and aptly represented in the becoming dress of the Stage: Now know ye that I think fit in compliance with the Design to usher in this <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Humours</hi> with a Preface, for no other reason, nor to other purpose, then to humour and imitate the <hi>Mode</hi> of Writers; letting you see the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> of Epistolary <hi>Personations</hi> (never <hi>acted</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) which shew their Books are chiefly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for their own sakes, and to <hi>adorn</hi> our <hi>Stalls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I must tell you, my <hi>Plot</hi> with my <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> is clearly for sale; for I intend to raise no other reputation to my self then that of Ready Money; and that I onely be-speak in these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory lines: since it were besides the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and an unpardonable presumption, to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi> these excellent Fancies, which do <hi>command,</hi> and have <hi>Emerited</hi> universal applause.</p>
            <p>All I am obliged to say therefore, is in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb facs="tcp:106769:3"/>
of the Collection of them into this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>consistencie,</hi> the making of a <hi>fluid</hi> a <hi>solid</hi> Body, which even the <hi>Experiment</hi> it self, among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, will fairly defend. But I should think the easie <hi>accommodation</hi> of them to every <hi>Gusto</hi> of Delight in this ready <hi>variety</hi> (saving the <hi>difficulty</hi> of <hi>purveying</hi> and hacking up and down) should best <hi>invite</hi> and <hi>entertain</hi> you.</p>
            <p>He that knows a Play, knows that Humours have no such <hi>fixedness</hi> and indissoluble <hi>connexion</hi> to the Design, but that without <hi>injury</hi> or <hi>forcible revulsion</hi> they may be <hi>removed</hi> to an <hi>advantage;</hi> which is so demonstrable, that I am sure nothing but a <hi>morose propriety</hi> will offer to deny it.</p>
            <p>To be a little serious: I was told by people that know better then my self, they would be in this Model more beneficial in sundry respects, then as they lay dispersed before. There is no sort of Melancholy whose sullen dulness and severe aversion to company, may not at one look be mockt out by one or other of these merry <hi>attempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratures</hi> and resemblances, which will most effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously manifest its Folly as in a Glass. Next, he who would make up a Treatment to his Friends by any such diversion, cannot study a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious method, without the help of Fidlers and mercenary Mimicks, and the long labor of a Cue: one Scene, which may almost be acted <hi>Extempore,</hi> will be abundantly satisfactory, being chosen fit and suitable to the Company, as none can come amiss. 'Twill make Physick work, 'twill cease

the pains of more inveterate diseases, 'twill allay the heat and distemper of Wine, and generally it is the <hi>Panacea,</hi> the universal Cure, mighty Mirths <hi>Elixir.</hi>
            </p>

The rest they take is little, and that little, is little ease, for like strict men of Order, they correct their bodies with a Bench, or a poor stubborn Table; if a Chimny offers it self with some few broken Rushes they are in Down; when they are sick, that's drunk, if they may have fresh straw, else they do despise these Worldly pamperings, for their poor apparell 'tis worne out to the dyet; new they seeke none; and if a man should offer, they are angry; scarce to be reconcil'd again with him: you shall not heare'um ask one cast Doublet once in a year: which is modesty befitting my poor friends: you see their Wardrope, though slender, competent: for shirts I take it, they are things worn out of their remembrance, lowzy they will be when they list, and mangie, which shews a fine variety; and then to cure'um a Tanners Lime-pit which is little charge, to Dogges and these, these two may be cur'd for three pence.</p>

T'other day I saw my face in a pail of water, and I had much ado to forbear drowing of my self. 'Tis no wonder then, that the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Nymph <hi>Oenone</hi> makes much of me, and lets all the other Shepherds shake their Ears like Asses: and the truth is, if I can finde never a handsomer, she shall serve the turn. This was her birth-day, she being born in the year—one thousand six hundred,—nay hold a little: but on this day of the moneth it was, VVinter or Summer, in the honour of which we all keep holiday: and therefore for the credit of her beauty, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my own Poetry, I have made such a Copy of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses on her, as will make her a thousand times handsomer then ever she was in her Life.</p>

He has his Maple block, his silver tongs, VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester pipes, and fire of Juniper. A neat, spruce-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest fellow, and no Goldsmith.</p>

               <speaker>Mill. son.</speaker>
               <p>But I must not, unless you send a Bier, or a Licter at my back. I do not use to run from my friends.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Gent.</speaker>
               <p>See if I can think on't now.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Son.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Gent.</speaker>
               <p>A Pistolet of that.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Son.</speaker>
               <p>Done; you have forgot a device to send me away. You are going a smocking perhaps.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>1 Gent.</speaker>
               <p>His own, due, due i'faith <hi>Antonio:</hi> the Pisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let's his own.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Gent.</speaker>
               <p>I confess it, there 'tis.</p>
               <p>Now if you could afford out of it a reasonable excuse to my Uncle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mill. son.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I can: but an excuse will not serve your turn: it must be a lie, a full lie, a downright lie, 'twill do no good else: if you'll go to the price of that.</p>

               <p>Is a lie dearer then an excuse?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Son.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, treble: this is the price of an Excuse; but a Lie is two more. Look how many foils goes to a fair fall, so many Excuses go to a full Lie; and less cannot serve your turn, let any Taylor i'th' Town make it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>1 Gent.</speaker>

               <p>VVhat? scale my Invention beforehand? you shall pardon me for that: VVell, I'll commend you to your Uncle, and tell him you'll be at home at Supper with him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mill. son.</speaker>
               <p>I know that too; you do not know a lie when you see it: remember it must stretch for all night.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mill. son.</speaker>
               <p>I shall want stuff; I doubt 'twill come to the other Pistolet.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mill. son.</speaker>
               <p>It must be fac'd; you know there will be a yard of Dissimulation at least, (City-measure) and cut upon an untroth or two, lin'd with fables, that must needs be, cold weather coming; if it had a gallon of hypocrisie, 'twould do well; and hooked together with a couple of Conceits, that's necessitie: VVell, I'll bring in my Bill: I'll warrant you as fair a Lie, by that time I have done with it, as any Gentleman i'th' Town can swear too, if he would betray his Lord and Master.</p>

               <p>His hair may come by divers Casualties, though he never go into the Field with his Foe: but a man to lose nine ounces and two drams of blood at one wound, thirteen and a scruple at another, and to live till he die in cold blood: yet the Chirurgeon (that cur'd him) said, if <hi>Pia-mater</hi> had not been perished, he had been a lives man to this day.</p>

               <p>Yet Pity bids me keep in my Charity: for me to pull an old Mans ears from his head with telling of a Tale: Oh foul Tale! Furthermore, there is the charge of Burial; every one will cry blacks, blacks, that had but the least finger in his blood, though ten degrees removed when 'twas done. Moreover, the Chirurgeon (that made an end of him) will be paid: Sugar-plums, and Sweet-breads; yet it may be the Man may recover again, and die in his bed.</p>

               <p>Look out, Miller: Is there ne'r a Miller amongst you here, Gentlemen?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Son.</speaker>
               <p>I should not be far off then; there went but a pair of Shears and a Bodkin between us. Will you to work, Miller? here's a Maid has a Sack full of News for you: Shall your Stones walk? will you grinde, Miller?</p>

               <p>This Villain (of my own flesh and blood) was accessary to the stealing of my daughter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Son.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Mountain!</p>
               <p>Shalt thou call a Mole-hill a scab upon the face of the earth? though a Man be a Thief, shall a Miller call him so? Oh egregious!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julio.</speaker>
               <p>Remember, sirrah, who you speak before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Son.</speaker>
               <p>I speak before a Miller, a Thief in grain; for he steals Corn. He that steals a Wench, is a true Man, to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Can you prove that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Son.</speaker>
               <p>I'll prove it strongly.</p>
               <p>He that steals Corn, steals the Bread of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: he that steals a Wench, steals but the flesh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>And how is their Bread-stealing more criminal then the flesh?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Son.</speaker>
               <p>He that steals bread, steals that which is lawful every day: he that steals flesh, steals nothing from the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106769:93"/>
fasting day: <hi>Ergo,</hi> to steal the bread is the arranter Thief.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>This is to some purpose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Son.</speaker>
               <p>Again, he that steals flesh, steals for his own bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly full: he that steals bread, robs the Guts of others: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the arranter Thief the Bread-stealer. Again, he that steals flesh, steals once and gives over; yes, and often pays for it; the other steals every day without satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To conclude, Bread-stealing is the more Capital Crime: for what he steals, he puts it in at the head; he that steals flesh (as the Dutch Author saies) puts it in at the foot (the lower Member.) VVill you go as you are now, <hi>Miller?</hi>
