            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Cannot but from the bleſſed Example of our Saviour (who was in his Age a new Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of old errors, <hi>viz.</hi> The falſe gloſſes of the Scribes and Phariſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20.) but accompt all ſuch Reformers in our times, bleſſed alſo; but for the keeping of Eaſter although I know not any Ordinance of Parliament diſcharging it; yet with ſubmiſſion to better judgments, I in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſſe conceive that Your Majeſties Reaſon upon which Your Queery is built, hath a great miſtake even in the foundation of it, You being pleaſed to lay this for a ground that the change of the Sabboth, and the Inſtitution of Eaſter are by one and the ſame equall authority and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Decree, which with Your Majeſties fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I cannot yeild to, for I humbly conceive that the change of the Jewiſh Sabboth (the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the worke of the Creation) unto the Lords day, the remembrance of that greaterwork (the worke of Redemption finiſhed upon this day of the Lords Reſurrection) was by no leſſe then by Divine authority, becauſe the keeping of one day in ſeven as a Sabboth to God, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160203:3"/>
ſanctified and ſet a part by Gods own example in the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and accordingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> many weekes before the Law was given <hi>Ex.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. but is one of the ten Commandements delivered by Gods own voyce, on <hi>Mount Sinay,</hi> Written by his owne finger in Tables of ſtone, commanded by himſelfe to be put into the Arke of the Covenant, which deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or ten Commandements, are alſo by our bleſſed Saviour in his Sermon upon the <hi>Mount,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the rule of his peoples morall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the end of the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17. And in the following part of that Sermon, wherein hee vindicates the Law from the corrupt gloſſes of the Scribes and Phariſes; He inſtances only in morall duties and morall Lawes, from all which Divines generally infer that the Decalogue is to continue in force unto the worlds end; And therefore it ſeemes moſt apparent that no authority that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that which appointed the ſeventh day from the <hi>Creation</hi> to be the Sabboth, could abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that day and appoint another day to be uſed inſtead of it, becauſe neither the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor the holy Scripture doth any where give the leaſt intimation, that any humane power may change any of the Commandements of God, and indeed ſo many abſurdities would follow upon ſuch an aſſertion, that I am confident Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty will not own it; It remaines therefore that the change of the day muſt needs be the worke of Chriſt himſelfe, or of his Apoſtles, who were Divinely inſpired, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 21. And to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160203:4"/>
prove that it was ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> That by Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the Lords day now ſucceeds in the room of the Jewiſh Sabboth, I ſhall uſe no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments then thoſe which I finde in learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> his Speech in the Star Chamber at the Cenſure of Mr. <hi>Traske;</hi> who expreſly ſaith, that it hath ever beene the Churches Doctrine that Chriſt made an end of all Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths by his Sabboth in the Grave; And that preſently the Lords Day came in the place of it, And that according to <hi>Auſtens</hi> judgement, The Lords Day is declared to be the Chriſtian Sabboth by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, which the ſaid Biſhop not only ſaith, but proveth by theſe Arguments, firſt becauſe he then began the new world <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. by whom he made the world, the firſt world which ended with his buriall, the ſecond world or new creation which began with his reſurrection; ſecondly becauſe the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts ſay Chriſt roſe <hi>una Sabbatorum,</hi> that is the firſt day of the weeke; thirdly the Apoſtles kept their holy meetings on that day, to Preach and Pray and Celebrate the Lords Supper, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7. fourthly the day is called the Lords day, not onely in the Apoſtles time, but by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 10. And he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addes that this epithite <hi>(Dominicum)</hi> in the Scripture is onely applied to theſe two, the Lords day and the Lords Supper, to ſhew that they are both to be taken alike in the Scripture: fifthly he ſaith wee have not onely example but expreſſe precept for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. that upon
