            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Likewiſe in this King <hi>Charles</hi> his time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have ſtopped the mouths of ſedulous and faithfull Preachers; they have aboliſhed Lectures, mutilated, ſtigmatized, whipped and tortured ſundry of the Clergy and Laity, as Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> Dr. <hi>Baſtwicke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi> and others, for diſcloſing their Tyranny and abuſes: and yet ſome ſillie men are ſo farre enamoured of them that they had rather a deſtructive Epiſcopacy ſhould roughly ſway in this Kingdome, then that a preſervative Parliament ſhould free both Clergy and Laity from ſuch Scorpions ſtings.</p>

                     <p>Though I bee not by Profeſſion a lawyer, yet I thinke I can ſhew it clearely by theſe reaſons following. Firſt, The intent of the law-makers, (which alwaies is to bee regarded in theſe caſes) is to bee conſidered which appeareth in the Preface of the Statute in theſe words; <hi>To ſuppreſſe the malice of thoſe that be evill affected to her highneſſe.</hi> Now I pray you conſider this, how can it be? or how is it poſſible that a Preacher of the ſame Religion which her Majeſtie profeſſeth, and maintaineth who is known continually to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for her highneſſe proſperity and happineſſe both of ſoule and Body; How is it poſſible I ſay, that ſuch a one ſhould bee maliciouſly affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her? Therefore it is evident that the Statute was made againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who uſe to ſlander her Highneſſe with the tearmes of Heretique, &amp;c. and no way againſt us for I dare boldly ſay of my ſelfe, and in the name of all my brethren. Curſed is he of God, and he deſerveth doubtleſſe to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of men that doth imagine the leaſt hurt againſt her Highneſſe. Secondly, the matter that maketh a man a Felon by that Statute, muſt proceeed from a malicious intent againſt her highneſſe, which I or any ſuch as I am can no way juſtly be charged with: pattly for that which is ſaid before, and partly for that my courſe of teaching and living in this Country theſe 9 yeares (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this laſt yeere, wherein I have been abſent) is known to have tended to no other end then the provoking and perſwading of the people to like of and yeeld obedience unto her Majeſtie, and the Religion received in her Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for the proofe whereof I referre my ſelfe to the conſciences of all men in the Country that have knowne me: And further it is likely that I who have bin trayned up in the Univerſities under Her Majeſties protection and have alwaies bended my Studies to the advancement of the ſincerity of the Goſpell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that thoſe ſmall crums of learning which I have gatheted, I doe acknowledge to have received by her Majeſties meanes Theſe things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, how can it be that I ſhould bee evill affected towards her Highneſſe, whom I proteſt I unfaynedly reverence? And therefore the worſt that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor can be charged withall is his overheat and to much vebemency by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his zeale againſt the abuſes, and not any malice againſt her Majeſtie, or the meaneſt of her ſubjects: Againe the matter to bring it within the compaſſe of the Statute muſt be falſe. But this booke is written in the behalf

of a moſt true cauſe. Laſtly the end of it, muſt be either to the defamation of the Queenes Majeſtie or ſtirring up of inſurrection, ſedition, or Rebellion. For the former I truſt that the whole courſe of our behaviour both in our Miniſtery and converſation, declareth it ſelfe to bee ſo farre from ſeeking to defame her highneſſe as it tendeth to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For I am perſwaded that there is none of us that would refuſe to undergoe any paine whereby her Majeſtie might any way be the better honoured, yea wee would not refuſe if need ſo required, to lay downe our lives for redeeming of the leaſt aking of her majeſties little finger wherewith ſhee might bee grieved. Now for the ſecond end which is the moving or ſtaring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this if there had bin any ſuch thing meant by the Author, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the people, as the Indictment chargeth me withall, (which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation of her Highneſſe government) yet (as I take it) it ſhould not be felony by that Statute, for the whole courſe of it, declareth, that it is onely meant of them that defame her Highneſſe Perſon, and not her Government, as it is manifeſt by the laſt proviſo, wherein it is ſhewed, that the whole Statute doth determine and end wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore it ſeemeth that the Statute hath no further regard then this, that her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe perſon might be preſerved in that Honour and dignity which becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her Royall Dignity and Eſtate. And I do beſeech your Lordſhips to anſwer me, for I appeale to your conſciences as you will anſwer to God for my life, and I pray you tell the Iury whether you do thinke the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Statute were in any ſort meant againſt us, and not rather againſt the Papiſts.</p>

But the cauſe why the Author did ſo earneſtly inveigh againſt them was this, as it ſeemeth, becauſe he perceived them not only to execute an Authority which he taketh to be unlawfull by the word of God, but alſo for that they do not the tenth part of that good, (even in thoſe corrupt callings) which by Law they might doe: and I am perſwaded, that your Lordſhips know in your owne conſciences, that they doe not the tenth part of that they are bound to doe.</p>

But this I take to be the Authors meaning, that it is not ſpoken in reſpect of her Majeſties Government and Laws, but in reſpect of the Biſhops whom your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips know to be wholly imployed in finding us out, and puniſhing of us, not regarding (in a manner) the puniſhing any ſinne elſe.</p>

                     <p>My Lords, we are not ignorant of this, that her Majeſty hath a care that all things might be well, and in that reſpect hath given them often in charge, (upon the conſiderations of theſe controverſies) to ſee to it that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be amiſſe, and becauſe ſhe hath a good opinion of them for their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and learning, ſhe believeth them when they ſay all is well and in good caſe, whereas if they had the grace to looke into theſe things, and to make them knowne as they be, indeed her Majeſty and the State, I doubt not, would quickly redreſſe them, and therefore was it that the Author did ſo charge them.</p>

And touching the ſecond place out of the 23 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Brethren I wiſt not that it was the high Prieſt:</hi> the meaning of that place is, as if he ſhould ſay, I thought there had not bin any high Prieſt now, ſeeing Chriſt being come, the high Prieſthood was to ceaſe, ſo that the Apoſtle doth not acknowledge any fault in that his Speech, for there was no lawfull high Prieſt of that time, neither did he acknowledge any, ſeeing they did end in Chriſt: And thus do the beſt Divines expound the place.</p>

have a night to thinke of what I had to ſay, and the next day to do with me as God ſhould move them.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etcht forth before the Judges in private, immediately after dinner, who uſing many perſwaſions to draw me to relent (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in private I will not expreſſe) told me that they ſent for me, for that they underſtood I deſired to be heard over-night, which they were willing then and there to do: I anſwered: My Lords, my meaning was not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire private but publique hearing, ſeeing I have nothing to ſay: but ſuch as would prevent my ſelfe, and diſappoint my publique ſpeech, if I ſhould ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it in private: yet becauſe they told me their other affaires would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to have any time with me till the latter end of the Aſſiſes, I was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing that I ſhould be prevented, then they ſhould be conſtrained to determine on a ſuddaine upon ſo weighty a matter; whereupon I did draw out a paper for each of them, containing theſe reaſons following.</p>
               <p>I humbly pray your Lordſhips to conſider, whether theſe reaſons ought not in conſcience to move you to ſtay the ſentence notwithſtanding the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict againſt me, and to be meanes of my releaſe.</p>
               <p>1. It ſeemeth that my caſe is not eſteemed Felony by the Judges of the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing they do uſually ſit in the High-Commiſſion Court, where the printing and diſperſing of the ſame and ſuch like Bookes are uſually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after as tranſgreſſions of another nature.</p>
               <p>2. No judgement in Law ought to be given in caſe of Felony, but upon a party firſt found guilty thereof by verdict of twelve men, but I am not ſo, for proofe whereof I pray you it may be remembred, that your Lordſhip gave the Jurie in iſſue onely for the triall of the fact, whether I were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſuch a Booke, and freed them from enquiring the intent, without which there is no Felonie.</p>
               <p>3. I humbly pray you to call to minde by what meanes the Iury was drawne to give that verdict they did, whether they were left wholly to their own conſciences, or were wrought unto it partly by promiſe aſſuring it ſhould be no further danger unto me, but tend to my good; and partly by feare, as appeareth in that it hath bin an occaſion of great griefe unto ſome of them ever ſince. And then I pray you to conſider, whether upon ſuch a verdict ſo drawne from twelve ſimple men, Chriſtian Iudges in a good conſcience, may proceed to ſentence of death?</p>
               <p>4. In caſe the verdict were never ſo free, yet your Lordſhips being men of wiſdome and knowledge are to conſider, whether the Statute whereupon I am Indicted, do agree to my caſe in the truth and meaning of it, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in that Booke ſpoken of her Majeſties perſon, but in duty and honour; and whether the drawing of it from her Majeſty to the Biſhops (as being a part of her body politique) be not a violent depraving and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Statute, which if it be, you being Chriſtian Iudges, cannot in a good conſcience upon ſuch a ground proceed to ſentence, contrary to your own knowledge.</p>
               <p>5. But if the Statute be to be taken ſo as it is urged, it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:123774:19"/>
that without a malicious intent againſt her Majeſties perſon, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it ſelfe maketh no act forbidden by it to be Felonious; wherein I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale firſt to God, and then to all men that have ſeene the whole courſe of my life &amp; to your Lps. own conſciences wherin I pray you to examine your ſelves in the ſight of God, whether either by your ſelves or the juſt report of any other you can finde me guilty of any act in all my life, that ſavoured of any malice or malicious intent againſt her Majeſty or of any other behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our than ſtandeth with the allegiance and duty of a moſt dutifull and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſubject. Of which malice or malicious intent againſt her Majeſty, if your conſciences cleare me before God, the act wherewith I am charged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not felonie without ſuch an intent, I hope you will conſider that you cannot with a good conſcience proceed to judgement.</p>
               <p>6. Yet if the Statute and intent were ſuch as it is ſaid, in caſe of life the evidences ought to be pregnant and full living witneſſes (I am ſure by the word of God, and I truſt alſo by the Laws of this land) were to have bin produced face to face to charge me. But I have none ſuch againſt me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any other thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaving onely papers and reports of Depoſitions taken by Eccleſiaſticall Commiſſioners and others, which kind of proofe the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the land caſt away in caſe of lands, and by no meanes allow to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and therefore are much leſſe to be allowed in a caſe of life, which being ſo, your Lordſhips ought to have a conſcience, that upon ſo weake evidences ſentence of death be not pronounced.</p>
               <p>7. But if the ſame that hath been given in for evidence in writing, had bin teſtifyed by men living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtanding out in the preſence of the Court and of mee the accuſed, I truſt your Lordſhips will conſider that no one of the evidences do directly prove me to bee the Author of the booke in queſtion which as it was hath little force in it as appeareth by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Author of the chiefeſt teſtimony is ſo grieved, that hee is aſhamed to come where hee is knowne. Whereupon howſoever the Iury have not diſcerned thereof, yet you being men of skill and underſtanding, are to have regard of it, and not upon ſo weake and impertinent proofes to proceed to judgement of death.</p>
               <p>8. If all theſe things were ſuch as they ought to bee, yet your Lordſhips are to conſider (ſuppoſing me to be the author of the booke in queſtion) that the ſaid booke for the ſubſtance of it, containeth nothing but that which is taught and beleeved to be a part of the Goſpell of Chriſt, by all the beſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches in <hi>Europe;</hi> wherein nothing being diverſe hom them, I cannot be condemned without condemning in me all ſuch Nations and Churches as hold the ſame doctrine. In which (if there be no error in them) the offence commonly be in forme, circumſtance and manner of writing which ſome men may thinke worthy an admonition, ſome more ſevere worthy correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and amercement, the ſharpeſt cannot judge it to deſerve more then ſome ſhort time of impriſonment. But death for an error of ſuch a kind in termes and words not altogether dutifull of certaine Biſhops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be but extream cruelty: Which ſeeing it ought to be farre from any Chriſtian man that hath the bowells of Chriſt in him.

                     <postscript>
                        <p>1. I do believe and have often preached, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a part of the true viſible Church of Chriſt, and that the preaching of the word and adminiſtration of the Sacraments therein are the holy Ordinances of God, profitable and comfortable to every one that rightly partakes thereof. In which regard I have bin and do yet deſire to be a preacher in the ſame Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have communicated in the Sacraments and Prayers therein, for the ſpace of 7 yeares at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> and about a yeare at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> immediatly before mine impriſonment, and therefore I do from my heart utterly renounce the Schiſme whereinto the <hi>Browniſts</hi> have fallen in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeparating themſelves from communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the publique Miniſtery thereof.</p>
                        <p>2. I know no other but that the Statute Laws of this land do maintaine the holy Miniſtery of the word and Sacraments in ſuch manner as any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may with a ſafe conſcience both adminiſter therein and communicate therewithall. Alſo that the Law which requireth a ſubſcription to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion ſo far as they contain the Doctrine of Faith and Sacraments is agreeable to the word of God.</p>
                        <p>3. I do believe that by the word of God her Majeſty hath, and ought to have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ſupreame Authority over all perſons, in all cauſes, both Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and Civill to inforce every man to do his duty and to be obedient in every thing that is not contrary to the word of God. And if the Prince ſhould command any thing contrary to Gods word, it is not lawfull for the Subjects to rebell or reſiſt, no not ſo much as in thought but with patience and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to beare all the puniſhments layd upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeking onely by Prayer to God, and ſupplication to Authority, and ſuch like peaceable meanes to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>aults amended.</p>
                        <p>4. I do believe that by the word of God, the Churches rightly reformed ought to be governed Eccleſiaſtically by the Miniſters, aſſiſted with Elders, and this is not my private judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch as I have learned out of the word of God, bin confirmed in by the writings of the moſt learned and godly men of ancient and latter times, and have ſeen practiſed with much peace and comfort in the beſt reformed Churches in Europe, and even by thoſe Exiles which her Majeſty to her great honour hath hitherto protected.</p>
                        <p>5. I do believe that the Cenſures of the Church ought meerely to concern the Soule, and may not impeach any Subject, much leſſe any Prince, in the liberty of Body, Dominion, goods, or any earthly priviledge whatſoever; and that therefore the Papall Excommunication that depoſeth Princes, and freeth their Subjects from their Allegiance or any part of Chriſtian obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Civill Authority, is blaſphemous againſt God, injurious to all men,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:123774:24"/>
and directly contrary to Gods word: neither do I believe that a Chriſtian Prince ought otherwiſe to be ſubject to the Cenſures of the Church, then our gracious Queene profeſſeth her ſelfe to be unto the preaching of the word &amp; adminiſtration of the Sacraments according to the doctrin of our Church in Mr. <hi>Nowells</hi> Catechiſme and the <hi>Hom:</hi> of the right uſe of the Church, at this day appointed publiquely to be read.</p>
                        <p>If I underſtand of any other thing that I am charged to hold as a ſtrange and private opinion, I would be willing to ſhew my minde freely in it; for my deſire is, that her Highneſſe might truely be informed of every thing that I holde: ſo ſhould I be ſure to obtaine her gracious favour, without which I do not deſire to live.</p>

               <p>WIthin foure or five dayes after Mr. Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> returned unto me, ſignifying that all that was done was miſtaken, for that was not the ſubmiſſion that was meant of me, but another. Which when I had peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed I ſound it the ſame (onely the laſt clauſe left out) which was oſtered mee by the Judges at the Aſſiſes. And he ſaid the Clarke to whom the making of the letter to Mr. <hi>Nowel</hi> putting in one for another. And becauſe I utterly refuſed to conſult of it, as having yeelded before to ſo much as I might hee prayed me to underſtand what I tooke exceptions againſt and for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. So wee entred into many diſcourſes, as firſt how the Diſcipline could be ſaid to be againſt the Queenes Prerogative Royall ſeeing it was (as I ſaid I did beleeve) expreſſed in the Scriptures whereby all lawfull priviledges of Princes are warranted. Then we debeted whether the Supremacy of a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Prince be the ſame with an Heathen, or diverſe from it. After that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the authority of Princes in making Church laws be <hi>dejurt,</hi> or <hi>de facto</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And laſtly of the moſt points of <hi>diſcipline.</hi> Thus we continued 5 or 6 hours, and at laſt he would have no anſwer of me then, but he prayed me to adviſe of it, for he would come againe. I anſwered, that the oftner he came the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer

he ſhould be, but I told him I would not accept of it, yet hee came twice after and tooke my reaſons of my refuſall to yeeld thereunto, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing me all the favour he could procure me, he departed.</p>
               <p>After this the Aſſiſes approaching, and the generall report being that it would go hard with me. I being deſirous to uſe any good meanes, did not onely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> who had heretofore dealt for mee, but alſo I was adviſed to write againe unto Mr. <hi>Nowell,</hi> earneſtly charging him to take my caſe to heart, ſeeing he had promiſed to procure me favour, whereupon I wrote unto him this letter following.</p>

                  <body>
                     <p>RIght Worſhipfull Mr. <hi>Nowell,</hi> as I did rejoyce when I perceived that you were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to deale with mee about my ſubmiſsion, becauſe of that Reverend eſtimation that you have bin ſo long of among the Worthies in the Church of God, hoping, that I I ſhould have found thereby, ſome comfortable meanes of meditation unto autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for my releaſe, ſo I am now occaiſoned to feare that all that credit with you are of, ſhall be uſed as an inſtrument to further and haſten extremity upon me. For ſo much time being paſſed ſince I voluntarily yeelded to that ſubmiſsion which you brought unto me and no liberty appearing from any place, but rather that being given out, that my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion ſhall be a ſpeciall meanes to haſten my death, and no way to procure my liberty, I am conſtrained to write unto you, to let you underſtand, that as I looke for that end the next weeke at the Aſsiſes at <hi>Kingſton</hi> (where I have been a Preacher) which hath ſo long bin threatned, but (to the doubling of my torments deferred, whereunto (I doubt not the Lord will ſtrengthen me, as graciouſly he hath hitherto done. So I pray you as you will anſwer unto God for my blood, which I am perſwaded your credit being imployed to the uttermoſt (as in the word and faith of a Chriſtian you promiſed) might have preſerved that you would ſo take my caſe to heart, as it may inforce you to leave no ſtone unturned which may either further my liberty, or at leſt cleere your conſcience from being any way acceſſary to my death. For it will one day bee an heavy thing to your heart, to thinke that you ſhould be ſet on worke, and the accompt that is worthily made of you, imployed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence, yea and as it were with aſſurance of life and liberty, to draw that from a Preacher and Profeſſor of the goſpel which afterward ſhall be uſed to haſten his end: and you will ſay it had bin better that you had never bin of any reckoning, then to bee made an Inſtrument to further ſuch an action. This I write unto you not in any troubled affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the feare of death, for I thanke God I am willing to end my daies, and (if it pleaſe the Lord) even in this manner and hope that my death ſhall further the cauſe, for which I ſuffer more then my life. But leſt I ſhould neglect any meanes which might ſeeme to be a furtherance to prevent the ſame, or leave that dutie unperformed unto you, which I take my ſelfe in conſcience bound to diſcharge, the Lord make us willing and able to diſcharge every good dutie, that he enjoyneth us to his glory, <hi>the good of his Church, and our own comfort, whether by l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About the ſame time came a Letter from the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> to a Scotiſh Merchant, one Mr. <hi>Iohnſon</hi> lying in <hi>London,</hi> to be delivered to her Majeſty (as was ſaid) being written in my behalfe, as he had done once before when I was cloſe priſoner; this Letter did the Merchant deliver to her Majeſty, and the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> upon my Letter went to the Councell, whereby whatſoever was wrought, as ſoone as the Judges heard that I was brought to <hi>Kingſtone</hi>
