            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO The Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is well known to all persons, that understand the Mathematicks, that Dialling (one excellent part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) hath with much Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry been improved of late years, and abundance of <hi>Treatises</hi> have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thereof, wherein several wayes
<pb facs="tcp:105578:3"/>
have been delivered, for delineating the Hour Lines on Dial Playns, some more speedy, as the Instrumental way; some for more exactness, as the Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical, and the Geometrical way good in it self, and in some cases serving, where the other two cannot convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be made use of.</p>
            <p>Dialling being thus plainly and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly communicated to the world, it's easie for an Industrious and Ingenious spirit to attain the knowledge of it, so far as to be able to draw his draught; but then wanting the knowledg of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on the Playn, he is fain to sit down and satisfie himself with having taken much pains, to attain that, which in the end will not profit him, by reason that he hath learnt but half his Art. Just like a Surveyor, that can hardly draw the draught, and give the proportions, or dimensions for the building of an house, but cannot rear the Fabrick there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb facs="tcp:105578:3"/>
of, without the help of Carpenters and Masons; So here, our Dialist can only draw the draught, but must be beholding to the Painter to finish his Dial.</p>
            <p>The Consideration of which hath made me adventure in the ensuing Work, to lay down such Rules for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, mixing, and laying on of Oyl-Colours, as that the meanest Capacity may thereby attain to the knowledg of <hi>Vulgar Painting,</hi> and may render our Ingenious Artist a Compleat <hi>Diallist</hi>; n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t able onely to draw his Draught, but, also to finish his work, and make it sit for use; which I have observed, not one in twenty, that are otherwise knowing in this Art, can do.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant of the lightness and vanity of the Times wherein we live, and therefore expect to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by a sort of people so vain, that they are apt to Condemn all, before
<pb facs="tcp:105578:4"/>
they Understand any; Yet let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious know, That the Rules herein delivered, are the same, which I my self have alwayes practiced, and that with as good Applause as any Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor in this kind whatsoever; and I doubt not, but he that industriously pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiseth what he finds here delivered, will soon become my Champion to defend my Rules, which he finds so true, against all opposers whatsoever.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the meanness of my style may perhaps not a little detract from the Reader's pleasure; for which I hope the subject will plead my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, which requires to be delivered, rather in demonstrative, than Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Expressions; and 'tis the Profit of my Reader that I more aym at than his Pleasure: however, if he chance to fail of his expectation in both, through Sloth or Ignorance, yet he cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me for being prodigal of his time,
<pb facs="tcp:105578:4"/>
the Discourse being so brief, which I desire may be as kindly accepted, as freely imparted.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105578:9"/>
any stone will serve, whose hardness will not suffer a Knife to wear it away, and withal sound and free from small pores: for if your stone be full of small holes, as some are, the colour that you first grind thereon cannot be so cleansed off, but there will remain some of it in those small holes, which will stain and spoyl the next different colour that is ground after it. This Grinding-stone ought to be a foot and a half square, and so thick as may make its weight suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keep it firm from moving when you are grinding on it.</p>
               <p>When at any time you have done using of your Stone, you must be sure to cleanse it well from all the colour that shall remain, by scowring it with a Cloath and fine dry ashes or other dust; for if you set up your Stone foul with colour, it will put you to great trouble when it is dry to make it clean when you come next to use it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105578:9"/>The <hi>Mulier</hi> must be a pebble stone of the fashion of an Egg, with one end broken off flat, three inches Diameter is sufficient on the flat end, and five inches in height is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that you may with more ease command it in the time of grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You must have a piece of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn horn about three inches square, this piece of horn is used to keep the colour together in the grinding, and to take the colour of the stone when it's ground sufficient.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You must have Galley-pots, Pans or Pipkins to put your colours in when you have ground them; and these Pots or Pans ought to be proportionable to the colour you grind: for if it be but little, and your Vessel great, your colour will be lost and spent in daubing about the sides of it; therefore for a little quantity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105578:10"/>
of colour, have a small Vessel; and for a larger quantity, a larger Vessel: however, let the largest hold not above two quarts, lest it prove too cumbersome and troublesom to you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You must have Brushes and Pencils of all sorts, some for priming and laying on of colours; others for drawing Lines, Figures, Letters, and the like; Brushes are made with bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and are of several sizes, as from two inches and an half diameter, to a quarter of an inch: their goodness consists in the bristles lying close and even at the ends, and being well bound to the frame.</p>
               <p>Pencils are made of finer hair, as of Colaber tayls, &amp;c. They are of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts, as of Swan, Goose, and Ducks quill fitht and pointed; their goodness consists in their being well bound, and that the hair lyes close, and that the pointed ones draw very
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105578:10"/>
sharp, being wetted with your tongue, and drawn through your lips.</p>
               <p>When you have done using of your Pencils or Brushes, you must wash the colour clean out with Sope and warm water; else the drying of the colour will so mat them, that they will never be fit for use afterwards: however, take notice you need not wash them every time you have done using them, but only when it will be a considerable time before you use them again; otherwise putting them into a pan of water, or letting them remain covered with colour or Oyl, will preserve them sufficiently when you use them often together.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You must have an Easel for the painting of Dials, easie to be made by your self or by a Joyner; it must be almost of the fashion of a Ladder about 7 foot high, having the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most round moveable with a stay in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105578:11"/>
it on the back-side of the Easel to stay it in what posture you please; the sides of it must be boared full of holes at equal and opposite distances, wherein two pins are to be put on which your Dial board is to be set, and may be let lower or set higher at pleasure according as occasion shall require.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You must have <hi>Black-Lead</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which you may buy at the Colour-Shops, or at the Stationers; good Pencils have of late been very scarce in <hi>London,</hi> till just upon the writing hereof there came Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements abroad of good ones to be sold at the <hi>Prince's Arms</hi> over against the King on Horse-back in the <hi>Stocks-Market.</hi> Which Pencils I have since tryed, and find excellent good; they are marked thus, R. ♥ F. so that you may easily know them: however, the best way to be sure is to try them on Paper; if they shed their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105578:11"/>
Colour freely, and draw a black line oft-times together, they are good; else not. The Use of these Pencils are to draw the draught of your Dial on paper, and afterwards to draw it on the Plain it self, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after is taught.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You must have Guilding Cushion to cut your leaf-Gold upon when you guild; the bottom is a Board about 6 inches broad, and about 12 inches long; one which is fastened to the Cover, which should be a piece of fine tanned Calves-Leather, the flesh side outward: This must be stuffed extraordinary hard, and as flat on the top as may be; for want of this, the leathern bottom of an ordinary Cushion will serve at a pinch, if you have not much to do.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You must have a Knife of <hi>Cane</hi> to cut your Gold on the Cushion; you must form or shape it with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105578:12"/>
sharp edged Knife, that the edge of your Cane may be the sharper and clearer. If you want a Cane Knife, and know not well how to make it, an ordinary pocket Knife will do the business; provided its edge be very sharp, and free from notches. You must wipe it very dry on your sleeve or some dry Cloath; for if the edge be never so little moist, the leaf-gold will stick to it, and spoyl all.</p>
               <p n="9">9. You must have a tuft of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or the hinder foot of a Hare or Coney to press down your gold after it's laid on the size, to make it take well and lye smooth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. You ought to have several pieces of wood about 3 inches long, some one inch broad, some half an inch broad, and some not above a quarter; These must have fine pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cloath glewed on the bottom,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105578:12"/>
with a small button or handle on the top to hold it by, this is to take your leaf-gold from the Cushion when it is cut in shape, and lay it on such figures, letters or mouldings of a Sun-Dial as you intend to guild (as hereafter is taught) if your work be hollow or protuberant that you are to guild, then the gold is commonly taken up on a bunch of Cotton, and laid on, pressing it down with the same.</p>
               <p n="11">11. You must have Brass Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, which will be useful to you on all occasions; indeed you cannot be well without them: The best places to buy them at, are the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Instrument-makers.</p>
               <p n="12">12. You must have Rulers of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral lengths to draw your lines with; these must be footed upon one side with little wier pegs to stand from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105578:13"/>
the wood about a quarter of an inch; this is to keep your Ruler up from the board, that when you lay it across lines newly drawn, it may not blot them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Fine neat squares are also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, they will be useful at every turn to draw perpendicular lines, or what else requires to be true and square.</p>
               <p n="14">14. You must have Crusiples or Melting-pots to burn such Colours in that require it: The best places to buy them at, are the Iron-mongers in <hi>Foster-Lane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. You must have also large Earthen Vessels to wash such Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in that require washing to be fit for use.</p>
               <p n="16">16. You must have also Cane-ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105578:13"/>
to take your Leaf-gold out of the Book, and lay it on the guilding Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion to be cut.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. A Catalogue of several <hi>Colours</hi> used in the Art of <hi>Painting;</hi> their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Use.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>White-Lead</hi> and <hi>Cerus,</hi> these two Colours are much of a nature, <hi>Cerus</hi> being only <hi>White-Lead</hi> more refined; which advanceth its price, and renders it something more esteemed among Picture-Drawers; but the White-Lead is every way as useful: This Colour is naturally apt to be ground very fine, and is the onely White colour used in <hi>Painting</hi> with Oyl: With this Colour the Playns of Dials are laid for the last
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105578:14"/>
Colour to draw thereon the Hour Lines, that they may be the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. With this Colour Posts, Payls, Palisadoes, Gates, Doors, Windows, divers Wainscottings, and other Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentary and Joynary work are often coloured both for beauty and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It resists the weather well, but within doors it's apt to tawnish and grow rusty. This Colour dries of it self indifferently well, especially if it be wrought pretty stiff; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to make it dry speedily, some put Oyl of Turpentine to it, in the tempering, which makes it dry much more speedily; but then without doors it will not resist the weather so well: Therefore the best way to make it dry speedily, and yet last long, is to put drying Oyl to it, which is made by steeping Red-Lead in Linseed Oyl for about a fortnight, stirring it every day once or twice, and afterwards let it settle clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you use it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:105578:14"/>
                  <hi>Lampe-Black,</hi> Is a Colour that of it self is very fine, and may be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Linseed Oyl, and used without grinding, after it hath soak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two or three daies in the Oyl; but when it is thus laid on, it will be a long-time a drying, by reason of a certain greasiness that is inherent to it; to remedy which, it must be burnt as hereafter is taught, which consumes the fatty substance, and then it dries well. But <hi>note,</hi> That after it's burnt, it must be ground on a stone; otherwise it will not work well by reason of its being hardned or crusted in the fire. This Colour is used in the Margins of some Dials that have their Figures guilt; A little of this Colour and much white, make the Ash Colour; and according to the quantity of either more or less, it gives several delightful varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:105578:15"/>
                  <hi>Willow Charcoal</hi> and <hi>Sea-coal</hi>; These two are a good Black for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary uses, only they are something coarse, and require good labour in the grinding to make them fine; they dry well, especially the <hi>Charcoal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spanish Brown.</hi> This Colour is a certain Earth brought out of <hi>Spain</hi>; the best is that which is of a deep bright colour, and free from stones; indeed I think there is little of it free from grittiness more or less: This Colour will grind well, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing its grittiness, if you take pains with it. This is the only Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour used in priming of all manner of Timber-work, being fittest for that purpose for divers reasons: As first, for its Cheapness, it being but of small price. Secondly, it dries kindly for that purpose, not so soon but that it gives the Oyl sufficient time to pierce into wood; nor is it so long as to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105578:15"/>
make the time over-tedious. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it kindly receives all other Colours that are laid on it. Some are of such a nature, that when they are dry no other will take on them but with great difficulty. For Example, <hi>White-Lead</hi> when it's throughly dry is so greasie, that if you would either draw Lines on it, or lay other Colours upon it, they will run together just as Ink will when you write on grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie paper. This Colour of it self is a perfect Horse-flesh colour; it's the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural shadow for Vermillion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixt with White, gives several varieties, according as the quantity of each is predominant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Red-Lead,</hi> Is a Sandy colour, not to be ground very fine on a stone: The onely way to make it fine is by washing (which shall be shewed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards): This Colour is an exceeding great dryer and binder, for which purpose it's many times mixed with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105578:16"/>
other Colours (such as will bear it) to make them dry speedily: 'Tis a Colour that resists the weather as well as any colour whatsoever, if it have the same advantage in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It's of it self an Orange colour, and is the onely Colour used in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of drying and fat Oyls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vermillion.</hi> This is a very rich Colour, and of a good body; and if pains and time be bestowed, it will be ground as fine as is possible for a Colour to be ground: which it must be, or else it works as bad as any Colour whatsoever; but if it be ground fine even as Oyl it self, no Colour works better. This Colour is used to draw the Hour Lines on Sun-Dials, and for divers other not common uses: it drys well if you work it stiff. The best way to buy it is in the stone; for otherwise it may be sophisticated &amp; spoyled with Red-Lead if bought in the powder.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105578:16"/>
This Colour is a perfect Scarlet, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with White it gives Scarlet Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in divers varieties, according to the quantity of each Colour mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The natural shadow for <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million</hi> it self, is <hi>Spanish Brown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lake,</hi> Is also a rich Colour, and may be ground very fine; it's often used in Ornaments of Dials, and a Margin of it sets off well with gold figures, especially if a little white be added to it. It's excellent in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of Flowrages. <hi>Lake</hi> and <hi>Bice</hi> make a Purple of divers varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties according to the Blew that is mixed with it. <hi>Lake</hi> of it self is an excellent Crimson colour. <hi>Lake</hi> and White make an excellent Crimson Carnation in divers varieties accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quantity that is mixed of each. <hi>Lake</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> and a little <hi>Red Lead</hi> make a Flesh colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:105578:17"/>
                  <hi>Smalt,</hi> Is a lovely Blew at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if strewed on; if you will work it in Oyl, it must be made fine with washing: The truth is, when it's at the finest, it works but badly in Oyl, by reason of its harshness; It must also have <hi>White-Lead</hi> added to it if wrought in Oyl, or else it's too dark, and shews not its self; and when all is done, time is apt to turn it Black: Therefore the best way is to strew it (as shall be shewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) and then there is not a more glorious Blew to be made. This is an Excellent Colour for the Margin of a Dial, if the Figures are guilt, and for several other purposes, as it may by an ingenious spirit be made use of: If you buy it to work in Oyl, the finest is best, which they call <hi>Oyl Smalt</hi>; but if it be for strewing, the coarsest you can get is the best, both for Colour and Continuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:105578:17"/>
                  <hi>Blew Bice,</hi> Is a Colour fine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for almost any use; it is but a pale colour, and in Dial-Painting is used for a Margin ground to guild figures in small playns or stacks of Dials that are near the eye: This Colour works well, though it be a little sandy; <hi>Bice</hi> and <hi>Pink</hi> make a Green; <hi>Bice</hi> and <hi>Lake</hi> make a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>Bice</hi> and <hi>White</hi> make a light Blew, of each several varieties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quantity of each.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blew Verditer,</hi> Is a Colour some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sandy; it's subject to change and turn greenish, and makes a good Green, mixed with Yellows, this Colour may serve in Dial-Painting, where <hi>Bice</hi> and <hi>Smalt</hi> are wanting; but not so good as either of them mixt with Whites and Yellows; or both, giveth variety of Colours for divers uses.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:105578:18"/>
                  <hi>Indico,</hi> Is a very dark Blew, and seldom used without a mixture of White, unless to shadow other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; it grinds fine, and works well, and is much used in vulgar Painting for the last Colours of Windowes, Doors, Pales, Posts, Rails, Pallisadoes, or any other Timber-work. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the Weather well, onely it's something dear, and yet not very chargeable for work, by reason much White must be mixed with it, which makes a little of it go a great way: Vulgar Painters instead thereof use Blew Balls, which they buy at the Colour-Shops which nearly imitates it, but is not so good a Colour nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Beauty nor Lasting. <hi>Indico</hi> and White make a Lead Colour; 'tis a pleasant colour to Marble <hi>White</hi> withal, or to shadow it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amber,</hi> Is a colour that will be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105578:18"/>
ground very fine, but must have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and time bestowed on it: it's very apt to furr the <hi>Mulier,</hi> and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be drawn under it, without sleight of hand in the grinding this Colour; dryes and binds exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore resists Weather well: It's much used in Painting, for the many pleasant Varieties it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. This Colour of it self is a perfect Hair colour, and being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with White, giveth variety of pleasant colours. This colour burnt in a Crusipple is the natural shadow for Gold; It likewise shadows divers other colours, and in great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verdigrease,</hi> Is a good Green, something inclining to a Blew; therefore for divers uses it's Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish colour must be corrected with Yellows: This colour is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very foul, and requires time
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105578:19"/>
and pains to pick and cleanse it: It requires also labour to grind it fine. This colour dryes speedily, and is a Green that is used on most occasions that require that colour. It is of it self a perfect Willow green; and being mixed with Pink Yellow, it makes a pure lively Grass-green: and these being mixed with White, gives several varieties of Light Greens, according to the quantity of each.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yellow Daker,</hi> Is of two sorts; the one gotten in <hi>England,</hi> the other brought from beyond the Seas: the one is a light Yellow, much like the colour of Wheat straw; the other is somewhat of a deeper colour. This Colour may with labour be ground very fine, but something troublesom by reason of its Clamminess: This colour is used to make Gold size, and is also much used in vulgar Painting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:105578:19"/>
                  <hi>Pink Yellow,</hi> Is a colour some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inclining to a Green; 'tis a good Yellow for some uses, and grinds well. It's chiefly used to mix with other Colours to make Green.</p>
               <p>Besides these Colours, a Dial-Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must furnish himself with Leaf-Gold for Guilding, Linseed Oyl to temper his Colours with, and Oyl of Turpentine to make his Colours dry the more speedily, by mixing a little of it among his Colours.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. How to order such Colours as require to be burnt in the fire, to make them the more fit for some uses.</head>
               <p>COlours that commonly use to be burnt, are <hi>Lamp-Black, Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Yellow Oaker,</hi> and <hi>Spanish Brown. Lamp-Black</hi> must alwayes be burnt, otherwise it will never dry kindly. <hi>Umber</hi> works and dryes well enough without burning for many uses: But when you would colour either Hair, Horse, Dogg, or the Bodies of some Trees, then it must be burnt, which makes it of a deeper and brighter colour; So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for some particular uses the others are burnt, else not: The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105578:20"/>
thus, Take a Crusipple or Melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Pot of bigness sufficient to hold the quantity of Colour you desire to burn, set it in the midst of a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal or other clear fire, and let it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue therein till it be all like a coal; then take it out, and let it cool of it self; then grind it and make it fit for use.</p>

               <p>SOme Colours are of such a gritty sandy nature, that it's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to grind them so fine as some Curious Works do require; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to get forth the flower and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the colour, you must do thus; Take what quantity of Colour you please to wash, and put it into a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of fair Water, and stirr it about till the water be all coloured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; then if any filth swim on the top of the water, scum it clean off, and when you think the grossest of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105578:21"/>
the colour is settled to the bottom, then pour off that water into a second Earthen Vessel that is large enough to contain the first Vessel full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four or five times; then pour more water into the first Vessel, and stir the colour that remains till the water be thick; and after it is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle settled, pour that water also into the second vessel, and fill the first ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel again with water, stirring it as before: do thus so often till you find all the finest of the colour drawn forth, and that none but course grit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty stuff remains in the bottom; then let this water in the second Vessel stand to settle till it be perfectly clear, and that all the colour be sunk to the bottom; which when you perceive, then pour the water clear from it, and reserve the colour in the bottom for use, which must be perfectly dryed before you mix it with oyl to work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:105578:22"/>The Colours thus ordered, are <hi>Red-Lead, Blew</hi> and <hi>Green Bice, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor</hi> Blew and Green, <hi>Smalt,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times <hi>Spanish Brown,</hi> when you would cleanse it well for some fine work, as also yellow Oaker, when you intend to make Gold size of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take Notice also,</hi> That unless you intend to bestow some cost on a piece, you need not be at the trouble to wash your Colours, but use them for coarse ordinary work as you buy them at the Shops.</p>

then with your <hi>Mulier</hi> mix it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little, and turn your <hi>Mulier</hi> three or four times about, and if you find there be not Oyl enough, put a little more to it, till it come to the consistence of an Oyntment; for then it grinds much better and sooner then when it's so thin as to run about the stone: You must of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in the grinding bring your Colour together with your piece of Lanthorn horn, and with the same keep it together in the middle of your stone; when you find you have ground it fine enough (by the continual motion of your <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> about the stone, holding it down as hard as your strength will permit, which you must also move with such a sleight, as to gather the Colour under it) and that no knots nor grittiness remains; then with your Horn cleanse it off the stone into a Gally-Pot, Pan, or what ever
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105578:23"/>
else you design to put it into: and then lay more colour on your stone, and proceed to grinding as before: do so thus often till you have ground as much of this same Colour as shall serve your occasions; and if you grind other Colours after it, let the stone be well cleansed from the first colour with a cloath and fine dry Ashes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. How to order Colours for working after they are ground.</head>
               <p>WHen you have ground your Colours (if you observe my Directions in grinding) they will be too thick for use without the addition of more Oyl; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when you have ground those Colours you desire, and intend to use them either simply by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or compounded with others, according as your fancy or occasions require, you must then add more Oyl unto them, till they be so thin as not to let the ground on which they are laid be seen through them;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105578:24"/>
for if it be so thin as to let the ground be seen through them, or to run about when it be laid on, it is not good, and will require to be colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the oftner before your work be perfect and substantial; whereas if your Colour be as stiff as it can well be wrought, your work will be done with more speed; once doing being more substantial then three times doing with thin Colour.</p>
               <p>Here by the way take notice of the fraud and deceit of Common Painters, who commonly agree to do work by the Yard at a certain price, and the work to be coloured three times over, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly paint with such thin colour, (to avoid the labour of grinding, a little Colour serving a great deal of Oyl, and besides it works with less pains, and takes up less stuff) that all three times doing over is not so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105578:25"/>
as one time would be, if the Colour had a thick and substantial body: and I'le maintain, that three times colouring with substantial and well bodied Colour, shall last ten times as long as that which is wrought thus sleightly by common Painters.</p>
               <p>In mixing Oyl with your Colours, take this further <hi>Note,</hi> That if the colour to be mixt be your priming Colour, (that is the first colour you lay on) it ought to be made very thin, that it may have Oyl enough to pierce into the Wood, which is much for its preservation; but after your first colour is laid, let your next be thicker as before is taught.</p>
               <p>But if your Colour to be mixt be for the drawing of the Hour Lines, or making the Figures in a Sun-Dial, then let it be tempered as stiff
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105578:25"/>
as is possible to work it, that it may not presently decay, but may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable by the quantity laid on, to last as long as any Colour on the Dial; to which purpose its being wrought in fat Oyl will much conduce to its lasting: How this fat Oyl is made, see <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. where you have the manner of it taught at large.</p>

               <p>GOld size is made of fat Oyl, and Yellow Oaker; the Oyl is no other than Linseed Oyl thus order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Take what quantity of Linseed Oyl you judge will serve your turn, put it in a Brazen or other Vessel that will endure the fire; when it is in the Vessel, put to it a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Red-Lead; the more you put in, the better will your Oyl be (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you put not in so much as to hinder its boyling) for this Red-Lead adds a drying quality to the Oyl, which otherwise being thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105578:26"/>
would not dry in any time: when the Oyl and Lead are thus mingled together, let them gently boyl over a fire of coals without flame a pretty while; when it's boyled enough, (which you may know by taking a little of it, and let it cool, and if it roape like thin Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, then it is enough) then with a lighted paper set it on fire, (which fireing will burn away much of the greasiness of it) which let burn about a minute or two, or more or less, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as your quantity of Oyl is; and then let it be extinguished (by clapping a Cloath over it) afterwards let it stand to cool and settle; and when all the Lead be sunk to the bottom, and the Oyl be clear, then pour it off, and reserve it in a Bladder for use.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Yellow Oaker</hi> must also be thus ordered before it be made into
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105578:27"/>
size; Take <hi>Yellow Oaker</hi> and grind it on a stone with water till it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine, and afterwards lay it on a Chalk stone to dry; this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way: but a better, is to wash it as is taught in the Fourth Chapter. For when it is washed, to be sure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the purest of the Colour will be used; and besides, it's done with more ease, and less daubing.</p>
               <p>When your Oyl and Oaker are thus prepared, you must grind them together, as you do other Oyl-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; but it's something more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious work, and must be ground very fine, even as Oyl it self: for the finer it is, the greater Lustre will your Gold carry that is laid on it.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Note,</hi> That you must give it such a quantity of your fat Oyl, that it may not be so weak as to run when you have laid it on; nor so
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105578:27"/>
stiff, that it may not work well; but of such a competent body, that after it is laid on, it may settle it self smooth and glasie, which is a chief property of good size.</p>

               <p>But if your Dial be more rich, you must have (besides the four fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Colours) Gold size to make the Figures to lay Gold on, and <hi>Smalt</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:105578:29"/>
or <hi>Blew Bice</hi> for the Margin and inner Table; and if you intend to bestow Curiosity, then you may use such other Colours as your fancy shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you may be most suitable to your design; for which purpose your care must be to observe the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Fashion of whatsoever good Dial you meet with, and to register your Observations: This will be a great help to your fancy on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. Some Instructions for making of Plains and Boards to draw Dials on.</head>
               <p>DIal Playns are of two sorts; first, such as are of the Wall of a Building it self: or secondly, such as are drawn on Tables.</p>
               <p>The first sort if they are made on Brick-work, is done with Lime and Hair plaistered on the Wall, of what bigness the Owner pleaseth; This is the Common way.</p>
               <p>But a better and more durable way, is to temper Lime and Sand
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105578:30"/>
with Linseed Oyl; 'tis not very chargeable, but exceeding profitable: for this substance will harden to the hardness of a stone, and not decay in many Ages.</p>
               <p>If you cannot have Oyl enough to temper a quantity of Plaister suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for your Playn, then temper your Lime and Sand with scummed Milk; this you will find to last six times as long as your Common plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
               <p>Now for Tables of Wood, they being the most Common, I shall give such Directions for the making of them, as I have alwayes found most profitable and fit for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>The Woods that I find best for this use are the clearest Oak, and the reddest Firr, provided it be not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105578:31"/>
Turpentiney; between these two Woods I find little difference as to their alteration by the weather, both being subject to split in case they are bound, and have not free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to shrink with dry weather, and swell with wet; but as to their last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I judge Oak to be the better: and how long Firr will last thus se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and defended with Oyl Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, I have not yet experienced; but we may judge that good red Firr that is very Roseny, will last the age of any man whatsoever, if it be secured as things of this nature ought to be.</p>
               <p>In working any of these woods, I advise, that first your Boards be cut to such a length as you intend your Dial Board shall be of, and so many of them as may make up the breadth designed; then let them be Joynted and plained on both sides, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105578:31"/>
set to dry (for 'tis observed, That though Boards have layn in an house never so long, and are never so dry, yet when they are thus shot and playned, they will shrink after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards beyond belief, if kept dry): when you think they are dry enough and will shrink no more, let them be again shot with good Joynts, and every Joynt in the glewing doubled together with Pins, as Coppers do the bottoms of their Tubs; after it is thus glewed, and the Joynts be sufficiently dry, then let the face of the Board be very well playned and tryed every way, that it may be both smooth and true, and the edges shot true, and all of a thickness, as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of Wainscot are commonly wrought, the edges must be thus true and even, that it may sit into the rabet of a moulding put round it; Just as a panel of Wainscot doth in its frame: This will give liberty
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105578:32"/>
to the Board to shrink and swell without tearing; whereas Mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are nayled round the edge as the common way is, doth so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the motion of the wood, that it cannot shrink without tearing: but Boards made this way will last a long time without either parting in the Joynts, or splitting in the wood.</p>
               <p>Dials are sometimes drawn on Playns lined with Copper or Lead, that they may be free from splitting or tearing; but I prefer a Board (if it be made as above is directed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in many respects: As first, it is much Cheaper: Secondly, Lead (and Copper too a little) will swell with the heat of the Sun, and grow in time so hollow, and as it were swelled outwards, that the truth of its shadow will be much injured. Thirdly, the Colours will be apt to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105578:32"/>
peel from the metal, and the Dial will be that way more defaced than on woodden Playns.</p>

your Experience finds to be most becoming your Playn; then set out the Margin of your Dial with boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Lines for the hour, half hour, and quarter divisions of your Dial (as in most Dials you see is done): when you have thus set out the Margin and Boundary Lines of your Dial, then take your Paper draught fairly drawn, and place the Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal Line which you before drew on your Playn; in doing of which observe to place the Center accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the situation of your Playn for Convenience sake requires: thus; If your Dial be a full South Dial, then let the Center be exactly in the middle of your Playn: but if your Dial decline from the South either East or West, then place not the Center of your Draught in the Center of your Playn, but nearer to one side or other of it, according as it declines, having also respect to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105578:37"/>
the quantity of its declination.</p>
               <p>For Example: If your Dial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Eastwards, then let the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Draught be plac't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Center and the Eastern side of your Playn, the quantity thereof must be according as your Dial declines; if it decline but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, then place the Center of your Draught but a little from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Playn; and if it declines much, place the Center of your Draught the more out of the Center of your Playn: The reason of my advising this, is, that by so doing you may gain a greater distance for those hour-Lines, which in declining Playns fall nearer together on one side then they are on the other; for which reason I alwaies use it in all declining Playns, except they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline far, as between 80 and 90 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; for then we commonly draw
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105578:38"/>
them without Centers, to gain the more distance for the hour Lines.</p>
               <p>When your Paper Draught is thus Artificially placed on the Playn, and fastened with pins or small tacks; then let the draught thereof be transferred to the Playn, by laying a Ruler over every hour, half hour, and quarter division: and where your Ruler shall cut or intersect the boundary lines of your Margin, there make marks by drawing Lines with a Black-Lead Pencil, of such a length as each division requires (or is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by your boundary lines) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving alwaies to draw the hour, and half hour lines quite through your Margin, that they may be guides for the right placing the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and for a small spot that is usually placed in the Margin, right against the half hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:105578:38"/>When your Dial Draught is thus transferred to the Playn it self, you must not forget to draw the substill Line according as it lyeth in your Draught, to be your guide for the right placing your Still or Cock; for you must in every particular be very exact, or else your Dial cannot be good.</p>
               <p>When you have taken every thing that is required from your draught, and have transferred it to the Playn, then take your draught off, and with <hi>Vermillion</hi> very well ground and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, as before is taught, let the boundary Lines of your Dial, as also the hour, half hour, and quarter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions be drawn therewith; let your Colour be as thick and stiff as you can possible work it, so as to draw a clear and smooth line.</p>
               <p>When your <hi>Vermillion</hi> Lines are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105578:39"/>
drawn, then with <hi>Lamp-Black</hi> let the Figures be drawn, a spot in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Margin right against the half hour line; and if you please in the Margin at the top of your Playn you may put the date of the Year, your Name, or some divine sentence, as is usual in things of this nature: then fit in your Cock so as to make right Angles with the Playn, so shall your Dial be drawn and finished in all respects as a plain Dial ought to be.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. How to guild the Figures of Sun-Dials with Gold.</head>
               <p>IF you intend to bestow more Cost on a Dial then what is expressed in the last Chapter, by guilding the Figures or other Ornaments, you must proceed thus; Whatsoever you would guild must first be drawn with Gold size (of the making of which, see <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.) according to the true proportion of what you would have guilt, whether figure, letter, or what ever else it be; when you have thus drawn the true proportion of what you would have guilt, let it remain till it be sufficiently dry to guild upon, which you shall know by touching it with the end of your
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105578:40"/>
finger; for if your finger stick a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to it, and yet the Colour come not off, then is it dry enough: but if the Colour come off on your finger, then is it not dry enough, and must be let alone longer; for if you should then lay your Gold on, it would so drown it, that it would be worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but if your size should be so dry as not to hold your finger as it were to it, then is it too dry, and the Gold will not take; for which there is no remedy but new sizing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must watch the true time that it be not too wet or too dry; both extreams being not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
               <p>When your size is ready for guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, take your Book of Leaf Gold, and opening a leaf of it, take it out with your Cane-plyers, and lay it on your guilding Cushion, and if it lye not smooth, blow on it with your breath
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105578:40"/>
which will lay it flat and plain, then with a Knife of Cane, or for want of it, an ordinary pocket Knife that hath a smooth and sharp edge; with this (being wiped very dry on your sleeve that the Gold stick not to it) let your leaf-gold be cut into such pieces or forms as your Judgment shall think most suitable to your work.</p>
               <p>When you have thus cut your Gold into convenient forms, then take your tool that was before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in <hi>num.</hi> 10. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. and draw the Cloath side of it across your tongue, or breath upon it to make it dampish that the gold may stick to it; with this tool take your Gold up (by clapping it down on the several pieces you had before cut into forms) and transfer it to your size, upon which clap it down according to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, &amp; your gold will leave your tool, and cleave to your size; which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105578:41"/>
you must afterwards press down smooth with a bunch of Cotton, or a Hares foot: and thus you must do piece by piece till you have covered all your size with gold; and after it is fully dryed, then with your Hares foot brush off all the loose Gold, so will your guilding remain fair and beautiful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That after your guilding is thus perfectly laid on, you may if you please diaper or flourish on it with thin <hi>Umber</hi> whatsoever shall be suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your design; the form and order of which take from Examples which are abundant, where Painting and Gilding are to be seen.</p>

               <p>IF you make the Margin of your Dial Blew with strowing <hi>Smalt,</hi> it must be done after the Figures are guilt; thus:</p>
               <p>Take <hi>White Lead</hi> stiffly tempered (if with fat Oyl it will be much the better) and therewith colour over your whole Margin, repairing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Figures as you come to them; when you have thus done your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin all over with thick colour, take your <hi>Smalt,</hi> and with a Goose-quill-feather cover all your Margin with it, and with a piece of Cotton dab it down close that it may well take upon the ground laid under it; and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105578:42"/>
when you imagine the ground to be throughly dry, then wipe off the loose colour with a feather, and blow the remainder of it off with a pair of Bellows, so is your work finished. And thus you have a Method for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring any thing else with this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour besides the Margins of Sun-Dials.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. The Practice of Vulgar Painting.</head>
               <p>THat which I call <hi>Vulgar Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is only the way and manner of Colouring Wainscot, Doors, Windows, Posts, Rayls, Pales, Gates, and the like; the method of doing which differs not at all from that of Painting Sun-Dials, that is, in the preparation, mixing and laying on of Colours; and one Example I know will be sufficient to direct you in any business of this kind: Suppose you have a pair of Gates or the like to paint, you must proceed thus; first
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105578:43"/>
prime it with <hi>Spanish Brown</hi> (as you did your Dial-Board) twice or three times, when this is dry take <hi>White Lead</hi> well tempered (as before was taught) or <hi>Umber</hi> and White, or Blew Balls, or <hi>Indico</hi> and White, or any other Colour you intend your work shall be laid in, and with that Colour (whatsoever it be) let your Gate be coloured four or five times over suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively after each drying (for the oftner you Colour any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doors, the longer will it last; Wainscotting indeed you need not do over above twice with the last Colour, because it's within doors) listing, quartering or panelling it as your fancy shall please; or else letting it go plain, and all of one Colour as you shall best like; so shall your work be finished; and thus may you do for any other: and if you are minded to gild or the like, repair to the 7. and 14. Chapters, where you are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105578:43"/>
taught in that also: So that you may see that in this Method of Painting Sun-Dials, I have also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the whole Art of Vulgar Painting, because they are indeed but one and the same thing.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. How to scour, refresh and preserve all manner of Oyl Paintings.</head>
               <p>THe Oyl Paintings that I here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, are only such as are kept from the injuries of weather; for such paintings as endure the fury of rain and storms (such as Sun-Dials, Posts, Pales, &amp;c.) are not any waies to be renewed or refreshed, but by being new coloured with the same Colour in which it was at first wrought, because that the body and strength of the Colour is worn out by the continual assaults of wasting time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:105578:44"/>But as for such Paintings that are sheltered from weather, as all in-door Paintings are, they still keep their Body and Colour, although their beauty may be much impaired by dust, smoak, fly-shits, humid vapors, and the like, which will in time soyl and tawnish them; To remedy which, take these few Rules:</p>
               <p>If your Painting be Wainscotting or any other Joynary or Carpentary work that is painted in Oyl, take Wood ashes well sifted, which mix with water somewhat thickly, then take a stubbed bristle brush (like those we call shooe-brushes) and dip it in the moystened ashes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with rub and scour your painting all over in all places alike, and when you find that all the soyl is taken off, then wash it clean with fair water, and let it dry; after which take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105578:45"/>
Varnish and therewith varnish your work all over alike, and you will find your painting to be near as fresh as when first laid on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That if your Varnish be too thick, you must put Oyl of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to it, which will make it as thin as you please.</p>
               <p>But if your Painting be more Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, whether Figures of Men, Beasts, Landskip, Frutage, Florage, or the like, then take <hi>Smalt,</hi> (a sandy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to be bought at the Colour-Shops) with which and a spunge wet in water, let your Picture be gently scowred, and then cleanly washed off with fair water: after it is well dry, let it be run over with Varnish, and you will find the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and lustre of your Picture much recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:105578:45"/>But <hi>Note,</hi> That this scowring ought not to be practised but very seldom (as when your Picture is very much soyled) because often and too frequent operations in this kind must needs wear off a little of the Colours; therefore strive what you can to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their first beauty, by keeping them free from smoak, and by often striking off the dust with a Fox tail; as likewise preserving them from Flies, by dressing up your Rooms with green boughes, to which the Flyes will gather themselves, and so not hurt your Pictures. Sir <hi>Hugh Platt</hi> in the First Part of his <hi>Garden of Eden,</hi> and 17 page, tells us of an <hi>Italian</hi> Fancy for this purpose, by hanging in the roof and sides of the Room small Pompions or Cow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers stuck full of Barley, which will sprout into green spiers on which the Flyes will lodge. <hi>Querie,</hi> Whether
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105578:46"/>
Vessels of Tin made round about full of holes filled with Earth, and every hole planted with a sprig of Orpen, Penyroyal, Mints, &amp;c. and watered as need requires, would not be more beautiful and useful for this purpose.</p>
               <p>Another Note worth Observation is, That all Pictures (especially those that are wrought with mixtures of <hi>White Lead</hi>) are apt to tawnish and grow rusty, as is seen in all ancient Pieces; To prevent which, in the Moneths of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> let your Pictures be exposed to the hot Sun three or four dayes; this will draw off much of the tawnish, and make the Colours more fresh and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: and thus doing from year to year will preserve them wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>Although in the beginning of this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105578:46"/>
Chapter I mentioned Dials among those things that are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed but by new painting; yet here take notice, That I think it not convenient at all to lay new Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the old ground of a Sun-Dial (that is, to draw the old Lines and Figures over again in the same posture wherein they were drawn before) but rather to take the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation anew, and according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto make a new draught of your Dial, and proceed in the painting of it in all respects as if it were a new Dial: For it is observed, That Dials which were made many years ago (which we believe went true when first made) will not give the true hour now, but go very false and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, which is caused by some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret motion of the Earth not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to taken notice of, which apparently alters the declination of all Playns whatsoever. If any one requires more
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105578:47"/>
satisfaction herein, let him repair to some old Dial that was made many years ago, and according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Substile from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, let him find out the declination when first made, as any man that is an Artist can easily do; then let him take the declination of the Plain by the Sun, and he shall find these two declinations to differ considerably according to the number of years contained between your observation and the time of the Dials first ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; so that a Plain that stood full South 30, 40, or 60 years ago, shall now decline some degrees either to the East or West, according to the nature of the Earths motion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. Some Improvements in Painting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist weather, and preserve Timber or woodden works from rotting.</head>
               <p>TAke the hardest Rosin you can get, clarifie it well; to which Rosin add Linseed Oyl so much as you find by experience to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; let them be well melted and incorporated together on the fire, then take either <hi>Umber, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrease,</hi> or <hi>Red Lead</hi> (these being extraordinary drying Colours) first ground fine, which put into the Oyl and Rosin; and when they are well mixed together, you may use
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105578:48"/>
them in Colouring Timber as you do with other Colours: it's best al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be used hot, least it be too stiff.</p>
               <p>This is a most excellent thing to preserve Timber, it lyeth like the <hi>China</hi> Varnish, and will endure 10 times as long as other Painting (if rightly wrought); this is a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way to preserve the Border Boards in Gardens, and any other thing that we would have last long in wet and moysture; this Colour spread on Cloath with a Trowel, is a most excellent Covering for Tents, Huts, Turrets, Houses of Pleasure, and the like.</p>
               <p>And let me add one Experiment more that will much commend the use of this mixture; which is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:105578:48"/>Let those woodden Vessels (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hogsheads, Barrels, Kilderkins, or any other Vessel whether upright or decumbent) that you design to keep any drinkable Liquors in, be well and intirely painted on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side therewith; which Vessel so painted shall keep and preserve all manner of Liquors equally to the best Bottles whatsoever, by reason that the sponginess and porusness of the wood is intirely closed and shut up by this tough rosinious varnish, thereby keeping the spirits of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor from flying away, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently preserving the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thereof in its strength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
               <p>The best way to make the Varnish (or Colour) for this purpose, is to put no more Oyl to the Rosin than what shall just serve to toughen it; nor to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105578:49"/>
mix any Colour with it, but burnt <hi>Umber,</hi> because <hi>Verdigrease</hi> and <hi>Red Lead</hi> may be objected against by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their corroding quality: The best way to lay this Colour on, is to heat it hot before you work it, which will make it close the firmer to the wood.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:105578:50"/>
Pencils, the better way were to dip them in clean Sallet Oyl, and draw them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your fingers divers times till they are clean; and when you come to use them again, dip them in a little Linseed Oyl, and squeeze it out again, and then use them.</p>
