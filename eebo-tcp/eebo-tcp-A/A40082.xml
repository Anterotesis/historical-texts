            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Relation I formerly
had to Your Lordship, and
to the Excellent Countess Your
Mother, who, like King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's</hi>
wise Woman, <hi>hath Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Her House,</hi> and by Her
extraordinary Prudence, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the Divine Blessing,
hath raised the now Third Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in this Kingdom to its Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Greatness and Splendour;
this Double Relation, I say, hath
<pb facs="tcp:100709:3"/>
Emboldened me to make a Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this Discourse to Your
Lordship: But there are also se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>other</hi> Considerations that
induce me thereunto: As par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</p>
            <p>I know Your Lordship to be a
Sober and Virtuous Person; and
that, as the Grace of God did
Guard your Youth, and make the
Pious and Solicitous Care of so
Good a Mother happily successful
to preserve you from all inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Debaucheries of the
Age; which have proved so Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to not a few Great Men and
Great Families; so since your
coming to years of Consideration
and Iudgment, You have not
<pb facs="tcp:100709:3"/>
onely upon deliberate Choice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
deelined them, but from the
Love of Virtue heartily detested
them.</p>
            <p>I know your Lordship to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
well Principled, both
as a Subject of his Majesty, and
a Son of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
and to be a perfect Enemy to the
two great Adversaries of <hi>both,</hi>
viz. <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Fanaticism.</hi>
And that, as a Noble Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of this Church was your
Grandfather, so your Lordship
hath always been an Affectionate
Friend and Patron of her Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;
and have had a very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Value for those of them
whose Piety, Prudence and
<pb facs="tcp:100709:4"/>
Learning intitle them to Esteem.</p>
            <p>But I will not enlarge so far
as <hi>truly</hi> I might upon this subject,
I shall onely add, that I know
your Lordship to be a Lover of
Books and Learning (wherein
you attained to very good Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
by your noted Studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Industry in the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity)
but chiefly to Admire that
sort of Learning which incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
Excelleth all other, <hi>viz.</hi>
That which our Great Master
Christ <hi>Jesus</hi> hath so highly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
and Perfected: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of which is <hi>to make us wise
to Salvation,</hi> and Happy both in
<hi>this</hi> World and to All Eternity.</p>
            <p>And this (if your Lordship
<pb facs="tcp:100709:4"/>
shall vouchsafe to peruse it) you
will find is for a great part the
<hi>immediate</hi> Business of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Treatise: As it is of the
remainder, to Vndermine and
Subvert those Principles, both
Popish and others, which are of
so Pernicious Consequence, and
infinitely Mischievous to that
Design.</p>
            <p>I am so well Acquainted with
your Lordships Candour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
as to presume that it will
easily overlook the many Defects
of this Discourse, for the sake of
that Honest Meaning which your
Charity will believe prompted
me to the Writing and Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100709:5"/>God Almighty continue to

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the right Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Nature of the
Christian Religion will
enable us to discover all
Destructive and Dangerous Errors,
so those cannot be Ignorant of its
true Nature who are acquainted
with its Design and Business; and
consequently to be well informed
<hi>herein</hi> is the most sure and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Method that can be made choice
of to preserve our selves from the
Contagion of Heresie, and all such
Opinions and Practices as are apt to
make us Bad Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100709:6"/>By this means men may save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the tedious labour of busying
their Heads in particular Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
and in strictly examining all the
Arguments whereby the many
Sects among us do endeavour to
make their proper Sentiments to
pass for great Gospel Truths: It is
sufficient to measure them <hi>all</hi> by
this <hi>one</hi> Standard, and compare
them with <hi>this</hi> Rule; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done, we may be fully satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all such as are opposite to
the intendment of our Saviour's
Coming are to be Rejected, all such
as tend to promote it are to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and as for such as do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Oppose nor Promote it (if any
such are) it is not worth our while in
the least to concern our selves about
them.</p>
            <p>The Consideration hereof did
heretofore induce me to write that
<pb facs="tcp:100709:6"/>
Treatise, Intituled, <hi>The Design of
Christianity:</hi> And whereas divers
Worthy Persons about that time
had written to excellently good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
against certain Popular Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Religion, and abundantly
exposed both the Falsity and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerousness
of them, I employed
<hi>my</hi> small Talent in Endeavouring in
that Discourse to Undermine them
all together in the lump, and to pluck
them up by the Roots: And, I
praise God for it, I have seen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to hope that I did not wholly
lose my Labour.</p>
            <p>Now the Reader will soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that <hi>this</hi> plain Discourse of
<hi>CHRISTIAN LIBERTY</hi> (as
is expressed in the Title-Page) is a
farther Pursuance and Improvement
of the Argument of that <hi>Treatise:</hi>
And that the self-same thing for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is Endeavoured in both.
<pb facs="tcp:100709:7"/>
And I was the more inclined to treat
of <hi>this</hi> Subject, because, as clear and
obvious as our Notion thereof is, I do
not know that it hath hitherto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to be fully expressed in any
other Book, and much less <hi>Made out</hi>
and <hi>Improved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Considering the near Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two Discourses, I may
save my <hi>Self</hi> and <hi>Reader</hi> the trouble
of a long Preface, and shall do little
more than acquaint him in a few
words with these three things.</p>
            <p>First, The Body of the Discourse
is as Practical as can be, and treats of
as Weighty and Important Points as
are to be found in the Gospel: Nor
is there any <hi>one</hi> Notion started
throughout the <hi>Whole,</hi> but what is
both very Easie, and Improveable
to the best and most Profitable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100709:7"/>Secondly, The Opinions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
which are exposed as False and
Dangerous are none but such as are
most Evidently Contradictory to
<hi>Christian Liberty</hi> as 'tis <hi>here</hi> Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or to that <hi>Natural</hi> Liberty which
is the not to be invaded Property of
Mankind; although <hi>some</hi> of them,
we have shewed, are insisted upon
by not a few, as so many <hi>Parts</hi> or
<hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Christian Liberty:</hi> And all
those that we have concerned our
selves with may be reduced to three
Heads, <hi>Antinomian, Fanatical</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish:</hi>
Upon which last we have
much more Enlarged than on the
other two; and not (especially at this
time) without great reason.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We have fully made it
appear, that as no man can entertain
a kind thought of <hi>Popery,</hi> so neither
can he easily satisfie himself to separate
from the Communion of the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> while he hath the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100709:8"/>The present Separation of so great
a number of our Protestant Brethren
(I meddle not here with the mere
Non-conformity of Ministers) is
chiefly occasioned, the more is the
shame, by things that are very <hi>little</hi>
in their own nature; By matters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by them <hi>generally</hi> to be
Indifferent in <hi>themselves,</hi> and which
they can never shew are forbidden by
any express Law of God, nor can
make them look in the least like Sinful
things, otherwise than by using a
deal of Artifice and Force in Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
and Applying of certain
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And the great Obstacle to our
Peace and Unity, I mean next to
Pride, Self-conceit and the want of
the true Christian Spirit, is a gross
Mistake concerning the nature of
<hi>Christian Liberty:</hi> It being concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that as Little things as are the
Cause of the Breach, there is a Great
<pb facs="tcp:100709:8"/>
thing parted with by Complying
with them; no <hi>less</hi> a thing than that
which their Saviour judged to be
worth the Expence of his Precious
Bloud to purchase it for them, which
is <hi>this</hi> Liberty. And could the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the Separation be once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
out of their darling Notion
thereof (as if they <hi>will</hi> they easily may)
and be satisfied that it is no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by obeying their Governours;
while nothing worse is imposed by
them than what is Indifferent, the
Well-meaning People amongst them
would soon think it of far worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to break the Peace of the
Church about <hi>such</hi> things, than to
Conform to them: Especially since
these Divisions are no less <hi>dangerous</hi> to
both the Church and State than <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi>
and <hi>Scandalous.</hi> For who
doth not see what Advantage our
Common Enemy doth make of them,
and what farther Advantage, not to
<pb facs="tcp:100709:9"/>
be thought of without horrour, he
may be too like to make?</p>
            <p>I have one humble Request to
make to the Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> that he will
be, I don't say so <hi>kind,</hi> but so <hi>just</hi> to
me as not hastily to Censure me, if he
happens now and then to light upon
a passage which at first sight
may seem somewhat odd to him, but
have the Patience to suspend his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
till he hath read farther;
when he may possibly perceive that
he misunderstood me in those
Passages: For it is impossible (I at
least find it so) to deliver the intire
sense of ones Mind all at once, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
any thing that requireth some
considerable exercise of thoughts. I
desire especially that <hi>this</hi> Right may
be done me in the Fifteenth Chapter,
which treats of that most ticklish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<hi>Liberty of Conscience;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I have endeavoured to give my
<pb facs="tcp:100709:9"/>
most Sedate thoughts with all since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and impartiality.</p>
            <p>I will Conclude with this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement,
that whereas I have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon several things which I have
since found in the Learned Dean of
S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s his most Excellent Discourse,
Intituled the <hi>Mischief of Separation,</hi> I
had perfectly completed all that Part
where I have done so, and sent much
of it to the Press too before I read that
Discourse; nor did it occasion the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of any <hi>one</hi> thing. And it would
have been, I am sensible, a weak
thing of me had I industriously repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
things published to the World so
immediately before by that Great
Man, with so much greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

that several Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Consequence. The First
of which is, That
which makes it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,

Obligation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law. Certain
Texts, urged by the

<hi>viz.</hi> That which makes
it to consist in Freedom

those Laws of Men,
which enjoyn or forbid
indifferent things. This
Notion differently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of it. First,
Some extend it so far
as to make it to reach
to <hi>all</hi> Humane Laws,
the matter of which
are things indifferent.
Secondly, Others limit
it to those which relate
to Religion and the
Worship of God. The

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
OF
Christian Liberty.</head>
            <div type="introduction">
               <head>The Introduction.</head>
               <p>THERE is nothing toward
which Mankind is more natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or vehemently affected than
Freedom and <hi>Liberty;</hi> there is
so great a value and price set upon it,
that Life it self is not thought too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be hazarded or laid down for it:
And many have rather chosen to <hi>die</hi> by
their Enemies hands than to be <hi>inslaved</hi>
by them.</p>
               <p>It was the saying of <hi>Cato, Malui mori
quàm uni parere, I had rather die than that
one man</hi> (meaning <hi>Iulius Caesar) should
Lord it over me:</hi> And he was as good as
his word, he laid violent hands upon
<pb facs="tcp:100709:17"/>
himself rather than that Usurper should
be his Master.</p>
               <p>The Jewish Nation, being besieged in
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> thought it more Eligible to
suffer the most direful Calamities, such
as are not to be parallel'd in any other
History, than yield themselves Captives
to <hi>Titus,</hi> and put their Necks under the
<hi>Roman</hi> Yoke.</p>
               <p>Both single persons and Communities
esteem all their other Enjoyments but
little worth, whilest <hi>Liberty</hi> is wanting,
nor hath any one thing occasioned so
much Bloudshed in the world, as the
Defence or Recovery of <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, that 'twas
greatly deliberated among the <hi>Gallican</hi>
Cities, whether <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Peace</hi> was to be
preferred, yet ordinarily, without the
least consultation, when these two stand
in competition, the <hi>former</hi> is chosen,
and <hi>Peace</hi> is forced to give way to and
sold for <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no Suffering so impatiently
born as the loss, or but Infringment of
<hi>Liberty,</hi> nor are any looked upon as such
Enemies to Mankind, or have so hateful
a character, as the <hi>Invaders</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>But yet as inamoured with <hi>Liberty</hi> as
we all are, the generality are lamentably
<pb facs="tcp:100709:17"/>
ignorant of its true nature, and wherein
it mainly and principally consisteth.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Spartan</hi> being asked, <hi>Quid sciret?</hi>
replied, <hi>Scio quid est liberum esse: I know
what Liberty and Freedom meaneth:</hi> But I
fear there are very few Comparatively
that can truly return this answer; nay,
that most are so strangely mistaken in
this matter, as to account the worst of
<hi>Slaveries</hi> the most desirable <hi>Liberty,</hi> and
the chiefest of <hi>Liberties</hi> the most intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Slavery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we will believe our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
who, being the <hi>Wisdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
can best inform us, we shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that there is no <hi>Liberty</hi> like that
which is of <hi>his</hi> bestowing: He hath said,
<hi>Iohn 8. 36. If the Son shall make you free,
ye shall be free indeed, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
ye shall be really free, and not only in shew,
in outward appearance and opinion; you
shall be in the truest and most excellent sence
free.</hi> Which words do plainly tell us,
that all other <hi>Liberties</hi> are unworthy
of that name, in comparison of that
which is conferred by <hi>himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what I now said of Liberty in
the <hi>general,</hi> may as truly be affirmed of
<hi>Christian Liberty, viz.</hi> First, That there
is nothing hath raised more dust, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
<pb facs="tcp:100709:18"/>
more sad feuds in the Christian
World than <hi>this</hi> hath done: The great
<hi>Ball</hi> of Contention hath been <hi>Christian
Liberty,</hi> among the professed Disciples
of Christ. Such an opinion is conceived
of it, that 'tis never thought too dearly
bought. This is the <hi>Good Old Cause,</hi> for
which multitudes have been very liberal
of both their Fortunes and Lives; and no
one thing hath been esteemed <hi>better,</hi> if so
<hi>well,</hi> deserving the price of bloud.</p>
               <p>The pretence of <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> is of
all other the most Plausible and Popular,
and nothing hath been more unhappily
successful in raising Tumults and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the People to take the Field. Nay,
this hath been held so <hi>Sacred</hi> a thing (if
it be lawful to judge of mens opinions by
their practices) as to be able to hallow
the unholiest actions, and to sanctifie the
most apparently wicked, when designed
for the preserving or regaining thereof.
And therefore.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Too many that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Christians (as I should not need
to add) must needs very grosly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
the nature of that they are so
fond of. And, as great zeal as they
shew for <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> do as little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that which <hi>really</hi> is so, and is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb facs="tcp:100709:18"/>
instance of it. Upon which account
I presume 'twill be thought no needless
labour to endeavour to rectifie mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
about the nature of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>And in order hereunto I design, with
Gods assistance, to shew in the following
Discourse,</p>
               <p>First, That the most excellent and
most highly to be valued Liberty doth
consist in an intire compliance with the
Laws of Righteousness and Goodness;
or in freedom from the dominion of
corrupt and sinful Affections.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That herein that Liberty
<hi>principally,</hi> or rather <hi>wholly</hi> consisteth,
which our Blessed Saviour hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for us, and in his Gospel proclaimed
to us.</p>
               <p>Which two Propositions being de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monstrated,
we shall</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Draw distinctly from each
several useful inferences, where <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi>
the <hi>false</hi> notions which too many
have conceived of <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> shall
be effectually confuted.</p>

               <head type="sub">This shewed in the General from Texts of
Scripture, and further confirmed by those
who were strangers to Divine Revelation.</head>
               <p>NOW in the <hi>General</hi> that this is
so, those forecited words of our
Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 36. do give us
assurance: For the Freedom which
Christ there commends as <hi>the</hi> true Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100709:20"/>
by way of Eminence is <hi>this</hi> from the
dominion of sin and corrupt affections.
This will appear by considering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text:
Our Saviour having said, <hi>verse</hi> 31,
32. to those <hi>Iews</hi> that believed on him,
<hi>If you continue inmy words, then are ye my
disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth,
and the truth shall make you free;</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<hi>ver. 33. They answered him, we be</hi>
Abrahams <hi>seed, and were never in bondage
to any man, how sayest thou, ye shall be made
free. They answered,</hi> not the Believers,
but some of the Company that came with
no good design, We be <hi>Abrahams seed,</hi>
we are not descended from the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
or other servile people, but from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and from <hi>him,</hi> not by <hi>Hagar</hi> the
Bond-woman, but by <hi>Sarah</hi> the Free-woman,
We are of a Generous and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
extract; <hi>And were never in bondage
to any man,</hi> as we were not <hi>born</hi> slaves,
so neither have at any time been <hi>made</hi>
slaves. But how could they say this,
whenas they were formerly in bondage,
both to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi>
with divers others, and even <hi>now</hi> subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the power of the <hi>Romans?</hi> The
truth is, if they spake this concerning
their <hi>Nation,</hi> the saying was an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and loud Falshood, as it is usual for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100709:20"/>
men when they are vaunting and boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to make bold with truth; but if
they understood it of their own <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi>
and they meant that they were not
in <hi>Personal</hi> servitude, had not lost their
<hi>natural</hi> Liberty as <hi>Men,</hi> though they
were in a <hi>Political</hi> servitude as a <hi>Nation,</hi>
their saying that <hi>they were Abrahams seed</hi>
came in impertinently.</p>
               <p>It follows <hi>ver. 34. Iesus answered them,
Verily verily I say unto you, whosoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
sin is the Servant of sin.</hi> He that is
a <hi>worker of iniquity,</hi> is inslaved and
brought into a servile state thereby: <hi>Ver.</hi>
35. <hi>And the servant abideth not in the house
for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.</hi> Or
those who are in this servile state, under
sin, though they may for a time be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Gods houshold, they shall at
length be for ever Cast out, but the <hi>Son</hi>
hath a right to continue there, and to
the enjoyment of his Fathers Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Then next follow those words,
<hi>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye
shall be free indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Freedom which our Lord
speaks of, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. being deliverance from
the power of Sin, as appears by his explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. It is manifest that
he meaneth the same thing in <hi>these</hi> words,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100709:21"/>
and consequently does in them give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to what we are now designing to
prove, that to be rescued from under the
dominion of our Lusts is Freedom and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<hi>indeed, the</hi> true and most excellent
Liberty.</p>
               <p>And of this the holy <hi>David</hi> was very
sensible, when he uttered those words,
<hi>Psal. 119. 45. I will walk at liberty, for I
seek thy precepts.</hi> Whereby he signified,
that the ways of Gods Commandments,
though they seem to the fleshly and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
strait and narrow, and though such
look upon those that walk in them as too
much confined and abridged of Liberty;
yet the spirit of a Regenerate and Good
man finds no where such Freedom and
Enlargement as in those ways. And
therefore when he lapsed into those two
hainous and provoking sins, he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
exceedingly straitned, and his Spirit
was miserably pent up and contracted:
As appears by that prayer in his <hi>Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Psalm,</hi> Psal. 51. 12. <hi>Restore to me the
joy of thy salvation, and uphold</hi> (or esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish)
<hi>me with thy free Spirit.</hi> Or rather,
with <hi>a</hi> free Spirit. In 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. the
Apostle, speaking of a sort of wicked
people, who were industrious to make
others as vile as themselves, saith, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100709:21"/>
                  <hi>While they promise them liberty, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are the servants of corruption, for of
whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
brought in bondage.</hi> They inticed others
to all manner of carnality and filthiness,
and tempted those that <hi>were clean escaped
from the pollutions of the world</hi> to relapse
into them, and this they did by the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pretence of giving them Liberty;
but alas (saith the Apostle) they <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
are the most wretched and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of Slaves, having yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up to their vile affections, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the power and command of
Tyrannical Lusts.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Heathens</hi> have divers of them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
this excellently, and were great
Masters of this Notion: That he who is
gotten from under the dominion of his
Sensitive part, and lives agreeably to
the Dictates of Right Reason, and the
Will of God, is the only Free Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arrian</hi> in his <hi>third</hi> Book upon <hi>Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
spends some time in shewing, that
the <hi>true</hi> Liberty consisteth in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of our Appetites to the <hi>Divine Will.</hi>
And in his <hi>first</hi> Book, that there is no
true bondage but that which ariseth from
the Prevalence of Evil Affections; and
that a Good man can never be in real
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100709:22"/>
Slavery, though he be in his Enemies
hands, that then his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, his <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass</hi>
only is taken Captive, but he <hi>himself</hi>
is as Free still as ever. And he gives <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
for an instance, who having been
set free from his corrupt Appetites by his
Master <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> would deny that it
was possible for any one to make a Slave
of him, and, being taken by Pirates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
himself in their hands like one that
was more their Lord than their Vassal.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the most excellent Freedom and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

and particularly demonstrated by
three Arguments. Of which the First is
that this is Freedom from the worst and
vilest of Slaveries. Where it is shewed in
three particulars, that the Transgressors
of those Laws are the most Slavish Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</head>
               <p>IT may moreover be more <hi>distinctly</hi>
and <hi>particularly</hi> proved, that the most
excellent Freedom and Liberty consisteth
in the Observance of the Laws of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100709:23"/>
and Goodness by these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This is Freedom from the worst and
vilest of Slaveries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is the Liberty of the
Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is the Divine Liberty,
the Liberty of God himself.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>This is Freedom from the worst and
vilest of Slaveries.</hi> And that there is no
such Slavish Creature as he who lives in
the transgression of these Laws (as the
wicked man) doth plainly appear, in that,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>His whole man, both Soul and
Body is inslaved.</hi> Those who are Slaves
in the vulgar sence, that are taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
by the <hi>Turk,</hi> or such like merciless
and inhumane Masters, are <hi>necessarily</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved
only as to their Viler part, their
<hi>Bodies:</hi> It lieth not in the power of any
man on Earth to inslave a <hi>Soul.</hi> The
<hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of him, who, as to his
<hi>Outward</hi> man, is the most absolute Vassal
to the Lusts of others, may retain <hi>their</hi>
Liberty still in spight of them. No Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
can make me either <hi>think,</hi> or <hi>chuse,</hi>
or <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>desire</hi> what he pleaseth.
Where all the members of the <hi>Body</hi> are
under constraint, the <hi>Soul</hi> may continue
free in all its powers, no external Force
is able to inthral that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100709:23"/>But he who lives in disobedience to the
Laws of Righteousness is <hi>perfectly</hi> insla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
his <hi>whole</hi> man hath lost its Liberty.
As his <hi>Body</hi> is at the command and dispose
of his Lusts, as each of its members are
Ministers of Unrighteousness, and made
to fulfil the will of the flesh, so his <hi>Soul</hi>
is subjected to their power and dominion,
and his Slavery <hi>begins</hi> there. His Mind,
Will and Affections are <hi>first</hi> subdued and
brought into bondage by fleshly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
Lusts, and then his Body is ingaged
in the filthy drudgery of making provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for them, of gratifying them and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
satisfaction to them. That is the
meaning of those words of S. <hi>Iames,
Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth
forth sin,</hi> Chap. 1. 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The wicked man is thus subject
to the Vilest and Basest of Masters.</hi> Such
a one (to repeat those words of <hi>Tully</hi>)
doth <hi>parere dedecori &amp; turpitudini, is at
the command of vile shame and filthiness it
self.</hi> What is Sordid Covetousness,
Swinish Lust, Beastly Intemperance,
Devilish Rage and Malice, what I say
are all <hi>these</hi> less than so? To which I
may add those other hateful Qualities of
Fraud, Dissimulation, Envy, Pride,
Selfishness, and the like. But some or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100709:24"/>
other, nay most of these are all wicked

the Slave
of a Wench, and a vile sorry Wench too;</hi>
well may I say, what a wretched Slave
art <hi>thou</hi> then, who art under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of so <hi>many</hi> base, vile, opprobrious,
shameful and hateful things?</p>
               <p>To be subject to any <hi>one</hi> of these is vile
Servitude; what is it then to be at the
command of so <hi>many</hi> such Masters, to
serve <hi>divers</hi> Lusts (as the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 3.) and all most vile,
base and brutish.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The wicked man is also inslaved
by the most Tyrannical and Cruel Masters.
Indeed</hi> 'tis rare that the Base prove other
than Cruel whensoever they happen to
get into power. Having understood
who are this mans Masters, we must
needs be satisfied, that they are not more
<hi>vile</hi> than they are <hi>Tyrannical.</hi> And their
Tyranny is shewed in requiring the most
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100709:24"/>
                  <hi>Vnreasonable</hi> services, and the most <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie.</hi>
Their <hi>Commands</hi> must necessarily
be most unreasonable in that <hi>they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
are so. The forementioned vile
Affections, and the like, are therefore
<hi>Vile,</hi> because perfect contradictions to
the Reason of mens Minds, and degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Humane and Intellectual
Nature: Because they Brutifie mens
Souls, yea, and make them <hi>more</hi> Vile
than the Beasts which perish.</p>
               <p>In short, he who obeys these Masters
preferreth the <hi>Creature before the Creator,
God blessed for ever: He forsakes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of living waters, and heweth out to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
broken Cisterns which can hold no water:</hi>
His Body is far more dear to him than
his Soul, and he esteems slight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany
satisfactions and pleasures,
above the most Substantial and Eternal.
He fears the displeasure of a poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and some very tolerable and small
evil, more than the wrath of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
God, and than Hell it self. He
is ever doing that which the sence of his
own Mind upbraids him with, and what
he knows before hand he shall wish <hi>undone</hi>
as soon as <hi>done.</hi> In a word, he is always
contradicting the Great Design of his
Creation and coming into Being. Such
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100709:25"/>
things as <hi>these</hi> (as I need not stand to
shew) do the Lusts of wicked men put
them upon doing, such services as <hi>these</hi>
are they perpetually imploying them
in.</p>
               <p>And what we said of the <hi>Vnreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of their commands speaks them also
<hi>Vneasie, Grievous</hi> and <hi>Troublesome.</hi> It is
impossible for a Creature to act contrary
to its Nature and Essential principles,
but it must needs feel much Pain in so
doing; the more Unnatural any thing is,
the more Disquieting and Tormenting
must it necessarily be. The very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of evil Affections in the Soul must
needs make it as uneasie, as evil Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
do the Body; what then will the
gratifying, the Nourishing and Cherishing
them do? I appeal to the Covetous and
Ambitious, to the immoderate Lovers
of Riches and Honours, to such Lovers
of Wine, and such Lovers of Women,
to the Revengeful and Malicious, and
the like, whether they do not feel exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
disturbance and perturbation of
Mind, from the several passions that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate
them <hi>such;</hi> and whether the
Pain they cause to their Souls, be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
greater and more lasting,
than the pleasure which their Flesh or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100709:25"/>
Sensitive part receiveth from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Add hereunto the grievous</hi> Disquiet

a Lust.</hi> Tully <hi>hath an excellent observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  </note> When a Lust hath
ceased to exercise its dominion for a while,
or to employ its vassal in new drudgery, he
is not for that time at ease, but another
Lord immediately tyrannizeth over him,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Dread that ariseth from conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Guilt, oh what a miserable slavery
and bondage is this!</p>
               <p>And (by the way) methinks it should
much affect us, to find a <hi>Heathen</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such a sense of the intolerable Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
men are brought into by satisfying
their Lusts.</p>
               <p>I might add further, that mens Lusts
have no <hi>moderation</hi> with them neither,
though (as that Philosopher supposeth)
they may, after their commands are
obeyed, for <hi>a while</hi> cease to command
again, yet it is but for a very <hi>little</hi> while;
before the sinner hath recovered his spent
spirits, they lay <hi>new</hi> burdens on his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
shoulders. What the Apostle saith of
those who <hi>have eyes full of Adultery</hi> that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100709:26"/>
                  <hi>they cannot cease from sin,</hi> is as true of
those who are under the dominion of <hi>any</hi>
lust whatsoever: And what <hi>Horace</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
of the Tyranny of sensual <hi>Love,</hi>
may as well be applied to every other
corrupt Affection, namely,
<q>
                     <l>Vrget enim mentem dominus non lenis, &amp;

                     <l>Subjectat lasso stimulos.</l>

                     <l>This cruel Lord th' unhappy Creature rides,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I might moreover shew, were it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that the service which mens Lusts
exact from them, is such as <hi>ordinarily</hi>
is of fatal consequence to their <hi>Estates</hi>
and <hi>Bodies</hi> as well as <hi>Souls,</hi> but there is
nothing to which universal observation
in all Ages, and Sinners Experience
gives clearer evidence. I might also in
the <hi>last place,</hi> shew, that mens Lusts do
deliver up their Servants to the power of
the <hi>Devil, such</hi> being said to be in <hi>his</hi>
snare, and <hi>to be taken captive by him at his
will, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 26. And no man, I hope,
shall need to be informed, what a Tyrant

               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100709:26"/>But enough hath been said of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Sin to make us cry out with the
Philosopher in the forementioned words,
<hi>Quàm illa misera, quàm dura Servitus!
What miserable and cruel Slavery is that
Service!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Enough, I say, hath been said to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us, that no Slavery is comparable to
<hi>this,</hi> and consequently, that the careful
observance of the Laws of Righteousness
is <hi>the</hi> true, and most Glorious Liberty,
in that, Freedom from such Bondage is
implied therein, as is not to be found in
any <hi>other</hi> sort of Liberty.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the Liberty which resulteth from the

               <p>SEcondly, The Liberty which result<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the Observance of the Laws
of Righteousness and Goodness is the
truest and most excellent of Liberties, in
that it is the Liberty and Freedom of the
<hi>Soul.</hi> As this is apparent by what hath
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100709:27"/>
been already discoursed, so we may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take notice, that by the Observance
of these Laws the Soul comes to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
to have Self-enjoyment, and to
be as it <hi>would</hi> be, in that it is by this
means delivered from those Passions
which <hi>straiten, confine</hi> and <hi>pend</hi> it up,
and put it into a Slavish state. Those
Passions are chiefly, <hi>Fear, Shame,
Trouble and Dejection of Mind,</hi> and an

               </p>
               <p>And the Opposites to these do give the

<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Confidence</hi> that is opposite both
to <hi>Fear</hi> and to <hi>Shame, Delight</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi>
which are opposite to <hi>Trouble and Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mind,</hi> and <hi>Generosity and Nobleness
of Spirit,</hi> whereby a man is carried forth
to the loving of God the Chief Good in
the <hi>first</hi> place, and a hearty concern for
the general welfare of his Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which is opposite to <hi>immoderate
Self-love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, The Observance of the Rules
of Righteousness casteth out <hi>Fear.</hi> This
is a most <hi>servile</hi> Passion; the Apostle
speaketh of some, who <hi>through fear of

                  </gap>, a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi>

I mean <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an <hi>Awful</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential
Fear,</hi> such as is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
28. a <hi>Godly fear:</hi> Nor yet do I mean such
a Fear as awakens and excites the Soul to
the use of means for the shunning and
keeping off evils. Such a Fear as <hi>this</hi>
doth not at all <hi>inslave</hi> or put a man out of
his own power, but is highly serviceable
to the maintenance and preservation of
Liberty. And therefore it is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us by the Apostle, <hi>Heb. 4. 1. Let us
therefore fear lest a promise being left us of
entering into his rest, any of you should seem
to come short of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, as was said, the Fear which is
enslaving is a <hi>Cowardly Dispiriting</hi> Fear,
and this the Righteous and Good man
is freed from. <hi>He hath not received the
spirit of bondage again to fear,</hi> in this
sence, <hi>but the spirit of Adoption whereby
he crieth Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8. 15.</p>
               <p>He is not afraid of God as a poor Slave
is of his fierce Master, or as a wicked
Servant of his justly provoked and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Lord; but not being under the guilt
of <hi>wilful</hi> sins, his Conscience being privy
to no other guilt than that which upon
good grounds he believes is expiated by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100709:28"/>
the Bloud of <hi>Iesus,</hi> he can go to God as
a child to his loving and tender Father.</p>
               <p>And as he hath no tumultuary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
or disheartening fear of <hi>God,</hi> so
neither hath he of the <hi>Devil</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> or
any <hi>worldly evil;</hi> as knowing that all
these are subject to the restraint of that
good Providence which ever chargeth
it self with the care of good Souls and all
their concerns. God hath not given him
the Spirit of fear (or timidity and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness)
<hi>but of power, of love, and of a
sound mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7.</p>
               <p>This man is an affectionate Lover of
<hi>God,</hi> and therefore cannot question God's
love to <hi>him,</hi> and is assured that <hi>all things
shall work together for his good,</hi> for his
good both in <hi>this</hi> life, and in the life <hi>to
come. Herein is our love made perfect,</hi> saith
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 1 Epistle 4. 17. <hi>because as he
is, so are we in this world</hi> (because we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the example of our Blessed Saviour in
the conscientious observance of the Rules
of Righteousness) <hi>there is no fear in love,
but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear
hath torment, he that feareth is not made
perfect in love:</hi> That is, he that is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with such a fear as hath now been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100709:28"/>He who is not under the power of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardizing,
dismaying Fear, his Spirit is
at great Liberty; but a care to keep an
inoffensive Conscience both towards God
and men, to adhere to the Rules of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and Goodness, and never to
swerve from them, will banish this Fear.
<hi>The wicked</hi> (saith the Wise man) <hi>fleeth
when no man pursueth, but the righteous is
bold as a Lion,</hi> Prov. 28. 1. <hi>He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
uprightly, walketh surely:</hi> or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

which great truth the Poet gives his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
in those known Verses;
<q>

                     <l>Non eget Mauri jaculis nec arcu, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </q>

                     <l>He that's in <hi>life</hi> upright and pure in <hi>heart</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, True Goodness begets that
confidence which is opposed, as to Fear
so, to <hi>Shame</hi> too. There is a highly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100709:29"/>
                  <hi>commendable</hi> shame, which is <hi>proper</hi> to a
Good man, namely that which is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Latine <hi>Verecundia:</hi> Which is
a quick sense of whatsoever is indecorous
and misbecoming. No man can have
too much of this, for the more any one
hath of it, the better man must he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be. But there is another sort of
Shame expressed by <hi>Pudor,</hi> which is a
troublesome passion arising from a sense
of disgrace, upon consciousness of Guilt.
Of <hi>this</hi> Shame, the most learned Doctor
<hi>Henry More</hi> observeth in his incomparable
<hi>Ethicks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pudor nec in pessimos nec in opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos cadit. Nam qui sibi consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us est se li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bero suo arbitrio constanter uti ad ca quae optima sunt, novit se non debere contemni, ac proinde, omni contemptu superior, ipsumme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> contemnit contemptum; quae magna pars est Generositatis, in improbis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro summum improbitatis fastigium. <hi>Enclur. Eth. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 2.</note> that <hi>it neither falleth upon the worst
nor the best of men. For he who is conscious to
himself that he constantly exerciseth his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in doing the best things, knows that he ought
not to be contemned, and thereupon, being
above all contempt, contempt it self is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
by him; which is a great instance, in
good men, of Generosity, but in bad men, is
the very height of improbity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> Shame is a good effect of a bad
cause, for though it be an evil, yet 'tis a
<hi>necessary</hi> evil, and tends to the deterring
men from unworthy actions for the time
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100709:29"/>
to come, and doth <hi>actually</hi> produce this
good effect where the great uneasiness
and perturbation of mind which was
caused thereby upon <hi>past</hi> commissions of
sin, is seriously and consideratively reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon. For where this Shame is,
there is great Bondage, where there is
consciousness of guilt, the mind of a man
is miserably pent up, confined and strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
so that he dares many times nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to look abroad into the world, nor to
look up to Heaven, nor reflect upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And therefore <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
are expressed by the <hi>same</hi> word
(<hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) in the <hi>Greek</hi> language.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But while a man is careful in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of the Laws of Righteousness,</hi>
to be Righteous before God, <hi>and to walk</hi>
(<hi>as it is said of</hi> Zacharias <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth)
in all the Commandments and Ordinances of
the Lord blameless, <hi>he is not affected with
this kind of Shame, and consequently
enjoys a mighty Freedom by this means.
Upright</hi> Iob <hi>had the happy experience of
this effect of uprightness; as we find
Chap.</hi> 31. 35, 36, 37. Oh that one would
hear me, (<hi>saith he</hi>) behold my desire is, that
the Almighty would answer me, and that
mine Adversary had written a book. Surely
I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100709:30"/>
as a Crown unto me. I would declare to him
the number of my steps, as a Prince would I
go near unto him. <hi>Which is as much as if
he had said,</hi> Oh that mine Adversary instead
of secretly whispering evil things of me, had
drawn up a charge in writing against me: I
would be so far from endeavouring to have it
concealed, that I would <hi>my self</hi> publish it to
all the world, and instead of thinking it a
disgrace and disparagement, I would esteem
it as an ornament; for my innocence would
be the <hi>more</hi> cleared, and my good name vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
by the means of it. And so far would
I be from sneaking and skulking in corners,
like one ashamed to shew his head, that I
would like a Prince with Heroick courage and
confidence go up to the face of mine Enemy,
and expose and lay open my whole life before
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or rather we will read these Verses as
the sence of them is expressed in a late
excellent Paraphrase upon this Book:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick's.</note>
Oh that the truth of all this [<hi>that I have
been accused of</hi>] might be examined by
some equal judge! Behold I continue still to
desire of God this favour: And let him that
can accuse me, bring in his Libel in writing
against me. Surely I would not endeavour
to obscure it, but openly expose it to be read
by all; nay wear it as a singular ornament,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100709:30"/>
which would turn to mine honour, when the
world saw it disproved. I my self would assist
him to draw up his charge, by declaring to
him freely every action of my life: I would
approach him as undauntedly as a Prince,
who is assured of the goodness of his cause.</p>
               <p>These words, with many other of his
sayings, shew, what a blessed Liberty
the Soul of this Holy man was possessed
with, even whilest he was deprived of all
his outward comforts, and in the saddest
and most dismal circumstances.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nothing will free a man from
<hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Dejection</hi> of mind, like the
careful observance of the Laws of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
<hi>This</hi> as it is a certain conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> it must needs
free a man from, as it freeth from those
its Causes: But it incomparably beyond
any thing in the world cureth this Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a <hi>wounded spirit how or by whatsoever</hi>
it be occasioned. I have shewed that it is
the fate of Sinners to feel great perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and disturbance of mind from their
corrupt Affections, <hi>by the law in their
members warring against the law of their
minds,</hi> and also by <hi>reflecting</hi> upon their
folly and madness, and by the fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
that their manifold bold trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of the Divine Laws do raise in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100709:31"/>
them. <hi>The wicked</hi> (saith the Prophet)
<hi>are like the troubled Sea, which cannot rest,
whose waters cast up mire and dirt: There is
no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. Cain</hi>
had no sooner given place to <hi>Envy</hi> and
<hi>Revenge,</hi> but his Countenance fell, and
the Disquiet of his mind was bewrayed
by his looks.</p>
               <p>But there is no such Lightsomness and
Sprightfulness of Soul, no such Pleasure
and Self-satisfaction as that which results
from true Religion, Righteousness and
Goodness. It's <hi>ways are ways of pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and all its paths peace,</hi> Prov. 3. 17.
<hi>Light is sown for the Righteous, and joy for
the Vpright in heart,</hi> Psal. 97. 11. <hi>Great
peace have they that love thy law, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shall offend them,</hi> Psal. 119. 165. <hi>The
work of Rigteousness shall be peace, and the
effect of Righteousness quietness, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
for ever,</hi> Esay 32. 17. The Good
man is free from self-accusations, and
from that gnawing Worm that is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
felt in Guilty breasts. He is not
appalled in thinking of what is <hi>past,</hi> nor
cast down with the fore-thought of that
which is to <hi>come.</hi> His Soul is like a calm
and clear River, like the waters of <hi>Silo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
which run softly, without noise or
murmur.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100709:31"/>Whatsoever is Natural is for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
highly pleasing, but nothing so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to the Heaven-born Soul of man, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so agreeable to our original
Make, as to live in conformity to the
Laws of Righteousness. Whilest this is
our serious care, we act according to our
Highest principle, that Principle which
God and Nature designed for our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
our Leader and Governour, I
mean the Reason of our Minds.</p>
               <p>And therefore so long as we follow its
Dictates, and behave our selves like
those on whose souls the Divine image is
imprinted, which consisteth in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and true Holiness, <hi>so long I say</hi>
we live in our own Element, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must necessarily have Self-enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And we shall enjoy our selves
<hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> according as we are <hi>more</hi> or
<hi>less</hi> diligent in works of Righteousness
and Goodness. The experience of every
Good man will force him to subscribe to
the truth of <hi>this;</hi> no such man can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his assent from it, or call it into
question any more than he can his own
Feeling. Such a one feels such serenity
of thoughts, and such great delight and
satisfaction of mind in the exercise of love
to God and love to men, in works of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100709:32"/>
Piety, Justice and Charity, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Humility, Meekness, Patience
and Submission to the Divine will, and
all other Christian Graces and Virtues,
that, while he is so employed, all is as
well within him as he can desire; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
it a Heaven upon Earth to be so
employed.</p>
               <p>I fear that many a one who would be
thought a Christian cannot receive this
Doctrine, that it seems to him a very
strange Soloecism; but I could tell him
of many a <hi>Heathen</hi> of whom he may learn
it as well as of <hi>Christians;</hi> particularly
<hi>Tully,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">O Vitae Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiae Dux O Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatrix, expultrix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum! V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus dies benè &amp; ex praeceptis tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus.</note> who hath this brave saying in his
<hi>Tusculan Questions: O Philosophy the

and expeller of Vices! One day well

ought to be preferred before a sinning immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi>
And all those say for substance
the self-same thing, who tell us, that
<hi>Virtue is a Reward to it self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Good man feels also no small plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in <hi>reflecting</hi> upon the fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
he hath brought forth: And
much more in the Contemplation of that
Glorious Reward, which God for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100709:32"/>
Christ's sake hath promised to those who
patiently persevere in well-doing. The
fore-expectation whereof doth greatly
support him under all the crosses and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
wherewith he is exercised in this
life: And makes him not only <hi>Patient</hi>
under <hi>those</hi> Tribulations he meets with
for <hi>Righteousness</hi> sake, but even to <hi>Glory</hi>
in them, as the Apostles did and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians.</p>
               <p>And moreover, he receiveth great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
and Comfort more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> especially
when he is called forth to any exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
great suffering, or extraordinary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
He <hi>then</hi> marvellously <hi>strengthens</hi>
the Good man <hi>with strength in his Soul</hi> to
bear the <hi>one</hi> and perform <hi>the other</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a servant of <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ. Which
he doth <hi>chiefly</hi> by giving sensible, clear
and lively representations to the Good
mans mind of the Glory of Heaven, and
by stedfastly fixing it upon the Crown
of Righteousness and Life, which his
Blessed Lord hath promised to all those
who are faithful to the Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus was the first Christian Martyr
S.</hi> Stephen <hi>strengthened, who</hi> being full of
the Holy Ghost looked up stedfastly into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and saw the Glory of God, saw the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100709:33"/>
opened, <hi>as ready to receive him,</hi> and
the Son of man standing on the right hand of
God.</p>
               <p>And in the same manner have innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
of his Followers been since
strengthened; and among others not a
few of our own Country people who
were burnt at stakes by the Bloudy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> And
if ever such days should come again (as
God grant they may not) all sincerely
good Souls, who are sensible of their own
weakness, and intirely confide in the
power of <hi>Iesus,</hi> shall undoubtedly be
enabled to suffer with great <hi>Patience</hi> and
<hi>Constancy,</hi> if not with great <hi>Ioyfulness</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
and triumphantly.</p>
               <p>And <hi>indeed</hi> without this more <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>
and <hi>special</hi> Divine Assistance, we
could not well hope to endure a <hi>Fiery</hi>
trial. All External encouragements,
such is the infirmity of our Natures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
but with the <hi>ordinary</hi> assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Divine Grace, are like little
to avail us in the hour of <hi>such a</hi> temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And the reason is, because we shall
be in great danger of being totally depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the power of considering by very
<hi>acute</hi> pain and torment: And a <hi>vigorous
powerful sense</hi> of the Glory of Heaven, is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100709:33"/>
necessary to our bearing with <hi>patience,</hi>
and much more with <hi>joyfulness</hi> the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sort of Tribulations; the mere <hi>Belief</hi>
thereof would certainly have but a very
weak influence in such a circumstance.</p>
               <p>And therefore (as was said) all Good
Souls may confidently expect extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Assistance, whensoever they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out to extraordinary sufferings. <hi>God
is faithful</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>who will
not suffer you to be tempted above what you
are able,</hi> &amp;c. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13.</p>
               <p>Now then, who after all this shall
need to be told, what a Glorious Liberty
of Soul is obtainable by the careful obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Laws of Righteousness and
Goodness? But this will yet further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if we consider that,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It delivereth from all <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
self-love.</hi> Such a love of our
selves as ties us down and determines us
to our own bodily and particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A worthy person,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. Iohn Smith.</note> 
                  <hi>in a Discourse of
the</hi> Excellency of true Religion <hi>hath a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our present purpose well worth
our reciting,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> Wicked men are of
most narrow and confined Spirits, they are so
contracted by the pinching particularities of
Earthly and Created things, so imprisoned
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100709:34"/>
in the dark dungeon of Sensuality and
Selfishness, so straitned through their carnal
designs and ends, that they cannot stretch
themselves, nor look beyond the Horizon of
time and sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there he observeth, that</hi> Plato
hath long since concluded <hi>concerning the
condition of Sensual men, that</hi> They live
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, like a Shell-Fish, and can never
move up and down, but in their own Prison,
which they ever carry about with them.</p>
               <p>But true Religion and Goodness is so
Generous and Noble a Principle, that he
who is acted thereby cannot be confined
to <hi>himself</hi> and his <hi>own</hi> things.</p>
               <p>His Soul is not imprisoned within
himself, that is, within his own <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
Being separated from the rest of the
World; but is enlarged by an Universal
Charity, by a sincere good will to God's
whole Creation.</p>
               <p>He hath an hearty concern for the
good of the World, and carries on no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
for himself which are opposite
thereunto, nor any other but such as
some way or other do tend to promote
the welfare and happiness of his Fellow-creatures:
And 'tis the greatest pleasure
to his mind imaginable, to be instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100709:34"/>Again, his Soul is not tied down to
any <hi>inferior</hi> good things, his love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
are not terminated on such objects,
but they are so extensive as to stretch
themselves far beyond <hi>this</hi> world, and
fix upon the Original and Supreme Good,
and there to Centre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Language of this man is the same
with holy</hi> David'<hi>s,</hi> Whom have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
but God, and there is nothing upon the
Earth I desire in comparison of him.
<hi>Though he hath a kindness for things</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<hi>yet his thoughts and affections are
not</hi> confined <hi>to them, but soar aloft to him
who is the Author of them, and from
whom all the goodness that is in them is
derived. Whereas (as the foresaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
expresseth it</hi>) All the Freedom that
wicked men have, is but like that of Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, to wander up and down in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of this World, from one Den and
Cave to another. <hi>And he saith before, that
Tully</hi> could see so much in his Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
as made him to say, Scientia natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae
ampliat animum &amp; ad divina attollit:
The knowledge of Nature enlargeth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the mind, and carrieth it up to Divine
things. But this is most true of Religion,
that in an higher sence it doth work the Soul
into a true and divine Amplitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100709:35"/>And thus have we shewed, that the
Observance of the Laws of Righteousness
and Goodness gives the most excellent
Liberty, in that the Liberty which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
from thence is the Liberty of the
<hi>Soul;</hi> and also <hi>how</hi> the Soul is thereby
set at Liberty.</p>

               <head type="sub">That this is the Liberty of God himself, and
his most excellent Liberty.</head>
               <p>THirdly, I proceed to shew, that
the Liberty which ariseth from the
Observance of the Laws of Righteousness
and Goodness is the <hi>Divine</hi> Liberty, the
Liberty of <hi>God</hi> himself, and his most <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi>
Liberty. God Almighty is of all
Beings infinitely the most unlimited and
uncontroulable by any thing <hi>without</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>He doth whatsoever pleaseth him, in
Heaven, the Earth, the Sea and all deep
places.</hi> The whole Universe is in <hi>his</hi>
hands as the Clay in the hands of the

               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:100709:35"/>But as unboundable as his Will and
Power are by any thing <hi>without</hi> him,
they are both determined, by the <hi>internal</hi>
Rectitude and Goodness of his Nature,
to things Holy, Just and Good. He is

               </p>
               <p>And a multitude of such Declarations
we find in the Holy Scriptures, which
abundantly speak the Divine Will and
Power to be inseparably conjoyned with
Righteousness and Goodness; and never
in the least to swerve from either.</p>
               <p>And if any such providences have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
under our notice at any time, or
come to our knowledge, which we have
been to seek satisfactorily to reconcile
with the Rules of Righteousness or
Goodness, we ought to take occasion
from thence to be humbled under a sense
of our own short-sightedness and shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Understanding, and to take great
heed how we charge our Creator with
that, which he hath so often professed to
loath and abominate.</p>
               <p>Now let us observe, that this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of God's Will and Power from
<hi>within</hi> himself to things Just and Good,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100709:36"/>
is that which gives a greater lustre to his
Nature, and far more speaks him the
most Excellent and most Happy Being,
than his mere unlimitableness by any
thing <hi>without</hi> him. Nay, Uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
and Absolute Soveraignty would
make him so much the <hi>Worse,</hi> and less
Happy Being, except the exercise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were determined by a Holy, Good
and Righteous Nature.</p>
               <p>If God Almighty were made up of
<hi>Will,</hi> and every thing were in it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to him, and he did this or that
merely because 'tis his <hi>pleasure</hi> so to do,
he would (I say) be infinitely the <hi>Worse</hi>
Being, for his Absolute Sovereignty and
Uncontroulable Power.</p>
               <p>What is it that makes the Devils, the
most vile and hateful of all Creatures, is
it not <hi>this,</hi> that they are Spirits indued
with great Strength and Power, with
great Knowledge, Sagacity and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Understanding, and with large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
though Usurped, but have lost
that integrity of Nature, and those good
Principles, whereby they should govern
themselves, and be determined in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of their Power and Wisdom?
'Tis certain, they would be nothing so
mischievous and wicked as they are, if
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100709:37"/>
with the loss of their <hi>Moral</hi> endowments,
they had also been divested of their <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:</hi>
I mean their Strength and Power,
their Knowledge and Acuteness of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>The Devils are in <hi>these</hi> far more like to
God, than any of us <hi>Men</hi> are in a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of being (at least in <hi>this</hi> life) but
notwithstanding this, they are of all his
Creation the most <hi>unlike</hi> God; namely,
because their great Power and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
are utterly unacquainted with, and
estranged from, Righteousness and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
are altogether employed in most
unrighteous and wicked designs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises.</p>
               <p>So that irresistible power and All-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
knowledge are so far from
denominating a Being the most Absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect considered <hi>alone,</hi> that <hi>That</hi>
would be the <hi>worst</hi> Being in the world,
which is supposed to have those perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and is <hi>made</hi> to be the worst <hi>by</hi> those
perfections, if they do not exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Righteous and Good actions,
but the contrary: if the exercise of them
be not determined by Rules and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Righteousness and Goodness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:100709:37"/>And in saying that a Being will be the
<hi>worse</hi> for Power and Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
separated from Goodness, I say also it
will be the more <hi>unhappy:</hi> For the worse
any one is, the less satisfaction he must
needs take in himself, and the less he will
necessarily have of self-enjoyment; as
hath been already shewed.</p>
               <p>Now, considering what hath been
said, 'tis most apparent that <hi>the</hi> Divine
Liberty, the most excellent Liberty of
God himself, is his absolute Freedom to
Good, his being perfectly unbyassed by
any evil Affection, and infinitely out of
the reach of corrupt Appetites, so that he
can as soon cease to <hi>be,</hi> as fail to exercise
his Almighty power, his Omniscience
and Unsearchable Wisdom, in doing
what is most fit, most right and equal.</p>
               <p>This is the Liberty, which most highly
commends the infinitely best of <hi>Beings,</hi>
and therefore 'tis that which will make
us poor Mortals most like to him, and
<hi>partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it is sufficiently, I presume,
demonstrated, that the most Excellent
Liberty consisteth in, or <hi>results</hi> from,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100709:38"/>
the Observance of the Laws of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Goodness. And to shew,
that this is eminently (nay and <hi>solely</hi> too)
our <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> will be the business
of the next Section.</p>

            <head type="sub">That this Freedom to holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and true Goodness, or
which consisteth in an intire
compliance with the Laws of
Righteousness, is our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Liberty.</head>
            <p>THis Phrase <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> being so
much in the mouths of people profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Christianity, one would think that
nothing is better understood; that there is
no point of our Religion in the nature of
which we less need to be instructed.</p>
            <p>We mightily insist upon our <hi>Christian
Liberty,</hi> a very warm Zeal we <hi>seem</hi> to
have for it, and we are not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
(as hath been already intimated)
when we apprehend it to be invaded, or
in the least infringed.</p>
            <p>And if we be not mistaken in our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Liberty, 'tis most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100709:39"/>
done of us to contend earnestly for
it, to refuse to part with it, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the smallest violation or abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof upon any terms whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>But alas, nothing is more misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
than <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> and nothing
hath been more abused; and therefore
'tis well worth our while rightly to state
the notion of it, and to fix it where it
ought to be.</p>
            <p>How it hath been mistaken and abused
shall be shewn in its due place, our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
business is,</p>
            <p>First, To Demonstrate the foresaid
Proposition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To shew what our Lord
hath done to instate us in this our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Liberty.</p>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <head type="sub">The foresaid Proposition Demonstrated by
four Arguments, viz. First, That this
hath been proved to be the most Glorious
Liberty. Secondly, This was that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
the instating us wherein, was the
whole business of our Saviour and his
Apostles. Thirdly, Our Saviours Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
the Ceremonial Law was chiefly
designed in order to the thorough effecting
this Liberty: Where it is shewed, that
this Law accidentally became very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the great Design of setting men free
from the power of their Lusts, in several
particulars. Fourthly, That none but
the Jews were obliged to the Observance
of this Law.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:100709:39"/>FIrst, We will demonstrate the truth
of this Assertion, that <hi>Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
consisteth in Freedom to holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
in deliverance from the Power
and Dominion of sin, together with the
direful effects and consequents thereof:
<hi>This</hi> we will do by these following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>First, This is, as we have shewed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
the best and most Glorious of
Liberties, and therefore it must needs be
(at least <hi>principally</hi> and in the most <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
sence) our <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi> For
whatsoever Benefits our Blessed Lord is
any where said to have procured for us,
the absolutely <hi>best</hi> of the kind is always
to be understood.</p>
               <p>For <hi>instance,</hi> whereas he saith, that
<hi>he is come that we might have life,</hi> he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100709:40"/>
means the <hi>best</hi> of Lives, the Spiritual life
of the Soul here, and Eternal life hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Riches</hi> he is said to bestow, is
meant those whereby the <hi>Soul</hi> is inriched,
the Divine Graces and Virtues, called
by himself <hi>the true Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>Salvation</hi> which he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of, is meant that from the <hi>worst</hi> of
evils principally, and <hi>everlasting</hi> Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>So proportionably, whenas <hi>the Son</hi> is
said <hi>to make us free,</hi> the meaning is free
with the <hi>best</hi> of Freedoms, <hi>viz.</hi> that from
<hi>sin,</hi> as also we have seen is manifest from
the <hi>Context.</hi> Whenas Christ is said to
be <hi>Anointed,</hi> according to the Prophecy
of <hi>Esay</hi> concerning him, <hi>to preach delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to the captives,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> and <hi>to set at liberty
them that are bruised</hi> (with being long
fettered and shackled) we are likewise to
understand the same most desirable of all
Liberties and Deliverances. Whereas
S. <hi>Iames</hi> calls the Gospel <hi>the law of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
(Chap. 1. 25.) and <hi>the perfect law of
Liberty,</hi> (Chap. 2. 12.) we are <hi>primarily</hi>
to understand it (as will be further
shewn) of this same Liberty which infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
surpasseth all other. In which
sence the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> understood it to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100709:40"/>
be <hi>The perfect law of Liberty,</hi> when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it <hi>The law of the Spirit of life, which is in
Christ Iesus,</hi> adding that, <hi>it had made him
free from the law of Sin and death,</hi> Rom.
8. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We find <hi>this</hi> Liberty was
that, the instating us wherein, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
when he was in the World, and
his Apostles after him, were altogether
bent and intent upon. The business of
making men holy and obedient to the
Laws of Righteousness, they had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>mostly</hi> in their Eye, but all they did
was <hi>subordinated</hi> thereunto.</p>
               <p>All those powerful means that were
used to perswade the world that <hi>Iesus</hi> is
the Christ, were in order to <hi>this</hi> end:
For the <hi>Son of God was manifested to take
away our sins;</hi> and <hi>to destroy the works of
the Devil,</hi> 1 John 3. 5, 8.</p>
               <p>Therefore is <hi>Faith</hi> so highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and so much ascribed thereto, and
men so excited to believe in Christ, or to
believe his Gospel, because the Doctrine,
Precepts, Promises and Threatnings
therein contained have a great aptness
and tendency, are of mighty force and
efficacy, to the thorough Reformation of
our Lives, and the cleansing our Natures
from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100709:41"/>
Because <hi>that</hi> Faith which is terminated
upon those Objects is such a <hi>Shield,</hi> as
whereby <hi>we shall be able to quench all the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
darts of the wicked one:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 16.</note> Because it is
most effectual to <hi>the purifying of the heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note>
and <hi>the overcoming of the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In short,</hi> Christ gave himself for us that
he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
purifie to himself a peculiar people zealous of
good works, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>He died for all, that they which live
should not henceforth <hi>live unto themselves</hi>
(to the drudging service of their Lusts)
<hi>but unto him that died for them, and rose
again, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 15. Or, that they should
be <hi>his</hi> Servants, that is, his Free-men;
according to that of S. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 22.
<hi>He that is called being a Servant is the Lords
Free-man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He gave himself for the Church, that he
might sanctifie and cleanse it, by the washing
of water by the word; That he might present
it to himself a glorious Church, not having
spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
should be holy and without blemish, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
5. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>He his own self bare our sins in his own
body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins,
should live unto Righteousness, 1 Pet. 2. 24.
<hi>Or as S.</hi> Paul <hi>saith,</hi> Rom. 6. 7. That being
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100709:41"/>
dead we might be freed from sin: <hi>That is,
that being dead to it, we might be freed
from the</hi> Bondage <hi>we were in under it.
Or, as we have it, ver.</hi> 18. That being
made free from sin, we might become the
servants of righteousness.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour required nothing of us,
forbad nothing to us, but what was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
designed in order to our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from sin, the making us <hi>pure in
heart,</hi> and <hi>holy in all manner of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
He gave us not a <hi>Promise,</hi> but what
was to encourage us hereunto, nor yet a
<hi>Threatning,</hi> but what was intended to
scare us from the serving of one Lust or
other. And the Apostle tells us, that
the whole of the Gospel, or, <hi>The grace of
God that brings salvation</hi> is designed to
<hi>teach us, that, denying ungodliness and
worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously
and godly in this present world,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>'Tis sufficiently evident from this <hi>little</hi>
that hath been said, that the setting us
free from Sin, and the making us Free
to Righteousness was <hi>the</hi> business which
took up our Blessed Saviour's time and
thoughts when he was upon the Earth,
and wherein his holy Apostles were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
after his departure: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>this</hi> must necessarily be our grand
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100709:42"/>
                  <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi> Abundantly more
might have been said upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">The Design of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</note>
but we have heretofore copiously
handled it in another Treatise.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Our Saviours abrogating the
<hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> his freeing from <hi>that</hi>
yoke, was mainly designed in order to
the thorough effecting <hi>this</hi> Freedom and
Liberty. This was a <hi>yoke</hi> which the
Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>neither they nor their
Fathers were able to bear,</hi> Acts 15. 10. It
was <hi>a yoke of bondage,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it,
<hi>Gal. 5. 1. Stand fast in the Liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Christ hath made us free, and be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
again with the yoke of bondage.</hi> This
Liberty (as appears by his discourse both
before and after) was that which Christ
had given them from the burdensome ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of the Mosaical Dispensation. And
diverse other places there are which speak
of this Liberty as an effect and fruit of
the death of Christ.</p>
               <p>Now it is worthy our Observation, that
the great reason wherefore our Saviour
did put an end to the Obligation of this
Law, and why the Apostles, especially
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> insisted so much upon it, and so
earnestly cautioned the Jewish Believers
against intangling themselves again with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100709:42"/>
this yoke, was because it became very
highly injurious to the Grand Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Design of setting men perfectly free
from their Lusts: Because it <hi>gendered</hi> to
that spiritual bondage, in deliverance
from which consisteth our best Liberty.
For this Law understood <hi>Carnally,</hi> and
according to the <hi>letter</hi> only, (which it
ought not to have been) was very apt to
beget a sordid and low spirit, a temper of
mind very much estranged from <hi>true</hi> Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Goodness. And it is too unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable,
that the <hi>Iews</hi> generally had no
higher a sense of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law,</hi> the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
saith, <hi>made nothing perfect,</hi> Chap. 7. 19.
It gave no man Freedom from the power
of Sin, no power to subdue corrupt Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
was obtainable thereby; it did
not make men <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>internally</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but only <hi>Ritually</hi> and <hi>External<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
As the most eminently Good men
under the Law did fall far short of the
Apostles of our Saviour, and those whose
lives have been most answerable to the
Christian precepts, so those degrees of
Virtue and Goodness they did attain to
were not owing the <hi>Law,</hi> but to the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made with Abraham,</hi> which was the
same for substance with <hi>the Gospel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:100709:43"/>
The Law is said to be <hi>weak through
the flesh;</hi> or in regard of the impetuosity
and violence of mens fleshly Appetites,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any express mention in
the Ceremonial Law of any <hi>necessity</hi> of
<hi>purity of heart:</hi> This was only represented
by the divers legal washings, and other
Rites; the mortification of corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
was signified by the cutting off
the foreskin of the flesh, and the great
<hi>substantial</hi> duties were veiled under dark
shadows. So that a man might be very
punctually observant of this Law, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the mere literal sence thereof,
and yet his Soul remain perfectly under
the power of sinful Affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Learned Mr.</hi> Chillingworth <hi>in
his Sermon on</hi> Gal. 5. 5. <hi>saith thus even
of the</hi> Moral Duties of the two Tables, <hi>as
they are part of the Mosaical Jewish
Law,</hi> viz. That they required only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
obedience and conformity to the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative
Precepts thereof, and an abstaining
from an Outward practice of the Negative.
They did not reach unto the Conscience, no
more than the National Laws of other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
do. So that, for example, when the
law of <hi>Moses</hi> forbids Adultery upon pain of
death, he that should in his heart lust after
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100709:43"/>
a Woman, could not be accounted a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor
of <hi>Moses</hi> his law, neither was he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the punishment therein specified:
Whereas the Gospel requires not only an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and, as I may say, corporal obedience
to God's Commandments, but also an inward
sanctification of the Soul and Conscience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same penalty of everlasting damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the former. And what is now said
<hi>(proceeds he)</hi> of the Moral Precepts (as
they are part of <hi>Moses</hi> his law) by the same
proportion likewise, is to be understood of the
Iudicial.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Promises</hi> of this Law
they were only of Temporal good things,
and therefore the Gospel is called by the
Author to the <hi>Hebrews, The bringing in of a
better hope,</hi> Chap. 7. 19. And is said <hi>to be
established upon better promises,</hi> Chap. 8. 6.</p>
               <p>'Tis confessed that promises of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things were contained in those of
Earthly, as some of the latter were
Types of the former, particularly the
<hi>land of Canaan</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Rest in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
and the promises of good things in
the <hi>general</hi> had those of the <hi>other</hi> life im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in them; but there is not the least
<hi>express</hi> mention in this Law of any Life
after this: I do not say, in any part of
the Old Testament, but in <hi>this</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:100709:44"/>Now then, seeing it abounded with
Temporal Promises, and none but such
being in <hi>express</hi> terms contained therein,
'tis no wonder if it became an occasion to
the sensual <hi>Iews</hi> of their being the more
<hi>eager</hi> and <hi>vehement</hi> in prosecuting the
profits, honours and pleasures of this
life, as it was of their being the more
Mercenary in their obedience.</p>
               <p>The like may be said of the <hi>Threatnings</hi>
of this Law, they are all so expressed as
if they were only of <hi>Present, Temporal</hi>
Evils, and the <hi>Iews,</hi> for the most part,
looking no farther than the outward let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of these Threatnings, it was not to be
expected that they should be excited by
them to obey from any higher motive
than the mere fear of <hi>such</hi> evils; as those
that did not look beyond the letter of the
<hi>Promises</hi> were obedient only from the
hope of some <hi>sensual, present</hi> good: And
by this means especially did this Law
<hi>Gender to bondage,</hi> as we read it did,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
               <p>The terrible manner in which the Law
was given, and the Threatnings of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
death or other temporal Calamities
upon the Transgression thereof did occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that slavish sear, which the Apostle
calls the <hi>Spirit of bondage,</hi> in those words,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100709:44"/>
                  <hi>Ye have not received the Spirit of bondage
again to fear,</hi> Rom. 8. 5.</p>
               <p>God dealt with the <hi>Iews</hi> as it was most
fit to deal with such a carnal, such a stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked,
stubborn and disingenuous
people; who would not be wrought upon
and overcome by love to <hi>himself,</hi> or a
sense of the loveliness of Virtue and true
Goodness, nor regard any Laws, but
such as were enforced with severe present
Penalties, or promises of <hi>sensual</hi> good
things: Which obedience of theirs was
most truly and properly the obedience of
Slaves, a Servile and Mercenary Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>So that this Law having been abused
by the <hi>Iews</hi> to the so much the more
captivating them to their fleshly lusts,
for this reason chiefly was it laid aside,
namely, because the Liberty which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in a thorough compliance with the
Rules of Righteousness, the Obligation
of this Law would have greatly obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the promoting of.</p>
               <p>And the things expresly required in
this Law being such as had no internal
goodness in them, being <hi>weak and beggarly
Elements,</hi> as the Apostle calls them, <hi>Gal.</hi>
4. 9. the imposition of <hi>many</hi> such must
needs be apt to call away mens Minds and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100709:45"/>
Affections from those that are essentially
and immutably good, whilest the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
meaning of those injunctions is either
not understood or not attended to. And
that it had this effect upon the generality
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> by this means, is a case too
plain to need to be proved.</p>
               <p>And though the great substantial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which are in their own nature Good
and Necessary, and of Eternal obligation,
were inculcated upon them by all their
Prophets, as well as taught by Natural
Light, such as <hi>Doing Iustice, loving Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
walking humbly with God,</hi> and the like,
yet they generally were so sottish as to
think that He valued Sacrifices, and the
other Ceremonial and External Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
of the Law so much above such
Duties (nay, though he had expresly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
declared the quite contrary) as that
their exact and diligent observation of
<hi>those</hi> would make expiation for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misness
in <hi>these,</hi> and fully satisfie for
gross immoralities. <hi>They trusted in lying
words, saying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 7. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the
Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord
are these;</hi> implying that their continual
attendance on the services there perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
according to the prescription of the
Law, would effectually secure them from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100709:45"/>
Divine vengeance, although they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to amend their ways, and were never
so immoral in their Practices.</p>
               <p>And their constant Trading in Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in Rituals and Ceremonial things,
occasioned their having but very little
<hi>sense</hi> of things <hi>Morally</hi> good; so that <hi>that</hi>
distinction was almost lost among them,
of things <hi>Positively</hi> and <hi>Morally</hi> so, or
things good only because commanded,
and things commanded because good.
Their being so intent upon a many <hi>little</hi>
things caused them to sleight and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
the <hi>great</hi> ones, as our Saviour told
the <hi>Pharisees, Luke 11. 42. Ye tithe Mint
and Rue, and all manner of Herbs, and
pass over judgment and the love of God.</hi>
And Mat. 23. 23. <hi>Ye pay tith of Mint and
Anise, and Cummin, and have omitted the
weightier matters of the Law, judgment,
mercy and faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And their <hi>omitting</hi> these things was
too plain an Argument <hi>alone</hi> (though
there is other proof of it) of their having
scarcely any notion of things Absolutely,
Immutably and Essentially Good and
Evil, which was occasioned (as I said)
by their minds being so employed about
things which were in <hi>themselves</hi> neither
Good nor Evil, but only by reason of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100709:46"/>
injunctions and prohibitions.</p>
               <p>Not that this great evil was <hi>necessarily</hi>
occasioned thereby (God forbid we
should think so) but 'twas through their
own default; otherwise there could
have been <hi>no</hi> truly good people among
them, as there were innumerable: just
as we see at <hi>this</hi> day, there are too many
of a certain Profession, who, by means of
their continual dabling in <hi>matter,</hi> are of so
gross and course intellectuals, that they
seem almost uncapable of any <hi>Idea</hi> and
conception of things immaterial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal.
Which is a great Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
but as great a Fault.</p>
               <p>So that, this we have now said suggests
to us <hi>another</hi> reason for the putting a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
to the Ceremonial Law, in order to
the introduction of that excellent and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Liberty, which we assert to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<hi>Christian Liberty;</hi> Because that the
love of Righteousness and Goodness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that <hi>notion</hi> is necessary thereunto, as
shall be farther shewn hereafter. And it
is an evidence of a Soul imprisoned in
Sense, and sunk in Selfishness to love
Virtue and Goodness, merely for its
dowry and the external Advantages that
accrue by it, and not for its <hi>own</hi> sake:
As also to avoid sin, only for the sake of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100709:46"/>
the uneasie and sad circumstances that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, having no sense of its Moral Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Whereas I have shewed, that
by the observation of the Laws of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and Goodness a man is delivered
from all <hi>immoderate Self-love</hi> to his own
<hi>Bodily</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> concerns, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
that Generosity and Nobleness of
spirit whereby he is carried forth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
to the love of God in the <hi>first</hi> place,
and a hearty concern for the General
welfare of his Fellow-creatures, the <hi>Iews</hi>
by the occasion of the forementioned
Law, became less free, as Freedom is
opposed to <hi>Confinement.</hi> For they being
paled in and separated from the rest of the
world by a Religion peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and it being forbidden by their
Law to contract Marriages, or have any
intimacy, and that they should so much
as <hi>eat</hi> with the Gentiles (though 'twas
but necessary they should be so restrained
for the more effectual preventing their
falling into Idolatry, and being infected
with their other wicked customs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
manners, to which they were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
very strangely inclined, yet) by
this means they generally became woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100709:47"/>
Narrow-spirited and contracted in
their Love, and took occasion from hence
to banish all from their Kindness and
Charity, that were not of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and their own Religion.</p>
               <p>And therefore for <hi>this</hi> reason also it
was highly fit that our Saviour should
take off all future Obligation to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of <hi>this</hi> Law; his design being to
Ampliate and Enlarge mens minds by
the most Universal and Unlimited Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
in imitation of himself, who was a
Propitiation not only for the sins of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, but also of the <hi>whole
World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for</hi> this <hi>reason particularly S.</hi> Paul
<hi>tells the</hi> Ephesians, <hi>This Law was Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
Chap.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. For he is our
peace, who hath made both one <hi>(Jews and
Gentiles)</hi> and hath broken down the middle
wall of partition between us, having abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his flesh the enmity, even the Law of
Commandments, contained in Ordinances
<hi>(or, having Abolished by his Sufferings
the Ceremonial Law, which was such a
Make-bate between the</hi> Iews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles)
for to make himself of twain one new man, so
making peace. And that he might reconcile
both unto God in one body on the Cross, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
slain the enmity thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:100709:47"/>And that in the general, the great
work of setting men perfectly at Liberty
from the power of their Lusts, and the
making them free to all holy Obedience
was designed by the nullifying <hi>this</hi> Law,
is asserted by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 5, 6.
<hi>For when we were in the flesh</hi> (or under those
Carnal Ordinances) <hi>the motions of sin,
which were by the Law, did work in our
members, to bring forth fruit unto death.
But now we are delivered from the Law, that
being dead wherein we were held, that we
should serve in newness of the spirit, and not
in the oldness of the letter.</hi> That is, when
we were under the Law, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
or Sinful Affections, which were height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereby (through our own blindness
in not looking beyond the <hi>letter</hi> of the
Law) did so work in us, as to render us so
much the more obnoxious to death: But
now we are delivered by our Saviour
Christ from that Law, it being dead, or
abrogated, that in stead of a mere <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Obedience, and a company of <hi>Bodily</hi>
Washings, we should for the future be
<hi>inwardly</hi> pure and <hi>spiritually</hi> obedient.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Argument: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we find Liberty or Freedom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
throughout the New Testament,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100709:48"/>
as that which belongeth to us under the
notion of <hi>Christians,</hi> as that which we
are beholden to the <hi>Gospel</hi> dispensation
for, it is still, I dare affirm, to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
either of Liberty from <hi>Sin</hi> (the
<hi>Power</hi> and the <hi>Punishment</hi> thereof) or of
Liberty from the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>purely
Mosaical</hi> Law. This I assert upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
consideration of all those Texts,
wherein any thing is said relating to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
And therefore this <hi>latter</hi> Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
being principally intended in order
to the <hi>former,</hi> the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that from
<hi>Sin,</hi> must necessarily be <hi>the</hi> Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, None but the <hi>Israelites</hi> were
obliged to the Observance of this Law.
Indeed in order to a <hi>Gentiles</hi> partaking of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priviledges in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
it was necessary he should be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
and become (as their phrase
was) <hi>a Proselyte of Iustice,</hi> and so make
himself <hi>a debtor to the whole Law:</hi> But it
was not necessary to his <hi>Acceptance with
God</hi> and <hi>Eternal Happiness</hi> to yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to this Law. It was sufficient for
him to worship the true God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Idolatry, and to follow the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:100709:48"/>Even the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves, as ill affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as they were towards the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did
acknowledge no more to be necessary,
than the Observation of the Seven Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of <hi>Noah,</hi> to their having their part
<hi>in Seculo futuro;</hi> and therefore they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the <hi>Proselytes of the Gate</hi> to worship
in the Outward Court of the Temple.
Which was therefore called <hi>Atrium Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
&amp; immundorum. The Court of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
and the Vnclean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, as it appears from the three
foregoing Arguments, that Liberty
from Sin and to Righteousness is the <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
Christian Liberty, which is procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the World taking in the <hi>Iews,</hi> so
from this <hi>fourth</hi> 'tis as evident, that it is
the <hi>only</hi> Christian Liberty which is
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
and purchased for us <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no <hi>other</hi> Liberty mentioned
either by our Saviour or his Apostles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this from the Power and Dominion
of <hi>Sin</hi> (wherein we always include deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from the sad consequents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
which we <hi>Gentiles</hi> are obliged to
<hi>Christianity</hi> for, or which we are invested
with under the notion of <hi>Christians.</hi>

            <div n="6" type="chapter">

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">What course our Lord hath taken to instate
us in this Liberty shewed in several parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
viz. that 1. He hath most fully
informed us concerning all the Parts and
Particulars of our Liberty. 2. He hath
furnished us with the most potent Means,
for the gaining of it. 3. He hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
a rich supply of Grace and Strength,
to enable us to use these Means successfully.
4. He hath laid before us the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Motives and Arguments to prevail on
our Wills to make use of this Strength,
and comply with this Grace.</head>
               <p>HAving, I hope, sufficiently cleared
the truth of this Proposition, that
our <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> (both <hi>mainly</hi> and
<hi>wholly</hi>) consisteth in Freedom to holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and deliverance from Sin, I now
come to shew,</p>
               <p>Secondly, How Christ instates men in
this Liberty, or what Course he hath
taken for the effecting hereof.</p>
               <p>By the way, we are to take notice that
the Method our Lord hath made choice
of, for the setting us free from our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Affections, is such as is most Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100709:49"/>
to the Nature of those that are to be
delivered, and such as is most suitable to
the Nature of that Bondage and Slavery
from which he delivers.</p>
               <p>Those who are to be delivered being
Reasonable Creatures, Voluntary and
therefore <hi>Free</hi> Agents, who act not by
mere Necessity of Nature, or Blind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts,
and much less from External
Force and Compulsion, he dealeth with
them, in Setting them free, as with <hi>such</hi>
a sort of Creatures.</p>
               <p>Again the Slavery (as also the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement)
from which he delivers being
<hi>Spiritual</hi> not <hi>Corporal;</hi> I mean, being
<hi>Originally</hi> in the Mind, Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and not in the Outward man, he
hath accordingly applied himself to the
effecting our deliverance.</p>
               <p>So that our Deliverer hath not done
all for us that is to be done, and left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for us to do, in order to our being
set free. Nor can this be said of any <hi>other</hi>
who designs to deliver out of Bondage or
Prison persons arrived at years of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that are able to use their hands
and legs. Such a one accounts that he
hath done abundantly enough, when he
hath paid the Slaves Ransom, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the necessity he was under of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100709:50"/>
in servitude; If afterward he will
not stir a foot, he doth not think himself
obliged to hale him by main force out of
the Gallies or House of bondage. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
looks upon <hi>his</hi> work as done, when he
hath set the Prison doors wide open, and
hath cleared the Prisoner's passage out,
and put the Key into his hand for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking
his Fetters, and offered to assist
him if he cannot do it by his own
strength: But when all this is done, if
the Prisoner will do nothing towards his
own escape, he, who hath done thus
much in his behalf, will think it great pity
but that there he should lie.</p>
               <p>There is no Prince but will be satisfied
that he hath quitted himself bravely, and
fully performed the part of a Deliverer,
when he hath put Weapons into the
hands of a Conquered People, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
them with sufficient aids for the
rescuing themselves from the Tyranny of
their Oppressors; but if after all, they
will not be perswaded to <hi>use</hi> their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and are so dastardly as not to joyn
with those Forces that are sent for their
help, he nevertheless deserves the Title
of a Deliverer.</p>
               <p>In like manner, it is not our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Method to drag men with irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100709:50"/>
force out of their Spiritual Vassal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
and Slavery: He doth not deliver us
<hi>against</hi> our Wills, nor in such a manner
as if we were Creatures that have <hi>no</hi>
Wills; nor doth so <hi>overpower</hi> our Wills
(at least <hi>ordinarily</hi>) as that they shall have
left them no power of resistance, but be
<hi>necessitated</hi> to give their Consent.</p>
               <p>But <hi>this</hi> is the Course he hath taken,
which is the most wise, and in its own
nature the most admirably effectual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He hath fully informed us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Parts and Particulars of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He hath Directed us to the
most potent Means for the gaining thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He hath purchased a rich supply
of Grace and Strength to enable us to use
these Means successfully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He hath laid before us the most
powerful Motives and Arguments imaginable
to prevail with our Wills to use this Strength,
to comply with this Grace.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>He hath fully informed us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Parts and Particulars of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:</hi>
I mean, he hath instructed us in
all those Rules of Righteousness and
Goodness, in the Observance of which
consists our best and most desirable Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:100709:51"/>This he hath done by the Precepts he
hath given us, as also by the Example he
hath set before us. In <hi>Matthew</hi> 11. 28, 29.
he proposeth both these, the one to be
obeyed, the other to be followed, in order
to the possessing our selves of this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<hi>Come unto me</hi> (saith he) <hi>all ye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.</hi> And what he meaneth by <hi>Coming
unto him</hi> he tells us in the next words,
<hi>Take my Yoke upon you,</hi> or obey my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
<hi>and Learn of me,</hi> or follow my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>for I am meek and lowly in heart, and
ye shall find Rest unto your Souls:</hi> Rest
from the Slavish drudgery of sinful Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>As to our Saviours <hi>Precepts,</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he hath required of us, it is either a
<hi>Part</hi> of our Liberty, or a <hi>Means</hi> for the
gaining and maintenance thereof.</p>
               <p>Now as to the Christian Precepts
which oblige us to those things in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which our Liberty <hi>consisteth,</hi> as
they incomparably excel the Precepts of
whatsoever Religion was before or since
the coming of our Saviour, so there is
nothing defective or wanting in them.
There is not any thing left out of them
that is necessary to the completing of the
freedom and happiness of our Souls. All
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100709:51"/>
the defects of the Mosaical Law, and of
the Law of Nature, are supplied and
made up by them. As our Lord <hi>came not
to destroy the Law,</hi> so he came <hi>to fulfil it:</hi>
To perfect it and fill it up, as he himself
hath told us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that conduceth to the
restoring humane nature to its Primitive
Perfection, to the bringing every thing
in man into due order, to the effecting a
complete Harmony and Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his various disagreeing Powers
and Faculties, to the putting him into
that state wherein every thing would be
with him as his own heart could wish to
have it, or (in one word) to the making
him partaker of the God-like Nature,
and consequently of the God-like Liberty,
Freedom and Blessedness; There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
I say, conduceable to these excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
purposes, but our Saviour hath in his
<hi>own Person,</hi> when he was on Earth, and
by his <hi>Apostles</hi> since he left the World,
acquainted us with it, over and over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated
it, again and again minded us
of it, and urged it upon our practice.</p>
               <p>To speak in the words of the Apostle
<hi>S. Paul, Phil. 4. 8. Whatsoever things are
true,</hi> or remote from insincerity and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie;
<hi>Whatsoever things are honest,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100709:52"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> venerable and grave; <hi>Whatsoever
things are just,</hi> or exactly agreeable to the
Rule of doing as we would be done unto;
<hi>Whatsoever things are pure,</hi> or far from
all shew and appearance of unchastity;
<hi>Whatsoever things are lovely,</hi> or which
tend to secure to us love among men, such
as all works of benignity, mercy and
Charity; <hi>Whatsoever things are of good
report,</hi> or which are apt to procure a
good name, and therefore to prevent all
the causes of shame, and to give us the
greatest freedom and confidence, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>God,</hi> so before <hi>Men</hi> too; <hi>If there be
any virtue,</hi> if there be any thing that is
by Good men reckoned in the number of
Virtues; <hi>And if there be any praise,</hi> or
any thing laudable and praise-worthy:
All these things, as the Apostle in the
general here enjoyneth us <hi>to think upon
them,</hi> so they are very particularly, and
as clearly and perspicuously, recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to us to be carefully observed by us, in
the New Testament.</p>
               <p>There is nothing which it becometh
us to Do or Forbear, whether in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>God,</hi> our Great Creator, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and Benefactor, or to our <hi>Fellow-creatures,</hi>
or to our <hi>own</hi> Souls and Bodies,
but <hi>here</hi> we find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:100709:52"/>Again, we may observe all these in
our Saviour's <hi>Life</hi> also, wherein He set
us an Example, that <hi>we should follow his
steps.</hi> And it is a most admirable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Piety towards God</hi> (of Love to
him, Trust in him, and Submission to
his Will) of <hi>Charity to all men,</hi> even his
greatest Enemies; and of Humility,
Meekness, Temperance, Purity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the World, and Heavenly-mindedness.</p>
               <p>He that shall observe how our Blessed
Saviour <hi>Lived,</hi> cannot be ignorant of any
of those Laws of Righteousness and
Goodness, which, before his coming,
the World was so lamentably, in not a
few instances, to seek in the knowledge
of, through that blindness which by the
customary gratifying their vile Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
men had generally contracted. I say,
he that is acquainted with the <hi>Life</hi> of our
Saviour cannot easily be ignorant of any
of those Laws, although he never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
what particular Commands or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
his Precepts consist of.</p>
               <p>So that this is the <hi>First</hi> thing Christ
<hi>Iesus</hi> hath done for us in order to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made Free: He hath given us fully
to understand what it is to be <hi>Free,</hi> what
are those several Rules of Righteousness
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100709:53"/>
and Goodness, in compliance with which
consists our Liberty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our Saviour hath also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
most Effectual <hi>Means,</hi> by making
use of which we shall most certainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and maintain this Liberty, that is,
obey those Laws of Liberty which he
hath given us.</p>
               <p>These Means are especially: <hi>Believing
himself to be the Son of God,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Truth and Divinity of his
Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hearing his Word, and Receiving it into
honest hearts,</hi> or Pondering it in our
minds, and Meditating upon it, with
the Design of conforming our selves to
it.</p>
               <p>Prayer to God in his Name, together with
Faith in his Bloud for the Remission of our
Sins, and in his Power and Goodness, for
the Subduing our Lusts, and the making us
Obedient to his Precepts: <hi>That is, for the
blessing our Endeavours to that End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Setting his Example before our Eyes,</hi>
which is an Excellent Means to beget in
us a likeness to him, and to our partaking
of his Spirit and Temper.</p>
               <p>Watching over our own Hearts, and
against Temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:100709:53"/>Denying our selves, and not indulging
our Sensitive Part.</p>
               <p>Advising in all Cases of doubt and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with our Pastors and Spiritual Guides;
<hi>whom Christ hath given to his Church,</hi>
For the perfecting of the Saints, for the

the Body of Christ, <hi>Ephes. 4. 12. And</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them which have the Rule over us in the
Lord, they watching for our Souls, as those
that must give an Account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.
<hi>Which Duties were never more neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than in this Age, to the great scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of our Reformed Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Keeping in the Communion of the Church:</hi>
And <hi>not forsaking the Assembling our selves
together</hi> (or our publick Assemblies) <hi>as
the manner of some is,</hi> Heb. 10. 25. And
<hi>now</hi> is the manner of vast numbers of us,
(though no Terms of Communion are
required that contradict any one Text
of Scripture) which Separation we are
too like ere long to pay dear for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Religious observation of the Lords
Day, both in Publick and Private,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
singular Help and Advantage;
Though few Professors of Christianity
seem now to have any great sense of it,
to the great prejudice of their <hi>own</hi> Souls,
and the Souls of <hi>those</hi> who are under their
charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:100709:54"/>And to these add in the <hi>last</hi> place (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis most convenient to place them
<hi>here) The Sacraments of Baptism</hi> and the
<hi>Lord's Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Baptism we are admitted into the
Church of Christ, and brought into a
<hi>New State:</hi> We are baptized <hi>into the
name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,</hi>
or devoted to their service. And the
<hi>Father,</hi> in this Sacrament, takes us into
his special care, and into the Relation of
his Children, whereas before we were
only the Children of <hi>Adam.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
us as members of his Body the
Church: <hi>We are baptized into one Body</hi>
(as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13.)
that Body whereof Christ is the Head.
And the Holy Ghost, who is the Author
of Grace and Spiritual Life, taketh us
for his Temples. We are said to <hi>Receive
the Holy Ghost</hi> in Baptism, to receive that
power and strength from him, which
will enable us to <hi>Mortifie the deeds of the
Body,</hi> and to acquire the Divine Graces
and Virtues; which we shall certainly
do, if we refuse not to Exert and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, when we come to years of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and our Faculties are ripe enough
for that purpose. In Baptism the Holy
Spirit communicates to us the Beginnings
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100709:54"/>
of a new life, which may afterwards be
improved to large measures of Virtue and
Goodness, if we be not wilfully wanting
to our selves in the other Means.</p>
               <p>And in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> as we renew
the Covenant we made in Baptism, <hi>to
renounce the Devil and all his works,</hi> &amp;c.
So all worthy Receivers of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
receive great additions of Grace
and Spiritual Strength, are fed with the
spiritual food of the most Precious Body
and Bloud of Christ.</p>
               <p>And of all the Means prescribed for the
Subduing our Lusts, and Growing in
Grace, the Frequent Receiving the
Lord's Supper is very deservedly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Principal. Certainly there is not
any Ordinance wherein sincere Souls do
so experiment the Communications of
the Holy Spirit, by which they are so
<hi>Strengthened with strength in their Souls.</hi>
Nor are there any such Strong and Sprite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Christians, any so confirmed and
rooted in Goodness, in the love of God
and their Neighbour, and all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Virtues, as those who take all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
to attend upon it, with a thankful
sense of the infinite love of God and
Christ to them, and sincerely design in so
doing a fuller participation of the Divine
nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100709:55"/>But this intimation that these two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
are conveyances of Grace and
Strength leads me to shew, that,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Our Saviour hath moreover
purchased for us a rich supply of Grace,
to enable us to use the forementioned
<hi>Means</hi> with happy success. He hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from his Father by his Perfect
Obedience, both Active and Passive,
Authority to send the Holy Ghost pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
to assist us; and hath assured us
that those who ask him shall have him,
in those most excellent, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
words, <hi>Luke 11. 11, 12, 13. If a
Son shall ask bread of any that is a Father,
will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish,
will he for a fish give him a Serpent? Or if
he shall ask an Egge, will he offer him a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion?
If ye then being evil, know how to
give good gifts unto your Children, how
much more shall your Heavenly Father give
his holy Spirit unto them that ask him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any of us want the Holy Spirit's
Assistance, it is certainly because we
either pray not at all for it, or not with a
sincere and earnest desire that he should
root up and destroy every Evil Affection
in our Souls; Because we are secretly
unwilling to let go some beloved lust or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100709:55"/>
other; And because we are false to God
and our own Souls in those things which
he hath put into our Power. For 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that not to put forth the power we
have already received, and yet complain
for want of strength, is to play the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crities;
and no wonder if the Holy Spirit
of God doth estrange himself, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
or withdraw his blessed Influences
from such persons.</p>
               <p>But as for those who are faithful so far
as those Talents reach, which they are
at present intrusted with, our Lord hath
promised <hi>them</hi> that more shall be given
them. That is the meaning of those
words, <hi>Mark 4. 25. He that hath, to him
shall be given:</hi> That is, that <hi>useth</hi> what
he hath; for no man properly <hi>hath</hi> or
<hi>possesseth</hi> what he makes no use of, 'twould
be the same thing to him to be without
it.</p>
               <p>Nay, our Lord doth not only promise
to him that <hi>hath,</hi> that <hi>more</hi> shall be given
him, but also that he shall have <hi>abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
more, <hi>Matth. 13. 12. For whosoever hath,
to him shall be given, and he shall have
more abundance:</hi> And he repeats this,
Chap. 25. 29.</p>
               <p>And if we were not through wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and carelesness wanting to our selves,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100709:56"/>
in putting forth that measure of strength
we <hi>have,</hi> as sure as <hi>Iesus</hi> is the Christ we
should fully experiment the truth of this
promise: We should <hi>then</hi> feel the Divine
Spirit <hi>working in us mightily,</hi> as the
Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>he</hi> did, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 29.</p>
               <p>The great things that are spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of what he shall
do in the hearts of men, would be <hi>then</hi>
punctually fulfilled in us, and we should
be satisfied by happy experience, that
they are not mere words; the Holy
Ghost would not fail to do all that for us,
he was sent by our Lord to do.</p>
               <p>It is to be acknowledged with great
sadness, that both <hi>Fleshly</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi>
Lusts are exceedingly strong and vigorous
even in the generality of those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<hi>Christianity,</hi> as well as in <hi>others,</hi> and
no <hi>less</hi> than in others, that are Strangers
to our Religion: But this never to be
enough lamented Evil doth not proceed
from hence, that grace is <hi>denied</hi> to the
generality, but 'tis wholly to be imputed
to their <hi>Receiving the grace of God in vain,</hi>
and wilfully refusing to <hi>comply</hi> therewith.
It is not at all to be ascribed to the Spirits
refusing to perform <hi>his</hi> Office in them, or
to do in their behalf what doth belong to
<hi>him,</hi> but to their refusing to do <hi>their</hi> part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:100709:56"/>
This we are as fully assured of from abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Texts of Scripture as we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be.</p>
               <p>The same is to be said of mens so ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
falling again and again into those
sins which they frequently <hi>Pray</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve</hi>
and <hi>Vow</hi> against: <hi>This</hi> is far from
being the account of it, that God is not
willing to hear their prayers; For (as
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks, 1 Epist. 5. 14.) <hi>This is
the confidence that we have in him, that if
we ask any thing according to his will, he
heareth us;</hi> and to ask victory over our
Lusts is of all Petitions most agreeable to
his will. <hi>This</hi> cannot be the reason of it,
that the Holy Spirit refuseth to inforce
his Preventing (or Prevenient) with his
Assisting Grace, that he will not assist
some persons in the performance of those
good Resolutions which his Preventing
Grace hath excited in their Souls. But
<hi>this</hi> is the true account hereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Such
Persons are undoubtedly wanting in the
use of some Necessary Means or other
for the subduing their Lusts; they do
not use <hi>all</hi> the means our Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and are especially faulty in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
particularly the great duty of
<hi>Consideration,</hi> They pray, it may be,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100709:57"/>
very frequently and <hi>earnestly</hi> too, that
God would give them strength against
this or that Corruption, and they add
<hi>Vows</hi> to their Prayers, but they add not
<hi>Consideration</hi> to their Prayers and Vows,
they watch not over themselves, disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the first motions of their Wills, and
inclinations of their Souls towards the
sins or sin they so Pray, Resolve and Vow
against, and are not careful to avoid
Temptations.</p>
               <p>And as inconsideration is the chiefest
cause of unsuccessfulness in the use of
means for the subduing of Corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
so the gross neglect of that
grand Means <hi>the Lords Supper,</hi> but now
discoursed of (which I hope in no Age,
nor among any people professing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
was ever so common, as to our
great shame it is in <hi>this</hi> Age and <hi>this</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
this gross neglect, I say, is questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless
a very great cause of so much Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proficiency
in attendance on other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
as is complained of. Which
Nonproficiency may <hi>well</hi> be, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Promises of the plentiful
Effusion of the Spirit, and our Saviour's
purchasing so rich a supply of Grace for
us. For our Saviour is no such Friend to
Negligence and Carelesness, as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100709:57"/>
his Grace in such a way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as that it must necessarily be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and encouragement to do <hi>nothing,</hi> or
but <hi>little</hi> our selves: But on the contrary,
he so communicates his Grace and
Strength, as to make it a great Exciter
and Quickner of Endeavours. Of this
S. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us, in making <hi>God's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in us to will and to do,</hi> or his <hi>readiness</hi>
so to do, an argument to perswade us <hi>to
work out our own salvation with fear and
trembling,</hi> Phil. 2. 12.</p>
               <p>Lastly, As our Saviour hath purchased
for us a rich supply of Grace for the Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
us to use the <hi>Means</hi> of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
with happy success, so he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us the most powerful <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
that can be imagined, to prevail
upon our <hi>Wills</hi> to comply and cooperate
with this Grace.</p>
               <p>And these Arguments are not only
proposed <hi>outwardly</hi> to us in his Gospel,
but they are also inforced <hi>inwardly</hi> upon
our hearts (as appears by what hath been
now said) by his Holy Spirit. That is,
they are inforced upon the hearts of all
those who will take the pains seriously to
<hi>consider</hi> them. To which <hi>consideration</hi>
likewise the Spirit fails not to Excite
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100709:58"/>
men, till by long Grieving him, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
frequent rejecting his good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Motions
and Suggestions, he is, as it were, <hi>forced</hi>
to desist, and depart from them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Wherein is discoursed the First of those Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Arguments which are offered in
the Gospel, to perswade us to use the Means
prescribed for our deliverance from the
Power of Sin. Namely, The love of God
in sending his Son upon the errand of our
Redemption. And two most powerful
Motives implied in this.</head>
               <p>NOW the chiefest of those Motives
and Arguments are these that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>First, The unconceivable Love of God
expressed in sending his only and Eternal
begotten Son, ultimately upon this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
of Redeeming us from the Power of
Sin: And the never to be sufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
Love of Christ, in so readily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our Nature upon him, condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to such extremely low circumstances
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100709:58"/>
here in the World, and at last submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to so Vile and Ignominious, so Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
and Tormenting a Death, and all this,
<hi>ultimately</hi> I say, for this very End, that
of Sins and Satans Slaves we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>his</hi> and his <hi>Fathers</hi> Free Subjects;
<hi>For he died, the just for the unjust, that he
might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18.</p>
               <p>Here we have a two-fold most exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and wonderfully powerful motive to
comply most heartily with the Method
our Saviour hath taken for the setting us
free.</p>
               <p>First, God's sending his own Son to be
a Sacrifice for our Sins, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
of which he would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Terms of Reconciliation to Sinners,
sheweth his infinite <hi>hatred of Sin,</hi> and
consequently, that it is a most deadly
Evil, and hath excessive Malignity in it.
This is expressed in the most Emphatical
manner by our Saviour's shedding his
most precious Bloud upon the Cross for
the expiating of it.</p>
               <p>And can we have a more constraining
Motive to do our utmost to be delivered
from the Dominion of Sin, than <hi>this,</hi>
that it is <hi>thus</hi> demonstrated to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
Evil?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:100709:59"/>It hath been shewed, that the Death
of Christ was designed to set us free from
the <hi>Power</hi> as well as <hi>Punishment</hi> of Sin,
and it is apt to effect that end, <hi>partly</hi> as
its extreme <hi>hatefulness</hi> is thereby discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and made manifest. By this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for Sin, is it <hi>condemned in the flesh,</hi> as
the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as the Vilest and most Intolerable
thing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>immediate</hi> end of Christs suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
was to make <hi>Atonement</hi> for Sin, but
<hi>this</hi> way of Atonement is a means, a most
<hi>effectual</hi> means, to this farther End, the
making us out of love with Sin, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
us to Abandon it as the worst of
all Evils. Of which, I say, we cannot
desire greater evidence than <hi>this,</hi> that no
meaner Sacrifice might be accepted for
the making expiation for Sin, than that
of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is as wonderful an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the <hi>Divine love to Sinners,</hi> as
of the Divine displeasure against <hi>Sin.
God commendeth his love towards us, in that
when we were yet Sinners Christ died for us,
Rom.</hi> 5. 8. And herein did he commend
his love in the most wonderful manner
that it was possible to commend it. He
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100709:59"/>
shewed <hi>the exceeding riches of his grace, in
his Kindness towards us through Iesus
Christ,</hi> as we read <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
               <p>Was that an <hi>ordinary</hi> Love in God the
<hi>Father</hi> think we, that moved him to send
no less a person upon the business of our
Redemption, than him who was the
<hi>Brightness of his own Glory,</hi> and the <hi>express
Image of his Person, by whom also he made
the Worlds?</hi> Was that an <hi>Ordinary</hi> Love
in God the <hi>Son,</hi> that prevailed with him
to take the Humane nature, and to
humble himself in that Astonishing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and to undergo such direful Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for our sake? Or was it not such a
Love as <hi>passeth knowledge?</hi> So S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith
it was, and it can be no less. This is
such a love <hi>indeed,</hi> as is rather to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
Admired, than much discoursed
of.</p>
               <p>How hard must needs be that heart
which will not be broken by the force of
such love as <hi>this!</hi> Nothing can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
to be of such irresistible power over
Persons not forsaken of all ingenuity,
as the consideration of this Love.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Other</hi> way whereby the
Death of Christ was designed for the
Destroying of Sin. And in respect of <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of these ways, but much more of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100709:60"/>
                  <hi>both,</hi> our Saviour had good ground for
the uttering those words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 32.
<hi>When I am lifted up from the Earth, I shall
draw all men unto me:</hi> He spake of his
<hi>dying on the Cross</hi> for Mankind, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>This he said signifying what-death he
should die.</hi> And he here supposeth this
his Death to contain such Forcible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to perswade men to cast off the
Drudgery of sin, and exchange it for his
Free service, that it must necessarily be
happily successful to this End, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is seriously thought on, and laid
to heart.</p>

               <p>BY the way: It is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100709:60"/>
his share in this Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and that the Redemption designed
by the Death of Christ is Universal.</p>
               <p>For if each individual Person cannot be
assured that he is <hi>his</hi> Saviour, and that he
died for <hi>him;</hi> if he died not for <hi>all,</hi> nay,
but for a <hi>few</hi> comparatively (as those say
who deny that he died for all) then what
influence can the consideration of his
Death have upon the Wills of men?
Surely the <hi>weakest</hi> influence that can be,
if <hi>any</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>Indeed how it can rationally have <hi>any,</hi>
seems unintelligible, since those who
assert that Christ died but for a few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively,
assert also that those few shall
be infallibly at one time or other drawn
to him, and Christ will not lose any one
of them.</p>
               <p>If this be so, what inducement can we
have either from the Death of Christ,
or any other Consideration, to concern
our selves at all about leaving our Sins,
and using the means prescribed for our
deliverance from the power of them?
For if it so happen that I am one of those
few for whom Christ died, what need is
there of my being concerned about that
which is so effectually secured? What is
this but to take Christ's work out of his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100709:61"/>
hand? But if Christ died <hi>not</hi> for me (as
'tis very many to one he did not, if he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for so few) then all my care is to no
purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I say, if every one of us cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Christ died for</hi> him, <hi>and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
for</hi> all, <hi>what motive to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can his Death be to us? And if he
died but for</hi> some, <hi>and those some but a
very small number compared with those
for whom he did</hi> not <hi>die, and those for
whom he died shall be undoubtedly saved,
and those for whom he died</hi> not <hi>shall be
undoubtedly damned, then I cannot see
how the wisest man on Earth can answer
this Plea of a wicked man for persisting
impenitently in his wickedness,</hi> viz. If
Christ died for me I shall be saved, and he
will most assuredly at his own time, which to
be sure is the best, bring me over to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of his Precepts by his Omnipotent
grace, if that be necessary, in order to my
Salvation: But if he died not for me, then
let me do what I can, it will signifie nothing,
my state is unalterable. So that I run no
hazard in being careless and neglectful of the
concerns of my Soul, on supposition of my
having an interest in the death of Christ;
nor is my case one jot the better for my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in using the means of Salvation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100709:61"/>
to my power, on supposition of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Now how can we think, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
doth contain such mighty Arguments
to perswade us <hi>to work out our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
whilest it leaves us utterly unable
to answer <hi>this</hi> Plea, that Careless People
may, and <hi>do</hi> many of them, make for
their Carelesness? And therefore it
highly concerns us to beware of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which makes Christ to die but
for some Certain Persons, as not only
most <hi>false,</hi> but as very <hi>dangerous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, <hi>this</hi> Doctrine could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gain any considerable Credit, in any
Church in the World, for the first fifteen
hundred years: 'Twas broached (with
the other concomitant Doctrines) by one
<hi>Lucidus</hi> a Presbyter in <hi>France,</hi> about the
year of our Lord 500, of which the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
Heresie was the occasion, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemned by two <hi>Councils,</hi> one at
<hi>Arles,</hi> the other at <hi>Lions.</hi> About 300
years after, it was (with the other) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
by <hi>Godscalcus,</hi> a person of ill Fame,
but condemned again by a Council at
<hi>Mentz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Doctrine we are defending
was Asserted, as a Point never doubted
of, by the Fathers of the first 300 years:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100709:62"/>
And is as expresly Asserted in the most
Ancient Confessions of the Reformed
Churches beyond Sea, and also in the
<hi>Articles, Homilies</hi> and <hi>Catechism</hi> of our
<hi>own</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>And those <hi>three</hi> Holy Martyrs, Arch-Bishop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> and
Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> (who will be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our Adversaries in this Point, to
be most Orthodox men) have as plainly
and fully given their testimony thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
as we can desire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> Cranmer, <hi>in the Preface
to his Book against</hi> Gardiner <hi>hath these
words, that</hi> Christ made a Sacrifice and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of his body upon the Cross, which was a
full Redemption, Satisfaction and Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the Sins of the whole World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bishop</hi> Latimer, <hi>in his Sermon on the
first Sunday after the Epiphany, tells us,
that</hi> Iesus is an Hebrew word, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
in our English Tongue, a Saviour and
Redeemer of all Mankind born into the
World.</p>
               <p>And he hath this passage in his Sermon
on the Gospel for the twenty first Sunday
after Trinity, <hi>P.</hi> 2. of <hi>Fol.</hi> 208. which
would be horribly offensive to many now|
adays, <hi>viz. That Christ shed as much bloud
for</hi> Judas, <hi>as he did for</hi> Peter; Peter <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100709:62"/>
it and therefore was saved,</hi> Judas
<hi>would not believe, and therefore he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
the fault being in</hi> him <hi>only, and
in no body else.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bishop</hi> Hooper, <hi>in his Preface to his
Exposition of the Ten Commandments,
saith,</hi> That as the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> without
priviledge or exemption, extended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
unto all and every of <hi>Adams</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity;
so did this promise of Grace gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
appertain as well to every and singular
of <hi>Adams</hi> posterity as to <hi>Adam:</hi> As it is
more plainly expressed, where God promiseth
to bless, in the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> all the
people of the World.</p>
               <p>And that these Good men did not hold
Contradictions, but, as they undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
believed that Christ died for all, so
they also rejected that Doctrine of the
Divine Decrees which is inconsistent
therewith, is plain from the following
passages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bishop</hi> Latimer <hi>saith, in his Fourth
Sermon on the Third Sunday after the
Epiphany,</hi> That if the most part be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the fault is not in God, but in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for, <hi>Deus vult omnes homines
salvos fieri,</hi> God would that all men should
be saved, but they themselves procure their
own damnation, and despise the Passion of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100709:63"/>
Christ by their own wicked and inordinate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
Here we may learn to keep us from
all curious and dangerous Questions; when
we hear that some be chosen and some be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
Let us have good hope that we shall be
among the chosen, and live after this hope,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Think that God hath chosen those that
believe in Christ, and that Christ is the
Book of life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So we need not to go
about to trouble our selves with curious questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Predestination of God. But let
us rather endeavour our selves that we may
be in Christ, for when we be in him, then are
we well, and then we may be sure that we are
ordained to everlasting life. But you will
say, how shall I know that I am in the Book
of life? How shall I try my self to be elect of
God to everlasting life? I answer, First we
may know, that we may one time be in the
book, and another time come out again, as it
appeareth by <hi>David. See more that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
to the same purpose,</hi> Fol. 310.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, in his Sermon on</hi> Septuag. Fol.
214. <hi>saith he,</hi> God's Salvation is sufficient
to save all Mankind; But we are so wicked
of our selves, that we refuse the same, and
we will not take it when 'tis offered to us, and
therefore he saith, <hi>Pauci verò electi, Few
are chosen;</hi> that is, few have pleasure and
delight in it, for the most part are weary of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100709:63"/>
it, cannot abide it; for there are some that
hear it, but they will abide no danger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Such men are cause of their own Damnation;
for God would have them saved, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it: like <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitor, whom
Christ would have had to be saved, but he
refused his Salvation, he refused to follow
the Doctrine of his Master Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Bishop</hi> Hooper <hi>is very full and
particular to this purpose in his forecited</hi>
Preface. <hi>Saith he, Cain</hi> was no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the promise of Christ, till he
excluded himself, than <hi>Abel; Saul</hi> than
<hi>David; Judas</hi> than <hi>Peter; Esau</hi> than
<hi>Jacob:</hi> Concerning which two Brethren, in
the sentence of God given to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> there
was no mention at all, that <hi>Esau</hi> should be
disinherited of Eternal Life, but that he
should be inferior to his Brother <hi>Jacob</hi> in
<hi>this</hi> world, which Prophecy was fulfilled in
their <hi>Posterity,</hi> and not the <hi>Persons</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
God is said by the Prophet to have
hated <hi>Esau,</hi> not because he was disinherited
of Eternal Life, but in laying his mountains
and his heritage waste for the Dragons of
the Wilderness, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 3. That Threatning
of God against <hi>Esau</hi> (if he had not of wilful
malice excluded himself from the Promise of
Grace) should no more have hindred his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
than God's Threatning against <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh:</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:100709:64"/>
The cause of Rejection or Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is Sin in man, which will not hear, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
receive the promise of the Gospel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
It is not a Christian man's part to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
his Salvation to his own <hi>Free-will,</hi>
with the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and extenuate Original
Sin, nor to make God the Author of ill and
damnation, with the <hi>Manichee;</hi> nor yet to
say, that God hath written Fatal Laws, and
with necessity of Destiny, violently pulleth
the one by the hair into Heaven, and thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the other head-long into Hell.</p>
               <p>I have thus at large transcribed the
words of these two Holy Bishops and
Martyrs for the Reformed Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Books are not easie to be met
with, and Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi>'s not to be light
on without great difficulty. And, I say,
by these Citations (to which we might
have added others) it is very apparent,
not only that they undoubtedly believed
the Doctrine of <hi>Christ's dying for all men,</hi>
(and were zealous Assertors of it too)
but also, that they rejected that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Fatal Decrees, which is the
Foundation of the contrary Opinion.</p>
               <p>I cannot but take notice, by the way,
how Unreasonable and Uncharitable
those men are, who clamour at such a
rate against their Brethren, as Innovators
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100709:64"/>
and Apostates from the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
for their asserting no worse Doctrine,
than we have now seen was heartily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by these Ancient and Eminent
Fathers of our Church. The Doctrine of
which Church, I presume, they'l have the
Modesty to acknowledge, they were as fit
judges of as <hi>themselves.</hi> But I must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
to that which is much more to our
present purpose; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That no Doctrine is more clearly or
fully asserted in the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> than
this of <hi>Vniversal Redemption.</hi> And that
there may remain no longer the least
doubt or scruple in any of our breasts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, let us take notice of these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
particulars.</p>
               <p>First, How those that have a share in
Christ's Redemption are <hi>expressed</hi> by our
Saviour and his Apostles. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the words SINNERS in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely,
the WORLD, ALL,
the WHOLE WORLD, EVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY
MAN. And can the Wisdom of
man invent more plain, significant and
full words, by which to express the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
of Mankind?</p>
               <p>1. Those whom Christ <hi>came,</hi> and <hi>died</hi>
to save, that is, to put into a Salvable
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100709:65"/>
state, so that it will be wholly long of
themselves if they perish, are expressed
by the word <hi>Sinners</hi> indefinitely. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 15. This is a faithful say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and worthy of all acceptation, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ came into the world to save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
of which I am chief.</hi> Now 'tis a
known Maxim, that <hi>An indefinite Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is equivalent to an Vniversal one.</hi>
And our Saviour himself saith, that <hi>He
came to call sinners to repentance,</hi> Luke 5.
32. <hi>And to seek and save that which was lost,</hi>
Chap. 19. 10. He makes no <hi>exception</hi> of
Sinners or Lost persons, and therefore
what can they be less than All Mankind?
But if this be not satisfactory,</p>
               <p>2. They are expressed by the word
<hi>World.</hi> Our Saviour saith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16,
17. <hi>God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish, but have everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life. For God sent not his Son into the
world to condemn the world, but that the
world through him might be saved.</hi> I could
not disparage any ones understanding
more, than by endeavouring to satisfie
him, that 'tis a most pitiful and senseless
shift, to say, that by the <hi>World</hi> is meant
all the <hi>Elect</hi> in the world, that is, some
exceeding few of the world in comparison
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100709:65"/>
of the rest. For, besides that this is to
make nonsence of the former Verse, as
must needs be obvious to every body, so
by taking the same Liberty in interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
other Texts, the Bible would be
made the most insignificant Book in the
world. The Generality of men is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
called the World, and Bad men
are sometimes so called in Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are the Generality; but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the incomparably lesser part of men
by the word <hi>World,</hi> is such a Figure as
was never heard of.</p>
               <p>3. They are expressed by the word <hi>All,</hi>
to put us more out of doubt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14,
15. <hi>The love of Christ constraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we thus judge, that if one died for all,
then were all dead, and that he died for all,
that they which live should not henceforth
live unto themselves, but unto him that died
for them, and rose again.</hi> Now did ever
the word <hi>All</hi> signifie a <hi>few?</hi> And that by
<hi>All</hi> is to be understood the Universality
is plain from the former of these Verses,
where the Apostle proves that <hi>all were
dead,</hi> or obnoxious to death, by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that <hi>Christ died for all.</hi> But we will
not question whether <hi>all</hi> in the largest
sence were obnoxious to death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>all</hi> must be understood in the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100709:66"/>
when it is said that <hi>Christ died for
all,</hi> or we shall make the Apostle a very
sad Arguer. For how could it follow
from hence, that Christ died for <hi>some,</hi>
that therefore <hi>all</hi> without exception were
dead?</p>
               <p>Again, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. we read that Christ
<hi>gave himself a Ransom for all:</hi> And ver. 4.
that <hi>He will have all to be saved, and come
to the knowledge</hi> (or Acknowledgment)
<hi>of the truth.</hi> And once more, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.
10. that <hi>He is the Saviour of all men, but
especially of those that believe:</hi> So that
those that <hi>believe</hi> are not the <hi>all</hi> he is the
Saviour of, the <hi>all</hi> being distinguished
from them. And the meaning of the
words is sufficiently obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> He is
so the Saviour of <hi>all,</hi> as to put them into
a capacity of Salvation, but he is so the
Saviour of those that <hi>believe,</hi> as that they
shall be <hi>actually</hi> saved. Those that so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as to <hi>obey</hi> the Gospel are at present in
a <hi>state</hi> of Salvation, and if they persevere
shall be undoubtedly saved.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Those whom Christ died for and
came to save (to make it still more out of
doubt if it be possible) are expressed by
the</hi> Whole World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6. If any man
sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,
Iesus Christ the Righteous, who is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100709:66"/>
for our sins, and not only for ours,
but also for the sins of the whole World.
<hi>Nay,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>They are expressed by</hi> Every man,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. But we see Iesus, who was made a
little (<hi>or for a little while</hi>) lower than the
Angels, for the suffering of death crowned
with glory and honour, that he by the grace
of God should taste death, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for
every man. <hi>And this is the fullest and
most Comprehensive Expression that can
be imagined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If after all these most express Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in such variety of the plainest
words, it shall still be asserted, that the
Doctrine of Universal Redemption is
Heretical or false, there needs no other
Reply but <hi>this:</hi> Let Christ be true and
his Holy Apostles, and everyman a Liar
that dares to contradict them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As our Saviour and his
Apostles do so express the Persons for
whom he died, as that they must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be the Universality of Mankind, so
we learn from <hi>S. Paul,</hi> that the Remedy
by <hi>Christ</hi> is of equal extent with the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
occasioned by <hi>Adam:</hi> That the Sore
is not so broad but the Plaister is every
whit as broad: <hi>Rom. 5. 18. Therefore as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100709:67"/>
by the offence of one judgment came upon all
men to condemnation, even so by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of one the free gift came upon all
men to justification of life.</hi> Can anything
be said plainer than <hi>this</hi> is, in these words,
<hi>viz.</hi> That as many as fell by the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of <hi>Adam,</hi> were designed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by the Righteousness of Christ?</p>
               <p>But it is Objected that it follows in the
19. ver. that, <hi>By the obedience of one shall</hi>
Many <hi>he made Righteous;</hi> As our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himself saith, <hi>This is the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in my bloud, which was shed for</hi> Many
<hi>for the Remission of Sins.</hi> But that this is
a Strange objection, will appear by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the <hi>latter</hi> part of that 19. ver. with
the <hi>former: For as by one mans disobedience</hi>
Many <hi>were made sinners.</hi> So that, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were put into a possibility of being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by the Righteousness of Christ
(and we do not desire that <hi>more</hi> should)
<hi>as were made Sinners</hi> (or made liable to
condemnation) by the Disobedience of
<hi>Adam.</hi> And by this means, the Reign of
Grace to Eternal life was designed to be
no more limited, than was the Reign of
Sin to death: As it follows in the 21. ver.
<hi>That as Sin hath reigned unto death, even so
might Grace reign through Righteousness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Eternal life, by Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:100709:67"/>
And it is not to be wondered at, that the
word <hi>Many</hi> should signifie <hi>All,</hi> for it is
well known, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Many,</hi> or <hi>the</hi>
Many, is used in other <hi>Greek</hi> Authors to
signifie <hi>all,</hi> as well as in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>So that these Texts do most necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and plainly speak <hi>thus</hi> much, That none
that hear the Gospel shall fall short of
Salvation, but through their Unbelief
and Disobedience, their wilful rejecting
the Remedy offered them: Nor any nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that never heard the Gospel, merely
for the Transgression of their first Parents,
but only for their <hi>own</hi> Sins, I mean, their
wilful disobedience to that light they
have.</p>
               <p>And that none to whom the Gospel is
preached are excluded from Salvation by
Christ, is manifestly implied in those
words of our Saviour, <hi>Iohn 3. 14. As</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness,
even so must the Son of man be lifted up,
that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> As the
Brazen Serpent was erected for the Cure
of all that were stung by the Fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
none excepted but such as would
not look up to it, for that end: So none
shall be shut out from the benefit designed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100709:68"/>
by the <hi>Son of man</hi>'s being lifted up upon
the Cross, but such as will not <hi>believe,</hi>
that is, apply themselves to him in that
way, which he hath appointed for the
obtaining of it.</p>
               <p>And though our Saviour saith, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.
of that Chapter, that <hi>This is the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that a light is come into the World:</hi>
Yet he immediately explains himself in
the following words, <hi>and men loved dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
rather than light, because their deeds are
evil.</hi> Or Mens being <hi>condemned</hi> by the
occasion of his coming is to be imputed
to their Rejecting him, and so refusing to
comply with the most reasonable terms
of his New Gracious Covenant, not to
<hi>his</hi> or his <hi>Father</hi>'s design in his Coming.
For he saith, <hi>Iohn 12. 47. I came not to
judge the World, but to save the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are assured that Christ
died even for those that perish. The
Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 11. If any man see
thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the
Idols Temple, shall not the Conscience of him
that is weak be imboldened to eat those things
which are offered to Idols, and through thy
knowledge shall the weak Brother perish, for
whom Christ died?</hi> Here it is supposed
that a man may perish, for whom Christ
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100709:68"/>
died: And consequently, that he died for
Reprobates themselves; that is, those
that have made <hi>themselves</hi> so, for if
Christ died for <hi>all,</hi> there can be no <hi>other</hi>
Reprobates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> Rom. 14. 15. Destroy not him
with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Author to the</hi> Hebrews expresly
<hi>preacheth this Doctrine, Chap.</hi> 10. 29.
Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,
shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden
under foot the Son of God, and hath counted
the bloud of the Covenant, wherewith he was
Sanctified (<hi>or Consecrated</hi>) an unholy
thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Peter <hi>likewise asserts the same,</hi> 2
<hi>Epist.</hi> 2. 1. But there were false Prophets al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
among the People, even as there will be
false Teachers among you, who privily will
bring in damnable Heresies, even denying
the Lord that bought them, and bring upon
themselves swift destruction. <hi>So that these
vile wretches were not destroyed because
Christ did not redeem them, for they are
said to be</hi> bought <hi>or redeemed by him as
well as</hi> others, <hi>but they</hi> brought upon
<hi>themselves</hi> swift destruction.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If this Doctrine be false, that
Christ died for all, then none are or can
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100709:69"/>
be condemned for not <hi>Believing</hi> in him,
notwithstanding that the condemnation
of men is so continually ascribed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
For 'tis a plain case, that those for
whom Christ did not die, can be no more
obliged to believe in him, than the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
are. And to say that any are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for not doing that which it was
not their <hi>duty</hi> to do, will, I hope, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the grossest absurdity.</p>
               <p>This <hi>little</hi> in comparison of what might
be said, to demonstrate the truth of this
Great Article of our Faith, is much more
than barely sufficient to give us an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
assurance of it. The truth is,
the <hi>Sun</hi> doth not shine more bright in the
Firmament, than doth this Doctrine in
the New Testament: And I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
we can be assured of upon Scripture
Authority, if this be False or Uncertain.
I verily believe that there are few of the
Greatest Points of our Christian Faith,
but may as plausibly be objected against
as this Doctrine, from <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis said indeed by our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi>
10. 5. <hi>I lay down my life for my sheep:</hi> But
did he ever say, <hi>I lay down my life for</hi> none
<hi>but my sheep?</hi> If he had, we must have
concluded, either that the whole World
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100709:69"/>
are his Sheep, or that which is far worse,
that he said and unsaid, and contradicted
himself, and so destroyed the Foundation
of our Faith and Hope. But in saying
<hi>He laid down his life for his sheep,</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was, that those who obeyed his voice
should receive the benefit of his death;
and such Sheep he would have <hi>all</hi> to be.
For (as we have seen in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4.) <hi>He
would have all men to be saved, and to come
to the acknowledgment of the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again our Saviour saith, that <hi>He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not for the World, Iohn</hi> 17. 9. From
whence some would infer, that surely he
would not shed his Precious bloud for
those on whom he would not vouchsafe
to bestow a Prayer. But 'tis apparent his
meaning was, that at <hi>that</hi> time he pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
prayed for his Disciples: They <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
(as appears by the Context) are
meant, by <hi>those that his Father had given
him out of the World.</hi> But afterwards,
<hi>ver.</hi> 20. He proceeds to pray <hi>for all that
should believe on him through their word:</hi>
And at his death, he prayed for his very
Crucifiers. And that he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to pray for the <hi>World,</hi> is apparent
from <hi>ver.</hi> 21. where he prayeth that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
might be one in him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for this reason, <hi>That the World may
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100709:70"/>
believe that He had sent him:</hi> or might be
converted to the Faith of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>These two Objections, as weak as they
are, are the chief ones that are taken out
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> against the most Ancient
and Catholick Doctrine we have been
asserting.</p>
               <p>But I must needs say, I have often
wondred at <hi>their</hi> Boldness, who have
used their utmost endeavours to run down
a Doctrine, that not only for so many
Ages together hath stood unshaken, but
is also so Abundantly, and in the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
manner imaginable asserted by Truth
it self, and those who were <hi>Guided into all
truth:</hi> And how they are able <hi>not</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
how grosly they wrest the Holy
Scriptures; so that, if they should use
the same Artifice in interpreting all <hi>other</hi>
Texts, they would make the Bible to
look like a thing that is contrived for the
service of every Humour and every Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and for both the proving and dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
every thing.</p>
               <p>Certainly, if we should take the same
liberty in understanding our <hi>own</hi> and <hi>other</hi>
mens sayings, that <hi>they</hi> take in Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>forementioned</hi> and the <hi>like</hi> sayings
of our Blessed Saviour and his Apostles,
<hi>Speech</hi> would signifie nothing, nay, be of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100709:70"/>
very pernicious consequence, and serve
only to abuse and put tricks upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If so many <hi>plain</hi> Texts as can be, to all
Appearance, should require so much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and pains to be rightly understood,
'twill be impossible to defend the Holy
Scriptures from that Obscurity which the
Papists most injuriously charge them
with; and to preserve the Bible from
that Contempt, which (the higher to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Authority of Holy Church)
it suffers from their prophane Tongues
and Pens, and wicked Practices.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of <hi>Vniversal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
being so strongly fortified,
could never have been assaulted, were it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
with that of <hi>Absolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
either in the <hi>Supra</hi> or <hi>Sublapsarian</hi>
way (as it is impossible it should be)
which the too great Admirers of the
otherwise very judicious and pious <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi>
are so exceedingly tenacious and
fond of. But 'tis much to be wondred
at, what these men should see in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(which is so severe in it self, and
horrid in its necessary Consequences)
that they should be contented to buy it at
so dear a Rate, as the Parting with that
other most Comfortable Doctrine. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100709:71"/>
since this hath no Antiquity to
commend it, and is not so much as <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi>
befriended, but by a very few Texts
of Scripture, and those very fairly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of quite another sence, than at first
sight may seem to belong to them; but is
contradicted by innumerable plain Texts,
and the concurrent strain both of the
New and <hi>Old</hi> Testament.</p>
               <p>But I must not forget that this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is a Digression from our Main Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
And I have thus long insisted upon
this Argument, that the great Motives
contained in the Death of Christ to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
the Slavery of Sin for his Free
service might have their full weight and
cogency: which would be in danger,
not only of being weakned, but even
quite lost, by limiting the Design of
Christ's Death to some particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
where the Consequences of such a
Limitation are apprehended.</p>
               <p>And I appeal to every Considerative
Person, whether it be not a mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Encouragement to the engaging
all the powers of our Souls in this great
work of using the Means prescribed for
the subduing our Lusts, to be assured that
every individual person of us is one of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100709:71"/>
those, for whom Christ gave himself to
<hi>redeem them from all iniquity.</hi>

               <p>HAving presented you with the <hi>First</hi>
powerful Motive to diligence, in

that Motive its full force and strength: I
proceed to shew, that</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another singular Motive is
our Saviour's <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we are by his Example <hi>Directed</hi> in
the several parts of our Duty, as hath
been shewed; And as the frequent Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof is a <hi>Means</hi> (as hath been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated)
whereby we may be more and

is it to be considered as a Wonderfully
Exciting <hi>Motive</hi> to comply with those
Rules of Righteousness and Goodness,
which we have naturally the <hi>greatest</hi>
Aversation of Will towards.</p>
               <p>As particularly, <hi>those</hi> which oblige us
to the Meek bearing of Indignities, the
Forgiving the greatest and most Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Injuries, the Loving our Enemies;
whereby we shall be set free from the
Cruel Tyrants of Revenge and Malice.

of his Providence; and Contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with a mean Fortune, and low Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
in the World; which will
free us from the inslaving Passions of
Pride, Anger, immoderate Grief, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we consider with what Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Evenness of Mind, this Great
Prince of the Kings of the Earth <hi>indured
the Contradiction of Sinners against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
How, <hi>when he was reviled, he revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
not again, when he suffered he threatned
not, but committed himself to him who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
righteously:</hi> When we consider with
what strange Sedateness of Spirit he bore
the Mockings, Buffettings, and most
Contumelious and insolent Behaviour of
vile Creatures towards himself: It is
then hardly <hi>Possible</hi> that <hi>We</hi> despicable
Worms should Rage and be inflamed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of such Disgrace, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and ill usage from Rude People,
as is not to be compared with that which
He underwent.</p>
               <p>When we consider how our Blessed
Saviour <hi>Forgave</hi> those who Thirsted after
his Bloud, and were never satisfied till
they had put him to the most shameful
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100709:73"/>
and most cruel Death; and not only For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
them <hi>himself,</hi> but Entreated his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that even in the <hi>midst</hi> of his
Torments (when his Spirit one would
think should be <hi>most</hi> highly exasperated)
to forgive them too: I say, when we
consider <hi>this,</hi> how can it be difficult to
disswade our selves from Meditating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
upon any Provocations whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?
Surely we must needs be very
powerfully inclined to forgive <hi>our</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>When we call to mind how He exprest
his love to his very Murderers, even <hi>so</hi>
as to design the greatest <hi>good</hi> to <hi>them</hi> by
the means of that, whereby they design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the greatest <hi>evil</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> can <hi>we</hi> be
averse to the bearing Good will to those
who are ill affected towards us, to the
<hi>Blessing</hi> of those that <hi>Curse</hi> us, and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for</hi> those that <hi>despightfully use</hi> us?</p>
               <p>When we consider how this Mighty
Person humbled himself, even to the
washing his Disciples <hi>Feet,</hi> and declared
that <hi>He came not to be ministred unto, but
to minister,</hi> can <hi>We</hi> contemptible Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
cherish the least spark of Pride in our
Souls? Can <hi>We</hi> despise the meanest of
our Fellow-creatures, or think our selves
too Great or too Good to condescend to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100709:73"/>
the <hi>lowest</hi> Offices of Love whereby we
may serve our Brethren?</p>
               <p>When we consider with what submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Divine Will our Blessed Lord
indured the most exquisite Pains both of
Soul and Body, though He never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
them by the least offence, but was
always most perfectly obedient to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
can this be other than a most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
motive to <hi>us,</hi> who have Merited so
<hi>ill</hi> at the Hands of God, quietly to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to his good Pleasure in Afflicting us,
whenas in so doing he doth always pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
us far <hi>less</hi> than our iniquities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve?</p>
               <p>When we consider how well satisfied
our Saviour was to be in poor low Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and not to have so much as
<hi>a Cottage</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> to put his Head in,
though he was <hi>Lord of all:</hi> Is it imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that <hi>We</hi> should aspire at High and
Great things, and having Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not be Content, who are <hi>less than
the least of all God's mercies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, Will not the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Saviour's being such a <hi>Man of
sorrows,</hi> and so <hi>acquainted with griefs,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
deaden <hi>our</hi> desires after Sensual
Pleasures? Surely it must <hi>necessarily</hi> so
do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:100709:74"/>Thus we see how greatly exciting the
<hi>Example</hi> of our Saviour is to the perfect
Mortifying of those Lusts which are most
strong and vigorous, to the loathing and
abominating those, which are naturally
very dear to us, and to the most restless
endeavours, to get our Souls possessed of
those Virtues and Graces which are most
supernatural.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another very prevalent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is, the Assurance our Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us, that He will not take such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of our Frailties and Weaknesses,
or Sins we fall into by mere surprize and
want of due Watchfulness, as to cast us
off for them; so long as we <hi>allow</hi> not our
selves in any evil way, and it is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
design of our lives, to be conformed
in all things to the Laws of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>There is a Prophecy concerning the
<hi>Messiah, Isaiah</hi> 42. 3. which our Saviour
applieth to himself, <hi>Matth. 12. 20. A brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
reed shall he not break, and smoaking flax
shall he not quench,</hi> &amp;c. He will not
crush under foot those who fall through
weakness, but whatsoever good he seeth
in them, he will still cherish. <hi>My little
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100709:74"/>
children</hi> (saith S. <hi>Iohn) these things I write
unto you, that ye sin not:</hi> But what if,
through the weakness of their Flesh, they
should at any time be overtaken, is their
state then desperate? No, by no means,
for it follows, And <hi>if any man sin, we have
an Advocate with the Father Iesus Christ the
Righteous,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Epist. 2. 1.</p>
               <p>As there are Sins unto Death, so there
are Sins <hi>not</hi> unto Death, according to
that of the same Apostle, 1 Epist. 5. 17.
<hi>All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin
not unto death.</hi> Though all Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be sin, and the deserved wages of
sin be Death, yet such is the Goodness of
God through Christ, that all Sins shall
not be unto Death, but only Wilful and
Presumptuous Sins. And I add, not
<hi>these</hi> neither, if not persevered in, but
throughly <hi>forsaken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we were liable to Eternal Ruine for
such Faults, as considering all our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
in this state, it is scarcely to
be hoped we shall constantly avoid, we
should necessarily live in great Bondage,
through continual fear, anxiety and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
thoughtfulness: But on the
other hand, it conduceth exceedingly to
the chearful pursuing our Great Work,
to be satisfied that it is not every Failure
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100709:75"/>
that shall endanger our final miscarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>And it is no small inducement to inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Tempers, to be so much the more
solicitous to avoid Deliberate and Wilful
sins, because God through Christ is so
ready to forgive, and graciously pass by
those that are <hi>not</hi> such: Because he is
pleased in his infinite Goodness to grant a
pardon of course for these, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their being in the <hi>general</hi> and <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals</hi>
repented of. And it is a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
also to <hi>such</hi> Tempers, to be the more
vigilant and watchful against all sins
whatsoever; against sins of daily incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and infirmity, as well as those which
waste the Conscience. And those are
very ill natured and obdurate Sinners,
who can find in their hearts to Encourage
themselves by this indulgence to sin the
more freely.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another wonderful Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to the careful use of the Means,
we are directed to for the subduing of
our Lusts, is our Saviours <hi>Mediation</hi> and
<hi>Intercession. There is one God and one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
between God and men, the man Christ
Iesus.</hi> His oblation was <hi>begun</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi>
but <hi>perfected</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> where <hi>He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100709:75"/>
in the presence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.
24.</p>
               <p>Those Prayers we put up in <hi>His</hi> name,
for things Agreeable to the Divine Will,
with honest and sincere hearts, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
inforceth with his own <hi>Intercession.
He ever lives to make intercession for us,
Heb.</hi> 7. 25. And for <hi>this</hi> reason (as the
Apostle saith in the former part of that
Verse) <hi>He is able to save them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
that come unto God by him:</hi> That is,
to give them a full and complete Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the Slavery of sin, and all the
evil Consequents thereof.</p>
               <p>Now we know that we ask what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Will of God, when we
pray for his Grace to Mortifie our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and to set us more and more
Free from their Dominion: <hi>This is the
Will of God, even our Sanctification,</hi> &amp;c.
1 Thess. 4. 3.</p>
               <p>There are many Temporal good
things, which God in his infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
may see not to be good for <hi>us;</hi> but
He knows that whatsoever hath a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
influence into our <hi>Soul</hi>'s welfare,
and the making us partakers of his own
image and likeness, can by no Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
whatsoever become unfit to be
bestowed on those that heartily and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100709:76"/>
seek it. And therefore we are
assured that those prayers that are put up
for <hi>such</hi> things, <hi>with a true heart and full
assurance of faith</hi> in his Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
are seconded in Heaven by our
Blessed Lord: And him <hi>the Father hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
always,</hi> John 11. 42.</p>
               <p>We have shewed that our Saviour
hath purchased a Rich supply of Grace to
help our Weakness, and that his Holy
Spirit is promised to those that ask him;
who will not fail to assist them, whilest
they carefully exert that power they are
already in possession of: But the most
Honest Souls have so frequent experience
of Heaviness, Dulness and Distractions
in their Addresses to God, that they
would be in great danger of despairing of
the <hi>Success</hi> of their Prayers, but for <hi>this</hi>
Consideration, that they have a no Less
Friend in Heaven, than the Only Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son of God; who is most powerful
with his Father, and supplies all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of <hi>their</hi> Prayers by his own Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in their behalf.</p>
               <p>I need not say, what a marvellous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
this is of our Faith and
Hope in the Divine Goodness; which are
so necessary to Animate us, and to put
Spirit and Life into all our Endeavours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:100709:76"/>And the Mediation and Intercession of
our Blessed Saviour conduceth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the overcoming those inslaving Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of <hi>Fearfulness</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> which
arise from Guilt; and do naturally cause
a great Averseness in Sinners from going
into the Presence of God, and disable
them, when they are there, to behave
themselves as they ought before him.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that <hi>In Christ
Iesus they have boldness and access with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
by the faith of him.</hi> That is,
through Christ's Mediation those Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Gentiles (of whose Calling he was
discoursing) as great Sinners as they had
been, even <hi>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</hi>
have liberty of Approach to God, with
Confidence of a kind Reception and a
Gracious Acceptance.</p>
               <p>And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap.
10. 19, &amp;c. doth <hi>thus</hi> encourage <hi>Sincere
Souls to draw near to God. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Brethren, boldness</hi> (or Liberty,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>to enter into the holiest by the
bloud of Iesus, by a new and living way,
which he hath consecrated for us,</hi> (in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the dead shadows under the
Law) <hi>through the veil, that is to say, his
Flesh:</hi> (Breaking through the veil of his
Flesh, being fain to die before he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100709:77"/>
into Heaven) <hi>And having an High
Priest over the House of God: Let us draw
near with a true heart in full assurance of
Faith; Having our Hearts sprinkled from
an evil Conscience, and our Bodies washed
with pure Water.</hi> That is, being sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolved against all sins both of Heart
and Life: As none that had touched
any unclean thing under the Law, till
the Priest had sprinkled them with pure
Water, had Liberty to enter into the
Congregation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The <hi>Reward,</hi> which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
hath purchased <hi>for</hi> and promised <hi>to</hi>
those that shall get free from the power
of their Lusts, is <hi>another</hi> Motive, than
which a more Powerful one is not to be
imagined. He hath promised that such
shall <hi>be with him where he is.</hi> That <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he lives,</hi>

assured them, that <hi>He is gone to Heaven
before,<note place="margin">Chap. 14. 19. ver. 3.</note> to prepare a place for them:</hi> That
<hi>He is entered thither as their Forerunner:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 20.</note>
That <hi>they shall behold the Glory there which
his Father hath given him;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 24.</note> and that they
shall be <hi>sharers</hi> also with him in that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
That they shall sit with Him upon
his Throne, <hi>Rev. 3. 21. To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
will I grant to sit with me upon my
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100709:77"/>
Throne, even as I also overcame, and am
set down with my Father on his Throne.
That the Righteous shall shine forth as the

raised again, <hi>shall be fashioned like to
his own most Glorious Body, according to the
Mighty working whereby he is able even to
subdue all things unto himself,</hi> Phil. 3. 21.</p>
               <p>Of this Glory it is impossible we should
speak much in <hi>this</hi> state worthily of it;
it far surpasseth our most Elevated <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>eptions,</hi>
and therefore our highest <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi>
must needs fall excessively short
of it. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we shall be,</hi>
saith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 Epist. 3. 2. only we
know so much of the Heavenly Bliss, as
to be assured that it is astonishingly
Great; for, as it follows, <hi>this we know,
that when he appears we shall be like him</hi>
(like <hi>Him</hi> the infinitely <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Happy</hi>
Being, in his <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Happiness) for
we shall see him as he is.</hi> Which implieth
such a <hi>clear, distinct</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his most Glorious Perfections,
as will transform the Soul into His own
Nature, and fill it with His own Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to the utmost extent of its capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:100709:78"/>Could we <hi>now</hi> apprehend this Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in any proportion to its transcendent
Greatness and Excellency, we should
have <hi>no more Spirit left in us;</hi> as it is said
of the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> when she beheld
the Magnificence of <hi>Solomons</hi> Court.
Indeed there is such an Account given us
of the Happiness prepared for Good men,
that we should find it impossible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, but that <hi>God which cannot lye hath
promised it,</hi> and that it is the purchase of
a most inestimable price, the Bloud of his
Eternally Begotten Son. And we have
so great Evidence of its being promised
by his <hi>Father,</hi> and purchased by <hi>Himself,</hi>
given us by our Blessed Lord, that our
own Hearts can't wish for <hi>greater;</hi> nay,
<hi>such</hi> as we could not have asked any <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable</hi>
to it, might we have had our own
<hi>choice</hi> of Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> His innumerable
Miraculous works, His Resurrection
from the Dead, His Ascension into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
And afterwards (exactly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his promise) His sending the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost.</p>
               <p>We have not more Evidence that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
is the Son of God, than we have that
All his sincere Disciples shall live with
him, in unspeakable and Eternal
Blessedness; for we have the self-<hi>same</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:100709:78"/>
for both. The same Arguments which
have abundantly demonstrated the truth
of the <hi>former</hi> Proposition, do equally
prove the <hi>latter,</hi> for they depend <hi>mutually</hi>
upon each other; As S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath shewed
in 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 13, 14. If there be no Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Dead, then is Christ not risen:
And if Christ be not risen, then is our
Preaching vain, and your Faith is also vain.</hi>
That is, there will be no Resurrection of
the Dead.</p>
               <p>Now of what mighty force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
are the <hi>exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>
of such a Glorious state as <hi>this,</hi> to
engage all the Powers of our Souls in the
pursuance of that Holiness which is not
only an indispensable <hi>Condition</hi> to precede
the obtaining of it, but like a necessary
<hi>Qualification</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>The Happiness which will <hi>naturally,</hi>
by <hi>proper,</hi> Efficiency and <hi>necessary</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
result from our Deliverance
from the Dominion of Sin, and our being
instated in the Freedom we have discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of, would be a mighty Motive to the
doing our <hi>utmost</hi> to be set at Liberty:
What a Motive then is <hi>this</hi> Vast <hi>Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Happiness which our Lord hath given
us the most unquestionable Assurance of?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:100709:79"/>
                  <hi>We can never be sufficiently affected
with those words of the Apostle,</hi> Rom. 6.
21, 22. What fruit had ye then of those
things, whereof ye are now ashamed; for the
end of those things is death. But now being
made free from sin, and become servants to
God, ye have your fruit unto Holiness, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
the end everlasting life.</p>
               <p>Can we have such a Hope as this, such
a Blessed Hope (as the Apostle calls it)
and not heartily endeavour <hi>to purifie our
selves as God is pure?</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us,
that he who hath this hope will do so.
Hath our most Gracious Lord made to
his Free Servants such a promise as <hi>this</hi>
of <hi>entering into his Rest,</hi> his Glorious and
Eternal Rest, how should we fear, lest
by continuing in subjection to our vile
Affections, we should at last fall short of
it?</p>
               <p>Good Lord!. That such a prize as <hi>this</hi>
should be set before us, and we not press
hard forward towards it. That such
Blessedness should be Purchased <hi>for,</hi> and
Offered <hi>to</hi> those, who have no esteem or
value for it. But had much rather be
wretched Bondslaves and Vassals to the
Devil and their Lusts, than Reign with
Christ in his Everlasting Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:100709:79"/>How many shall lament this inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

               <p>Sixthly, If it be possible, that <hi>this</hi> with
the <hi>foregoing</hi> Motives should <hi>not</hi> prevail,
there is <hi>another</hi> behind, which is suited
to the most Disingenuous, Stubborn and
Inflexible Tempers, and must needs sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
them, if any thing will: Namely,
The most Dismal <hi>Threatnings</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
hath pronounced against those, who
will not Accept the Liberty he offereth
them, and become his Freemen.</p>
               <p>As such will be necessarily exceedingly
miserable, beyond what they are here,
when they leave this world, through the
Fury of their Corrupt Appetites (there
being no objects in the other state to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
it, or to afford them the least satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
or gratification) so our Lord hath
declared, that, <hi>They shall be cast into outer
Darkness, where shall be weeping, and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and gnashing of teeth,</hi> Matth. 8. 12.
That, <hi>they shall be cast into a Furnace of
Fire,</hi> Matth. 13. 42. That, He will say
unto them at the last Day, <hi>Depart from
me ye cursed into Everlasting Fire, prepared
for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Matth. 25.
41. And his Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100709:80"/>
such, what their Doom shall be, in
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. viz. That <hi>the Lord Iesus
shall be revealed from Heaven, with his
Mighty Angels, in flaming Fire, taking
vengeance on them that know not God, and
obey not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ:
Who shall be punished with everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
from the presence of the Lord, and
from the Glory of his power: When he shall
come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be
admired of all them that believe. Then</hi> shall
we discern the vastest difference imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
between the states of the Righteous
and the Wicked, of those who have
<hi>through the Spirit mortified the deeds of the
body,</hi> and those <hi>who have lived after the
flesh.</hi> The Former sort of men, as the
same Apostle saith, <hi>shall live;</hi> that is, a
most inexpressibly Happy and Glorious
life: The Latter <hi>shall die;</hi> that is, the
<hi>Second</hi> death, or be Eternally Miserable.
<hi>One shall be taken, and the other left:</hi> One
shall be <hi>saved,</hi> the Other <hi>damned:</hi> One
shall be received into the Blessed Mansions
above, and crowned with Immortal Bliss
and Glory; the other shall be tumbled
down into Hell, and have his portion <hi>in
the lake that burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:100709:80"/>Did I say, that these Fearful Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are designed to awaken the most
Disingenuous, Stupid and Obdurate
Souls? I fear there are <hi>Few</hi> who do not
find, that they have need sometimes of
seriously considering them, and laying
them to heart. And when we feel the
principle of <hi>ingenuity</hi> most unactive, as
also that those Motives that excite our
<hi>Hope</hi> have but a weak influence (as it is
possible we may, at certain times, be in
so dull and heavy a Temper, as that we
may be but very little affected with
them) <hi>then</hi> should we rouse up our selves
out of our Lethargick stupidity, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
our Thoughts upon the <hi>Terrors of
the Lord,</hi> the most Terrible Threatnings
of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>And now what think we? Hath not
our Blessed Lord done Abundantly
enough to make us <hi>Free indeed;</hi> To set us
at Liberty <hi>from</hi> Sin and <hi>to</hi> Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
In that he hath not only shewn us
<hi>What it is to be made Free,</hi> and wherein
our Liberty consisteth; And given us the
best <hi>Means,</hi> by the use of which, as we
ought, we shall be set at Liberty; And
purchased such <hi>Grace</hi> for us as whereby
we may be <hi>successful</hi> in the use of those
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100709:81"/>
Means, if we will not neglect them; But
also hath given us such <hi>Motives,</hi> as <hi>those</hi>
we have now discoursed of, to prevail
with our <hi>Wills</hi> not to receive that Grace
in vain.</p>
               <p>And as for these <hi>Motives,</hi> can the
Heart of Man conceive any more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?
No surely, nor could it, unassisted
by Divine Revelation, conceive any that
are the thousandth part <hi>so</hi> powerful.</p>
               <p>But besides all this (as hath been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated)
the Blessed Spirit of God is ready
<hi>so</hi> to inforce these Motives upon us, if we
will endeavour to think seriously upon
them, as that they shall <hi>effectually</hi> do what
they are designed for: And not only <hi>so,</hi>
but he also <hi>begins</hi> with us, and by his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
suggestions excites us to the due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of them, and the use of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Means we are directed to, for the
<hi>pulling down of strong holds, and casting
down every imagination, and every high
thing, that advanceth it self</hi> against the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Government of Christ in our
Souls, and <hi>the bringing every thought,</hi> and
all that is within us, <hi>to the obedience of
Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus doth he work in us both <hi>to
will and to do,</hi> as to <hi>Do</hi> so to <hi>Will, of his
own good pleasure:</hi> or, of his free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100709:81"/>
mercy to us. And therefore
what encouragement have we to put the
Apostles inference from that Doctrine
into Practice, namely, <hi>To work out our
own Salvation with fear and trembling?</hi>
That is, to work out our own Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the Dominion of Sin, and our
Slavish subjection thereunto, with great
Diligence and Solicitude.</p>

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:100709:83"/>I AM come <hi>now</hi> to the Last Head of

from each of the Arguments of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going

Such as, if they be duly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

us higher in the true Evangelical
Spirit and Temper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To begin with the</hi> Former <hi>of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi>
viz. <hi>That</hi> the most Excellent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
consisteth in an Intire Compliance with
the Laws of Righteousness and Goodness; or
in Freedom from the Dominion of Corrupt
and Sinful Assections. <hi>From</hi> hence, <hi>and
what hath been discoursed thereupon,
we Infer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, That those are most Unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and very sadly Depraved who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of, and quarrel with the Divine
Laws as great Intrenchments upon their
Liberty; And therefore, in regard of
the high value they set upon Liberty,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100709:83"/>
cry out upon them as intolerable. For,</p>
               <p>First, Suppose it were true, that our
Liberty is much restrained by the Laws
of God, yet would it be the most unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
thing in the World to cavil at
them upon that account, or to think our
selves too unkindly dealt with: And
that for these <hi>three</hi> Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. We know by Experience, that it is
Absolutely necessary to the Well being
(nay to the very <hi>Being</hi>) of Societies,
that particular Persons be obliged to part
with not a little of their Natural Liberty.
It is utterly inconsistent with the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the <hi>Whole,</hi> for each Particular to
insist so severely on his own Right, as to
refuse to submit to the being deprived of
that Liberty, in several instances, in
which the Primary Laws of Nature have
instated him: And consequently this is
as inconsistent with the Wellfare of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;</hi>
the Well-being of each Part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon the Well-being of the
Whole.</p>
               <p>There can be no Leagues, Compacts
or Agreements between Men and Men,
but there must be <hi>yielding,</hi> and quitting
of Liberty; and that on <hi>both</hi> sides too or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
if not <hi>always.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:100709:84"/>All the Laws of Men do suppose the
Necessity of this; Nor is there any <hi>one</hi>
merely <hi>Humane</hi> Law but doth Restrain
Natural Liberty. He therefore who is
resolved not to let go any part of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
must resolve upon <hi>another</hi> thing
too, <hi>viz.</hi> To live under no Government;
To forsake all Society with his own kind,
and live alone in a Desart. But by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he will quickly be satisfied, that he
pays infinitely too dear for so stiffly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
upon his beloved Liberty, and that
he hath sold for it all the Comfort of his
Life, and whatsoever would make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
to him.</p>
               <p>In a word, There can be no such
thing as <hi>Property</hi> without parting with
several points of Liberty; without this
no <hi>Meum</hi> or <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uum</hi> (I mean as to any thing
<hi>without</hi> our selves, or that can happen to
come within the reach of Anothers Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
can be secured, as every Body will
grant. And therefore can it be thought
a grievous thing that <hi>God himself</hi> should
restrain our Liberty?</p>
               <p>2. As it will be Universally Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that it is Absolutely necessary,
that Particular Persons be abridged of
their Natural Liberty in abundance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
so all that have a right Notion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100709:84"/>
of the Deity must needs believe, that we
are abridged of it in no instances by God
Almighty, but such as wherein it is most
<hi>fit</hi> we should be abridged.</p>
               <p>The Holy Scriptures assure us of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, nor doth Natural Light nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than that Infinite Wisdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and Goodness are necessary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the Divine Nature; Than
that Wilfulness and Arbitrariness, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
and Sourness, Envy and Ill will,
are as far removed from God as is Hell
from Heaven. And consequently, though
several of His Laws should seem to our
thinking never so Unreasonable, yet
while we adhere to the Scriptural and
Natural Notion of the Deity, we our
<hi>selves</hi> would be most Unreasonable, in
not Concluding them to be <hi>really</hi> most
contrary to what they may <hi>seemingly</hi> be
to <hi>us;</hi> in not believing them to be as
Wise, as Righteous, and as Good, as
any can fancy them Weak, Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or Unkind.</p>
               <p>3. As from the Consideration of the
Nature of God we are as certain as we
are capable of being of <hi>any</hi> thing, that all
the Abatements and Limitations of our
Liberty, He is the Author of, are most
Wise, Just and Good; that they are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100709:85"/>
founded in great Reason, Equity and
<hi>Kindness</hi> also to us, so <hi>we</hi> that live under
the Gospel Dispensation are assured from
the Consideration of the <hi>particular</hi> Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
and Forbearances He hath by
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> obliged us to, that they are
no other, than such as are infinitely
Worthy of such a God.</p>
               <p>They are all of <hi>that</hi> nature, that they
carry their own Reason most visibly and
apparently along with them: And <hi>such</hi>
as we are easily able to give account to
our selves, upon what <hi>particular</hi> Designs,
it was the pleasure of our Creator to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them upon us. 'Tis the easiest thing
in the World to demonstrate, that they
are not only all of them <hi>Consistent</hi> with
Infinite Goodness, but also great <hi>Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and <hi>Expressions</hi> thereof: That God is
not only most Righteous in enjoyning
each of them, but most Good and Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>All but some two or three of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Gospel are no other than what
Right Reason, and the Law of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did, and must necessarily, always
oblige us to, as will presently be seen.
And those very few <hi>purely</hi> Evangelical
ones are designed for our better Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Natural Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:100709:85"/>And thus I have shewed in short, that,
granting Gods Laws do put restraints
(and those <hi>many</hi> too) upon our Liberty,
we have no cause to complain upon that
account: They restraining it only in
such particulars, as wherein it is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
better for us to be restrained than
otherwise. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is utterly to be denied,
that the Laws we Christians are under
the Obligation of, do any of them restrain
our Liberty. They restrain Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
indeed, but not Liberty. This doth
sufficiently appear from what hath been
discoursed.</p>
               <p>That cannot be true Liberty which is
injurious to our Chiefest Liberty, but
our Chiefest Liberty we have shewed
doth consist in being free to Good; in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all impediments taken out of our
way to the free exercise of those Virtues
which are (as I may say) the very <hi>Soul</hi>
of our Souls, the <hi>Life</hi> of our Souls, as our
Souls are of our Bodies: Without which
we are <hi>dead</hi> even whilest we <hi>live;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we are in an utter incapacity
of enjoying our selves, of being in the
least measure truly Happy, or of Living
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100709:86"/>
like Men, and discharging the Functions
of that Life which is proper to Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creatures: And by the absence of
which we degenerate into the Brutish,
nay into the Devilish Nature.</p>
               <p>You may as well say, that He is
abridged of his Liberty, who is kept from
running his Head into the fire, or from
Cutting his own Throat, as that He is
so, who is forbidden to be Unjust and
Unrighteous in any kind, or to be Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
or Uncharitable, or Intemperate,
or Lascivious: That is, who is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to play the Beast or the Devil. Or
who is Commanded to Love God above
all, to Fear Him, to Trust in Him, to
be Thankful to Him, in all his ways to
Acknowledge Him; and to Love his
Neighbour as himself. But, if we will
believe the Great S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
is comprehended all that for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which the <hi>Grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Salvation</hi> reacheth men to forbear or
practise.</p>
               <p>To summ up all in short that needs to
be said about this matter, There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
required of us, but it is either an
Essential part of our Liberty, of our
Highest and most Excellent Liberty, to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100709:86"/>
be Free to it, or is a Means to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Maintenance of it.</p>
               <p>What an Unreasonable Brutish Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
therefore art Thou, whosoever thou
art, that darest repine at the Restraints
which thy Creator and Redeemer have
laid upon thee, whenas these Restraints
(if they may be called so) are necessary
to thy greatest Enlargement. And let me
tell thee, thou that thinkest much of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
held within the Limits which the
Gospel hath set thee, thou affectest a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which <hi>God</hi> himself hath not, and
Abhors to have.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Second Inference, viz. That such a
Freedom of Will as consists in an Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
to good or evil is no Perfection, but
the Contrary.</head>
               <p>SEcondly, We may observe from the
abovesaid Discourse, That such a
Freedom of Will as consists in an Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
to Good or Evil, as much as it is
magnified by some for a great Perfection
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100709:87"/>
of the Humane Nature, is <hi>indeed</hi> no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a Diminution and Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Nor is it otherwise Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
than as a <hi>less</hi> Evil.</p>
               <p>This must necessarily be so, if the most
Excellent Liberty consisteth in an entire
Compliance with the Laws of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Goodness, as it hath been
fully proved it doth.</p>
               <p>Seneca <hi>hath</hi> somewhere <hi>a most Impudent
and Blasphemous saying, to</hi> this <hi>purpose:</hi>
That a Wise, or Virtuous, man is in some
respect Superior to God himself; because God
is Good by necessity of Nature, but <hi>he</hi> by his
own free choice.</p>
               <p>'Tis to be confessed, that, comparing
this indifferency to Good or Evil with the
Determination of the Will to Evil, so it
is desirable; but then it is so only as 'tis
a <hi>less</hi> Evil than the other, as was said.
But comparing it with the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Will to <hi>Good,</hi> from an inward
Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> from a quick, Vigorous
Sense of the infinite Loveliness of Virtue,
and monstrous Deformity and Ugliness
of Vice, so on the other hand, 'tis a great
imperfection, and consequently by no
means desirable.</p>
               <p>The Divine Nature will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be the Great Standard and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100709:87"/>
of Perfections: We cannot question
but that, the more <hi>like</hi> to God any one is,
the more <hi>perfect</hi> he will be; and the
more <hi>unlike</hi> to God, the more <hi>imperfect:</hi>
But the being Free to Evil and Undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to Good, makes a man <hi>less</hi> like
God, because God is (as hath been
shewn) necessarily, from his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Determined <hi>to</hi> Good, and <hi>from</hi>
Evil; And his Infinite Wisdom, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Righteousness and Goodness can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist with Peccability, or a Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of doing or approving the least Evil.
And therefore the more any one is from
<hi>within</hi> himself, from a good Temper of
mind, determined to that which is Good,
the more like must he needs be to the Best
of Beings, and the more he partakes of a
Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>That saying of S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>

as, without doubt, the Angels and

Saints in Heaven are. And, whereas
the Father seems to exclude Free Will
from God, and to give it to all Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creatures, he must mean such a
Free Will as consisteth in Indifferency to
Good or Evil, or Undeterminedness
from <hi>within</hi> to <hi>Good</hi> and against <hi>Evil,</hi>
and so on the contrary. This kind of
Freedom cannot belong to God, because
it speaks great imperfection: For it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
him who hath it, to be without
such a Sense of the Excellency and Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of Goodness, and the Hatefulness
and Intolerableness of Wickedness, as he
ought to have.</p>
               <p>He that can in the least Deliberate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whether it be more Eligible to be Just or
Unjust, Chaste or Impure, Intemperate
or Sober, to speak Truth or to Lye, to
Love God or the World, to Forgive or
Revenge, to be Pitiful or Cruel, to be
Niggardly or Charitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He, I
say, that can perswade himself to Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
about these things, doth manifestly
declare, that he understands neither the
one nor the other, as he ought to do. I
mean, that he hath nothing so lively a
<hi>Sense</hi> of the Goodness of the one, or the
Evil of the other, as it <hi>becomes</hi> him to
have.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:100709:88"/>If we <hi>had</hi> such a Sense, it would be as
impossible to perswade us to any Vile
Action, as it would be to prevail with a
man in his right Mind, to pour melted
Lead down his own Throat, to pluck
out his Eyes, or to dash out his Brains.</p>
               <p>You cannot deliberate whether it be
better for you to be Healthy or Sick, to
be at Ease or in Torment, to have a Good
Name or a Bad, to be Beggarly or in
Plentiful Circumstances, to be a Wise
man or a Fool, to be a Mad-man or in
your Wits, to be a Slave or a Freeman,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> You will say that <hi>Bedlam</hi> is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
place for him, that shall in the least
consider which of these he shall chuse.
Now if we had as great a Sense of the
Evil of the infinitely <hi>worst</hi> of Evils <hi>Sin,</hi> as
we have of <hi>those</hi> Evils, it would be as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that our Wills should incline to
the Commission of a known Sin, as that
they should prefer Sickness before
Health, and refuse Ease and embrace
Torment.</p>
               <p>As for those that contend that, It is
more <hi>Praise-worthy</hi> to <hi>do</hi> Good and <hi>forbear</hi>
Evil, having a <hi>Power</hi> to do otherwise,
than to be under a <hi>necessity</hi> of so doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Supposing they mean by <hi>necessity,</hi> such as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100709:89"/>
is not from <hi>without,</hi> or from an inward
blind instinct, but from an Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Principle and Perfection of Nature,
I must needs tell them there is no Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in the World more false or absurd.
For is God Almighty the <hi>less</hi> to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
Loved or Praised for his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
because his Nature is so Good, as
that He cannot but be ever doing good?
Surely He is much the <hi>more</hi> to be Loved,
Adored, Admired and Praised upon this
account.</p>
               <p>I will not therefore stick to say, that
to have the Will necessarily determined
to all Good, and from all Evil, from an
Overpowering Sense of the Becoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Excellency of the <hi>one,</hi> and the
Vileness and Odiousness of the <hi>other,</hi> is
the very Perfection of Liberty. And this
is so far from being impossible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by <hi>Creatures</hi> or by <hi>our Selves,</hi> that,
by the help of God's Grace, it is in a large
measure even in <hi>this</hi> life Attainable. I
mean <hi>such</hi> a Sense of Good and Evil, as
shall certainly determine us <hi>to</hi> Good and
<hi>against</hi> Evil in most of the instances of
each.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>some</hi> immoralities and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Actions, that they who have attained
to but very mean and ordinary degrees of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100709:89"/>
Goodness, cannot perswade themselves
so much as to <hi>endeavour</hi> to reconcile their
Minds to. Nay, there are <hi>some</hi> that no
man can easily be supposed <hi>able</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to, but an extraordinarily Depraved
and Wicked Wretch, let the Motives
that are used to perswade him be what
they will. Such as <hi>Blaspheming of God:
Contriving the Murther of our Parents,</hi> or
of a most obliging Friend: <hi>Torturing of
innocent Babes,</hi> and the like Horrid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies.
Surely then, a man is capable of
such a Vivid sense of the Hatefulness of
Sin in <hi>general,</hi> as will (whilest it lasts)
render it impossible for him to <hi>Will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately</hi>
to commit any known Sin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
               <p>'Tis confessed that we cannot hope to
get past all danger of sudden <hi>Surprizals,</hi>
so long as we inhabit <hi>these</hi> Bodies, and
remain in our present Unhappy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
but, I say, so powerful a Sense
of the Infinite Unrighteousness, Disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
Unreasonableness, Folly and
Madness of opposing the Holy Will of our
Great Creator and Blessed Redeemer
may, by the Divine Assistance, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
even on <hi>this</hi> side Heaven, as shall
Determine us effectually against all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
and Wilful Violations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:100709:90"/>For this we have the Authority of a
Great Apostle: S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith in his
1 Epist. 3. 9. <hi>Whosoever is Born of God
doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth
in him, neither</hi> can <hi>he Sin, because he is
Born of God.</hi> He here affirms, not only
that those who have attained to extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Measures of Goodness <hi>cannot</hi> Sin,
that is, cannot <hi>will</hi> to sin <hi>deliberately,</hi> but
likewise that no Regenerate or <hi>truly</hi> Good
man can. He cannot <hi>thus</hi> Sin, <hi>because he
is born of God;</hi> because he is a Child of
God by the inward Renewing of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit: And because <hi>his Seed remaineth
in him,</hi> that is, the Divine Seed. Which
Divine <hi>Seed</hi> I take to be the same thing
with the several times mentioned Quick,
Powerful and Pungent Sense of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Nature, and most dreadful Effects
and Consequents of Wilful Sinning. It
is more than <hi>Morally</hi> impossible, that
whilest this Sense abideth in its Strength
and Vigour, the Good man should lapse
into such Sins.</p>
               <p>Have we not such a Sense of the Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of some Actions, as to say frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>I could not for all the world find in mine
heart</hi> (that is, in my <hi>Will) to do so or so?</hi>
And if we had the same Sense of <hi>all</hi> Sins,
which it is unreasonable not to have,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100709:90"/>
considering them <hi>as</hi> Sins, or Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Everlasting Rules of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
(for considering them under that
notion, all sins are alike) I say had we
the same Sense of <hi>all</hi> Sins, we should as
truly say concerning <hi>each, I cannot find in
mine heart, I cannot</hi> will, <hi>to consent unto
it.</hi>

The First of which is, That
which makes it to consist, wholly or in

That in Freedom from the Dominion of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

thereof our Christian Liberty doth <hi>Eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
consist, and <hi>wholly</hi> too the Liberty
which Christ hath purchased for us <hi>Gentiles.
And</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, We infer from hence, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Notions of Christian Liberty, that
have too much prevailed, are False and
of dangerous Consequence. We will
speak to,</p>
               <p>First, That which makes it to consist
in Freedom from the Obligation of the
<hi>Moral Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That which makes it to
consist in Freedom from those Laws of
<hi>Men,</hi> which Enjoyn or Forbid <hi>indifferent</hi>
things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That which makes <hi>Liberty of
Conscience</hi> a Branch of <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, For <hi>that</hi> Notion of Christian
Liberty, which makes it to consist, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly or in part, in Freedom from
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100709:91"/>
the Obligation of the <hi>Moral Law:</hi> This is
extremely Wild and Wicked, as will
appear from what hath been discoursed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the Doctrine of the</hi> Antinomians,
<hi>and they produce in favour of it all those
Texts wherein we are said to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the</hi> Law. <hi>As particularly</hi> Rom.
7. 6. Now we are delivered from the Law,
that being dead wherein we were held, <hi>&amp;c.
Gal.</hi> 2. 19. I through the Law am dead to
the Law, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 6. 14. Ye are not under
the Law, but under Grace. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5.
When the fulness of time was come, God sent
forth his Son, made of a Woman, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, to Redeem them that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it is Answered, That there are
indeed many Texts which Assert our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freed from the <hi>Law,</hi> but the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, <hi>What</hi> Law they mean? Or rather
'tis out of Question, that they mean not
the <hi>Moral</hi> Law. For there is no need of
doing more than reading <hi>throughout</hi> the
forementioned Verses, to satisfie us, that
the Apostle understood, in each of them,
nothing less than <hi>that</hi> Law. Nay, we
need do no more to be assured, that he
<hi>Abominated</hi> this Notion of <hi>Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:100709:92"/>
                  <hi>For whereas he saith,</hi> Rom. 7. 6. Now
we are delivered from the Law, that being
dead wherein we were held; <hi>it follows,</hi> that
we should serve in Newness of Spirit, and
not in the Oldness of the Letter. <hi>That is,
That we should no longer be merely</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
<hi>Obedient, but also,</hi> Inwardly <hi>and</hi>
Spiritually.</p>
               <p>Whereas he saith, <hi>Gal. 2. 19. I through
the Law am dead to the Law,</hi> he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
adds <hi>this</hi> as the reason why he was
so, <hi>that I might live unto God:</hi> Or be in
all things conformed to the Rules of
Righteousness and Goodness, which He
hath prescribed; all which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the <hi>Moral Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, whereas he tells the <hi>Romans,</hi>
Chap. 6. 14. <hi>Ye are not under the Law but
under Grace:</hi> This comes in as a proof of
what he said immediately before in the
same Verse, <hi>viz. Sin shall not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, In saying, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5. That
Christ <hi>was made of a Woman, made under
the Law, to redeem them that were under the
Law,</hi> he gives this in the next words as
the reason or design hereof, <hi>that we might
receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> But doth
not the Relation of a <hi>Son</hi> necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Obligation to Obedience? It doth so
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100709:92"/>
no less than that of a <hi>Servant.</hi> For where
God saith, <hi>If I am a Master, where is my
Fear?</hi> he saith also, <hi>If I am a Father where
is mine Honour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Law</hi> therefore which is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in <hi>these</hi> and the <hi>like</hi> places is the
purely <hi>Iewish</hi> Law, the mere <hi>External</hi>
and <hi>Drudging</hi> Observances of the <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Dispensation, which the <hi>Iewish</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
thought themselves to be still under
the Obligation of, and Condemned the
<hi>Gentile</hi> Converts for not submitting their
Necks to the same Yoke.</p>
               <p>And the Apostle takes a great deal of
pains, in his Epistles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and
<hi>Galatians,</hi> to confute that mistake; and
to convince the <hi>Iews,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> Law was
made by Christ null and void; that He
had Cancelled it, and taken away its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
power.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>each</hi> of those places the Apostle
as plainly affirms <hi>this</hi> to be the Law they
were delivered from, as that it is <hi>not</hi> the
<hi>Moral</hi> Law. We will therefore a <hi>third</hi>
time go them over again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom. 7. 6. Now we are delivered from the
Law, that being dead wherein we were held,
that we should serve in Newness of Spirit,
and not in the Oldness of the Letter.</hi> That
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100709:93"/>
is, We are delivered from that Law,
that considered <hi>literally,</hi> required no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a company of Bodily Washings,
Outward Services, and Carnal Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
which the <hi>Iews</hi> generally rested
in, and thought no more was to be done
to render them Acceptable in the sight of
God; And the reason why we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from this Law is, that so we may
be the more intent upon the Great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Duties, and the Purification of
our Hearts, Souls and Spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gal. 2. 19. I through the Law am dead to
the Law, that I might live unto God.</hi> Or,
I by virtue of the Law of <hi>Christ,</hi> am dead
to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that I may have all
impediments taken out of my way to the
being intirely devoted, as to the <hi>Inward</hi>
as well as <hi>Outward</hi> man, to the Service of
God. And it hath been shewed how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
this Law did <hi>Accidentally</hi> become
to the great Design of the Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi>
The making us Spiritually Obedient;
the enduing us with Inward, Real, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Righteousness; or the Divine
Likeness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Sin shall not have dominion
over you, for ye are not under the Law, but
under Grace.</hi> That is, There is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of your continuing under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100709:93"/>
and dominion of Sin, because you are
not under the weak Dispensation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
which <hi>made nothing perfect,</hi> and gave
no strength to mortifie Lust, but under
the Gospel Dispensation, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Promises of Plentiful
Supplies of Grace and Strength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gal. 4. 5. God sent forth his Son, made of
a Woman, made under the Law, to Redeem
them that were under the Law, that we might
receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> Or, That
we might no longer drudge like Servants
of the inferior Sort, in such Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as are mean and low, having no
Internal Goodness in them; and that
from the hope only of some <hi>sleight</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
from the hope of some mere <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
good things, such as are Gratifications
only of the Animal and Sensual life; and
from the Fear of mere Temporal Evils,
and the present Lash, (that Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
no other express Promises or
Threatnings but Temporal, as was shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
but may be dealt with as <hi>Sons,</hi> be
Honourably employed, <hi>viz.</hi> in such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
as are of the most Excellent nature,
and do recommend themselves by their
own Goodness, and Agreeableness to our
Rational and Intellectual Faculty. And
be acted also by a more Noble <hi>Principle,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100709:94"/>
viz. Love,</hi> and encouraged by an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more Noble <hi>Reward,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in a perfect Likeness to God, and
an Everlasting Enjoyment of him.</p>
               <p>And thus we see, these very Texts
that are made use of by the <hi>Antinomians,</hi>
to prove this mad Notion of <hi>Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
from the Obligation of the <hi>Moral
Law,</hi> are so far from signifying any thing
to this purpose, that they give manifest
and clear proof of the <hi>Contrary.</hi> As they
are far from asserting, that any such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
as <hi>this</hi> belongs to Christians, so
they assure us that <hi>no</hi> such Liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to them.</p>
               <p>Tertullian <hi>hath a good saying to our

               <p>And indeed should we find this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in those Texts, that our Saviour
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100709:94"/>
hath procured for us Freedom from <hi>this</hi>
Law, then,</p>
               <p>First, The Blessed Apostle would have
most expresly contradicted his Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and so have proved himself <hi>no</hi>
Apostle; For our Saviour plainly saith,
<hi>Matth. 5. 17. Think not,</hi> let not such a
wild fancy enter into your Heads, <hi>that I
am come to destroy the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil:</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to fill it up, or Preach it
fully.</hi> I am so far from such a Design,
as that of destroying or Abolishing the
Moral Law, that, on the contrary, I am
come to Preach it more fully and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than ever it was before my Coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> this <hi>he presently sets upon doing,</hi>
Vers. 21, 22, 27, 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ye have heard
that it hath been said by them of old time,
thou shalt not Kill, and whosoever shall Kill
shall be in danger of the judgment; but I say
unto you, that whoso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye have heard, that it was said by them of
old time, Thou shalt not commit Adultery:
but I say unto you, that whosoev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r shall look
upon a Woman, to lust after h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Adultery already with her in his heart.
<hi>And so He goes on to Perfect and Fill up
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100709:95"/>
Law, in the following Verses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again our Saviour saith,</hi> vers. 18. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
I say unto you, that till Heaven and
Earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no
wise pass from the Law, till all be fulfilled:
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, till all be done, <hi>or
till all things come to an End, according
to Doctor</hi> Hammond.</p>
               <p>He hath not here respect to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Conflagration, saith <hi>Grotius</hi> upon
the place, but it is a Proverbial speech,
as if it were said in Latine, <hi>Vsque dum
Coelum ruat: Till the Heavens fall.</hi> Which
is thus expressed, <hi>Luke 16. 17. And it is
easier for Heaven and Earth to pass, than one
tittle of the Law to fail.</hi> In which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of speaking, as saith the same Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Expositor, He hath respect to the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Nature,</hi> and not to the <hi>Power of
God.</hi> But according to Nature it seems
impossible that Heaven and Earth should
pass away or perish.</p>
               <p>So that the meaning of these Texts is
plainly <hi>this, viz.</hi> The Obligation of the
Law can neither cease, nor be diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or relaxed in the least, to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then our Saviour adds,</hi> Vers. 19.
<hi>of this Fifth of S.</hi> Matthew, Whosoever
therefore shall break one of these least Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100709:95"/>
and shall teach men so, he shall be
called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven:
<hi>That is, saith</hi> Grotius, Minimi erit pretii,
eum minimi habitum iri, he shall be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and treated as a most despicable wretch
at the Day of Iudgment. <hi>Then it follows,</hi>
But whosoever shall do and teach them, the
same shall be called Great in the Kingdom of
Heaven. <hi>He shall be highly Honoured,
and signally Rewarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the young Man came to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to ask him, <hi>What good thing he
should do, that he might have Eternal life,</hi>
we know what his Answer was, <hi>If thou
wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments,</hi>
S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 17. And whereas He meant
<hi>all,</hi> yet (knowing how apt Hypocrites
are to flatter themselves with an opinion
of the goodness of their state, upon the
account of their External Conformity to
the <hi>First</hi> Table Precepts, though they
live in the gross Transgression of those of
the <hi>Second</hi> Table) He only <hi>expressed</hi> those
which enjoyn Duties relating to our
<hi>Neighbour.</hi> For the young Man asking
<hi>which</hi> Commandments? <hi>Iesus said, Thou
shalt do no Murder, Thou shalt not commit
Adultery, Thou shalt not Steal, Thou shalt
not bear false Witness, Honour thy Father
and thy Mother: And thou shalt love thy
Neighbour as thyself,</hi> Ver. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:100709:96"/>Secondly, The Apostle would have
Contradicted <hi>himself</hi> most Egregiously,
as well as his <hi>Master,</hi> should he, in the
above-cited Places, or any where else,
teach this Notion of <hi>Christian</hi> Liberty.
For 'twas <hi>He</hi> that said, <hi>Do we make void
the Law through Faith, God forbid, yea we
establish the Law, Rom.</hi> 3. 31. He here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
even the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by <hi>ver.</hi> 28. (which gave occasion to
these words) <hi>Therefore we conclude that a
man is justified by Faith, without the deeds
of the Law:</hi> That is, that a <hi>Gentile</hi> is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
without <hi>Circumcision,</hi> or Sacrifices,
or any other of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rites and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
which they still laid so great
weight upon; as appears by the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Verses, <hi>Is he the God of the Iews
only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes of
the Gentiles also. Seeing it is one God,
which shall justifie the Circumcision by Faith,
and Vncircumcision through Faith.</hi> Now
saith the Apostle, God forbid we should
affirm that the Gospel Dispensation
should make void the Law; should make
useless so much as the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law,
therefore much less the <hi>Moral,</hi> yea we
assert it establisheth the Law. In some
sence it even establisheth or perfects <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:100709:96"/>
Law, as it brings in the substance of that,
whereof that Law had the shadow; and
requireth purity of Heart, which was
the spiritual meaning of Circumcision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, 'twas the same S.</hi> Paul <hi>that said,</hi>
Not the Hearers of the Law are just before
God; but the Doers of the Law shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
Rom. 2. 13. <hi>And it is</hi> He <hi>who makes
it to be the design of Christ's Expiating
our Sins upon the Cross, That</hi> the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the Law might be fulfilled in us,
who walk not after the Flesh, but after the
Spirit. <hi>And it is this same Apostle that
saith,</hi> Though I speak with the Tongues of
Men and of Angels, and have not Charity
(<hi>a</hi> Moral <hi>Virtue</hi>) I am become as sounding
Brass, or a tinkling Cymbal. And though
I have the gift of Prophecy, and understand
all Mysteries, and all Knowledge: And
though I have all Faith, so that I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
Mountains, and have no Charity, I
am nothing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. <hi>And in
the</hi> last <hi>Verse, doth not only Equalize
Charity with Faith and Hope (which
many now adays are so far from doing,
that they are</hi> angry <hi>with those who do so)
but also Advanceth it</hi> above <hi>those Graces.</hi>
And now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity,
these three, but the greatest of these is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:100709:97"/>Thirdly, Whosoever teacheth this
Doctrine, of Christ's having set us free
from the Moral Law, contradicteth the
whole strain of the New Testament:
Our Saviours Sermon on the Mount
<hi>throughout,</hi> all his Injunctions and even
all his Discourses, and all the Precepts
and Exhortations contained in the
Epistles of the Apostles. They are all so
many instances of the Obligations that
the First and Second Tables lay upon us,
as understood in the most Spiritual, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and Comprehensive Sence: And
none are <hi>more</hi> so than those of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> so
intolerably is he abused in being made
the Great, and I think, <hi>Onely</hi> Patron of
that most licentious and wicked Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>And even that Precept of Believing in
the Name of the Son of God, is a <hi>First-Table</hi>
Precept, not Positive but Moral,
<hi>in its own Nature</hi> necessarily obliging, and
a Dictate of Natural Light, to all those
who are acquainted with the Evidence
of his being the Messiah, and Son of God.
Upon our understanding how He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
so to be, we should have
known that Faith in Him is an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
Duty, though we could not have
produced one Text to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:100709:97"/>Moreover Believing in Christ, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Institutions of <hi>Baptism</hi> and
the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> are designed as Means
to the great End of making us intirely
Obedient to the Moral Law, or the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Rules of Righteousness.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whosoever teacheth this
Doctrine, teacheth a most manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the Essential Principles and
Make of Mankind. It is impossible that
Reasonable Creatures should be disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from Loving God above all, from
being Just and Charitable, Sober and
Temperate, Humble and Submissive to
the Divine Will, and the like.</p>
               <p>It is impossible that <hi>any</hi> Power whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
should discharge them from such du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as these. Their Obligation to them
doth Naturally arise from their being <hi>such</hi>
Creatures. There is not a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
than <hi>this</hi> imaginable, that
Creatures made capable of understanding
what God is, and their Relation and
Obligations to him, may not be Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bound to behave themselves towards
him, as the Moral Law requires they
should. Infinite Power it self cannot set
such Creatures free from their Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to love God with the highest degree of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100709:98"/>
love their Souls will admit of. Now as
the Apostle tells us, that <hi>Love is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Law,</hi> so 'tis easie to shew, that
all Moral Duties whatsoever, whether
relating to God, our Neighbour, or our
Selves, are the necessary results and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
of the Love of <hi>God;</hi> so that we
cannot once suppose, that these should
cease at any time to be the Duties of Men
and Women, but we must also suppose
them then deprived of their Essential
Form, and to be changed into <hi>another</hi> sort
of Beings.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This Doctrine also is as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
a contradiction to the Happiness and
Welfare of Mankind. We cannot be in
a Happy or tolerably Good state, but by
conforming our selves to the Precepts of
this Law.</p>
               <p>We have already shewed, that those
must necessarily be deplorably Miserable,
who live in subjection to any corrupt
Appetite, any Fleshly or Spiritual Lust.
To which purpose,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Strom. Lib. 2. p. 424.</note> I will
add this passage of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Alexandrinus, To
submit and give place to
evil Affections is extreme
Slavery, as to overcome them is the only Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:100709:98"/>
Nor can the best place in the
World, not Heaven it self, or the most
Glorious outward circumstances, make
that person Happy, or <hi>not</hi> Miserable,
<hi>within</hi> whom all is amiss and out of order,
and who is indued with no good Habit
or Temper of Mind. A diseased Body
will be uneasie, do what you can to it,
and so will diseased Souls.</p>
               <p>These things considered, 'tis the most
Amazing thing, that any who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Christians can entertain such a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as this of <hi>Christian Liberty;</hi> the
directly contrary being the whole Design
and Business of Christianity. And yet for all
that we find it as Ancient as the Apostles
days; there were those so early that did
not only Teach it but Practised upon it;
that used their Liberty <hi>for a cloak of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciousness,</hi>
and <hi>turned the Grace of God into
lasciviousness.</hi> But 'tis no over-bold say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that if this could be really proved to
be a Liberty of Christ's bringing into the
World, there is no Good man but would
abhor the Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Antinomians</hi> (not to make
worse of them than they are) tell us, that
they do not deny the Obligation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to the performance of the Duties
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100709:99"/>
required by the Moral Law, but 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Love, Gratitude and ingenuity that
can oblige them. Which is as much as
to say, that they are not obliged to them
in strict Justice, or as they are the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a Law.</p>
               <p>But alas, they very little mend the
matter by this <hi>Salvo,</hi> nay their Doctrine
is of the same dangerous consequence <hi>with</hi>
it, that it is <hi>without</hi> it. For,</p>
               <p>First, It destroys all the Gospel Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
makes them insignificant and idle
things; They being all Moral, either in
<hi>themselves</hi> or in their <hi>Design.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It takes off all Obligation to
Love, Ingenuity and Gratitude. You
say you are not bound to be Righteous,
Charitable, Temperate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by any
other Law than <hi>that</hi> of Love and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
But by what Law are you obliged
to the Love of God and Christ, to be
Grateful to them, and to have an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous,
Thankful Sense of the Great
things they have done for you? You
must say by no Law at all, seeing you
make these the only Law of Christians.
And, if you are obliged to these things
by no Law, how are they <hi>Duties?</hi> And
perswade a man once, that they are not
Duties, and 'twill be very strange if he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100709:99"/>
make any Conscience of Love and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
And then there is nothing left to
hold him in from committing all manner
of wickedness with greediness, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Tempter or his Lusts solicite
him, and opportunities are offered to
him.</p>
               <p>But besides, they have another Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and 'tis <hi>that</hi> upon which this
strange wild Notion is founded, which
takes away all necessity of being Grateful
and Ingenuous, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ is Formally (and not
only in its Fruits and Effects) a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
so that He hath done all that the
Law requires in the Believers stead, or
as <hi>Personating</hi> him.</p>
               <p>This is their Sence of those words late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cited, <hi>I came not to destroy the Law, but
to fulfil it;</hi> so that Christ having fulfilled
the Law as the Believers Representative,
he hath fulfilled it <hi>himself</hi> in Christ. And
Christs Active and Passive Obedience is
<hi>his,</hi> both as to Matter and Principle, and
therefore Christs Love and Gratitude
are <hi>his</hi> Love and Gratitude, and all
those Graces which so shined forth in
Christ are the Believers, in their very
Formality and Essential nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:100709:100"/>Now what should ail those that can
down with this strange stuff, to boggle
at believing that they have no need at all
of any <hi>other</hi> Love, Ingenuity or Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
than what is thus imputed to them?
And therefore you see that their talking
of the Law of Love and Gratitude is but
a pitiful shift, and will do nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the deliverance of their Doctrine
of Freedom from the Moral Law, from
the necessary tendency it is charged with,
to the letting the Reins loose, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Flood-gates to all Ungodliness.</p>
               <p>I exceedingly wonder how it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
for People that have not first lost
their Wits, to embrace an Opinion so
apparently Destructive of Christianity
and of all <hi>Religion,</hi> and all this while pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves Christians, and the <hi>onely</hi>
Christians too.</p>
               <p>But I have bestowed too much time in
the Confutation of this Hateful Notion
of Christian Liberty; it being as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
silly as it is wicked: And it being
as evident to <hi>him</hi> that knows any thing of
the Gospel, that it is <hi>Antichristian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness,</hi>
as that there is any such
thing as <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:100709:100"/>Poor Souls! They little understand
what Liberty meaneth, who are able to
talk or think at this rate.</p>
               <p>In short, He that believes that true
Christians are delivered by the Sufferings
of Christ from the <hi>Curse</hi> due to the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
of this Law, believes most <hi>truly;</hi>
but whosoever believes they are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Power it had to oblige to the
<hi>Duties</hi> thereof, or that any man <hi>can</hi> be
so delivered, thinks most <hi>wickedly,</hi> and
thinks most <hi>madly.</hi>

               <head type="sub">A Second False Notion of Christian Liberty,
viz. That which makes it to consist in Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from the Obligation of those Laws of
Men, which enjoyn or forbid indifferent
things. This Notion differently managed
by the Defenders of it. First, Some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it so far as to make it to reach to all
Humane Laws, the matter of which are
things indifferent. Secondly, Others li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to those which relate to Religion
and the Worship of God. The 23. Vers.
of the 7. Chap. of the 1 Epist. to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
cleared from giving any Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to either of these Opinions. The
Former of them Confuted by three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And the Latter by four. Vnder
the Second of which, several Texts of
Scripture which are much insisted upon in
the defence thereof, are taken into Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
An unjust Reflection upon the
Church of England briefly replied to.
And this Principle, that the imposing of
things indifferent in Divine Worship is no
Violation of Christian Liberty, proved
to be no ways Serviceable to Popery, by
considering what the Popish Impositions
are in Three Particulars.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:100709:101"/>SEcondly, We are next to speak to
that Notion of Christian Liberty,
which makes it to consist in Freedom
from those Laws of <hi>Men,</hi> that command
or forbid <hi>Indifferent</hi> things: (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
Things neither good nor evil in their own
nature, nor required or prohibited by
any Law of God.</p>
               <p>This Notion is differently managed
by the Defenders of it.</p>
               <p>First, Some extend it to <hi>all</hi> Humane
laws, the Matter of which are things
Indifferent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others limit it to those
which relate to Religion onely, and the
Worship of God.</p>
               <p>But what proof is there of Christ's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
purchased such a Liberty as this?
Or that Christians are made Free from
such Laws in <hi>either</hi> of these Sences?</p>
               <p>There is one Text insisted on by <hi>both</hi> of
these Parties for each of their Sentiments
about this matter; <hi>viz. that</hi> of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor. 7. 23. Ye are bought with a price, be
not ye the Servants of Men.</hi> That is, say
the <hi>former</hi> party, Ye are Redeemed by
the precious Bloud of Christ from the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100709:102"/>
Obligation of all merely Humane Laws:
From all such Observances as are only of
Mens imposing, which neither Natural
Light, nor any Divine Law hath made
Necessary, but have left us Free to. And
the <hi>latter</hi> Party say, The meaning is, Ye
are Redeemed by Christ's Bloud from all
merely Humane Impositions which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
Religion and Divine Worship, as
being aware that the <hi>other</hi> Exposition is
too too extravagant.</p>
               <p>But these two Parties are equally <hi>Out</hi>
in their Application of this Text to their
several purposes, nor will it do the least
service to either of them. And they
may as well conclude from that of our
<hi>Saviour, Matth. 23. 9. Call no man your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon Earth, for one is your Father
which is in Heaven,</hi> that it is forbidden
them to acknowledge any such Relation
upon Earth, as that of <hi>Father,</hi> as raise
either of those Doctrines from those
words of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, as it is manifest, that by this
Prohibition of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> no more is to
be understood, than that we ought not to
give up our selves Universally and Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to be Guided and Governed by any
Man on Earth; as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> (of
whom He is there discoursing, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100709:102"/>
against the imitation of whose proud pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
he there cautions his Disciples)
did expect their Proselytes should be by
<hi>them;</hi> as young Children who are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruled by the Will of their Parents: I
say, as, by considering the Context, it is
most evident that our Saviour there only
speaks against an <hi>Vnlimited</hi> subjection to
Men, as being that which is due to God
only, so it is exceedingly Unreasonable
to make that Prohibition of the <hi>Apostle</hi> to
speak any more than thus much, <hi>Put not
your selves so under the power of any Man or
Men whatsoever, as to be in all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, at their Devotion. As to
subject your selves to their Lusts, in doing
those things at their Command which God
hath forbidden.</hi> And <hi>thus</hi> to do, 'tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
most freely, is <hi>with a Witness</hi>
opposite to our <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Notion of it, which in this
Discourse hath been laid down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by us.</p>
               <p>But it is, I think, a plain case, that
this Place hath been not only by <hi>these</hi>
men, but <hi>generally</hi> mistaken; and that
Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> is in the right, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the words otherwise than they are
translated, <hi>viz.</hi> thus: <hi>Are ye bought with a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100709:103"/>
price? be not ye the Servants of Men.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may as well be rendred, <hi>Are ye?</hi>
as <hi>Ye are</hi> bought with a price. So
that the meaning of these words accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this Reading is <hi>this,</hi> Have you
bought out your Liberty, and obtained
Manumission (having been formerly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to Heathens) sell not your selves
again. Return not to that condition of
Servitude, but prefer Liberty. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
foregoing Verses do greatly
favour this Reading, <hi>viz. Ver. 21, 22. Art
thou called being a Servant? care not for it,</hi>
think it not a disparagement to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for a Bondman to be a Christian,
<hi>but if thou mayest be made Free, use it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
Prefer Freedom, if thou canst law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obtain it. <hi>For he that is called in the
Lord, being a Servant, is the Lord's Free-man:
Likewise also he that is called being
Free, is Christ's Servant.</hi> So that the
23. Ver. follows these two very fitly and
pertinently, as we now read it, <hi>Are ye
bought with a price?</hi> that is, out of your
Servile condition, (and it was ordinary
in those days, for Christians to buy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from their Heathen Masters) <hi>be not
ye,</hi> or be not ye <hi>made</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Men.</hi> Or return not any more to
your former condition. Now,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:100709:103"/>First, For that Doctrine which makes
it a part of Christian Liberty to be freed
from all Laws that are merely Humane;
(which the minds of some Professors of
Christianity were leavened with, as I
might shew, even in the Apostles time,
and all theirs must needs have been, who
then held themselves disobliged from the
Moral Law) I say, as for that Doctine,
the Wildness thereof will be sufficiently
exposed, by that time we have considered
these following Particulars.</p>
               <p>First, There is no intimation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of any such Liberty as this. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think of any Text that so much seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to look that way, as <hi>this</hi> we have now
spoken to: And <hi>this,</hi> read it how you
will, cannot to any sober man, at his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thought upon it, seem so to do.
But</p>
               <p>Secondly, Nothing is more slatly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted</hi>
by the Holy Scriptures than this
Doctrine. For, Servants are not only
commanded <hi>to be Obedient to them that are
their Masters according to the Flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>with
fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as
unto Christ,</hi> without any such limitation
as this, <hi>If they command nothing but what
God hath required;</hi> But they are expresly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100709:104"/>
commanded, <hi>in all things</hi> to <hi>obey their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
according to the Flesh, Col.</hi> 3. 22.
That is, all things not Evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or not forbidden by any Law of
God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>All things</hi> must be so limited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
else S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two other Apostles, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who said to their Rulers, upon
their Commanding them <hi>not to teach any
more in the Name of Iesus, Whether it be
right in the sight of God, to hearken unto
you more than unto God, judge ye, Acts</hi> 4.
19. This limitation needed not to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,</hi>
because nothing is better known
from Scripture, nor from Natural Light
neither, than that no Laws of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Kings on Earth are of any force that
are contrary to any Law of the King of
Kings. According to that saying of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
if I mistake not, <hi>Obediendum est
Principibus, sed intra limites disciplinae.
Princes are to be obeyed, but no farther than
our Religion will give us leave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I see not how he can be better than a
down-right Atheist, let him pretend
what he will, whosoever patronizeth the
Leviathan Doctrine, that <hi>Absolute Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
Active no less than Passive, is due to
Governours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:100709:104"/>But to return to our present Business:
S. <hi>Peter</hi> is still more express, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. 18.
saith he there to Servants, <hi>Be subject to
your Masters with all fear, not only to the
Good and Gentle, but also to the Froward.</hi>
Or, though they require Unreasonable
things of you, if they be not forbidden by
a Higher Power, do you obey them.</p>
               <p>But I presume the greatest Zealots for
this wild Notion who have <hi>Servants,</hi> are
well content that <hi>they</hi> should have no plea
from their Christianity to disobey <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
in any of their Commands; but
are onely concerned to have their Notion
of Christian Liberty true in reference to
the Laws of the Magistrate. As if a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of a Family hath more Power over
his Servants, than a King hath over his
Subjects. Let us see therefore what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
we find concerning Obedience to
Kings and the Higher Powers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Peter <hi>saith,</hi> 1 Epist. 2. 13. Submit
your selves to every Ordinance of Man for
the Lords sake; whether it be to the King as
Supreme, or unto Governours, as unto them
that are sent by him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> Every Soul is <hi>commanded to
be</hi> Subject to the Higher Powers, <hi>because</hi>
there is no Power but of God, the Powers that
be are ordained of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:100709:105"/>And Ver. 5. 'tis said, <hi>We must needs be
Subject, and that not onely for Wrath, but
also for Conscience sake.</hi> But there is not
the least syllable, either in <hi>these</hi> or any
other places, of such a limitation as
might Reconcile these Injunctions with
this Notion of <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi> And
we may be confident, that if, by virtue
of that Liberty, Christians were disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
from Obedience to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
whensoever they required things
indifferent, (though very unreasonably
enjoyned, yet in their own nature not
Evil, and no where forbidden by God to
be done) the Apostle would have put in
this Exception in the last mentioned
place: The Emperor being a great Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and rather a Monster than a Man,
that then Reigned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If Governours can oblige us
to nothing, but what Antecedently to
their Laws we ought to do, there is no
formal Obedience at all due to them. I
am <hi>then</hi> no more bound in Conscience to
obey <hi>them,</hi> than <hi>those</hi> who have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over me, that are invested by God
with no Authority. For if such say to
me, <hi>Do not Kill, Do not Steal, Do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. I shall greatly sin in not
hearkening to them. And whereas it
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100709:105"/>
will be replied, that though such Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Persons not placed in Power
ought to be observed, yet not as <hi>theirs,</hi>
but as <hi>Divine</hi> Injunctions, I must needs
profess that I do not believe it neither to
be at all my Duty to obey such Laws of
our Governours under the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion of
<hi>theirs:</hi> My obligation to obey all the
Laws of God being as strong and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable
every whit, by virtue of His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Authority, as if they were backt
and inforced by never so <hi>many,</hi> and never
so <hi>severe</hi> Laws of his Vicegerents. Nor
can any of <hi>their</hi> Laws make what God
Almighty hath obliged me either <hi>to</hi> or
<hi>from,</hi> one iot a greater Duty or Sin than
it was before; For the Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath made whatsoever it hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
or prohibited, as great a Duty
or Sin, as it is capable of being made,
that is, considered in it self.</p>
               <p>It is so evident, that we are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to obey a Law of the Land as <hi>such,</hi>
which onely requires or forbids what is
required or forbidden by an express Law
of God, that the <hi>less</hi> respect any one hath
to Humane Laws in <hi>such</hi> things, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Iustly,</hi> in being <hi>Temperate</hi> and <hi>Chaste,</hi>
in <hi>attending upon the solemn Worship of
God,</hi> and the like, supposing he makes
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100709:106"/>
Conscience of them upon the account of
the Divine Laws, the better Man is he,
and the more sincere Christian. And
therefore such Laws of Men, as are
Enacted against what God's Law hath
forbidden, or do enjoyn what was before
commanded by God, are not made for a
<hi>Righteous man</hi> (as the Apostle speaks,
even of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>) but for such
Wretches as live under no Sense of the
Divine Sovereignty, and would not have
any regard to God's Laws, were they
not inforced with <hi>Men</hi>'s, having severe
penalties annexed to them.</p>
               <p>So that, if I am disobliged by my <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Liberty</hi> from Doing or Forbearing
any thing in Obedience to Humane
Laws, but what I ought to Do or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
though there were no Laws of Men
about it, that which I now said is very
easie to be believed, <hi>viz.</hi> That no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Obedience is due to Magistrates;
and they have no Power to make any
New Laws of their own, but onely to
take the best care that the Old ones,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Laws of God, be observed.</p>
               <p>And if it be so, what becomes of all
those Texts wherein Obedience to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
is with such strictness required
of Christians? This Opinion that Rulers
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100709:106"/>
have no Power over us in regard of our
Christian Liberty in matters of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Nature, doth make the Fifth
Commandment, and all those Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
perfectly insignificant. And the
Apostle might well have spared his
charge to <hi>Titus,</hi> To put those under his
care in mind, <hi>to be subject to Principalities
and Powers, to obey Magistrates,</hi> &amp;c.
Tit. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>This Monstrously wild Notion of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Liberty,</hi> I should not have taken
thus much notice of, as <hi>little</hi> as I have
said, but that of late days Multitudes by
their <hi>behaviour</hi> would make us suspect
they are infected with it, who yet will
not <hi>professedly</hi> own it. It is come to that
sad pass, that preaching Obedience to
Authority is become as unacceptable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
as can be to even many great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to Christianity, although it be
done never so prudently and agreeably to
the express Doctrine of our Saviour and
his Apostles: And the Notion of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for <hi>Conscience-sake</hi> seems almost lost
among not a few. Which is one of the
great Sins for which we have too good
reason to fear, there's a Heavy Scourge
near us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:100709:107"/>Secondly, As for that Doctrine which
limits our disobligation, by the means of
<hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> from the Laws of Men
that impose indifferent things, to those
that onely relate to <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God:</hi> That this is Wild too,
though more Sober than the other, will
appear by <hi>these</hi> Considerations.</p>
               <p>First, This Notion of Christian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
tends to introduce sad Disorder and
Confusion into the Churches of Christ,
and will certainly do it if practised upon.
I need not go about to prove, that the
Order of Ecclesiastical as well as Civil
Societies consisteth principally in the due
Regulation of things in their own Nature
Indifferent.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath enjoyned that in the
Church, <hi>All things be done decently, and
in order, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 40. But how shall
they be so done, if it be a Violation of our
<hi>Christian Liberty</hi> to have any thing impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon us by our Governours for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies
and Orders sake? <hi>Particular</hi>
Rules being not given us in Scripture
about this matter; which to be sure
would have been, were they not left to
the Determination of the Governours of
each Church, upon supposition that 'tis
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100709:107"/>
                  <hi>possible</hi> to give such as would well suit <hi>all</hi>
Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin,</hi> upon those words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor. 11. 2. Now I praise you Brethren,
that you remember me in all things, and keep
the Ordinances as I delivered them to you,</hi>
doth thus express his Sense about this
matter: Saith he, <hi>We know that every
Church is left free to appoint a Form of Polity
for it self, because our Lord hath prescribed
nothing certain:</hi> And he speaks this you
see, not as his <hi>own</hi> sense onely, but as the
sense, and that undoubted too, of his
other Brethren of the Reformation:
Whose judgment, were it needful, we
might largely produce to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
But there is no need of it, those
very Persons, who have been most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the contrary opinion being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to contradict it in their practice;
And, for Orders sake, to determine such
things in their several Church-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
as are left perfectly undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Scripture (of which might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
very many instances) notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their clamors against the Church of
<hi>England</hi> upon this account, as modest as
she is in her Impositions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Notion of <hi>Christian
Liberty</hi> is so great an infringment of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100709:108"/>
Liberty Christ hath left to Ecclesiastical
Governours, as not to leave them so
much, as it is certain the Governours of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church was invested with,
who yet were bound up and determined
in a very great number of Particulars.</p>
               <p>Over and above the Multitude of Rites
and Ceremonies which God himself did
annex to the Substance of his Worship,
we read of not a few others that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Men. We have a large account
of such in <hi>Maimonides,</hi> in his Book <hi>De
Cultu Divino,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>
themselves present us with diverse such,
without the least intimation of God's
dislike of them; a Summary of which is
to be seen in several late Treatises.</p>
               <p>I will onely instance in some few of the
chief of them, <hi>viz.</hi> King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the middle part of the Temple for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi>
1 Kings 8. 64. <hi>The celebrating of
the Passover for fourteen days by King</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs
<hi>order,</hi> although God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
no more than half that number,
2 <hi>Chron. 30. 23. The Yearly Feast of Purim,</hi>
Esther 9. 27. <hi>The set Hours of Prayer in
the Temple,</hi> Acts 3. 1. <hi>The Feast of Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
ordained by the <hi>Iews, 1 Maccab.</hi>
4. 29. in commemoration of the new
Consecrating the Altar, after <hi>Antiochus</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:100709:108"/>
had prophaned it. This Feast, though
God did not prescribe it, was Honoured
by Christ's own presence at it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.
22, 23. <hi>Several Alterations, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
that of the Gesture, in Eating the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over;</hi>
The which Christ declared his
Approbation of by his Conformity to
them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 20.</p>
               <p>To these I shall only add those two
known Rites of the <hi>Iews</hi> not commanded
in the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> That of joyning <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>
with Circumcision in admitting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes;
and that of the <hi>Post-coenium,</hi> or
<hi>Feast after the Passover.</hi> And these two
our Saviour was so far from condemning,
upon the score of their being of Humane
Institution, that his two Great Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
received their rise from them.</p>
               <p>The Texts which are chiefly urged, to
prove the Unlawfulness of bringing any
thing into the Worship of God, but
what He hath himself prescribed, are
those in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> wherein God
declareth his displeasure against some of
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> for doing those things
which he <hi>commanded them not:</hi> And one
in the <hi>New,</hi> but cited out of the <hi>Old,</hi>
where our Saviour reprehendeth the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
for <hi>Teaching for Doctrines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:100709:109"/>Those Texts in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> are
<hi>Lev. 10. 1. Deut. 17. 3. Ier. 7. 31. Chap.</hi>
19. 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 32. 35. But I wonder that
those who produce these Texts for such a
purpose, could not see without our shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to them, that they all speak of
such things as God did not onely <hi>not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
but had strictly <hi>forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 1. The thing which God
saith <hi>He Commanded them not,</hi> was <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>
and <hi>Abihu</hi>'s <hi>offering strange fire before
the Lord.</hi> Which was an Act of Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to a most express Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.
12, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That, in</hi> Deut. 17. 3. not commanded by
God, <hi>was a most hainous Sin, and a flat
Transgression of the</hi> First Commandment,
<hi>viz.</hi> Serving other Gods, and Worshipping
of them, the Sun, the Moon and the Host
of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> not Commanded, Ier. 7. 31. <hi>was
not onely contrary to the Law of God,
but a horrible wickedness condemned by
the</hi> Light of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> The burning of
their Sons and their Daughters in the Fire,
in the Valley of Hinnom.</p>
               <p>That which God saith, <hi>He Commanded
not, neither came it into his Mind,</hi> Jer. 19.
5. was the same <hi>Vnnatural</hi> wickedness,
viz. <hi>The burning their Sons with Fire for
Burnt-offerings to Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:100709:109"/>
                  <hi>And that in</hi> Ier. 32. 35. <hi>was</hi> the causing
of their Sons and Daughters to pass through
the Fire unte Molech.</p>
               <p>But what doth Gods condemning such
Abominable practices as these signifie,
towards the proving it unlawful to use or
impose certain innocent Rites and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
in Divine worship, which
are not expresly and particularly required
by God? But may be truly said to be in
the <hi>general</hi> required by him, as such are
necessary to the decorous management of
his Worship, and agreeable to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Rule, of <hi>Doing all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
and in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the Urgers of these
Texts for the foresaid purpose do reply to
us, that though they cannot deny but
the instances of the things <hi>not Commanded</hi>
mentioned in each of them, are things
also <hi>Prohibited,</hi> yet they are pertinently
insisted upon by them, because it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
<hi>implied</hi> in God's expressing them as
things onely <hi>not Commanded,</hi> that things
<hi>not Commanded</hi> in His Worship offend
him, as well as things <hi>Prohibited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I briefly Answer, that this is
subtil Arguing indeed, except it can be
shewed that God doth any where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the doing in his Worship what is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100709:110"/>
lawful in its own Nature, and no
where forbidden by him, under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a thing <hi>not Commanded.</hi> Which I
dare affirm cannot be shewed. And I
add, that nothing is more absurd, than
to build Doctrines upon Idioms of the
Sacred Language; but this is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
done by the men we are now deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with, as I am able to shew in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Instances.</p>
               <p>And if we should turn the Scales, and
argue thus, such and such things are not
Forbidden by God, therefore they are
Commanded, we should not be guilty of
a grosser absurdity than they are in infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from God's not having Commanded
them, that he hath therefore Forbidden
them.</p>
               <p>If it be said (as it is by these men)
that there is a general Precept, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2.
that makes it as evident, that things not
commanded in Divine Worship may not
be done, though they ben't forbidden,
as if there were <hi>particular</hi> instances of
that nature condemned, <hi>viz. Ye shall not
add unto the word which I command you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall you diminish ought from it, that ye
may keep the Commandments of the Lord
your God which I command you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:100709:110"/>I Reply, that if they be not mistaken
in the sence of these words, they will
prove <hi>more</hi> than is intended to be proved,
or than they would have true: Namely,
that nothing is to be done <hi>out of</hi> as well
as <hi>in</hi> the Worship of God, but what is
expresly and particularly Commanded.
But <hi>Episcopius</hi> (who may be listened to
in this matter because no <hi>Episcopalian</hi>)
hath shewed that these words, <hi>Ye shall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> add unto the word which I command you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Instit. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol. Lib. 3. cap. 8. p. 97.</note>
                  <hi>neither shall you diminish ought from it,</hi> are
<hi>no new</hi> Precept; but onely signifie, <hi>Ye
shall not transgress the Commandments of
God, by doing any thing</hi> contrary <hi>to them,
which is to</hi> Add; or by omitting any
thing <hi>Required by them, which is to</hi> Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</p>
               <p>And as to that Text in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Matth. 15. 9. <hi>But in vain do they
Worship me, teaching for Doctrines, the
Commandments of men.</hi> It is manifest,
that <hi>that</hi> which is condemned in the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
here is the setting up of their own
Constitutions in stead or in the <hi>place</hi> of
God's, and those too <hi>contrary</hi> to God's
Commandments. This is evident from
the Context. Our Saviour saith <hi>Vers.</hi> 3.
<hi>Why do you transgress the Commandments</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:100709:111"/>
of God by your Traditions?
<hi>That is,<note place="margin">Non solùm autem per praeva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricationem frustrati sunt Legem Dei, miscentes Vinum Aquâ; sed &amp; suam Legem è contrario statuerunt, quae usque adhuc Pharisaica vocatur. <hi>Advers. Haeres. Lib. 4. Cap. 25. p.</hi> 342.</note>
saith</hi> Irenaeus
<hi>upon these words,</hi> They
did not onely frustrate the
Law of God by prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
mixing Wine with
Water; but they also set
their Law in opposition, or contradiction to
the Law of God, <hi>&amp;c. And that so they
did appears by what follows,</hi> Vers. 4, 5,
6. For God commanded, saying, Honour
thy Father and Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ye say,
Whosoever shall say to his Father or his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is gift by whatsoever thou mightest
be profited by me; And Honour not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or Mother, he shall be free. Thus have
ye made the Commandment of God of none
effect <hi>by your</hi> Tradition. <hi>And then next
follows a Citation out of</hi> Esay 29. 13. <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Septuagint, whereof these
words are part,</hi> viz. Ye Hypocrites, well
did <hi>Esaias</hi> prophesie of you, saying, This
people draweth nigh unto me with their
mouth, and honoureth me with their lips:
But their heart is far from me. But in vain
do they worship me, teaching for Doctrines
the Commandments of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We will also consider these words as
they are recited by S.</hi> Mark, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 7.
<hi>with the Verse following.</hi> Howbeit in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100709:111"/>
vain do they Worship me, teaching for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
the Commandments of men. For
laying aside the Commandment of God, ye
hold the Tradition of men, as the washing of
Pots and Cups, <hi>&amp;c. That is, according
to Doctor</hi> Hammond<hi>'s Paraphrase upon
the place,</hi> You are those Hypocrites that
profess great strictness in performances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and practise in some external
things more than God commands you, and
impose these on others as the commands of
God, when they are only Humane Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
As for the inward purity of the heart
and actions, to which all God's Laws of wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
did refer, you take no care of them,
transgress against this substantial part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in the foulest manner, and spend all
your time in these External superfluities,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>shing of Pots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Ordinances of
your Rabbins onely.</p>
               <p>But what are the Hypocritical and
wicked doings here condemned, to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
determining of External Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of Administration in the
Worship of God, which are not onely
innocent in themselves, but also not set
up in the <hi>place</hi> of, or justling out, any
thing commanded by God, nor yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>as</hi> the commands of God. But
who can have the Forehead to fasten such
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100709:112"/>
high Presumptions as these upon <hi>our</hi>
Church? But I proceed,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As this Notion of <hi>Christian
Liberty</hi> is an infringment of the Liberty
which is left to <hi>Governours,</hi> so is it also
greatly injurious to the <hi>Peoples</hi> Liberty.
For it is a very highly to be prized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Peoples Liberty, that they
may without giving God an offence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to such Laws as oblige them onely
to <hi>indifferent</hi> things. And it will be an
intolerable straitning and confining of
our Liberty, it will be a very grievous
Bondage to us, to be always obnoxious
to the Penalties which are the Sanctions
of <hi>such</hi> Laws, and to other manifold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
that follow upon disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> according to <hi>this</hi>
Notion, is so far from being worthy of
our Saviour's purchasing, that 'tis infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more desirable to be without it,
in regard of the extremely mischievous
consequences which follow upon quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
with Authority about harmless
matters, which have not the least ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon our Souls; whereby not
onely those who refuse Obedience are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in their own Persons and Families
to great Evils, both Temporal and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100709:112"/>
but also the whole Community,
the Church and State too, by <hi>their</hi>
means. This we all know, at this day,
by very sad experience.</p>
               <p>This, I say, is such a Liberty as is the
occasion of lamentable Mischiefs both
publick and private, but I am wholly to
seek what Good can possibly accrue
thereby; and therefore we may safely
warrant it, to be no Liberty of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour's procurement, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>If we were well instructed in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Gospel Dispensation, we
should be very certain that whatsoever
doth no way tend to the Depraving of our
Souls, and the bringing us into Bondage
to Sin (Which we have proved to be the
onely Opposite to our Grand <hi>Christian
Liberty</hi>) cannot be unlawful to us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
because not prejudicial to the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Design of the Gospel, which is
the making us Free from the Dominion
of Sin. To which Design we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Precepts of our Saviour, the
Promises and Threatnings (and I may
add Doctrines too) are subservient. And
on the contrary, we may be as sure, that
whatsoever is apt to hinder the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this Design must needs be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100709:113"/>
lawful under the Gospel: As all that are
not blind, or do not shut their Eyes, may
easily see this same pretended Christian
Liberty most sadly doth.</p>
               <p>And there is nothing more apparent,
than that Obedience to Authority, in all
things not forbidden by the Divine
Laws, doth mightily conduce to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of Peace, Love, Humility, Self-denial,
and the like great Christian Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
But Disobedience in such matters
doth as much occasion the gratifying of
those Devilish Lusts, Pride, Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness,
Contention, Wrath, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Those that pretend it to be
such a Violation of <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> to be
obliged by Mens Laws to things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
if they will be true to <hi>themselves</hi>
and their own Principles, must not onely
refuse Obedience to the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of
such things, but to the <hi>Prohibitions</hi> also
of such things: As they must <hi>not do</hi> such
as are commanded to be <hi>done,</hi> so they
must <hi>do</hi> such as are commanded to be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</hi>
For it is as great an Infringment
of our Liberty to have indifferent things
<hi>Forbidden</hi> us, as to have them <hi>Imposed</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us; 'Tis a no less intrenchment upon
it, to be tied up from what we may ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100709:113"/>
to the Magistrates Authority <hi>do,</hi>
as to be commanded what we may <hi>omit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if the things which the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
now Refuse to <hi>do</hi> because Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
should hereafter be Forbidden by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
they would be obliged, in order
to the Maintenance of their <hi>Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
to be every whit as zealous <hi>for</hi>
them as now they are <hi>against</hi> them: Nor
were they so honest as they should have
been, but false to this their Principle, and
shamefully betrayed their Liberty, in so
patiently Submitting, when time was,
to the severe Prohibition of the same
things, though it was by an Usurped
Power too.</p>
               <p>What a strange Liberty is this, which,
in its natural consequences, tends to
make people so Humoursom, Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain'd,
and Opposite to Government!
Surely it can't be <hi>Christian,</hi> but the most
<hi>Vnchristian</hi> Liberty.</p>
               <p>If this Free Dealing should offend any,
I shall be sorry for it, but must withal
take leave to tell the offended, that it is
an Evidence of exceeding great Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
not to say <hi>worse,</hi> to be Angry with
those who endeavour in the Spirit of
Meekness, to convince us of our Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100709:114"/>
Mistakes. But such is the Fate of
Conscientious opposing Popular and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Errors, that it seldom meeteth
with better success, than kindling the
Passions, and sharpening the Tongues
(and <hi>Pens</hi> too) of those, who are most
obliged to be thankful for it: <hi>But Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is justified of her Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however it be taken, it was never
more seasonable, nor ever scarcely <hi>so</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
to do our utmost towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
of Peoples Apprehensions about
matters of this nature; when our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and Animosities about <hi>little</hi>
things mostly, (things very little in
<hi>themselves</hi>) and so great a Defection from
our Church, merely upon the account of
such things as are no where condemned
by the Law of God, nor are opposed by
any express or plain Text, but by exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
laboured and far fetch'd Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
have given our Adversaries
such Advantage against us, and do them
far greater service, than all their open
Attempts, or secret wicked Plots and
Conspiracies, through the infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God to us, have hitherto done.
God Almighty grant that <hi>that</hi> saying be
not to be applied to <hi>us</hi> ere long, which
was used of our Predecessors the <hi>Britains,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:100709:114"/>
when their intestine Quarrels had occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
their being Vanquish'd by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
viz. Dum singuli pugnant, Vniversi
vincuntur. While they severally contend
and quarrel with one another, they are all
overcome by a Common Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must confess, when I consider what
Excellent Treatises have of late been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
fraught with Unanswerable and
the most convincing and affecting Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to perswade our Brethren of the
Separation to ease us in a great measure
of our Fears of Popery or Confusion, by
Returning to the Communion of that
Church wherein most of them were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;
and when withal I observe what
little Success those Treatises have had, I
have as faint hopes as can be that so small
an endeavour as <hi>this</hi> should do <hi>any</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
But however, it is some satisfaction
to my Mind to express my Good Will.</p>
               <p>But we are told by <hi>some,</hi> that we may
thank the <hi>Church of England</hi> if ever the
Pope be again our Master, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>that</hi> Principle of Hers we have been
now defending, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Imposing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things in the Worship of God is no
Violation of Christian Liberty:</hi> And that
this Principle will open a door to Popish
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100709:115"/>
Conformity, if we should be once more
so unhappy as to be brought into Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke.</p>
               <p>To these I Reply, in the <hi>First</hi> place,
That 'tis unconceiveable how any thing
but Malice or the thickest Ignorance can
charge the <hi>Church of England</hi> with serving
the Interest of the Popish Religion: For
is any thing more Notorious, than that
almost <hi>all</hi> the opposition that hath either
<hi>heretofore</hi> or of <hi>late</hi> been made against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
hath been by the Bishops and the
other Clergy of this Church? To say
nothing of what the Separating Party
have done (though not upon that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign)
to <hi>promote</hi> Popery, which would
be as <hi>large</hi> as <hi>unpleasant</hi> a Theme to insist
on; what have they done in defence of
the Reformed Religion <hi>against</hi> Popery?
Have they all of them put together done
the half quarter part of that Service in
this kind, that <hi>One</hi> Excellent Dean of
our Church hath done? Truly I much
doubt it. And I think I may adventure
to say, that all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
can hardly shew of their <hi>own</hi> so
many Learned and Judicious Treatises
against the Body and the several Parts of
Popery, as <hi>our</hi> single Church can shew
of Hers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:100709:115"/>Again, Is any thing better known
than that the Priests and Jesuits, and
Popish Faction do at this time spit all
their Venome and bend all their Force
against the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
always have done? This sheweth
that <hi>they</hi> are well aware, though so many
among our selves will not acknowledge
it, but would have the World think the
directly contrary, that <hi>our</hi> Church is the
most Formidable of all their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>In short, Who needs Arguments to
convince him, that the <hi>Church of England</hi>
is at present our <hi>onely</hi> Bulwark against
Popery? As, ever since the Reformation,
she hath been acknowledged by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
beyond Sea, to be the <hi>strongest</hi> and
most impregnable upon several ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to <hi>this</hi> Principle of our
Church, that <hi>Imposing of Indifferent
things in the Worship of God is no Violation
of Christian Liberty,</hi> it is a most weak
and ignorant furmise, that <hi>it</hi> should in
the least befriend Popery. Those little
understand what Popery means that
think <hi>thus:</hi> For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:100709:116"/>First, There is nothing more plainly
demonstrable than that many of those
things which are imposed by the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church are far from being Indifferent in
their own nature, but the grossest Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
as contrary to the Doctrine
and Practice of the first Ages of the
Church; and, which is far more, as
contrary to the Laws of God and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ, as is Darkness to Light. I
have given a Catalogue in the <hi>Design of
Christianity</hi> of the chief of these,<note place="margin">Chap. 17.</note> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon them, and thither I refer the
Reader that needs satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Other of Her Impositions,
which are Indifferent in themselves, are
made to change their Nature by the
Notion under which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
by her. <hi>That</hi> Church enjoyns
no Indifferent things <hi>as</hi> such (as <hi>ours</hi> doth
all she imposeth, as appears by her 34<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi>
Article) but as made necessary by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority; She pretending to the
Infallible Guidance of the Holy Ghost in
all Her Decrees and Constitutions: And
therefore expects your Receiving them,
as you do the Holy Scriptures, with a
Divine Faith, and the self-same awful
Regard and Reverence.</p>
               <p>I might add too, that several of her
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100709:116"/>
Rites and Ceremonies are imposed under
a most Superstitious notion, either as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
conveying Grace, or as having
some special Virtue in them, to atone
the Divine Majesty, or to scare away the
Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is <hi>my</hi> opinion too, that
though their Ceremonies were never so
innocent in <hi>themselves,</hi> yet the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of them doth make them in the lump
to cease to be Indifferent. My reason is,
because it is unconceiveable to <hi>me,</hi> but
that so great a Number must needs so em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the Mind in the Worship of God,
as that it is not possible to be intent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
and consequently must frustrate
(at least in a great measure) the Design
of Worship.</p>
               <p>But this is no Reason to a <hi>Papist,</hi> who
cannot be thoroughly <hi>so,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the necessity of exercising the Mind
in Divine Worship: For his Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath taught him this mad and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Doctrine, That the Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Grace, <hi>ex opere operato, from the work</hi>
Done, and so are differenced from those
of the Old Testament, <hi>they</hi> conferring
Grace, <hi>ex opere operantis, from the work of
the</hi> Doer; as also that a mere general
Attention in saying their Prayers and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100709:117"/>
numbering them over, is as much as is
necessary. And if we can believe that
we need not <hi>mind</hi> our Prayers, we have
no reason to blame those of <hi>them,</hi> who
do not desire to <hi>understand</hi> them; Nor
yet their <hi>Church</hi> for enjoyning the saying
them in a Language which the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Her Children are ignorant of; as
if She designed in so doing to put an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
upon S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath taught us
in the most express terms the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Doctrine, in the 14 Chapter of the
First to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this Chapter: Our Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> is so very far from
befriending Popery, that 'tis not possible
it should have a greater Enemy; in that
it so highly conduceth to the advancing
of the true Spirit and Power of Religion,
and to the perfect ridding our Minds of
those two as Great Friends to Popery, as
Pests to Religion, and even Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
<hi>viz. <hi>Superstition</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I mean by these two a Base Unworthy
Apprehension of the Deity, and a Blind,
Irrational, Heady Zeal.</p>
               <p>If it be said after all, that supposing

               <head type="sub">An Answer to this Question, Whether the
Prescribing of Forms of Prayer, for the
Publick Worship of God, be not an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment
upon Christian Liberty?
Wherein it is shewed, that this is not a
Stifling of the Spirit, or Restraining the
exercise of his Gift. And what in Prayer
is not, as also what is the Gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Whereby is occasioned an Answer to
another Question, viz. Whether an Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for Preaching be properly a Gift of
the Spirit.</head>
               <p>WHat hath been last discoursed
gives me occasion to Enquire,
Whether the Imposing of a Liturgy, or
Forms of Prayer for the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, be not an Encroachment
upon <hi>Christian Liberty?</hi> I answer it is, if
that Principle taken up by very many
among us be a true one, <hi>viz.</hi> That this
is a Stifling of the Spirit, and a Restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Exercise of one of his Gifts.
If this be so, I say, it can be no better
than a very great invasion of Christian
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100709:118"/>
Liberty, and a far <hi>greater</hi> than the mere
obliging men to things Indifferent. For,
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. The Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>estation
of the Spirit is given to every man
to profit withal;</hi> and therefore for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to be limited in doing good by a Gift
of the Spirit, must needs be a robbing
them of that Liberty, which Christ in
sending Him design'd to give them.</p>
               <p>By the way, it shall be no part of my
Reply to say, that onely the <hi>Ministers</hi> are
here concerned, not at all the <hi>People:</hi>
For although a Conceived Prayer of the
Minister be of the nature of a prescribed
Form to those that joyn with him, as to
the confining their Spirits, yet the <hi>People</hi>
must needs be sufferers by means of their
Ministers being stinted in the exercise of
a Gift of the Spirit, since it was designed
for <hi>their</hi> profit; and therefore upon this
account, and moreover in regard of the
Countenance they will thereby give to
Authority in such a kind of Sacrilegious
Usurpation of power over Ministers, it
cannot be justifiable in them to Attend
willingly upon such Forms.</p>
               <p>But in order to the undeceiving of
those, who are so tenacious of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that a prescribed Liturgy is a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to the Free Exercise of a Gift of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100709:119"/>
the Spirit, I must freely profess, that I
know of no Gifts of the Spirit which we
have warrant from Scripture to believe
are continued to the Church at this day,
besides those which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the
<hi>Fruits</hi> of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. Where he
saith, <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Ioy,
Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Faith, Meekness, Temperance.</hi> These
and the like Christian Graces, are Gifts
which the Spirit still bestows, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called Graces. They are supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Gifts as no man by his mere Natural
power can obtain them, but only by the
Spirit's blessing of our Endeavours; and
to the sincere use of the Gospel-means
the Spirit is always ready to give his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
And the reason why in these latter
Ages, these blessed Gifts are bestowed
upon no <hi>more</hi> Professors of Christianity
than they are, is because the generality
of such are miserably wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to the Holy Spirit, in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to do <hi>their</hi> part, and to cooperate
with Him: Because they will not attend
to the evidence the Spirit hath given to
the Truth of the Gospel, and therefore
have too weak and ineffectual a belief
thereof: Because they will not consider
the Doctrine of the Gospel; they will
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100709:119"/>
not weigh well, and lay to heart its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
with the infinitely powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
wherewith they are inforced. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they will not listen to the Spirits
good motions and suggestions, whereby
he works in men to <hi>Will,</hi> and begets in
them good Resolutions, but do truly
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ench the Spirit</hi> (though that phrase is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sed in reference to his miraculous Gifts)
and <hi>resist the Holy Ghost;</hi> and because
they will not make a believing Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Him for his powerful Assistance.
I say it is upon <hi>these,</hi> and such like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
that the forementioned Gifts of
the Spirit are so <hi>rare,</hi> and that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of those who are honoured with
the Title of Christians are so destitute
of them as we see they are. Nay, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
are so befooled by the enemy of
their Souls, as to expect that the Spirit
should do <hi>all</hi> in them, without their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>any</hi> thing; that He should make them
Temperate, Righteous, Charitable,
Meek, Humble and Submissive to God's
Will, Heavenly-minded, and the like,
without their due attendance upon those
Ordinances of the <hi>Word, Sacrament</hi> and
<hi>Prayer,</hi> and serious Consideration and
Watchfulness over themselves, wherein
alone we have ground to expect the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100709:120"/>
working of the Divine Grace in
our Souls.</p>
               <p>But, I say, though these Gifts are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in so very <hi>few</hi> comparatively,
(the account whereof I have briefly
touched upon, and shewed that 'tis mens
own fault that they are not very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
yet we have no warrant from
Scripture that I know of, to call those
which are much more common, though
they are by many so reputed, Gifts of the
Spirit; notwithstanding the Prophecies
and Promises of so plentiful a pouring of
Him out in the times of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>There were indeed <hi>common</hi> as well as
more <hi>special</hi> Gifts of the Spirit in the First
Ages; For the miraculous ones of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all manner of Tongues, Prophesying,
Healing all sorts of Diseases, Casting out
Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were the great Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
to the truth of Christianity, were
very common. They were not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon the Apostles, but the private
Believers: <hi>These signs,</hi> said our Saviour,
<hi>shall follow them that believe in my name,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 17. And not onely on those
Believers who were <hi>sincere</hi> Christians,
but those also whose Lives were not at
all answerable to their Christian professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as appears by those words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:100709:120"/>And several of these miraculous Gifts,
we have full assurance from Antiquity,<note place="margin">Vid. Iust. Mart. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. cum Trypho. p. 247. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. ad Scap. p. 69: Rig. Orig. cont. C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did continue in the Church, though in
nothing so plentiful a measure, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
those of Healing, Prophesying and
Casting out Devils, till about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Fourth Century, when
Providence blessed her with a Christian
Emperor, and she came to be protected
by his Sword and Laws; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stood not in such need of those Gifts for
the keeping her in Heart, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
her Credit and Reputation in
the World.</p>
               <p>But as these have ceased for many
Ages, so the abovesaid Fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
are the onely Endowments now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
which may in a more peculiar
manner be ascribed to <hi>Him;</hi> that is, they
are the onely <hi>Supernatural</hi> Endowments.</p>
               <p>As to that therefore which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> we have these
things to say,</p>
               <p>First, That we have not the least rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe, that the expressions of the
very best mens Prayers are now dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Holy Ghost, or that they pray
by the Inspiration of the Spirit as to
<hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Matter.</hi> I know not that any
sober men do pretend to such a Gift as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100709:121"/>
this in Prayer, and too many of those
that do pretend to it do manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
by the management of their Gift,
that either they juggle and are gross
Cheats, or are sadly deluded.</p>
               <p>What slovenly, what ridiculous, what
bold and impudent expressions are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
heard from them? And what a
deal of nauseating stuff, that hath
brought a vile scandal upon Religion, and
furnished Atheistical and Prophane
people with matter of derision? Even
such stuff as that it is no better than a
Blaspheming the Holy Ghost to father it
upon <hi>Him.</hi> But I delight not to insist
upon this Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is objected, that S.</hi> Paul <hi>saith,</hi> Rom.
8. 26. We know not what we should pray for
as we ought, but the Spirit it self maketh
Intercession for us with groanings which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be uttered.</p>
               <p>I answer, that this Text makes not
at all for the purpose of those who in this
sence pretend to an ability of praying by
the Spirit. For, as for the Apostle's say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>We know not what to pray for as
we ought,</hi> it is to be limited to Temporal
things, and <hi>wholly</hi> to them: For we <hi>do</hi>
know that all those things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to our Eternal Felicity, <hi>viz.</hi> all
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100709:121"/>
spiritual Blessings, are to be prayed for.
And we do or <hi>may</hi> know what all those
are without inspiration. But we do <hi>not</hi>
know whether worldly Prosperity or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
may be best for us, or what <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
of temporal good things, or what
<hi>particulars</hi> of such good things; and
therefore in reference to <hi>these</hi> things, we
are not to pray Absolutely but Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally,
and with a Willingness to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
if God sees it not good to grant
them to us. And the following words
shew, that it is not therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the <hi>Spirit</hi> will put it into
Good peoples hearts, <hi>what</hi> temporal
things they should pray for, for they tell
us that He will back their Petitions in
Heaven by interceding for them, with
unutterable Groanings; not that He will
put words into <hi>their</hi> mouths, or suggest
matter of Prayer to them. I dare not
say, the Spirit <hi>never</hi> does thus, I should
be then too bold; but we have no
ground to expect or hope He should, at
least, in <hi>ordinary</hi> cases. In short, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
pretends that his Prayers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated
by the Holy Ghost, must have the
very <hi>same</hi> opinion of them that he hath of
the Divinely inspired Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:100709:122"/>Secondly, I say consequently, That
an ability of uttering our Minds to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God in great variety of words
and phrases, is as much a <hi>Natural</hi> Gift,
or a Gift acquired in an <hi>ordinary</hi> way,
that is, by study and frequent practising
and exercising, as any Art or Ability
whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Very bad men have been often known
to have a notable Faculty this way; and
so miserably weak and silly are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of people as to admire those for
excellent Christians in whom they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, though they know them guilty
of very great immoralities, and they have
nothing to commend them but this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
But there is no man, if he will
set himself to it, and he be <hi>made</hi> for it,
that is, prepared with a sufficient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Boldness and Confidence, with a
glib Tongue and a warm Head, but may
be excellent at it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I say, how shamefully ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and childish are the Vulgar sort
(I fear the much <hi>greater</hi> part) that this
dexterity at pouring forth words to the
King of Heaven without fear or wit,
with a mighty voice, great earnestness,
and abundance of action, shall gain to a
man a greater repute with them for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100709:122"/>
Christian, than all the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
real fruits of the Spirit put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Although any Hypocrite that is
qualified as we now said, may with the
greatest ease attain to it.</p>
               <p>Such a brave man as <hi>this</hi> shall lead mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
by the Nose, work his base de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
upon them, and infuse what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
he listeth into them. Such Babies
are the common People too generally in
the affairs of Religion, and their Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
concerns. But, <hi>Si populus vult decipi,
decipiatur,</hi> If Folk will be thus cheated
and made a prey of, who can help it?</p>
               <p>It may grieve us at the Hearts to think,
what work the <hi>Popish</hi> Priests and Jesuits
may hereafter make (as we know that
in Disguises they have already made sad
work) among these silly Sheep: No
men in the World having a rarer knack
at Extemporary performances, and at
Feigning and Raising of Passions than
many of <hi>them</hi> have. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The true Spirit of Prayer
consisteth in a deep sense of the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
Majesty of the great God, of
the infinite distance that is between Him
and us, of our unspeakable Obligations
to Him, and necessary dependance upon
Him: In an affecting sense of our own
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100709:123"/>
Wretchedness and Sinfulness, which
makes us altogether unworthy to appear
in His presence, or to receive the least
Favour at His hands: In a sense of His
infinite Goodness, Wisdom and Power,
and an undoubted Belief that whatsoever
is really needful for us, He knoweth so
to be, and is both Able and Willing to
confer it upon us, when we ask it as we
ought in the Name of <hi>Iesus.</hi> Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
entire Resignation of our Wills to
the Will of God, to have Granted or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to us, as shall seem most agreeable
to His infinite Wisdom, the Good things
of this present Life; and hungering and
thirsting desires after Righteousness, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those Divine Dispositions and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
which are necessary to our being
made meet for the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>In such things as <hi>these</hi> doth consist the
Soul and Spirit of Prayer: These are the
Absolutely necessary and Essential ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
thereof. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As for <hi>Words,</hi> they are but
a circumstantial part of Prayer, and no
farther necessary than as they tend to the
more quickening our Affections, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our Desires, inlivening our Sense of
the forementioned Objects, and keeping
our Minds fixed and intent; And in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100709:123"/>
Prayer, or Prayer with others, they
are necessary to enable others to joyn
with us.</p>
               <p>But the Omniscient God understands
the sense of our Souls, the temper of our
Spirits, and the desires of our Hearts,
though no <hi>words</hi> be used for the expressing
of them; And always measures our
Prayers by <hi>those,</hi> not at all by <hi>these.</hi> I
say <hi>not at all</hi> by <hi>Words,</hi> because if they
flow from an honest Heart, and a good
disposition of Mind, they cannot be so
faulty as to make a Prayer unacceptable.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is the same thing to
<hi>God</hi> whether a good Sense and good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
be from time to time expressed by
the <hi>same,</hi> or by <hi>variety</hi> of Words and
Phrases: And he who is affected as he
ought to be in the use of a Form, who
hath such Desires and such a Sense as he
ought to have (as thousands of good
Christians have) hath as much the true
Spirit of Prayer, and as much <hi>of</hi> it too,
as he can have who hath the most notable
Faculty at varying his Expressions. And
he who hath this Faculty but wants <hi>that</hi>
Sense and those good Dispositions, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
utterly destitute of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:100709:124"/>But it is incomparably most fit, that
there should be a Liturgy, or Forms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
for the publick Worship of God,
for Prayer and Praising of God in the
<hi>Church,</hi> and for the celebration of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacraments, with the other Offices;
because the publick Worship of God
ought always to be performed with the
greatest Gravity and Solemnity possible.
But such a performance of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
can never be secured, where Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are wholly left to their own Liberty,
and permitted to put up all the Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Petitions and Thanksgivings of the
Congregation, and to perform all the
Offices, in their own Arbitrary and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
Expressions.</p>
               <p>For though some Ministers who take
this Liberty may pray excellently well
when their heads are clear, and they are
in a good Temper, yet I doubt there are
very few who have always that Presence
of Mind, that Composedness of
Thoughts, and Constancy of Temper as
not to be forced <hi>sometimes</hi> to use many
Tautologies and indecent expressions.
But however the Church is never like to
be provided with such Ministers as shall
be able, for the most part of them, to
keep themselves from great confusion in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100709:124"/>
their conceived Prayers, from bald and
absurd phrases, and from Nauseating
their Auditory with repetitions of the
same things, ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om sayings, or lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
misapplications of Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
through over-much modesty or
other infelicities of Temper in <hi>some,</hi> and
in <hi>others</hi> through ignorance, or weakness
of Natural parts, either slowness of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
or want of Judgment.</p>
               <p>And besides, there is <hi>this</hi> necessity of
having a Liturgy, that without one there
is no rational way of perswading strangers
to hold Communion with us: Except
we can shew them something which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by common Agreement for
a Form and Method of Divine Worship,
we cannot satisfie them what publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
we perform to God, it will <hi>then</hi> be
so various, that is, as not alike in all <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
so neither at all <hi>times</hi> in the <hi>same</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>But to complete my Answer to the
Question in hand.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The affecting us with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Sense of the Majesty and Glorious
perfections of the God we pray to, and
of our own Vileness and Unworthiness;
And a Submissive frame of Mind to the
Divine Will; Ardent Breathings after
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100709:125"/>
more of the Divine Image and Likeness;
And a lively Faith in the Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness of God, which are,
as I said, the Substantial and Essential
parts of Prayer; all <hi>these</hi> we heartily and
thankfully acknowledge to be the Gifts of
the Spirit. We own them to be so other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than all other good things which
are every of them expressions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Bounty, and consequently Gifts of
the Spirit as He is one of the Persons of
the Blessed Trinity: But we profess to
owe them to the more <hi>special</hi> operations
and influences of the Holy Ghost; And
for the working and encrease of these, all
good Christians do daily crave the Spirits
assistance.</p>
               <p>Now I need not say, that to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to put a restraint upon the exercise
of such Gifts as these is a most wicked
invasion and violation of our <hi>Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
according to our <hi>own</hi> Notion of it.</p>
               <p>But what we have discoursed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prayer, gives me occasion to add
something of <hi>Preaching</hi> too, and to shew
also how far an ability for <hi>that</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
is to be ascribed to the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or called one of his <hi>Gifts.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100709:125"/>
we may from hence be satisfied,
whether a Preacher of the Gospel is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tled
to such a Liberty in reference to
Preaching as may not be limited by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
from him, without putting an affront
upon the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>First, It is out of doubt, that no man
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath the Gift of Preaching in <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the Spirit and of Power,</hi> in
the sence that S. <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellow-Apostles
had it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note> For by the <hi>demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Spirit and of Power</hi> is meant those
extraordinary Gifts of Speaking with
Tongues, Prophecy and Miracles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
their Preaching, whereby
they demonstrated the truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
preached by them.<note place="margin">Contra Cels. lib. 1. p. 4. Edit. Spenceri.</note> And so <hi>Origen</hi>
understands it, in his Book against <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is not the least ground
to believe that any man hath now the
Gift of Preaching by Inspiration, or from
the immediate Revelation of the Spirit.
Nor do any seriously pretend to it, but
wild Enthusiasts, Brain-sick, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Hot-headed people, who take their
own Fancies and Whims, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of an ungoverned imagination for
Inspirations. I say none but those who
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100709:126"/>
plainly discover themselves to be <hi>such</hi> do
<hi>seriously</hi> pretend to this Gift, because
there have been and still are a company
of Knaves in the World (as is manifest
by their actings) who, for the carrying
on their corrupt and naughty designs,
pretend to that which they are conscious
to themselves they have nothing of.</p>
               <p>But sober and honest Preachers of the
Gospel do profess to deliver nothing to
their people, but what they conceive to
be long ago revealed; But what they
acknowledge they have with study and
pains gathered from the Holy Scriptures,
either immediately, or by plain conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
wherein are contained all things
necessary to be believed and practised by
us in order to Salvation; and which,
without any Additions, <hi>are able to make
us wise to Salvation</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us)
and are a complete Rule of Faith and
Practice. And that Preacher who shall
offer to require his Auditors assent to any
thing not delivered, either in express
terms or by plain consequence, in the
Writings of the Old or New Testament,
doth impudently impose upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
except he be able to work real Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
for the convincing of them. He
takes more upon him, than either the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100709:126"/>
Apostles, or our Saviour <hi>himself,</hi> who
did still appeal to the works, the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi>
works he did, to attest the truth
of the Doctrine he delivered.</p>
               <p>I would such impudent imposers were
onely to be found among the <hi>Romanists</hi>
(who are <hi>all</hi> so, and the most impudent
that ever appeared upon the stage of the
World) but alas, they are too too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
also among professed haters of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And as to the <hi>sence</hi> of the
more difficult places of Scripture, no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Preacher pretends to come to the
knowledge thereof by the immediate illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Spirit, but such a one
acknowledgeth he doth it in the <hi>general</hi>
by the exercise of his Reason: And <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly</hi>
by considering the proper signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Words and Phrases in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Languages; by comparing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Scripture; by searching into
the Ancient Customs, which give great
light to a great number of Texts, and
without the knowledge of which they
are not to be understood; by enquiring
after the judgment of those who lived
nearest to the Times of the Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And after all, they submit their Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of such Texts to the judgments of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100709:127"/>
their Hearers, I mean <hi>such</hi> of them as are
capable of judging. As for <hi>others, Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet
discentes credere, It becomes Learners to
give credit to their Teachers.</hi> And <hi>Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
est peritis in suâ Arte.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We do piously, and by the
Authority of Scripture believe, that the
Spirit is ready to assist us in our Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Enquiries, and whatsoever
particular good means we use for the
understanding of Scripture, when He is
humbly and devoutly sought to by us;
and when without the least prejudice,
partiality, ill design, or sinister respect,
but for the best of Ends, and from the
pure love of Truth, we make Enquiry.
Thus even <hi>Private</hi> Christians are assisted
in the searches and enquiries which they
are able to make: For God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that <hi>The Meek he will guide in judgment,
and the Meek he will teach his way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, In composing also of profitable
Discourses, as we implore, so we have
the Divine Assistance, but we see no
ground to believe that we have it in any
other <hi>manner,</hi> than in other good works
of what nature soever.</p>
               <p>But as for the ready Faculty of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
from a Pulpit, and popular
speaking to a Congregation, we have no
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100709:127"/>
reason to believe it a Gift of the Spirit,
any more than the <hi>Lawyers</hi> strange readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in pleading at the Bar. And a volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of speech upon any subject whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
heat of Fancy, and nimbleness of
Wit and Invention, are as much to be
attributed to the Holy Spirit as such a
Faculty.</p>
               <p>And hence we may gather, that a
Preacher of the Gospel can plead no such
Liberty as is wholly exempted from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
by Authority. But one that is
known to have never so good a Talent at
Preaching may be forbidden the exercise
of it, till he hath submitted to a lawful
Ordination, such as was in use in the
Churches of Christ for Fifteen hundred
years together. And when Ordained,
he may lawfully have bounds set him as
to the <hi>places</hi> where he shall exercise his
Ministry in publick, and as to the <hi>times</hi>
when. And he may be forbidden to
meddle with such Arguments as are
above the reach of his Peoples Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
or are not like to conduce to
their Edification, and much more to
broach dangerous Doctrines, that is,
such as are so in the judgment of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.
And for his Disobedience,
and other Misdemeanours, he is as liable
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100709:128"/>
to be suspended or totally deprived of his
Ministerial Office, as are any <hi>other</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
               <p>I do but <hi>touch</hi> upon and give light glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at these things, because my present
subject will not give me leave to discourse
largely upon them, which would be too
great a digression from its proper busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

               <head type="sub">A Third False Notion of Christian Liberty,
viz. that which makes Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

1. That Conscience is not so sacred a

That what is contended for, is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Liberty of Practice than of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
The Author's Opinion in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to this Liberty delivered in Ten
Propositions. That whatsoever Liberty
of this nature may be insisted on as our
Right, it is not Christian Liberty but
Natural Liberty.</head>
               <p>THirdly and Lastly, I proceed to that
Notion of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> which
makes <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> a Branch of
it.</p>
               <p>But before I deliver my Opinion about
this weighty point, which hath occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as great Feuds and sharp Contests as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100709:129"/>
any whatsoever, I shall premise two
things:</p>
               <p>First, That Conscience is not so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
a thing as to be uncapable of being
Obliged by Humane Laws.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That no man can properly
be deprived of the true Liberty of his
Conscience by any Power on Earth.</p>
               <p>First, That Conscience is not so Sacred
a thing, as to be uncapable of being Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by Humane Laws. This is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
clear from what is discoursed in the
Thirteenth Chapter.</p>
               <p>But it is said by many that God is the
onely Lord of Conscience, and therefore
it is the highest presumption for Men to
go about to bind it by <hi>their</hi> Laws. It is
the sole Prerogative of the Deity to <hi>search
the Heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Icr. 17. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and try the Reins</hi> of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men; Conscience is too inward
and secret a thing to fall under Mans cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance,
and therefore what have any
of our Fellow-Creatures to do to give
Laws to our Consciences?</p>
               <p>In Answer hereunto, We have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
seen what S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sense is about this
matter, that <hi>he</hi> saith, <hi>We must needs be
Subject,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>or Obedient, and that not only for
wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</hi> So that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100709:129"/>
the Apostle was far from thinking, that
the obligation of Humane Authority is
founded in mere <hi>Prudence,</hi> not at all in
<hi>Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But no man in his Wits will say, that
the Laws of <hi>Men</hi> do oblige Conscience as
the Laws of <hi>God</hi> do. <hi>Those</hi> cannot do it
<hi>immediately</hi> as <hi>these</hi> do, but onely by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Divine Authority. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, <hi>Rom. 13. 1. Let every</hi> Soul <hi>be subject
to the Higher Powers:</hi> I think I shall not
be over-critical in saying, that is every
<hi>Conscience,</hi> for what follows proves the
obligation of <hi>Conscience</hi> to subjection,
and is an Answer to the foresaid Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against it, <hi>viz. For there is no Power
but of God, the Powers that be are ordained
of God, whosoever therefore Resisteth the
Power Resisteth the Ordinance of God,</hi> &amp;c.
So that all we assert is <hi>this,</hi> that we are
bound to obey our lawful Governours for
God's sake, who hath invested them
with the Authority they have over us,
and commanded us to obey those Laws
of theirs which are not contradictory to
any of <hi>His.</hi> Nor do we say that Humane
Authority can make more Duties or Sins
than God hath made, or to speak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and strictly, can make any thing to be
a Duty or Sin; for it can only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100709:130"/>
or Forbid, and what it Commands,
if lawful, the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> makes it
a Duty, and what it Forbids, if not a
Duty, the Divine Authority makes it a
Sin. Or to speak in the words of the
Learned Bishop <hi>Taylor:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ductor Dubitanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Book 3 chap. 1. p 21. Edit. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
doth not make the action of disobedience
to be a Sin. It makes that the not compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Subject is</hi> Disobedience; <hi>but it
is the Authority of God which makes Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to be a</hi> Sin. And what immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows deserves also to be transcribed
in this place, <hi>viz. And though no Humane
Power can give or take Grace away, yet we
may remember, that we our selves throw away
God's Grace, or abuse it or neglect it, when
we will not make use of it to the purposes of
Humility, Charity and Obedience, all which
are concerned in our Subordination to the
Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is also <hi>this</hi> difference between
the Obligations of Divine and Humane
Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> The Divine Laws bind our
<hi>Thoughts</hi> and the Sense of our Minds,
they bind us not onely to obey them, but
to think them also Wise and Good Laws.
But so do not Humane Laws, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
onely to Obedience, but not to the
thinking them such as <hi>ought,</hi> or are <hi>fit,</hi>
to be imposed. A man may think a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100709:130"/>
Law imprudent or unreasonable,
and be guilty of no Transgression, if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he complies with it; I
mean, provided he keeps his thoughts to
himself, or does not make them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>The forementioned Worthy Prelate
layeth down no sewer than Ten or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
differences of Divine and Humane
Laws in their obligation, in his <hi>Ductor
Dubitantium:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Book 3. chap. 1. p. 23.</note> Whether they will all hold
or no, or may not be reduced to a smaller
number, I will not take upon me to say;
but thither I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>And thus much may serve to be spoken
to the First thing premised, <hi>viz.</hi> That
Conscience is not so Sacred a thing as to
be uncapable of being bound by Humane
Laws.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I premise also, that no man
can be deprived properly of the true Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of his Conscience by any Power on
Earth, I mean without his own consent;
no Mortal nor any Creature is able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
it.</p>
               <p>This will appear by considering what
that is, which is called Conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conscience is</hi> The Mind of a man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as possessed with certain practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100709:131"/>
and comparing his own actions with
those principles, doth, according as he finds
them agreeing or disagreeing with them,
judge of himself; either absolve or condemn
himself.</p>
               <p>So that there are three Offices of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
The first is, That of assenting
to and embracing certain practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
as Laws for the governing a man's
self. The second is, That of comparing
ones self, or actions, with those Rules
or Principles. The third, That of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
judgment of ones self accordingly.</p>
               <p>Now that is properly <hi>Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and that onely, which relates to
the execution of these three Offices. But
the Acts of Conscience in executing these
Offices being all Internal, and within a
mans Soul, how can its Liberty in exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those Acts be infringed by any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Power? What Earthly Power
can make me <hi>Assent</hi> to or believe what it
pleaseth? Can so give Laws to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as to necessitate me to receive
them for such, and to think them good
Laws, and safe to steer my Actions by?
Again, how can any such Power deprive
me of my Liberty to compare my Actions
with such Rules as I think I am obliged
to be governed by? And, having reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100709:131"/>
upon my self and actions, and made
this comparison, how can any such Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
abridge me of Liberty to <hi>Absolve</hi> my
self, if I find my actions agreeing with
those Rules, or to <hi>Condemn</hi> my self, if I
find the contrary? Can make me <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi>
when I ought to <hi>Acquit</hi> my self, or
<hi>Acquit</hi> when I see reason to <hi>Condemn</hi> my
self?</p>
               <p>So that the Liberty which is with so
much heat contended for by <hi>some,</hi> and
inveighed against by <hi>others,</hi> under the
name of Liberty of <hi>Conscience,</hi> is truly
and properly Liberty of <hi>Practice,</hi> not of
<hi>Conscience.</hi> And the great thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
is, Whether a Liberty of doing what
a man's Conscience tells him he ought to
do, and of forbearing what it tells him he
ought to forbear, be an inviolable Right,
and not to be invaded by Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</p>
               <p>This being the true state of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I shall endeavour an Answer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
in these following Propositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. That there are two Extremes
about this matter to be carefully avoided.</p>
               <p>First, That of Asserting an unlimited
Liberty of practising according to a mans
Conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:100709:132"/>Secondly, That of over-great severity
in Restraining this Liberty.</p>
               <p>First, As to the Extreme of Asserting
an unlimited Liberty of practising accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a man's Conscience: This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be an Extreme indeed, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wild and mad one, if we consider that
there is scarcely any thing so extravagant
or wicked, but the Consciences of some
or other may urge them to it. Nay, it
is certain that men have pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for some of the most impious and
most villanous actions in the World. So
the Papists have done among our selves
we all know; And another sort of People
too, whose principles, though very bad,
were better than theirs. And it is not
possible for us to know that their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Conscience were <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re</hi> pretences.
Nor is it hard for us to perswade our
selves, that through the just judgment
of God for past provocations, the Spirit
of delusion may be permitted to have such
power over some mens Consciences, as
that <hi>they shall call evil good and good evil,
put darkness for light and light for darkness,
and bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter;</hi>
for we find a Woe pronounced against
such as do so, <hi>Esay</hi> 5. 20. which there
would not have been, if there were no
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100709:132"/>
such men, nor could be. And it is said
of some, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. that, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they received not the love of the truth
that they might be saved, God shall send
them</hi> (or <hi>permit</hi> to be sent them) strong
delusions (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, strength of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion)
that they should believe a lie: That
they all might be damned, who believed not
the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour foretold his Disciples,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 2. that <hi>The time cometh that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
killeth you will think that he doth God
service.</hi> That is, the time is coming,
when men shall kill you out of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
As no doubt the Papists have done
many thousands of good Christians:
And it is well known that their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
are such, as that they cannot be
true to them, and not think themselves
bound in Conscience to Stab and Poison,
Burn and Massacre all without exception
whom they call Hereticks, whensoever
an opportunity is put into their hands.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as cruel a persecutor of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
as he was before his Conversion,
did then think not onely that he did what
was <hi>lawful,</hi> but that he did his <hi>duty</hi> too.
For, saith he, <hi>Acts 26. 9. I verily thought
with my self</hi> (or I was verily perswaded in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100709:133"/>
my Conscience) <hi>that I ought to do many
things contrary the Name of</hi> Jesus <hi>of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi>
Among which things he reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the two following verses, <hi>Shutting
up many of the Saints in Prison, and giving
his voice against them to be put to death, and
compelling them to Blaspheme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No man is able to imagine what dismal
Effects Superstition and Enthusiasm may
have upon the Mind and Conscience.</p>
               <p>So that this will be easily granted me
by men of any Sobriety, that <hi>that</hi> which
they call <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> must be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
by Governours, if they will have
any concern for the Honour of God, the
Welfare of Religion, the Safety of the
Community, and the Preservation of
Government; it being impossible that
there should be any such thing as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if all shall be exempt from
Punishment who shall plead Conscience
for their Disobedience; nay, though
they should be known to plead it never so
<hi>truly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it being so evident that Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may and <hi>must</hi> be restrained in its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
we clearly gain one point by it,
and that no small one, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Liberty
of Conscience</hi> is <hi>not to</hi> be necessarily allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the notion of Liberty of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:100709:133"/>
For this Liberty as <hi>such</hi> is not an
inviolable Right,<note place="margin">Aquatenùs ad omne valet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentia.</note> if it be not to be claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all cases without exception.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to that which we call
the <hi>other</hi> Extreme of <hi>over-great Severity</hi>
in Restraining this Liberty, no man sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will question but that there may be an
erring on <hi>this</hi> hand also. But how to
steer betwixt <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> these
two extremes, is, I think, one of the
greatest difficulties: And requires a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the greatest Prudence with as
great Goodness. But as to what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in the <hi>general</hi> are to be taken, we
will adventure modestly to suggest our
Thoughts in the Propositions that follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. No such Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(for so for fashions-sake wee'l call
it) is by any means to be allowed, as is
apparently injurious to the Community,
and such a Liberty as can have no ill pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
influence in the Church or State,
both may and ought to be granted. The
welfare of the Community with respect
to both its Civil and Spiritual Interests is
the business and design of Government,
and the welfare of <hi>particular</hi> persons, as
they are parts of the Community. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100709:134"/>
not to grant to particular persons as
much Liberty of what nature soever, as
is consistent with the general Good or
Well-being of the Whole, is to hold the
Reins too strait, and to be over-severe
and Arbitrary. But it must be left to the
iudgment of our Governours, what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and proportion of Liberty may be
safely vouchsafed, with respect to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Community, both because
<hi>they</hi> are to be presumed the fittest Judges
of this affair, and because it is wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with Government for every
private person to be his own Judge. But
(as I need not add) Governours are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
as they will answer it to <hi>their</hi> Judge,
not to be hasty in making a judgment,
but to do it with the greatest wariness
and deliberation, because their being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in this point may happen to be of
very evil and mischievous consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. It is a very plain case that men
ought to have the Liberty of enjoying
their Opinions to themselves, without
their being extorted by penalties from
them. This follows from the foregoing
proposition, and if <hi>that</hi> be true <hi>this</hi> can't
be false. For if such a Liberty ought to
be granted as hath no ill Aspect upon the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100709:134"/>
Community, then no Body should be
compelled to discover his Opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
whilest they are kept within a mans
own Breast, they can do no hurt to other
Folk, and if they discover themselves by
<hi>Overt-Acts</hi> (as the Lawyers speak) there
is no need of using violent means for the
Extorting of them. Which is the cruel
practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and our
own Nation knew it by sad experience in
the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> How many
excellently good Christians were then
Sentenced to the Stake for their mere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to Subscribe to their as wicked as
false Doctrine of the <hi>Sacrifice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. To make Sanguinary Laws
against mere Dissenting from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Establishment, that is, when Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
from it is not accompanied with
a Factious, Schismatical and Seditious
opposition to it, is without controversie
Antichristian Tyranny. Of all the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensible
practices of the now mentioned
Church, there is none that makes the
Title of Antichrist more due to her, than
her prosecuting with Fire and Faggot,
and all manner of Cruelties, men who
are guilty of no other crime but that of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100709:135"/>
renouncing Communion with her in her
gross Corruptions.</p>
               <p>But suppose her Terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were as <hi>agreeable</hi> as they are <hi>contrary</hi>
to the Word of God, yet would her put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
men to death for their bare not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to those terms, speak her to be
utterly destitute of the true Christian
Spirit: And to deserve that Reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which her mild and gentle Master
gave to his Disciples for desiring him to
call for Fire from Heaven to destroy the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> for refusing to receive him,
<hi>viz. Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye
are of; for the Son of man came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
mens lives, but to save them.</hi> And if
our Saviour was so offended with those
Disciples for making that motion, though
He knew 'twas not made deliberately,
but in a sudden fit of passion, and that
kindled too by the quick resentment they
had of an high affront that was put upon
his Sacred person, how highly must it
needs provoke him to see Christians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
their Brethren in <hi>cool</hi> bloud, and
that not for so hainous a crime as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
his Religion, but for not being
Christians of their Mode and Form:
Which possibly considering all their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
(particularly their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100709:135"/>
the prejudices of which it is the most
difficult thing in the world one of them
to overcome, their Parts, Complexions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) may be more their misfortune than
their fault.</p>
               <p>Besides Sanguinary Penalties, or the
using of extreme Rigour of any kind to
compel men to come over to our way of
Religion, are the most <hi>improper</hi> means to
effect that end;<note place="margin">Religio co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gt non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test; verbis potiùs quàm ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beribus res agenda est, ut sit vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas, lib. 5. cap. 20.</note> that of <hi>Lactantius</hi> being
as great a Truth in all Ages as it was in
<hi>his</hi> and the two <hi>foregoing,</hi> when the
Church was subject to the <hi>Heathen</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
<hi>viz. Religion is a thing to which
no man can be forced, the Will is perswaded
by Words not by Blows.</hi> And the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
used by the most Ancient Fathers
against persecuting people for mere
dissenting in matters of Religion are as
strong against the persecuting practices
of <hi>Rome</hi> Christian, as they were against
those of <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan.</p>
               <p>And this means hath proved always as
unsuccessful as it is improper, the best
success it hath ever had hath been to
make <hi>some</hi> Hypocrites, and the <hi>rest</hi> more
averse and obstinate than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
That way of Religion they before
<hi>disliked,</hi> they now <hi>hate,</hi> and <hi>oppression
making even wise men mad</hi> (as King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:100709:136"/>
observeth) multitudes from modest
Dissenters in their own defence turn Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
and Seditious, and down-right op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers.
And nothing hath been more
ordinarily observed, than that Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth mightily <hi>encrease</hi> instead of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the number of Dissenters. As it
is grown into a Maxim, <hi>Sanguis Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
est semen Ecclesiae, The bloud of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
is the seed of the Church,</hi> so nothing
makes any party so considerable, nor any
thing gains them so many Proselytes, as
their bearing Death or Torment or any
cruel usage <hi>like</hi> Martyrs; which we need
not be informed the very worst of men
have frequently done.</p>
               <p>Thanks be to God the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is as far departed from that of <hi>Rome</hi>
in this point of merciless Severity, as in
the rest of her Abominations. Which
hath made me stand amazed at the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
out-cries of one or two of late
against our Church, as if the Inquisition
it self could hardly match her in her sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
cruelty towards sober Dissenters.
Such Libellers as these have as little <hi>Wit</hi>
as <hi>Christianity</hi> or Common Honesty; for
can they more expose their Reputation
than by publishing to the World such
things as <hi>every</hi> body can confute from his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100709:136"/>
own knowledge. These people cannot
but believe in their Consciences; that
modest Dissenters (nor <hi>immodest</hi> neither
as themselves know by experience) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hope to have fairer quarter in any
part of the Christian world, where there
is any Establishment, than they have in
<hi>this</hi> Church. Nay, that there is hardly
any <hi>one</hi> Party of the Dissenters that
would be half so favourable to the rest,
should they get into Power, as our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
is to <hi>all</hi> of them. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
of our divided Parties 'tis well known
have been tried in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and
<hi>New-England,</hi> and how exemplary they
have been for their Moderation towards
men of a different perswasion is too well
understood to be quickly forgotten. But
old sores shall not bleed afresh by <hi>my</hi> rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
them, as great provocation as is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by some at the most unseasonable time
imaginable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. But, notwithstanding what we
have now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Asserted, there is a necessity of
making it more mens <hi>interest</hi> to comply
with the publick Establishment, than
<hi>not</hi> to comply with it: Which cannot be
done, so long as those who are conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thereunto, and those which dissent
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100709:137"/>
from it, are both put into the self-same
circumstances. It is as good, nay <hi>better,</hi>
to have no legal Establishment at all, than
not to back it with motives of Temporal
Interest, to disswade from Disobedience
to it; it is so, so long as this sort of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
hath so great a power over the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of men, nay of professors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
too, as we see it hath; and so few
comparatively are governed by pure Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Conscience, as great pretences
as there are to both. Penalties of one
nature or other are necessary Sanctions of
Laws, and were it not for the annexing
of <hi>them,</hi> Laws would be so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
generally <hi>obeyed,</hi> that they would be
generally despised and contemned. Nay,
the perverse natures of men do so incline
them <hi>niti in vetitum,</hi> to do what's prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
through their excessive fondness
for Liberty, that I am perswaded the
way to have this or that done by the far
greater part, would be for Authority to
forbid it without a Penalty.</p>
               <p>And as for that Objection, that Civil
penalties make men Hypocrites; how is
it possible that those who make it should
not at the same time see, that it is as
much levelled at <hi>all</hi> Laws, as at those
which relate to matters of Religion?
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100709:137"/>
Then men ought not to be prohibited
Murther, Adultery or Theft under Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
penalties, because they will be apt to
make them Hypocrites; as 'tis certain
those are no better, who abstain from
those crimes from the mere fear of the
lash of the Law. But it is better for the
Publick that men should be Hypocrites
in their Obedience, than that they should
live in Disobedience, and somewhat
better for <hi>themselves</hi> too. And no man
will be made a Hypocrite by penalties,
but such a one as would disobey and be an
open sinner were it not for <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I add, that this Objection is also level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at leaving it to every bodies Liberty
to comply or not comply with the legal
Establishment. What a Temptation
would this be to those to plead scruples of
Conscience against some condition of
Communion, who are only swayed by
some motive of Interest (to get better
trading, to please their Wives or the like)
to leave the Church, and joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to separate Congregations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. We must distinguish between
a Liberty of serving God according to
our Consciences, and a Liberty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
others to be of our perswasion.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100709:138"/>
There is a wide difference between these
two.<note place="margin">See the Learned Dean of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on <hi>Josh.</hi> 24. 15.</note> It is inconsistent with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for this latter Liberty to be Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Nothing can come of Authorities
giving licence to Dissenters to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
to their several Parties, but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Confusion. I appeal to <hi>themselves,</hi>
whether if any of <hi>them</hi> now sate at the
Helm, and were in the chair of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they could endure to have their
Authority publickly confronted; they
know they could not, and much less give
Liberty, that is Encouragement, to
those to confront it who have a mind to
it. But what is it to put an affront
upon Authority, if publick Endeavours
to withdraw People from Obedience be
not so?</p>
               <p>It is the greatest immodesty to desire
of Governours such a Liberty as <hi>this,</hi> and
supposeth them either not to understand
or to have no concern for their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
as Governours. And those that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from the legal Establishment ought
to think themselves most kindly dealt
with, and to be very thankful, may they
enjoy upon tolerable terms their own way
of Religion, without free licence to do all
they can to encrease their Party. How
happy would our good Ancestors in the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100709:138"/>
Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
had Her Majesty vouchsafed them
such a Liberty as that! They would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have thought they could pay too dear
for't.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, what if a man be
immediately commissionated by the King
of Kings, as the Apostles were, publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to withdraw men from Obedience to
those Laws which require of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
things, and withal he prove his
Commission by working of Miracles,
is not Authority obliged to give Liberty
so to do in that case? Surely it is. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
surely it is <hi>not,</hi> but 'tis obliged to
do that which is much <hi>better</hi> than giving
this Liberty, and which will prevent all
need of it, namely, to Repeal those Laws
as soon as ever it appears they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to God; and so to make the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to them no Disobedience.
But if this be not done, the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
person ought not to expect that
Authority should <hi>give</hi> him this Liberty,
but he ought to <hi>take</hi> it, and to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that God will stand by him in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. Those Laws that enjoyn or
forbid things in their own nature Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100709:139"/>
ought not to be inforced with as
severe Penalties, as those which are
made for or against those things which
are good or evil in themselves, which are
commanded or prohibited by the Divine
Laws. Or the Transgressors of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jora
jura,</hi> the Laws of Heaven should be
more severely punisht, than the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
of mere Humane Laws. 'Tis
certain that the former sort of offenders
do deserve worse than the latter do.
<hi>Their</hi> crimes are of an higher nature and
more intolerable, and therefore it is
highly fit that they should be greater suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
than the <hi>other</hi> offenders, for the
more effectual scaring of others from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their Example, or doing like
them.</p>
               <p>All offences against the State are not
alike punished, neither should all those
which are against the Church. No good
man will question, but that 'tis a greater
Sin to be a Separatist than a mere Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in some things; and also not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God at all than to worship him in an
illegal way. To make no Conscience
of Receiving the Lord's Supper, than to
scruple the Gesture he is obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it in. Or, that Profaneness is more
hateful than unaffected Scrupulosity or
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100709:139"/>
Superstition. And therefore I think the
self-same or equal Penalties should not
belong to both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Common</hi> Equity requires this; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Rule our Judge hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
us <hi>He</hi> will at the last day proceed
with the Disobedient.</p>
               <p>And by this means will no pretence be
left to those, who take all occasions to
censure their Governours, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
of them, as laying too great
weight upon things little in themselves,
as placing Religion in them, and equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
their own Traditions with (and
much less preferring them, <hi>Pharisee</hi> like,
before) the Commandments of God;
and as having less Zeal for Gods Glory
than for keeping up the Reputation of
their own Authority.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>same</hi> as well as an <hi>higher</hi>
reason it is necessary, that as great care
at <hi>least</hi> should be taken to bring the open
immediate Transgressors of God's Laws
to condign punishment, as those who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are Transgressors of mere Humane
Laws.</p>
               <p>But there is one thing more that I
would not have forgotten, that the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Censure of Excommunication ought
not to be past upon any but the greatest
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100709:140"/>
offenders; among which (that I may
not be mistaken) I account (as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church did) all <hi>Schismaticks</hi> as
well as <hi>Prophane</hi> persons. To make the
smaller offenders liable to it, be it done
upon what pretence it will, is the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
way to make it contemptible. And
nothing is more contrary to the practice
of the Apostles or the first Ages than so
to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. Most favour may be reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
expected by such Dissenters as give
the greatest reason to judge that they are
<hi>really</hi> Conscientious in their Dissenting.
If any Liberty be left by Law to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
to shew favour in pitiable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
whatsoever it is, such Dissenters
ought to have the benefit of it. And
those may be presumed to be Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in <hi>reality</hi> as well as <hi>pretence,</hi> who</p>
               <p>First, Are observed to make Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the great and indisputable duties
of Religion. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, Who comply with the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
as far as they <hi>can,</hi> for ought
that appeareth to the contrary. These
we are bound in charity to believe are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
Conscientious in stopping where
they do. This proposition needs no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100709:140"/>
and this other is as clear, <hi>viz.</hi>
Those who give greatest evidence of their
being Conscientious have most right to
favour.</p>
               <p>But although it be not an indisputable
case, that <hi>he</hi> makes no Conscience in
some smaller things who makes none in
certain great ones; or that <hi>he</hi> who goes
not as far as he declares he <hi>can,</hi> is a mere
pretender to Conscience in what he saith
he <hi>cannot</hi> do, yet there is no injury done
him if his Governours have a strong sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of him, and he fare the <hi>worse</hi> upon
that account. He must then thank <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
for it, and not blame <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 9. Those have least reason to ask
or look for Liberty of Conscience or any
thing of Indulgence, who are for no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
having it besides themselves, and
give great reason to presume by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
in their present circumstances,
that were <hi>they</hi> in Authority they would
give <hi>none</hi> to those from whom they now
expect it.</p>
               <p>Such are all those who are not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Disobey the present Laws, nor to
draw others to their Party as much as
in them lies, but cannot forbear Railing
at, and passing the severest and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100709:141"/>
Censures, in their Common
discourse, and in the Pulpit and Press
too, upon their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Governours
especially, and those who are Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the Constitution. 'Tis not at
all to be questioned but such People
would Persecute otherwise than with
their Tongues or Pens, if ever they
should be furnisht with more dangerous
Weapons. He who shews his teeth at
me, I have reason to suspect would make
them meet, were he able to bite; in so
doing he shews his good will and what
he would gladly be at, had he an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
I wish the Papists were the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
people I could now reflect upon.</p>
               <p>Such too are all our peremptory Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizers
in Disputable points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who cannot bear to be contradicted,
though never so modestly, as if they had
gotten the Popes chair from him, and
<hi>their</hi> judgments were the standard of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy.
From whose Sentiments you
may not depart scarcely one hairs
breadth, but you immediately fall under
suspicion of Heresie, or some dangerous
error.</p>
               <p>I should be very loth these Stiff and
Supercilious men should ever live to be
my Masters; if they should, I doubt not

that several Points are so expressed, as
to admit of a latitude of Interpretation.
Who can believe but that these men
would be far more severe Restrainers of
Liberty, than those whom they so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of? I say far <hi>more</hi> severe, for there
is no Considerative Ingenuous and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
man but had rather have twenty
harmless Rites imposed on his Practice,
than two disputable and uncertain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
upon his Belief.</p>
               <p>And such <hi>lastly</hi> are those Parties,
who, whensoever they have had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100709:142"/>
have been Rigidly severe to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
from themselves. What security
can we possibly have, that those who
for the time past have been Persecutors,
whenever they had Power in their hands,
will never be so for the time to come, if
they should have Power? Especially if
they still retain those principles which
naturally tend to make men Cruel.</p>
               <p>Here if I expatiated I would have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to do with the <hi>Popish</hi> Faction, and
spare others, who though they have been
too guilty in this respect, yet not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to <hi>them.</hi> What is better known
throughout the Christian World, than
the Horrible Tyranny of the <hi>Romish</hi>
Church, than her most Barbarous and
Savage Cruelties towards those who
would not <hi>Worship that Beast and his
Image, and would not receive the mark of
his Name?</hi> What an Ocean of Bloud hath
this Ravenous Beast shed <hi>of the Saints and
of the Prophets of God?</hi> The History of
Pagan <hi>Rome</hi>'s cruelties towards the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in the ten Famous Persecutions is
far out-done by that of <hi>Rome</hi> Christian
(I had rather say <hi>Rome</hi> Antichristian)
towards poor Protestants. Guess we
what a prodigiously vast number have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
as Sacrifices to her Devilish Fury by
two or three Instances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:100709:142"/>It is computed that in the Massacre in
<hi>Paris,</hi> and other parts of <hi>France,</hi> were
Butchered about an Hundred thousand.
That of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> and <hi>Waldenses</hi> were
Murthered no fewer than a Thousand
thousand. That within the space of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  </gap>ate Horrid Conspiracy had taken effect,
we very well know.</p>
               <p>Those know no more of the Principles
or Spirit of Popery than a sucking Infant,
who can give the least credit to their most
solemn promises of a Toleration of, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
towards Protestants, although
they should back them with never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100709:143"/>
Sacred Oaths upon the Holy Bible,
and pawn their Souls upon their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
them with never so tremendous
and direful Execrations.</p>
               <p>And yet these men are so void of all
shame, that ever since the Reformation
they have turned every stone to obtain a
Toleration of their Religion among us:
And that notwithstanding the plainest
Demonstrations which from time to time
they have given us, that they seek it for
no other End, but that by the means of
it they may do that by Fraud against our
Religion and all that's dear to us, which
(thanks be to God) they are not strong
enough to do by force, nor by any other
methods of Fraud neither.</p>
               <p>Though they could never yet obtain a
legal Toleration, yet they have not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for indulgence and kind usage, but
this hath been so far from melting them
into good nature, that they have still ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Advantage from thence to lay De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
for our Ruine. At that very time
(and for some time before) when their
Gunpowder Conspiracy, not to be
thought of without the greatest Horror,
was projected and almost effected by
them, did King <hi>Iames</hi> treat them with
not onely extraordinary Clemency, but
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100709:143"/>
also Friendship and Bounty. At the
Trial of the Traitors, his Majestie's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torny
General observed, that <hi>that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was hatched at a time, when the King
used the greatest Lenity towards the Papists,
whom he honoured with Advancement and
Favour as well as others, and by the space of
a whole Year and four Months took no Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by Statute of them.</hi> And this likewise
the King himself remembred them of,
the more to convince them of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>And to pass by their Conspiring the
Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First of most
Happy Memory, and afterwards effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it by the hands of the Fanaticks
(whose instruments they were, not onely
in the not to be parallel'd Murder of that
excellently pious Prince, all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it considered, but also in the long
Civil War preceding it, as Doctor <hi>Peter
Du-Moulin</hi> hath discovered in his Answer
to <hi>Philanax Anglicus</hi>) I say to pass by all
that, to which nothing could provoke
them except the most Gentle, Gracious
and Kind usage, 'tis known to every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that nothing neither except the <hi>like</hi>
usage could provoke them to this <hi>last</hi> most
Inhumane and Hellish Conspiracy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:100709:144"/>And yet, notwithstanding they have
always been to us like the <hi>Philistines</hi> to
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> sharp <hi>Thorns in our Sides,
and Pricks in our Eyes,</hi> are they still so
impudent as to insist upon it as their
Right to have Liberty of Conscience;
and hope with the Assistance of their old
tried Tools at last to obtain it. And 'tis
matter of Grief and Astonishment to us,
that these will not yet see, though it be
as visible as the Light, that if with <hi>their</hi>
help they <hi>do</hi> obtain it, the best Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
they shall receive for their good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
will be the Inslaving of <hi>themselves,</hi>
and the Ruine of their Religion.</p>
               <p>I thought not of so far enlarging upon
this Proposition, but considering into
what a large Field I was entered, I found
it somewhat difficult to break off so soon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 10. In the last place, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
ought not to impose any thing but
for weighty Reasons; but what upon
the maturest deliberation they judge to
be necessary, or (upon one account or
other) very highly Expedient. To
make little and insignificant things the
matter of Laws is the readiest course to
beget in the People a sleighting of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and to lessen the Veneration
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100709:144"/>
that is due to Laws; And also gives ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
persons a great advantage, and
puts plausible objections into their
mouths against the Government.</p>
               <p>But, having taken leave to say what
becomes Governours, I am obliged to
add, that private Persons are no compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
judges of the Necessity or Expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Laws. And that it very ill becomes
them to be forward to Censure those as
needless, the reason of which is unknown
to <hi>them.</hi> 'Tis an Argument of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty
and pride to think, that we
who stand upon the lower ground can see
as far as those who are so much above us:
And a very little Prudence and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will serve to convince us, that those
much better understand the Methods of
Government than we do, and what is
fit to be imposed, whose whole Business
and Employment it is to Govern.</p>
               <p>We have certain Rules whereby to
judge of the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of things imposed,
but we may be easily mistaken when we
undertake to determine of the <hi>Fitness</hi> of
them.</p>
               <p>Thus having with submission to my
Superiors offered my Opinion about this
weighty Argument in the foregoing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100709:145"/>
I hope I shan't be censured as
immodest if I also add, that I do not see
but Governours might avoid the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
in reference to <hi>Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
as it is called, by having a constant
regard to such like Rules. And that the
<hi>Governed,</hi> on the other hand, by doing
the like, might understand without much
difficulty, within what bounds they
ought to confine themselves, in Craving
of their Governours or Expecting from
them this kind of Liberty.</p>
               <p>But I think it seasonable to suggest
this one thing more to <hi>these,</hi> that they
would so behave themselves, that those
who have Power to grant it as far as is
sitting, might not be tempted to think it
a thing onely adapted to the serving of
<hi>Interest,</hi> and by that means be the more
inclined to a <hi>total</hi> Refusing of any such
Liberty. I mean, that there be no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
given to what is so Commonly,
not without ground, said, <hi>viz.</hi> When
'tis mens Temporal Interest to plead for
Liberty of Conscience, then they are
Zealous for it, but the Tables are no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
turned, but who like them against it.
Were we as honest as we should be, we
should be more fixed and constant, and
not so vary in our Principles as our <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:100709:145"/>
vary. We should not in <hi>one</hi>
Circumstance build what before we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and in <hi>another</hi> destroy what we
before built: And so declare amidst all
our Stir and Noise about <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
that we have either none at all,
or but very little Conscience.</p>
               <p>But in the Conclusion of all, I must
not forget <hi>that</hi> which hath occasioned all
this Discourse about Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>viz.</hi> that whatever that Liberty of
this kind is which we have a Right to,
it is not a Branch of <hi>Christian</hi> but of mere
<hi>Natural</hi> Liberty. There is no Text of
Scripture that mentioneth <hi>this</hi> as a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Saviour's Purchasing, and
therefore no Christian may claim it <hi>as</hi> a
Christian. 'Tis due to men of <hi>all</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
who may be supposed to make

               <head type="sub">The Third Inference from our Notion of
Christian Liberty, viz. That Popery is
the greatest Enemy in the World thereunto.
Where it is shewed, First, That the
Church of Rome Robs those who are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to her of that Natural Liberty which
necessarily belongs to them as they are
Men, viz. That which consists in the free
use of their Vnderstandings in matters of
Religion. That She will not permit men
to Examine either her Doctrines or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
by the Holy Scriptures; nor yet to
receive the Holy Scriptures themselves
otherwise than upon her Authority. The
Wickedness of this exposed in two Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
The alledging of Scripture for it,
shewed to be the grossest Absurdity. Their
great Text 1 Tim. 3. 15. spoken to. Her
Tyranny over mens Minds further shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</head>
               <p>HAving now spoken to all the False
Notions of <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> that I
know of, and discovered the intolerable
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100709:146"/>
Mischievousness of them as well as Falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
I proceed to another Inference from
our Notion thereof, namely;</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That <hi>Popery</hi> is a Religion (if
I honour it not too much in calling it so)
that is the greatest Enemy in the whole
World to <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi> Should all
the wicked Wits in the World meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to Consult and Complot how to
Banish out of it <hi>this</hi> Liberty, they could
not devise more effectual means for the
doing of it than those which are pitch'd
upon by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And here
we will shew,</p>
               <p>First, That She Robs those who Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
themselves to her, of that <hi>Natural</hi>
Liberty which necessarily belongs to
them as they are <hi>Men,</hi> or Reasonable
Creatures. And much more,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That She Robs them of that
Liberty, which it was the Design of our
Saviour's Coming into the World, and
of all he <hi>did</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> here to instate
us in.</p>
               <p>First, That She Robs those, who Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
themselves to her, of that <hi>Natural</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
which necessarily belongs to them
as <hi>Men,</hi> or Reasonable Creatures. There
is no Liberty so Essential to Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or so much its Inviolable Right, as
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100709:147"/>
that which consists in the free use of our
Understandings: But a <hi>Papist</hi> is misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
tied up and inslaved here; and that
in those matters wherein it is of Infinitely
the greatest Importance and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him, that his Mind should be
free, namely in matters of <hi>Religion;</hi>
which have such a necessary influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Welfare of our Souls and our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Happiness.</p>
               <p>But, notwithstanding that Injunction
of S. <hi>Paul, 1 Thes. 5. 21. Prove all things,
hold fast that which is good.</hi> And that of
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 Epist. 4. 1. <hi>Beloved believe not
every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they
be of God,</hi> &amp;c. This Church denieth to
her Children all judgment of Discretion
in Points of Religion; at least except in
this one Point, the choice of the Church
for their Guide, which having Chosen,
they must follow her blind-fold all their
lives after. They must be <hi>Implicit</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100709:147"/>
the forementioned one thing, (nay, for
<hi>that</hi> too, as we shall see anon) is to put
an Affront upon Her Authority; and the
<hi>Bereans,</hi> who were so highly commended
for so doing, were guilty of great Sauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and high Presumption.</p>
               <p>And She takes the most successful
course that can be thought of, that you
shall not <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> by locking
them up as She does, and making the
Bible so scarce a Book to be light upon,
where she hath Power enough to do it;
and in those places where her Power is
Clipt, by using a many wicked Artifices
to keep the Vulgar from looking into it;
who are so miserably imposed upon by
their wretched Priests, as to think it a
lighter sin to be Drunk or to commit For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
and transgress many an express
Law of God, than to cast their Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Holy Scriptures. So well aware
is this Church, that a great part of her
Religion is neither to be found there,
nor agreeable with them, but as expresly,
as it can be done by words, contradicted
by them.</p>
               <p>And as you may not Examine any of
her Doctrines or Practices by comparing
them with the Rule of Faith and Practice,
the Scriptures, so neither (which is but a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100709:148"/>
necessary consequence from thence)
may you have any other Foundation
for your Belief of the Books of Scripture
<hi>themselves,</hi> besides <hi>her</hi> Authority. She
will have your Assent to their being of
Divine Authority to depend wholly upon
her Testimony; Notwithstanding that
God Almighty hath vouchsafed to the
World marvellously full and plentiful
Evidence thereof, and such as is adapted
to the capacities of all those who have the
use of Reason, but never <hi>once</hi> mentioned
<hi>this</hi> as a part of that Evidence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
much less can it be thought the
<hi>Whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How infinitely ill hath this Corrupt
Church deserved at the hands of all
Christians, although <hi>this</hi> were the onely
Abuse she had put upon them!</p>
               <p>For (to say nothing of her Horrible
Pride and Uncharitableness in making
the truth of the Scriptures dependent on
her Testimony, that her Pretence suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
her making her self the <hi>onely</hi> true
Church) this is the greatest injury ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to Christianity; nor can she take
a surer course than <hi>this</hi> to make all men
Infidels. And that upon these two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:100709:148"/>First, This Pretence of hers is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
founded upon a Precarious and
most Evidently false Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That
of her <hi>Infallibility.</hi> I dare appeal to those
of her own Sons who have studied the
Controversie, whether there was ever a
more shamefully baffled Cause in the
World than <hi>this</hi> is: Whether by their
Infallible Church they mean with the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
the <hi>Pope</hi> alone, or with <hi>others</hi> the
<hi>Pope</hi> with his General Council, that is,
a pack of Bishops and Priests of his own
Faction.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, <hi>If the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be destroyed, what shall the Righteous
do?</hi> So if this be the Foundation of our
Christian Faith, and that be proved to be
a Rotten Foundation (as nothing was
ever proved if this be not) then what
shall we Christians do? We must then
acknowledge our selves a Generation of
most Credulous Fools, and that <hi>our Faith
is vain.</hi> If the Foundation be tottering,
the whole Superstructure must fall to the
Ground.</p>
               <p>But so fond is this Unsatiably Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and Ambitious Church of her Great
<hi>Diana</hi> Infallibility, by the Pretence
whereof she hath raised her self to such a
Height and Grandeur, that she is well
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100709:149"/>
content, if that must fall, that our Saviour
and his Apostles, both the Old and New
Testament should fall with it. And she
hath done all that lies in her to make it
necessary, that those who shall have the
wisdom to reject her Ridiculous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Infallibility, should at the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
time renounce Christianity.</p>
               <p>If Popery were Chargeable with no
other Crime (as it is with innumerable
others, and many of them <hi>intolerable</hi>)
I say were it Chargeable with no other
Crime, but the making our Belief of the
Authority of the Books of Scripture to
be founded on the Infallibility of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>
Faction, we ought to be as zealous
for the Preventing its Reestablishment
in this Nation (from whence it hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
been twice Expelled) as we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to Preserve the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Romish</hi> Churche's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her Authority the sole Foundation
of our Belief of the Scriptures makes the
Testimony of the Spirit to the Truth of
Christianity, in our Saviour when on
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arth, and in the Apostles and others in
the Primitive Ages, to be <hi>now</hi> perfectly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant.
I think it makes them to be
so as to the Church <hi>Representative,</hi> for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100709:149"/>
she pretends to her Infallibility (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to her Infallible Assurance of
the Truth of Christianity) as an <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te</hi>
Gift of the Holy Ghost, therefore
what need hath she of the Testimony of
Miracles? But as to <hi>Private</hi> Christians
I can by no means understand in what
stead they stand <hi>them;</hi> for if the Churches
Authority be necessary to their believing
the truth of the Scriptures, and therefore
to their believing that there were those
Miracles <hi>really</hi> wrought, which the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Apostles tell us of, then why
may they not without any more ado
make her Authority the <hi>immediate</hi> ground
of their Assent to the truth of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
               <p>It is said that the truth of the Matters
of Fact are not knowable at this distance,
(such as whether there were such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as our Saviour and his Apostles,
whether they performed such Miracles,
and the Apostles wrote such Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
but by the Tradition of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no such Matters are to be known at
any considerable distance, but by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>To this it is Answered, that it is <hi>one</hi>
thing to believe the Matters of Fact upon
the Churche's <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100709:150"/>
believe them upon her <hi>Authority</hi> founded
upon her Infallibility. Now this latter
we reject, but adhere to the former, as a
Ground of our belief of those things.</p>
               <p>But then by the Tradition of the
<hi>Church</hi> we are far from meaning that of
<hi>Rome</hi> onely. We mean the <hi>Catholick</hi>
Church, or the whole Collective Body
of Christians throughout the World,
from the Apostles times down to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Age; of which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
is but a Part (and therefore does Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in appropriating Catholicism to
her self) and that a very Vitiated Part
too, and that Church <hi>Representative</hi> an
exceedingly <hi>small</hi> Part.</p>
               <p>And we receive the Tradition of the
Catholick Church as a Ground (as I
said) of believing these Matters, not as
<hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> Ground, because we take in another
Tradition, <hi>viz.</hi> that of those who are out
of the Church, and Enemies to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the <hi>Iews</hi> especially.</p>
               <p>In short, we believe those and the like
matters of Fact, upon the same ground
that we believe all other wherein Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not concerned; but there are Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
which give the Tradition of
<hi>Christian</hi> matters of Fact a mighty Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
above other Traditions, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100709:150"/>
Assurance as <hi>these</hi> give men,
when they are General and Uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>But 'tis well known to all who are not
strangers to the Popish Writers, what
lamentable work they make in proving
the Testimony of the Church to be the
foundation of our Faith concerning the
Authority of the Scriptures. This Proof
they fetch out of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and their main Text for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and for the Infallibility of their
Church is those words of S. <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi>
3. 15. where he calls the Church <hi>the Pillar
and Ground of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what a manifest Circle is this?
We ask them, how it appears that the
Scriptures are the Word of God? They
answer, it appears from the Testimony
of the Church. We ask again, how it
appears that the Testimony of the Church
is true? They reply, it appears from the
Scriptures. And so they prove the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scriptures by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Church, and then wheel about
again, and prove the Authority of the
Church by the Testimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:100709:151"/>But again, We can either be certain
of the truth of these words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aside the Authority of the Church,
or we cannot be Certain. If we <hi>can</hi> be
Certain, why then not of the truth of
the whole Scripture as well as of this
single Text? If we <hi>cannot</hi> be certain of
the truth of this Text without the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Churche's Authority,
what Folly or rather Knavery is it to
make this Text an Argument to prove
the thing in Controversie by, when the
truth of this Text is questionable upon
the same grounds that the truth of the
Scriptures in <hi>general</hi> is?</p>
               <p>Again, When they say that the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Church is the Ground of this
our Faith, they tell us, that by the <hi>Church</hi>
they mean the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that
<hi>She</hi> onely is the True Church. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that there are a many Societies of
Christians in the World, that hold no
Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and Each of these calls it self a True
Church, and therefore how shall we
know that they are none of them so, but
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alone is? They
tell us, that <hi>this</hi> Church alone hath the
Notes and Characters of the True
Church. We ask again, how it doth
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100709:151"/>
appear that those Notes and Characters
they give are true and genuine, and, if
they are, that <hi>their</hi> Church onely hath
them? Here they are forced to fly again
to the Scriptures, and produce us some
which they would have us believe are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pertinent to the purpose; though none
but those who see by <hi>their</hi> Light are able
to discern any such matter. But whether
they be to the purpose or no, is no part
now of our Enquiry, but this is that
which we shew from hence, how still
they are intangled in their own Net, and
Run round in a Circle.</p>
               <p>Yet once again, these People would
perswade us that there is no knowing the
Scriptures to be of Divine Authority,
but by the Testimony of <hi>their</hi> Church,
whenas 'tis impossible to know that there
is any such thing in being as <hi>a</hi> Church,
but by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And thus you see what prime Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
these <hi>Romanists</hi> are, what Worthy
Catholicks. If there were no better
Champions than <hi>these</hi> for the Authority
of the Scriptures, or the Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
Atheists and Infidels long since
would have filled all Places: As it is well
known how they abound in the Popish
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100709:152"/>
Countries, and most of all in <hi>Italy,</hi> and
of all <hi>Italy</hi> most in <hi>Rome.</hi> And but for
Old Mother <hi>Ignorance,</hi> whom they have
a marvellous Fondness for, as well they
may, their Holy Mother the <hi>Church</hi>
would by this time have had but a very
small number of Children or Friends.
But I would this had been the worst on't,
as alas it is not: For Multitudes among
them being well aware that they are
merely imposed on; and being Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with no better than an Implicit Faith,
and thinking that no more is to be said
for <hi>Christianity</hi> than they learn from <hi>them,</hi>
shake off both their <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi>
Faith together.</p>
               <p>But we must not let that foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Text wholly pass on which is laid such
mighty Stress for the proving of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; which
gives her such a plausible Pretence for the
Enslaving of Mens Minds and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</p>
               <p>The whole Verse runs thus, with the
Verse foregoing: <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e things write I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly. But
if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how
thou oughtest to behave thy self in the House
of God, which is the Church of the living
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100709:152"/>
God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Episcopius</hi> his reading of these
latter words, it is not the <hi>Church</hi> that is
here called <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Instit. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but <hi>God manifested in the flesh, justified in
the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. in the next Verse. For
he makes that 15. Verse to conclude with
<hi>living God,</hi> (Verses and Pointings being
arbitrary) and <hi>The Pillar and Ground of
Truth</hi> to begin the next Verse thus, <hi>The
Pillar and Ground of Truth, and without
controversie the great Mystery of Godliness,
is God manifested in the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. But
there is no need of using any artifice to
make these words unserviceable to the
design of proving the Infallibility of the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for all that can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from them is no more than <hi>this;</hi>
That the Church is the support of that
Truth which is necessary to Salvation,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Doctrine of the Gospel. That
which preserveth it in the world is the
Churches constant profession of it, and
standing up for it. That is, this is the
<hi>External</hi> and <hi>Visible</hi> means whereby this
Truth is kept from perishing and being
lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or according to</hi> Grotius, The Church
doth uphold and lift up the Truth, it causeth
it not to slip out of mens minds, and also to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100709:153"/>
be beheld far and near. For the Testimony
of many good men, who all say that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
these Doctrines and Precepts from the
Apostles, must needs have great force and
efficacy upon those who are not obstinate and
contumacious. <hi>So that,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, This Great man seems to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by the Church in this place onely
<hi>that</hi> which was most Ancient. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is no reason at all to
understand by the <hi>Church</hi> here onely the
Church <hi>Representative,</hi> but the <hi>whole
Body of Christians</hi> must necessarily be
meant; It being called the <hi>House of God,</hi>
but the <hi>Apostles, Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> are
called the <hi>Builders</hi> of the House, and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi>
never the <hi>House</hi> it self. And
besides, the <hi>Church</hi> which is here called
<hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth</hi> is that over
part of which <hi>Timothy</hi> presided. <hi>That
thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave
thy self in the House of God,</hi> &amp;c. that is,
as a Bishop and Pastor in it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it should be understood of
the Church <hi>Representative,</hi> 'tis however
intolerable impudence to make it onely
the <hi>Roman.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This Text makes nothing
to the purpose of Infallibility in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s sence, understand by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100709:153"/>
                  <hi>the Church of the living God</hi> which Church
you please; especially if you do not limit
it to the First Age: As is plain from
what hath been said, and it needs no
more words to make it plainer.</p>
               <p>Now how can we have greater assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Impostor than <hi>this</hi> one thing gives
us, <hi>viz.</hi> That She will not allow us the
Liberty of judging for our selves? The
Great Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> allowed this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in those words: <hi>I
speak as unto wise men, judge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e what I say,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 15. And dare they say, that he
overshot himself in that saying, or passed
a mere Complement upon the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi>
'Twill not be at all strange if they
do, considering how many worse things
several of them have said of <hi>this</hi> Apostle.
But, I say, this Church will not permit
us to see with our own Eyes, but we
must take the whole of our Religion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
trust, that is, upon <hi>her</hi> bare word,
pin our whole Faith upon <hi>her</hi> Sleeve, and
receive the most Fundamental Articles
upon <hi>her</hi> Warrant and Authority. Nay,
though she would seem to give us leave
to use our Reason in the choice of our
<hi>Church,</hi> yet neither doth she this <hi>really;</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:100709:154"/>
but what she gives with <hi>one</hi> hand takes
away again with the <hi>other,</hi> in that she
will not suffer us to judge of the sence of
Scripture, and consequently not of <hi>those</hi>
Texts whereby she pretends to prove her
self the onely true Church. For if we be
acknowledged to be Competent judges
of the true meaning of <hi>some</hi> Scriptures,
why not of <hi>all</hi> that are as easily intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
as those are?</p>
               <p>Those must be very Charitable, who
can put a fairer Interpretation upon this
her Severity than <hi>this,</hi> that it is designed
to make us swallow without Chewing,
receive without Examining the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which are of her own invention;
and obey blindfold those Decrees of hers,
which she is Conscious to her Self, have
not onely no <hi>Countenance</hi> from the Holy
Scriptures, but are as apparently <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory</hi>
to them, as any one Proposition
can be to another; and are framed for no
other purpose, but the serving of a
worldly and most corrupt Interest, and
the gratifying of those Appetites which
it is the Business of Christianity to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
and Mortifie, <hi>viz.</hi> Unsatiable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
Luciferian Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Diabolical Revenge and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:100709:154"/>Again, what greater Tyranny can be
Exercised over a mans Mind, than to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon his Faith, and that upon pain
of Damnation, not onely the strangest
Absurdities and greatest Fooleries, but
the grossest, most manifest and palpable
Contradictions? But the <hi>Romish</hi> Church
requireth your Belief of Innumerable of
<hi>these</hi> in that her one Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</p>
               <p>Nay, in imposing this mad Doctrine
upon you, she also tieth you up from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Credit to your very <hi>Senses,</hi> no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               <p>SEcondly, As <hi>Popery</hi> deprives men of

                  </gap> an Enemy as can be to <hi>Christian</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Both to that Liberty which our
Saviour hath purchased for the World in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100709:155"/>
general, and to <hi>that</hi> which He purchased
for the <hi>Iews</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p>First, It is as opposite and injurious as
can be to that Liberty which our Saviour
hath purchased for the World in general.
This Liberty we have abundantly proved
doth consist in Freedom from the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Corrupt Affections, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Compliance with the Laws of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
Upon which follow Freedom
from the Power of Troublesom and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
Passions, and Sweet Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Self-Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>Now it will fully appear, that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Religion is as opposite as can be to
the Liberty which consisteth in <hi>these</hi>
things, by that time we have dispatched
these following particulars; whereon
should I give my self leave to be as large
as I might, I should write a large Volume
instead of a Chapter.</p>
               <p>First, Popery in its own nature tend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth,
as much as is possible, to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
and Debauching our Souls by
bringing them into Subjection to Vile
Affections.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It no less tendeth to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
our Minds with Troublesom and
Tormenting Passions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:100709:156"/>Thirdly, It makes the Admirable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which we have shewed our Lord
hath taken for our Deliverance from
both, and the making of us Holy and
Happy, perfectly Ineffectual.</p>
               <p>First, It in its own nature tendeth as
much as is possible, to the Corrupting
and Debauching of our Souls, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into subjection to Vile Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This shall be shewed in the <hi>general,</hi>
and more <hi>particularly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. In the <hi>general,</hi> it doth this as it is
apt to beget false Notions, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Conceptions of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Whereas a true <hi>Idea</hi> of God is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the Reforming of our Lives,
and Rectifying of our Natures, which
cannot be done, without a due Awe and
Reverence for Him, nor without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
our selves to his Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Among the several Instances of Popish
Idolatry (from the guilt of which high
and provoking Impiety the <hi>Heathens</hi> may
as easily purge themselves, as the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi>) their Picturing of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Holy Trinity (Allowed by
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) and Worshipping
their Pictures is a very great one. But
who seeth not how this tends to beget in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100709:156"/>
mens Minds a most Low and Undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Gross and Impure Conception of
the Deity? Can he easily conceive of
God as a most pure Spirit, that useth to
feed his Eyes, and foul his Fancy with
bodily Representations of Him? That
useth to Worship the Trinity under the
Figure of an Old man, with a long Grey
Beard, with a Crucifix between his
Knees and a Dove in his Breast? Or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ugly Figure of a <hi>Man-Cerberus,</hi>
or a Man with three Heads upon his
shoulders? But 'tis well known that
these are the Abominable Forms by
which the Papists Represent the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Trinity; of which the former is
much the more Common.</p>
               <p>I do not see how any Man who vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
the Divine Majesty as he ought,
and hath according to his Capacity a
worthy <hi>Idea</hi> of the unspeakable purity of
his Nature and incomprehensible Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
can endure the <hi>sight</hi> of such Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures:
But whosoever can fall in love
with them, whatsoever becoming sense
of God he had before, must needs soon
lose it.</p>
               <p>That other Instance also of Popish Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Addressing themselves
to the Saints, whether by Images or
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100709:157"/>
otherwise with all the Reverence and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of Devotion which is used to the
Great God, must necessarily have much
the same influence upon their Minds.</p>
               <p>And their multitude of little trifling
things, and many of them most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Fopperies, in which they place so
much Religion, and seek to obtain Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
by them even for great immoralities,
speaks them to have no true sense of his
Wisdom or Holiness, to have a base and
sordid notion of Him, and doth more and
more confirm them therein.</p>
               <p>Nor can they have any true Sense of
the Infinite <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, who are able to think that
there is no Salvation out of the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that God will damn to
Eternal Torments all Persons that are not
of her Communion, that is, the much
greater part of Christendom, let them
be never so good and pious people other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
But no man can be truly a <hi>Papist</hi>
who believes more Charitably. And 'tis
no wonder that <hi>they</hi> should be Bloudy
Wretches who are able to conceive such
a thing of God; when according to their
Notion of Him the more Arbitrary, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
and Cruel they are, the more
are they like that Being, <hi>which</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100709:157"/>
is their Glory and Happiness.</p>
               <p>2. This brings me to shew more <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi>
that Popery doth naturally tend
to bring mens Souls into Slavish Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Vile Affections of Malice,
Revenge and Cruelty; Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Covetousness; Uncleanness; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance;
and the greatest Injustice
and Unrighteousness.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> (as now we
intimated) they are the Natural and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Off-spring of that most Horrible
Uncharitableness that is proper to <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
When men have once conceived
such an opinion of any of their Fellow-Creatures,
as that they are hated of
God, and damned Reprobates, they
think <hi>themselves</hi> obliged to Hate them
too, and Hatred and Cruelty are never
separated.</p>
               <p>We have already given Instances of
Popish Cruelty in Butchering Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
and shewed what a vast Sea of
Bloud hath been shed by the Papists;
which hath been at the command of their
Holy Father, and the instigation of his
cursed instruments the <hi>Iesuits.</hi> And I
now add, that they have not satisfied
themselves with the mere shedding of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100709:158"/>
Bloud, but have devised the most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely
tormenting Methods of doing it;
such as can hardly be recited without
great Horror and Consternation of mind.
To pass over the inexpressible Tortures
of the <hi>Holy Inquisition,</hi> what say you to
<hi>long protracting the torments of those whose
Bodies have been committed to the merciless
Flames, by letting them down by degrees with
Pullies, that the lower parts might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
before the Fire could reach the Vitals?</hi>
What say you to <hi>Roasting alive;</hi> To
<hi>Flaying off mens skins alive;</hi> To <hi>Boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Young Children of Hereticks alive,</hi>
and <hi>casting them alive to be devoured by
Swine?</hi> What say you to <hi>Ripping up the
Bellies of Women Great with Child, their
hands and feet being first nailed down;</hi> To
<hi>Hanging men at their own doors by their
privy Members;</hi> To <hi>Burying men alive,
and young Children, making holes in the
Ground out of which they have put their
hands, and made sad moan for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi>
What Heart is so hard as not to
bleed at the mere Reading or Hearing
such things as these? But <hi>these</hi> and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
such like, nay far <hi>more</hi> horrible
things we might shew are Instances of

               </p>
               <p>But how should those think that these
Devilish Barbarities do not well become
them, who presume the poor Wretches
they so torture to be Accursed of God,
Devoted to destruction, and to far more
grievous and intolerable Torments; and
that the Hatred God bears to them doth
cause him to accept it as an Excellent
piece of Service at their hands to be their
Destroyers and Tormenters, that is, the
Executioners of <hi>His</hi> Wrath?</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Absolute Obedience
they owe to Christ's <hi>Vicar</hi> imposeth a
Necessity upon them not to boggle at the
greatest Cruelties, whensoever his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
shall please to imploy them in such
Services: which his Pride and Malice
will never permit him to fail to do,
whensoever he thinks it consistent with
his interest. And that a power to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
his Vassals in such work as this, was
conferred by Christ upon S. <hi>Peter</hi> and
his Successors, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth tells
you, in the beginning of his Bull against
Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Saith he, <hi>Regnans in

Catholick and Apostolick Church, to one
alone on Earth,</hi> viz. Peter <hi>Prince of the
Apostles, and to his Successor the Bishop of</hi>
Rome, <hi>to be governed with a plenitude of
Power. This one hath he constituted Prince
over all Nations and Kingdoms,</hi> (but
what to do? The next words tell us)
<hi>Qui evellat, destruat, dissipet, disperdat,
plantet &amp; aedificet. That he may pluck up,
destroy, break in pieces, waste,</hi> (Blessed
work!) <hi>plant and build</hi> (i. e.) upon those
Ruines. And Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third
applieth to the Popes in a literal sence
those words in the Prophecy of <hi>Ieremy:
See,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>And it would be a most tedious piece
of work to shew, what use the Popes
have made of this their pretended pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and how they have menaced with
Excommunication those good-natured or
prudent Princes, whom they have not
found forward to obey their Commands
in destroying Hereticks. So necessary is
it that a Papist, if he will be true to his
principles, should be either <hi>actually</hi> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
or in a ready preparation to be so.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:100709:159"/>And where is the Lust of <hi>Pride</hi> and
<hi>Ambition</hi> so gratified to the height as in
the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Head</hi> of this Church, can
there be a prouder or so proud a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon Gods Earth? Who claims as
Universal and Unbounded an Empire
over Mankind, as the Father hath inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
his Son <hi>Iesus</hi> withal. Who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<hi>his Authority to exceed as much the
Royal Power as the Sun doth the Moon.</hi>
Which are the words of the now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> in the place cited.
Who assumes to himself as great a Power
over Kings and Emperors as over the
meanest of Peasants, and Authority to
dispose of their Crowns and Kingdoms
at his own pleasure: And, whensoever
he hath been strong enough, hath made
them <hi>feel</hi> it. Who claims as great a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over Mens very Consciences, their
Minds and Understandings (as we have
seen) in matters of Religion, as God
himself can. Nay, usurpeth such a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as God himself abhors to have, as shall
be shewn anon.</p>
               <p>So that if the <hi>Man of Sin, who sitteth in
the Temple of God, and Exalteth himself
above all that is called God,</hi> be not to be
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100709:160"/>
found in <hi>Rome,</hi> no part of the World
ever was or will be able to shew him.</p>
               <p>And how is it possible that such prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Pride in the Head should not affect
and influence the Members, both Clergy
and Laity; and that there should be none
or little contagion in such an Example?
Surely the Example of the profoundly
Humble <hi>Iesus</hi> cannot have a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
influence upon his Disciples, than
that of his Diabolically proud and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pretended Vicars must needs have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Proselytes; especially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great propensity of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to this Sin of Pride. But as for the
Popish <hi>Clergie,</hi> they have infinite tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
to the gratifying to the height
this Lust, and as great Opportunities for
it.</p>
               <p>To pass by the Cardinals and Bishops,
the former of which have the stile and go
in the Equipage of Princes, and are co-partners
with their High and Mighty
Lord in his forementioned vast Rule and
Government: And the latter not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to the greatest of the Nobility, and
have been Censured for going too much
out of their way to meet Princes; I say
to pass by <hi>these,</hi> their Common Priests,

to Pride, haughtiness and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of others, that the most Ambitious
of them all can well wish to have.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Priests,</hi> I need not say how
much their pretended Power of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiating
the Elements in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
which is no less than making a God
Almighty with pronouncing five words,
must needs Conciliate Veneration from
the People to them. And also what a
mighty Awe and Reverence their taking
of Auricular Confession from People of
all Ranks lying prostrate before them
must necessarily beget in their minds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. And to other Instigations
to pride, too many to be now instanced
in, may be added their priviledge of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Sacrament in both kinds,
whereas the greatest men of the <hi>Laity</hi>
may not presume to touch the Cup.</p>
               <p>And then for the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
what a Gratification of Pharisaical Pride
is the Opinion that the Silly Vulgar have
of their Extraordinary Sanctity, by
means of the many Ceremonies, of which
some are peculiar to <hi>one,</hi> and some to
<hi>another</hi> Order, which are devised for no
other purpose, but to make up a Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew
of wonderful Humility, Contempt
of the World, and Mortification?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:100709:161"/>And to the Lust of <hi>Pride</hi> we next add
that of <hi>Covetousness, this</hi> is no less gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Popish Religion than the <hi>other:</hi>
And no wonder, for Covetousness is a
Pander and Pimp to Pride.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the whole Systeme of Popery is
mainly contrived for the heaping up of
Wealth. This is manifestly designed in
their Doctrine of Purgatory; Of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of good Works;</hi> The <hi>Popes Indulgences,</hi>
and his <hi>prodigious Grants of Pardons; The
prohibition of Marriage to Priests; Their
many Spiritual Fraternities,</hi> &amp;c. But I
must not take liberty to enlarge here;
for innumerable are the Ways and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of the Papacy, and that are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
with the Popish Religion, for
scraping together the Wealth of the
World: So notoriously guilty is that
Church of the crime which S. <hi>Paul</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Seducers with, <hi>Tit.</hi> I. II. viz.
<hi>Teaching things that they ought not, for
filthy lucres sake.</hi> She hath infinitely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
all Societies and Bodies of men that
ever were in the World in the Politick
Trade of Grasping and Accumulating
Riches; and <hi>that</hi> (which makes it far
the more abominable) varnisht over
with a <hi>Form</hi> and mighty shew of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:100709:161"/>
though in the mean time She sticks
at no means, though never so unrighteous
and abominably wicked, to accomplish
her End. The Sect of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> her
famous Predecessors, <hi>Who made long
Prayers to devour Widows houses,</hi> were in
comparison of Her very silly Novices at
this Artifice, and sorry Bunglers. Which
should I make out by proceeding to Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
the rest of the Particulars (as
hath been now intimated) I should hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know where to make an End.</p>
               <p>Then, for the Lust of <hi>Vncleanness,</hi>
what greater encouragement can a Beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Creature have to give it its full Swinge
and Liberty, than <hi>Holy Church</hi> gives
him? As also what dangerous and next
to unavoidable snares doth she lay in the
way of those mens Chastity, who would
be glad to live honestly?</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Encouragement</hi> she gives to
the satisfaction of this Lust, what can be
greater than to make simple Fornication
a Venial Sin? That is, in the Popish

               </p>
               <p>Which leads me to shew likewise what
<hi>Snares</hi> are laid by that Church, and
what next to invincible Temptations to
the sin of Uncleanness she exposeth innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
People to. As imposing Vows
of perpetual single Life upon all Priests,
Monks, Friers and Nuns, most of which
live idly and fare plentifully; And gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Priests the most inviting Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for the commission of Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Adultery that can be: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not a Female of ripe years but is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>once</hi> a year at least to be alone with a
Priest for Auricular Confession. And
whensoever they please to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to them upon that pretence, 'tis a
Sin for Parents, Husbands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
them: By which means there is no
sort of men scarcely in all Christendom
so infamous for Filthiness as the Popish
Priests: And what a snare their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
must necessarily be to the Laity, I
need not say.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:100709:163"/>I might instance in other high provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to Lust and Wantonness which
the Clergy and Laity of that Church
must thank <hi>her</hi> for. As her excessive
number of Holy days, whereon the <hi>Laity</hi>
at least must be idle whether they will or
no. And which, considering how they
are observed as well <hi>within</hi> the Church
as <hi>out</hi> of it, do generally not at all serve
the purposes of Religion; and, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Liberty that is allowed, are only
opportunities for <hi>making provision for the
flesh to fulfil it in the Lusts thereof.</hi> And
as for the <hi>Carnivals,</hi> the business of <hi>them</hi>
is to <hi>commit all manner of Wickedness with
greediness,</hi> and with the greatest Secrecy
and Security.</p>
               <p>And therefore I need not <hi>distinctly</hi>
shew what Liberty that Church gives
to the Sin of <hi>Intemperance,</hi> the highest
provocative to Lasciviousness.</p>
               <p>Lastly, For <hi>that</hi> of the grossest <hi>Injustice</hi>
and <hi>Vnrighteousness,</hi> no men in the world
have such Encouragement to make no
bones of it as have the Children of the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Diverse of whose Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
and Principles are exactly fitted for
so Execrable a Design, as the extirpating
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100709:163"/>
out of mens Minds all sense of Justice or
Common Honesty. As particularly,
the Pope's claiming a Power to dispense
with the most Solemn Oaths, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
exercise of that Power in Absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Subjects from their Allegiance to
Heretical Princes, and otherwise: That
truly Catholick principle, that <hi>Faith is
not to be kept with Hereticks;</hi> which a
Council of <hi>Constance</hi> put in practice upon
poor <hi>Iohn Husse:</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
and <hi>Mental Reservation,</hi> which
takes away all Security and Confidence
in one anothers words, and tends to the
destruction of Humane Society. <hi>This</hi>
Doctrine is not proper to the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> but
(as Father <hi>Parsons</hi> saith in his <hi>Treatise
tending to Mitigation) hath been received
in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church for Four hundred
years.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And if you take in the professed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of <hi>that</hi> their most Renowned Order,
which improve that Doctrine so far, as
in some cases, but especially in those
wherein their Religion is concerned, to
make it Lawful or at least Venial, to
back Equivocations with Sacred Oaths,
and horrible Imprecations; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Court of Judicature (at least if it
consists of Hereticks) of the practising
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100709:164"/>
upon which we have had among our
selves of late most Amazing Instances:
If, I say, you take in these principles
(which are now collected out of their
Books into Pamphlets, and exposed to
the View of every Body) as also those
very many other, which are to be seen
in the <hi>Iesuits Morals,</hi> you will say that
should we rake Hell for Doctrines to
make men Devils, there can none be
found more Effectual for the purpose
than those wherewith we are furnished
by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so much shall suffice to be spoken
to the First Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That Popery
tendeth as much as is possible to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching
our Souls, by bringing them
into subjection to Vile Affections; in
discoursing on which we have studied to
be as brief as can be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Popery no less tendeth to
Disquiet mens Minds with certain
troublesom and tormenting Passions.
We have shewed in the First <hi>Section,</hi> that
all Corrupt Affections (and therefore the
<hi>forementioned,</hi> to which <hi>all</hi> may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced)
are of a very tormenting nature:
In saying therefore <hi>now</hi> that Popery tends
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100709:164"/>
to disquiet men with certain troublesom
Passions, I design a distinct head of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the better and wiser
any man of that Religion is, the more
will his Mind be disturbed by a many
Points thereof; particularly with <hi>Fear,
Shame, Anxiety</hi> and <hi>Solicitude:</hi> And</p>
               <p>First, For the Passion of <hi>Fear,</hi> what
can so excite <hi>this,</hi> or make a man so
much a Slave to it, as the Popish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Purgatory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whosoever doth really believe that
there is a life after this, must needs be
more or less solicitous about his state in
that life; and according to the degrees of
that his Faith, will his solicitude be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or less. Now the belief of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
must necessarily be accompanied
with great fear of Death; which, as the
Apostle saith, makes those who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power of it <hi>all their life-time sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Bondage.</hi> For, as the pains of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
are taught to be so dreadful and
terrible as to equallize those of <hi>Hell,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
onely in the duration of them (and
how long each particular person may lie
there before he be released, whether
scores or hundreds of years, as also what
degrees of Torment shall be allotted to
him, is the greatest uncertainty) so no
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100709:165"/>
man can have any rational assurance, let
him lead never so strictly holy a life, of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping
this place of Torment; No nor the
least <hi>hope</hi> neither from such a life, if it be
short of absolute Perfection, as whose is
not?</p>
               <p>And as for the Efficacy of <hi>Penances</hi> and
<hi>Indulgences,</hi> it is impossible for any one
who ever thinks seriously about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of his Soul, and understands any
thing of Religion, at <hi>least</hi> not to be full
of <hi>diffidence</hi> what it may amount to.
Those are such monstrous Cheats, the
former for the <hi>most</hi> part of them, and the
latter <hi>all</hi> of them, that such as are not
much short of Brutes for Folly, or of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
for Wickedness, can never be so
blinded as to promise to themselves the
least benefit or advantage from them,
and much less <hi>that</hi> which is promised by
the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, what a Slavish Fear and Dread
of God, as a Revengeful Being, must
needs possess the Minds of those who have
imbibed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Doctrine
concerning Whippings and Scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and other severe Penances? <hi>viz.</hi>
That they are necessary not onely for
Mortification, but likewise for Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the Popish sence of that word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:100709:165"/>But what a Spirit of Bondage are they
under then from Dread of God's Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
in believing (as they are bound)
that God will not Remit the punishment
of Sin where the Guilt of it is washed
away with the Bloud of Christ, upon the
performance of the conditions of the New
Covenant (which is as <hi>Nonsensical</hi> as
<hi>False</hi>) that he will not Remit it, I say,
to such, so far as to excuse them from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Temporary Torments in the
other World, except he hath <hi>other</hi> satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
given him in this life by <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi>
nor from Torments of a Vastly
long duration, except it be given him by
<hi>others</hi> after their decease?</p>
               <p>Their Church is so well aware, with
what horrible Dread and Fear this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
must necessarily affect poor credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Fools, that she hath invented it for
that very reason; because by this means
she brings them into the most Slavish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
makes her self Mistress of their
Purses, and is enabled to have her fill of
Tyranny over their Consciences, their
Souls and Bodies. What tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the Devilishness of such Practices!</p>
               <p>Next for the Passion of <hi>Shame;</hi> The
necessity of all People's of both Sexes <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing</hi>
to the Priest, which is enjoyned
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100709:166"/>

their purposes and desires to commit
them, nay, and <hi>inclinations</hi> too; what
violence is hereby done to the Modesty of
all such as have not arrived to the height
of impudence? This is (to use the words
of the Learned Doctor <hi>More) as if all the
modest Maids and grave Matrons in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

                  <note place="margin">Mystery of Iniquity, p. 78.</note> 
                  <hi>and
in that manner humble themselves before
their Priest once a year: Which would look
like a piece of unsupportable Tyranny. And
yet</hi> (as he proceeds) <hi>this extorted Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon pain of Damnation not to conceal any
thing, is not the stripping of a man to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
body, but the stripping him of his body,
that they may see his naked Heart, and so by
the force of this Superstition break into those
secrets, which it is onely the due priviledge
of God Almighty to be acquainted with,</hi> &amp;c.
And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly, What</hi> Anxiety <hi>and</hi> Solicitude
<hi>must those Papists minds needs be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with, who are at all concerned
about their Eternal State, by reason of
these following Doctrines,</hi> viz. That of
the Dependence of the Efficacy of Sacraments
upon the Priests intention: That of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100709:166"/>
now mentioned, <hi>decreed in the</hi> Trent
<hi>Canons,</hi> viz. That the Penitent must not
onely confess every Mortal sin, which after
the strictest search he can call to mind, but
even his particular sinful thoughts, his secret
desires, and every circumstance which chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the nature of the sin: <hi>And</hi> that of their
distinction of sins into Mortal and Venial;
<hi>to pass by many others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>First</hi> of these, That known
Doctrine of <hi>the Dependence of the Efficacy
of Sacraments upon the Priests intention:</hi>
Such as Baptism; the Lords Supper;
Absolution, which is a grand <hi>Popish</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can it be other than a
great disturbance and distraction to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
person, whether there be any
dash of Melancholy in his Temper or no,
to think with himself <hi>thus:</hi> What if after
all my care and all my expence, the
Priest should either from a principle of
Malice or non-advertency not direct his
Intention as he ought to do? Then, if I
am not <hi>remedilesly</hi> damned, I am at least
in eminent <hi>danger</hi> of damnation.</p>
               <p>But then as to the <hi>Second</hi> relating to
<hi>Confession;</hi> This ushers in this perplexing
difficulty, <hi>viz.</hi> How shall I in enquiring
after my particular sins, in <hi>deed, word</hi>
and <hi>thought,</hi> assure my self that I have
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100709:167"/>
used my <hi>utmost</hi> diligence? Which if I
have not done, my Absolution will signifie
nothing to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as to Confessing the</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<hi>of sins, the Questions and Scruples
which naturally arise from</hi> thence <hi>are too
many to be recited. But I'le transcribe
some passages of the Learned Bishop</hi> Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor'<hi>s,
concerning Auricular Confession,
which are greatly to our present purpose.
Saith he in his</hi> Disswasive from Popery,
<hi>the First Part,</hi> How this can be safely done,
and who is sufficient for these things,<note place="margin">Polemical Discourses in fol. p. 316.</note> and
who can tell his Circumstances without temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Confessor, or betraying and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
another person (which is forbidden)
and in what cases it may be done, and in
what cases omitted; and whether the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
be valid upon infinite other Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and whether it be to be repeated in
whole or in part, and how often, and how
much? These things are so uncertain, casual
and contingent, and so many cases are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
upon every one of these; and these so
disputed by their greatest Doctors, by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
and <hi>Scotus,</hi> and all the School-men,
and by the Casuists; that, as <hi>Beatus Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus</hi>
complains, it was truly observed by
the famous <hi>John Geilerius,</hi> that according
to their Cases, Enquiries and Conclusions,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:100709:167"/>
it is impossible for any man to make a right
Confession. <hi>And thus he concludes that
Section:</hi> So that although the shame of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Confession be very tolerable and easie,
yet the Cases and Scruples which they have
introduced, are neither easie nor tolerable.
And though, as it is now used, there be but
little in it to restrain sin, yet there is very
much danger of encreasing it, and of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no benefit by it.</p>
               <p>But yet for all this, the <hi>Trent</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the fore-cited Session and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
call it an impious thing to say that
this their Auricular Confession is <hi>Carnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina
Conscientiarum, a Racking and Tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Peoples Consciences.</hi> But it would
be a wonder if the greatest Wickedness
should be unaccompanied with the most
shameless impudence.</p>
               <p>As for the Third Doctrine I named,
<hi>viz.</hi> That of their distinction of Sins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Mortal and Venial (that is, in their
own <hi>nature</hi> so) the intanglements it
brings men into are inextricable. For
they cannot be satisfied from their Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists
what Sins are Venial and what are
not so, in very many instances. And
much less can they distinguish between
the greatest Venial Sins and the least
Mortal ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:100709:168"/>Now, considering this little that hath
been said, as the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
17. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is</hi> (or the
true Spirit of Christianity) <hi>there is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
so may we say, <hi>Where the Spirit of
Popery is, there is Slavery;</hi> much worse
than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery. No Papist who
is disposed to be Devout and Religious
can be better than a poor Superstitious
Creature: Nor can scarcely serve God
after a better sort than a <hi>Turkish</hi> Slave
doth his cruel Patron; or than the poor
<hi>Indians</hi> Worship the Devil.</p>
               <p>But that those of them who make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of their ways, and are Religiously
inclined are not beholden to their <hi>Popery</hi>
for being so, will be fully made to appear
in the next Chapter.</p>

That the Admirable Method our Lord hath

This shewed as to each of those four
Particulars that Method consists of. The
Second Head briefly spoken to, viz. That

               <p>THirdly, The Admirable course and
Method which our Lord hath taken
to instate us in our Christian Liberty is
made lamentably Ineffectual by <hi>Popery,</hi>
For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Whereas we have shewed, that
He hath fully informed us concerning all
the parts and particulars of our Liberty,
what can the</hi> Romish <hi>Church do more
than she doth to keep men in Ignorance
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100709:169"/>
of them? The Holy Scriptures (as hath
been said) She hath locked up: And
though (as that excellent Gentleman
Sir</hi> Edwyn Sandys <hi>saith</hi>) as well to beat
back the irksome out-cries of their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">Europe Speculum, p. 126. Edit. 1673</note>
as to give some content and satisfaction
to their own, that they might not think them
so terribly afraid of the Bible, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to let it be translated by some of their
Favourers into the Vulgar, as also some
number of Copies to be saleable a-while at
the beginning; yet since, having hushed that
former clamour, and made better provision
for the Establishment of their Kingdom,
they have called all Vulgar Bibles straitly
in again, yea the very Psalms of <hi>David,</hi>
which their famous Preacher, Bishop <hi>Pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garola</hi>
translated, as doubting else the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidableness
of those former inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>And such base, blasphemous Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Holy Scriptures have been
published, both from their Pulpits and
Presses, as speak them exceedingly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
by reason of their extreme obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
even in points necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(though the Apostle saith, <hi>If our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
be hid, it is hid to them that are lost</hi>)
as well as not worth the reading, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fitted to serve all turns, a <hi>dead letter,</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:100709:169"/>
and at best an insufficient Rule, and not
signifying any thing unaccompanied
with their paltry Traditions; though
S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Scriptures are able to
make us wise to Salvation.</hi> Nor do their
<hi>Preachers</hi> make any great amends for this
intolerable abuse; for, as <hi>they</hi> are too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
most sottishly ignorant, and
know little more of the Scriptures than
the poor people, so the most Knowing of
them for the most part stuff their Sermons
with Legends and Idle tales, make as
little use of Scripture as they can, and
feed their Flocks with sorry Trash, nay,
with rank Poison mingled with <hi>the sincere
milk of the Word,</hi> and the Saving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas we have shewn,
that our Lord hath furnisht us with the
most potent <hi>Means</hi> for the gaining of our
<hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> this Church hath also
taken a course to make <hi>these</hi> unsuccessful
We will instance in some of them.</p>
               <p>As for that of <hi>Believing himself to be the
Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. we need add nothing to
what hath been said to shew how little
she befriends it, in that she makes her
own Authority the onely foundation of
that Belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:100709:170"/>That of <hi>Hearing his Word,</hi> we have
<hi>now</hi> seen how Ineffectual she makes it.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Prayer</hi> she makes so as much as
she can, both by her foresaid Doctrine
of the Non-necessity of imploying the
Mind therein, and her suitable Practice
of enjoyning the Reading of Prayers in
an unknown Tongue: As also by defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them with Superstitious Rites, and
even gross <hi>Idolatry:</hi> And by joyning
many Mediators with <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ.</p>
               <p>That of the <hi>Observation of the Lords
day,</hi> for which we have uninterrupted
Tradition from the Apostles times, she
hath made as effectual to the business 'tis
designed for, as the rest of her Holy-days.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Denying our sensitive Appetites,</hi>
she is a wonderful Friend to, as appears
by the foresaid Doctrine concerning
simple Fornication, and the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Liberty she allows, and the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
her Popes have granted.</p>
               <p>And lastly, Those <hi>of the Sacraments,</hi>
how unserviceable hath she made <hi>them</hi> to
their intended End, by her Doctrines of
<hi>opus operatum,</hi> and of making their Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
dependent on the Priests Intention:
And <hi>that</hi> of the Lords Supper, by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the People of <hi>half,</hi> and converting
the whole by her prodigious Doctrine of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:100709:170"/>
                  <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> into the most Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Idolatry; and by her, Doctrine of <hi>the
Sacrifice of the Mass</hi> into a daily <hi>Crucifying
our Lord afresh, and putting him again to
an open shame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas we have shewed
that our Lord hath purchased for us a
rich supply of Grace, to enable us to use
these and the like Means with happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
I need not say what an Enemy Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
is to this Grace and the Efficacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof, having now shewn what an
Enemy it is to these Means.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whereas we have likewise
presented several most powerful Motives,
which our Lord hath given us to prevail
with our Wills to comply with this
Grace, Popery is apt greatly to weaken
and deaden every one of them to all its
Proselytes. As for instance,</p>
               <p>1. That of <hi>the Vnconceiveable Love of
God, expressed in sending his onely Begotten
Son upon the Errand of our Deliverance,</hi> &amp;c.
Wherein we said are implied two won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
exciting Motives to comply hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
with the Method Christ hath taken
to set us free from the Dominion of Sin,
<hi>viz.</hi> First, <hi>Gods extremest Hatred of Sin,</hi>
in that he would not propose Terms of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:100709:171"/>
Reconciliation to Sinners without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of such a Sacrifice as that of
his Dear Son. Secondly, <hi>His as wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
love to Sinners.</hi> Now as to the former
of these two Motives, what influence can
it have upon those who are made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that a company of little sleight Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
will satisfie for great and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Crimes? Can they think that God
doth account Sin so heinous and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
an evil, when they presume Him
so willing to be reconciled to great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
upon the most easie terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
               <p>The foresaid Gentleman, who was
conversant among them, tells us,<note place="margin">Europae Speculum, p. 13.</note> that
their Penance doth ordinarily consist but
in <hi>Ave Maries</hi> and <hi>Pater Nosters,</hi> with
some easie Alms to them that are able,
and some little Fasting to such as are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
And that he himself hath known,
when the Penance for Horrible Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and that frequent too, besides much
other lewdness, hath been but the bare
saying of their Beads thrice over; which
in <hi>Italy</hi> (such good Husbands are they)
hinders no business, but (as he also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves)
they dispatch their Beads as they
walk the Streets, or rid business at
home, making it two lips and one fingers
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100709:171"/>
work. But were the Penance imposed
by the Priests never so sharp, he shews
that the Fathers plenary Pardon sweeps
all away at a blow. And that of these
they have granted (especially the Pope
that lived in his time) so huge a number,
that he believed there were few Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of note in <hi>Italy,</hi> which had not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
or procured a perpetual plenary
Indulgence, by virtue whereof whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
at certain days being Confessed, and,
having Communicated, pours out his
Devotions at some Altar in that Church,
or gives Alms to the behoof thereof, had
forthwith free Remission of all sin and
punishment. Which, I say, is the most
effectual course that can be devised to
make people think, that the greatest sins
are no greater evil in <hi>God</hi>'s than they are
in their <hi>own</hi> account.</p>
               <p>And then as to the <hi>latter</hi> Motive, how
is the <hi>Love of God to sinners</hi> lessened by
<hi>this</hi> Doctrine of theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> That by the
Sufferings of Christ true Penitents are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
delivered from <hi>Hell,</hi> but not from
the direful pains of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which
(as was said) may be equal in all respects
to those of Hell, except in the duration
of them; which yet may endure too for
many Ages, but that they have invented
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100709:172"/>
means to shorten them. And their
eaking out the satisfaction which Christ
hath made to the Divine Justice for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
with satisfactions of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
doth also not a little disparage <hi>his</hi>
and his Fathers love in what he hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in their behalf.</p>
               <p>2. As to the Motive of <hi>Christ's Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Example,</hi> we have shewed of what
little Efficacy this is made by the Vile
Examples of his Vicars and Vicegerents,
and their Spiritual Guides. Whereunto
I will add this passage of the said Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Europe Speculum. p. 136, 137</note>
                  <hi>That the Iniquity of their Chief</hi> See
<hi>hath been so exorbitant, as to have raised
amidst themselves this Proverb or saying,
<hi>That the worst Christians of</hi>
                  </hi> Italy <hi>are
the</hi> Romans, <hi>of the</hi> Romans <hi>the Priests
are Wickedest, the Lewdest Priests
are preferred to be Cardinals, and the
baddest Man among the Cardinals is
preferred to be Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. As for <hi>this</hi> Motive, <hi>viz. The assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
Christ hath given us, that he will not
take such advantage of our Frailties as to
cast us off for them.</hi> it is even quite taken
away by their Doctrine of even Venial
Sins being so severely punisht in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:100709:172"/>4. For that of <hi>our Saviour's Mediation
and Intercession,</hi> what a little Motive have
they made it, by making so many Co-Mediators
with <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ, as if his
Mediation were far from sufficient. And
nothing hath been more observed than
that for one <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> they say very
many <hi>Ave Maries.</hi> And the Virgin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of God (as they call her) is Cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
after that rate by them, that 'tis
scarcely uncharitable to suspect that they
lay far more stress upon <hi>her's</hi> than upon
her <hi>Son's</hi> Merits.</p>
               <p>Lastly, To joyn together the Motives
of the <hi>Glorious Reward promised to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of Corrupt Affections,</hi> and <hi>the most
Dismal Punishment those are threatned with
who gratisie them,</hi> it appears abundantly
from what hath been already said, that
they have made <hi>these</hi> exceedingly weak
and insignificant. But that <hi>one</hi> Doctrine
is enough to do it <hi>alone,</hi> which we find
backt with the Authority of the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> viz.<note place="margin">Quamv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>That Imperfect Contrition,
or Attrition, although by it self it cannot
bring a sinner to Iustification, without the
Sacrament of Penance; nevertheless it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposeth
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:100709:173"/>
him for the obtaining of the Grace of
God in that Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now they tell you immediately before
what they mean by <hi>Attrition, viz.</hi> A sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for Sin, arising either from the
consideration of its turpitude, or from
the fear of Hell, (not from both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but from <hi>either</hi>) excluding a will
to Sin for the future, and accompanied
with the hope of Pardon. Now who can
find it difficult to be affected with sorrow
for his Sins, for <hi>fear</hi> of Hell, and to be
willing to leave off to sin, when he sees
Death approaching, and he can sin no
longer? And then a Priest being at hand
to apply the Sacrament of Penance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this sweet Doctrine, the most
profligate sinners work is done for the
other World. And therefore what need
any man put himself to the trouble of
subduing his Lusts, and a holy life, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that's necessary to Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be dispatcht on the Death-bed?
If it be said, that no man can be certain
that he shall have any time of sickness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
death, or that he shall not be cut off
in a Moment, as many are, or that he
shall be <hi>compos mentis,</hi> and have the use
of Reason in his Sickness, and therefore
'tis a mad thing to put off the great work
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:100709:173"/>
of Saving a man's Soul to the very last: I
say, if this be said, the Answer is easie,
that seeing there's scarcely one in some
hundreds but hath at some time or other
the use of his Intellectuals upon his
Death-bed, and so very few <hi>comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
die without some warning, there is no
doubt of it, but a hardned sinner will put
those things to the Venture, when once
he hath drunk down the comfortable
Cordial which is prepared for him by his
Spiritual Physicians, and that by a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
Council of them too, which never
fails of being Infallible.</p>
               <p>And thus we have seen how wofully
mischievous Popery is in making as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
as can be the most admirable
Method our Lord hath pitcht upon for
the setting us Free from the Power of
Sin. Which Argument I have been the
more brief upon, because I have already
discoursed upon it in the <hi>Design of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It remains to be shewn
what an Enemy Popery is to that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which our Saviour purchased for the
<hi>Iews</hi> particularly. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath laid on a far more intolerable Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:100709:174"/>
of Ceremonies and Ritual Observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
than that which our Saviour took off
<hi>their</hi> shoulders. Which, as they fall not
short of the <hi>Iewish</hi> ones in number, (nay I
may say do much <hi>exceed</hi> them) so they
are (to say nothing how grosly Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
many of them are, and some as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous)
for the most part so odd and
uncouth, so childish and ridiculous, so
vain and garish, as that it is not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
how truly Devout and Serious
people should stoop so low as to give their
Minds to them, and not lose their Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Devoutness. The ill influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Ordinances had
by <hi>accident,</hi> and through their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
upon the Minds of the <hi>Iews, these</hi>
must <hi>naturally</hi> have, and a far worse, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Minds of <hi>Papists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would be an endless piece of work
to discourse of them <hi>particularly,</hi> and
I shall onely refer the Reader to the
Seventeenth, Eighteenth, and Nineteenth
Chapters of the several times quoted
<hi>Mystery of Iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor will I add any thing farther of
mine own upon this Unpleasant subject,
but set down what Sir</hi> Edwyn Sandys <hi>hath
acquainted us with from his own Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Europ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Superstitions and Ceremonies of the

part of a mans life to gaze on and to peruse;
being neither Vniform in all places, as some
would pretend, but different in divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
An huge sort of them are so childish
also and unsavoury, that, as they argue
great silliness and rawness in their Inventors,
so can they naturally bring no other than dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and contempt to those exercises of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
wherein they are stirring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor can I forbear to add the following

ways they hold to Ravish all Affections and

There being not any thing either Sacred or

obligeth us to receive the Faith of Christ
upon the self-same Grounds and Motives
that are proposed by our Saviour and his

                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:100709:176"/>We live in a Church which not onely

upon our Belief or Practice as necessary

Bible: That makes the Scriptures a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete

all Merit of good Works, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us to expect Salvation onely for the
sake of <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ, and through <hi>his</hi>
Righteousness; but gives not the <hi>least</hi>
countenance to Licentious practices, or
Remissness in good Works; and teacheth
the absolute necessity of purging our
selves by the Assistance of the Divine
Grace from all Filthiness both of Flesh
and Spirit, in order to our being made
capable of God's Complacential love
here, and Glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>Lastly, (whereas I might be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
large upon this subject) we live in
a Church wherein we want no necessary
help for the building us up in our most
holy Faith, or our having the Design of
our Saviour's Religion happily effected
in us; namely, the Reformation of our
Lives, and our being Renewed after the
Image of God, which consisteth in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and true Holiness.</p>
               <p>O that at length we could become

               <p>If that dismal day should again come
(as God grant it may not) with what

               <head type="sub">The Fourth Inference, That he onely is a
true Christian, that looks upon himself as
obliged to be no less Watchful over his
Heart and the frame and temper of his
Mind, than over his Life and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</head>
               <p>I Shall now return to more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practical discourse, for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of this Treatise, which is far more
pleasing to my self than that I have been
employed in for several of the past Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
as necessary and seasonable as <hi>that</hi>
is also.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, From our Notion of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Liberty</hi> this is another manifest Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<hi>viz.</hi> That a true Christian is one
that looks upon himself as obliged to be
no less watchful over his Heart, than
over his Life and Conversation; to take
as great care to <hi>cleanse the</hi> inside <hi>of the Cup
and Platter</hi> (to use our Saviour's expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
as the <hi>outside;</hi> to be as vigilant
over his Affections, as over his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Behaviour; to be as Solicitous
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100709:178"/>
about purging himself from all immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Love</hi> of the things of this World, as
about procuring them by warrantable
and lawful means.</p>
               <p>The true Christian makes as much
Conscience of <hi>Lusting after a Woman</hi> and
cherishing impure <hi>thoughts,</hi> as he doth of
Lascivious and Wanton <hi>Practices;</hi> Of
harbouring Revenge in his Breast, and
bearing ill will to any, as of repaying
Injury with injury. He needs not to be
made sensible that 'tis no less his duty to
<hi>forgive</hi> and <hi>love</hi> his Enemies, than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
reviling them or doing evil to them;
that 'tis as indispensably necessary to be
low in his own Eyes, and to <hi>think</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of himself, as to beware of a haughty
and supercilious carriage towards others;
that he cannot more safely <hi>Covet</hi> than he
can <hi>Steal</hi> his Neighbours goods; that he
is as much bound to bring his <hi>Will</hi> into
subjection to the Will of God, under the
severest Providences, as to forbear Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
Repining and Charging of God
foolishly.</p>
               <p>He who is a Christian in <hi>deed</hi> as well as
in <hi>name</hi> placeth Religion in Governing
his own Spirit, no less than in any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
performances or forbearances of
what nature soever; in putting away
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100709:179"/>
from himself all Wrath, Bitterness and
Sourness, no less than in abstaining from
uncivil deportment towards his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>This man doth not think it more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to <hi>do</hi> good works than to do them
from a good <hi>principle:</hi> And he is as much
concerned about <hi>Loving</hi> of God, as about
<hi>Doing</hi> what he hath commanded him,
and <hi>Forbearing</hi> what he hath forbidden
him. He no less endeavours to <hi>Hate</hi> sin,
than <hi>not</hi> to <hi>Commit</hi> it; and to be in <hi>love</hi>
with his duty, than to <hi>do</hi> his duty.</p>
               <p>Nay, the sincere Christian looks upon
that as his greatest and most important
work and business which is least in sight,
which is to be done <hi>within</hi> himself; as
well knowing that if the <hi>Tree</hi> be good,
its <hi>Fruit</hi> will be so also: That (as our
Saviour saith) <hi>a corrupt tree cannot bring
forth good fruit, nor a good tree evil fruit;</hi>
and that all must needs be well <hi>without</hi>
him, if all be well <hi>within</hi> him: And
that no outward Temptations can be
forceably enough to draw him to sin, so
long as there is entertained within him
no treacherous Lust, that is ready to take
part with them.</p>
               <p>That he to whom this Character doth
not belong is no genuine <hi>Christian,</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100709:179"/>
in that such a person is no <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
And as a great number of Texts
do plainly speak the <hi>former</hi> Proposition to
be true, so is it to be concluded from
what hath been discoursed of the nature
of <hi>Christian Liberty;</hi> from our having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
that it consisteth in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from all Inslaving Lusts, and in
having all obstacles taken out of the way
to our complete complying with the
Laws of Righteousness and Goodness.</p>

               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:100709:180"/>
               <head>CHAP. XX.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Last Inference. Viz. That the most
Proper and Genuine Christian Obedience
is that which hath most of Liberty in it;
namely, that which proceeds from the
Principle of Love to God and Goodness.</head>
               <p>FIfthly and Lastly, I infer from our
discourse of <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> what is
the most Proper and Genuine Christian
<hi>Obedience;</hi> Surely <hi>that</hi> which hath most
of Liberty in it; that Obedience which
is most free and least forced: That which
springs from an Inward Living Principle,
and is not merely occasioned by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of External Motives and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And <hi>then</hi> doth a man act from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Principle of Life, when he acts
from the love of God and Goodness.
There is scarcely any distinction betwixt
these two, for to love God, that is, <hi>as</hi>
God, is to be inamoured primarily with
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100709:180"/>
his most Beautiful and Amiable Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Righteousness, Purity, Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and Mercy; all which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be expressed by that one Excellent
word <hi>GOODNESS.</hi> I say to love
God <hi>as</hi> God is to be in love with <hi>these</hi>
Perfections <hi>primarily,</hi> and to love His
<hi>Person</hi> upon the account of <hi>them,</hi> if it be
lawful to distinguish them, and abstract
His Person from His Perfections. But
those do most truly conceive of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
Being, who make no
such Abstraction, but describe Him by
calling Him <hi>Infinite Righteousness and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Bounty and Mercy, Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
&amp;c. rather than a Being <hi>in</hi> whom are
all these Perfections: For they are not so
properly said to be <hi>in</hi> God, as to be God
Himself. Thus limited that Maxim of
the Schools is indisputably true, <hi>viz.
Quicquid est in Deo est ipse Deus: Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is in God is God himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that I say, to love God and to love
Goodness as <hi>such</hi> do amount to the same
thing: To love God not because Good in
<hi>himself,</hi> but because Good and Kind to
<hi>me,</hi> is more <hi>self-love</hi> than a love of <hi>God.</hi>
A Wicked man may thus love God, for
as the Wise man observes, that <hi>every man
is a friend to him that giveth gifts,</hi> so is he
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100709:181"/>
especially to him that bestoweth gifts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>himself;</hi> the very Brutes are so, and he
is more a Devil than a Man that is not so.
<hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> our Saviour saith,
<hi>do love those who love them,</hi> and the more
a man loves <hi>himself</hi> the more will he be
inclined to love his Benefactors and best
Friends as <hi>such.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now (as I said) that is the most <hi>Free,</hi>
and consequently the most <hi>Christian</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which ariseth from an Inward
lively sense of the Beauty and Amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Goodness, of the Christian Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and Graces, which are all so many
Rays of and Emanations from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Goodness, and therefore those who
are indued with them are said to be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of a Divine nature:</hi> And when we
act from this Principle we act from a
New nature, and I need not say that no
actions are so free as <hi>natural</hi> actions.
Thus to do good is to do like God himself,
the Freest of all Agents; for he doth
good not from External Motives, but
from the Infinite Complacency he takes
in Goodness it self. <hi>I am the Lord who
exercise Loving kindness, Iudgment and
Righteousness in the Earth, for in these
things do I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>light saith the Lord, Ier.</hi> 9. 24.
Which is as much as to say, therefore I
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100709:181"/>
am exercised in these things, because
I <hi>delight</hi> in them: or, my delight in these
things is the Principle whereby I am act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Exercise of them. <hi>Thou art
Good</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>and dost good,
Psal.</hi> 119. 68. Or, <hi>because</hi> thou art Good
thou dost good, and God's <hi>being</hi> Good is
his <hi>Delighting</hi> in Goodness. Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Goodness are too Excellent
things to be made mere means to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
End. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee,
that pardoneth Iniquity, and passeth by the
Transgression of the Remnant of his Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
he retaineth not his anger for ever</hi>
(and why he doth not, the next words
tell us) <hi>because he Delighteth in Mercy,
Mic.</hi> 7. 18. And our imitating of
God and being like to him is the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and business of our Saviour's Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But I would not be understood as if I
affirmed that <hi>that</hi> Obedience which
springs from <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Fear,</hi> or is excited
by the consideration of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
is an Obedience not becoming
and unworthy of Christians: If so, I
should condemn our Saviour and his
Apostles for proposing such Motives.
But I say,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:100709:182"/>First, That the <hi>most</hi> genuinely Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Obedience is that which proceeds
from <hi>Love,</hi> from the Love of God and
Goodness; Not that Christianity doth
<hi>exclude</hi> all other Motives, but this is the
Chief and Principal, because it makes
our Obedience most Free, and makes us
most like to God in doing Good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I say also that to do good
from a Principle of love to God and
Goodness, and to do it from the hope of
Heaven and the fear of Hell are one and
the same thing, if we have a true notion
of Heaven and Hell: That is, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of the Heavenly State as that which
consists in a perfect likeness to God (as
perfect as our Natures are capable of)
and a full and complete enjoyment of
him; and of the Hellish State as that
which is directly opposite to the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
according to <hi>this</hi> Notion of it. Now
I need not spend one minute in shewing,
that to do good from the hope of <hi>such</hi> a
Happiness, and from the fear of <hi>such</hi> a
Misery, is to be acted by the foresaid prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Love in so doing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I add, that to be acted by
mere External Motives, Motives wholly
Extrinsical to God and Goodness, by the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ar of Hell onely considered as a place of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100709:182"/>
Torment, and the hope of Heaven onely
considered as a place of great Pleasure
and Joy, without considering the <hi>nature</hi>
of that torment and the <hi>nature</hi> of that
Joy, <hi>this</hi> is a low and mean Obedience,
as having nothing but <hi>Self-love</hi> in it, and
Self-love of the lower kind too; and <hi>this</hi>
is a <hi>forced</hi> not a <hi>free</hi> Obedience.</p>
               <p>It is a certain truth, that he who hath
no sense of the inward Pulchritude and
Loveliness of Virtue, and of the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and Ugliness of Vice, and the Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibleness
of the former before the latter
considered in <hi>themselves,</hi> and therefore
would be a Wicked wretch if he were
not held in by the mere hope of a Reward
and fear of Punishment, though he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so Conformable outwardly to the
Laws of Christ, this man is no Christian.
He is much nearer to the Kingdom of
God, than he on whom Hope and Fear
have no Influence to make him better,
but he hath not attained to a due qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and meetness for it.</p>
               <p>I appeal to any <hi>Father,</hi> whether he
would account such a one a good Child
who is mightily observant of him, if he
were assured that his Obedience proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from no more generous Principles;
and that he would be a Rogue and a
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100709:183"/>
Villain but for fear of the Lash, and that
he hopes for his Estate. As little reason
hath our Saviour to account such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of his <hi>good Christians,</hi> as we have to
account such Sons of ours <hi>good Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And from what hath now been said
we learn what to think of the Principle
of <hi>Gratitude;</hi> Whether <hi>this</hi> makes that
Obedience which ariseth from thence
the most genuinely Christian Obedience,
as it is ordinarily said it doth. If our
Gratitude proceeds merely from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Divine Bounty to our
<hi>selves,</hi> taking no notice of that expressed
to our Fellow-Creatures, it hath nothing
but Self-love in it, and therefore is more
<hi>Animal</hi> than <hi>Christian</hi> Gratitude. And
consequently, I need not ask what we are
to think of that Gratitude which is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
onely or chiefly upon the Peculiarity
of God's love to our <hi>selves; that</hi> wherein
the Sweetest and most Indearing Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
is this, that the Generality of
Mankind are excluded from it: Truly
this is a worse than mere Animal Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and speaks a Mind exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of that Divine (and therefore
Christian) temper, which exerts it self
in Universal good will. And I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the more a Christian any man
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100709:183"/>
is, the higher will the Consideration of
<hi>other's</hi> having a share with him in the
Blessings of God advance his Gratitude.
And <hi>that</hi> which doth most become us
springs more from a lovely sense of the
Divine Beneficence considered as largely
extended, than from the Consideration
of its being terminated on our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or Families, or some few people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
our selves.</p>
               <p>I do not say, that the peculiarity of a
Favour ought not to affect us, when it is
not in our Fancy onely but in reality:
But, I say, there is nothing but what is
<hi>natural,</hi> (it is impossible we should not
be affected with it when we consider it)
there is nothing proper to a <hi>Christian</hi> in
such a Gratitude; and I say also, that
though this Consideration, I have such a
Mercy conferred upon me, which not
one in a thousand is blessed with besides
my self, must needs the more affect me
with Joy and Gratitude; because it
makes me sensible that it was more than
a thousand to one I might have missed of
it too, supposing it was no fruit of my
extraordinary diligence, and I did no
more than others for it who went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it: Yet it would be a very Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and therefore Wicked, thing in
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:100709:184"/>
me to be so much the more thankful for
that Mercy, <hi>because</hi> it is denied to most
others. There is a Vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
being the more grateful for a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
because, since so small a number are
partakers of it, I am one of those that
<hi>are;</hi> and being so, because so small a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
are partakers of it. And the more
will our Gratitude have of the truly
Christian Spirit, the less we abstract <hi>our
selves</hi> from <hi>others</hi> in the Consideration of
those obligations God hath laid upon us
together <hi>with</hi> others; and by consequence
that Obedience will be most <hi>Christian</hi>-like
which flows from such a Gratitude.</p>

            <head>THE
CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>NOW then, after all that hath been
said upon this weighty Argument,
shall we continue as negligent and cold
as ever in Asserting our Liberty? That
Liberty which is infinitely most Valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that Liberty which sets free from
the Vilest and most Intolerable Slavery,
the Liberty of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and the truly
<hi>Divine Liberty?</hi> Shall that Liberty
which deserves not to be named on the
same day with <hi>this,</hi> be so highly set by,
and can we tamely give up <hi>this?</hi> Do
men think Freedom from Bodily Slavery
to be worth the Price of all they have,
their <hi>Lives</hi> and all, and are we able to
imagine that Freedom from Spiritual
Slavery can be bought too dear; or think
much of using our most Serious Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for the regaining of it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:100709:185"/>Had the <hi>Laconick</hi> Boy,<note place="margin">Phil. Iud. p. 682.</note> when taken
Captive by a Souldier of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> so
brave a Spirit as to refuse to be employed
by him, in any of that drudgery which
was proper to Slaves, and to prefer a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent

he despaired of Redemption?<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Did those
<hi>Dardan</hi> Women esteem Slavery <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the most loathsom of all Evils,
and so extremely Vile and Shameful a
thing, as to take their dear Children and
drown them in the River to prevent
their being made Slaves of? And are we
of so much a baser Make than that poor
Lad, and these silly Women, as Sheepish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to subject our selves to the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
most Vile and dishonourable Slavery?
Nay, are we so void of all Sense as to be
unconcerned at the unsupportable Misery
which first or last will be the unavoidable
consequent thereof? Are we <hi>Nati ad Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitutem,</hi>
is Slavery so <hi>natural</hi> to us, as
that we can endure to be domineered
over by the most Tyrannical and Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Masters, as we have shewed our
Lusts and the Devil are? Are we so in
love with the house of Bondage as to be
well satisfied to make it the place of our
perpetual Residence? Are we so like
<hi>Apes</hi> as to hug our Clogs, and so like
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100709:185"/>
               <hi>Bedlams</hi> as to be fond of our Shackles?</p>
            <p>The King of Heaven, we have heard,
hath sent his onely Begotten Son upon
this very Errand of Knocking off our
Fetters, of <hi>proclaiming Liberty to us Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and opening the Prison doors unto
them that are bound;</hi> of delivering us from
our Thraldom and Vassalage, and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
us Free indeed,</hi> Free with the most
Excellent and Noble Freedom; and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
those out of the snare of the Devil
who are taken Captive by him at his Will;</hi>
and <hi>will</hi> we not be made Free? Will we
not exchange this worse than <hi>Egyptian</hi>
Slavery for the <hi>Glorious Liberty</hi> of the
Sons of God?</p>
            <p>As <hi>God</hi> said of old to <hi>Ierusalem, Wilt
thou not be made clean, when shall it once be?</hi>
So let <hi>me</hi> say to every Soul that lyeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Dominion of Corrupt Affections,
<hi>Wilt thou not be set at Liberty, when shall it
once be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did the <hi>Grecians</hi> when set at Liberty
by <hi>Flaminius</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports) sound
out, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OVR,
SAVIOVR,</hi> with such a
Courage, that the Birds which flew over
them fell Astonisht to the Ground? And
can <hi>we</hi> be so little Affected with what <hi>our</hi>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:100709:186"/>
Saviour hath done for us in order to our
being rescued from <hi>that</hi> Slavery which is
so much worse than <hi>theirs,</hi> as not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Deliverance at his hands? Can <hi>we</hi>
be so unconcerned at what King <hi>IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS</hi>
hath done for <hi>our</hi> Redemption, as
to refuse to embrace his offers of it?</p>
            <p>Have we conceived so low an opinion
of the Service of God, and his Blessed
Son, as to <hi>chuse</hi> to be Drudges and Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
to most Cruel <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> rather than
to be <hi>their</hi> Free-men? Had we rather still
toil in the Brick-Kilns of <hi>Egypt</hi> than inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and possess the good Land; the Land
of Peace and Rest, Liberty and Joy?
God forbid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O that therefore we would at length
be perswaded, first to accept of, and then
to</hi> stand fast in the Liberty, wherewith Christ
would make us free, and no more be intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the yoke of Bondage.</p>
            <p>Hath Christ <hi>Iesus</hi> taken such an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
course in order to our being set free
from the power of Sin, and its dismal
Effects? Then let us no longer cry out,
<hi>O wretched men that we are, who shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us from the body of this death?</hi> as if
we knew of no Deliverer; but let us
<hi>thank God through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:100709:186"/>It hath been shewed that Christ is not
<hi>so</hi> our Deliverer as to leave <hi>us</hi> nothing to
do, as to bid us <hi>stand still</hi> (as <hi>Moses</hi> did
the <hi>Israelites</hi> at the Red-Sea) <hi>and see the
Salvation of God,</hi> and see what himself
will do for us; but that he doth expect
we should do <hi>our</hi> part in order to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
set Free. But he hath done as much
as we can reasonably desire he should do
for that end, and abundantly more than
could ever have entered into our hearts to
imagine he would have done; and <hi>so</hi>
much that it must be now wholly long of
our <hi>selves,</hi> our own inexcusable negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
if what he hath done prove at last
unsuccessful.</p>
            <p>We are too weak to deliver our selves
by our own strength, by our own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
power we are utterly unable to rescue
our selves from under the dominion of
our Spiritual Adversaries; but Christ
hath purchased that Grace which shall be
sufficient for us, if we will make a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Application to him for it, so that
we may, if it be not our own fault, <hi>be
strong in the Lord and in the power of his
Might;</hi> and therefore our weakness can
be no excuse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:100709:187"/>It is to be acknowledged also that we
are naturally very listless and averse to
the using of the means of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but what would we desire our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to do more than he hath done to
excite our Wills and quicken our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours?</p>
            <p>Nor can we plead Ignorance of the
Means to be used, for we have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
how fully our Saviour and his
Apostles have instructed us in <hi>these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hath Christ been so wonderfully
concerned for our Deliverance, and can
we our selves be unconcerned? Did <hi>he</hi>
pay such a Ransom and Price for us, and
not think much of coming down from
Heaven, of taking our Nature, of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his precious Bloud, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inexpressible Torments in order to
this great End, and can <hi>we</hi> think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of our serious Care? What is
<hi>this</hi> but <hi>to tread under foot the Son of God,</hi>
and that Bloud whereby we are Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
            <p>Was ever any miserable Slave heard of
that might if he would be set at Liberty,
and yet refused? Or is it imaginable that
such a one could listen to any temptation
whatsoever to continue in Slavery?
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100709:187"/>
especially if he were promised by a Person
able to make good his word, that he
should exchange his Prison for a Palace,
and his House of Bondage for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
But we have seen that no less a
Motive than <hi>this</hi> is presented to us by one
who <hi>cannot lie,</hi> and who is as Able as
Faithful. We have the greatest Security
in the World given us of a Crown of
Glory, and an Everlasting Kingdom;
which infinitely surpasseth all the
Crowns and Kingdoms upon Earth to
perswade us to comply with that Rare,
most Powerful and most Wise Method
which our Lord hath taken to make us
Free.</p>
            <p>What a wonderful thing is this, that
our Lord should <hi>hire</hi> us to accept of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and that at such a Rate as this!
That he should have such Compassion
and Love for our Souls, as, that so we
may be perswaded to do that which is
<hi>onely</hi> our <hi>own</hi> Interest, and infinitely our
<hi>greatest</hi> Interest to do, that so we may be
won upon to cease from the vilest, most
filthy and most miserable Drudgery, and
to Engage in his most Free and Blessed
Service, he should think that he cannot
make us too large Offers. That he should
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100709:188"/>
so strangely out-bid the Devil and our
Lusts, and, that we may no longer be
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ooled by their pitiful Promises of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
Empty and False Pleasures,
should proffer us such Joys, such Bliss,
as to which those Pleasures, were they
<hi>truly so,</hi> and never so durable, cannot
bear the <hi>least</hi> proportion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And, that we
might no longer suffer our selves to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
and Tyrannized over by <hi>them,</hi> and
to be, as it were, their Footstool, he
should assure us of his willingness, nay,
of his great <hi>desire</hi> to advance us to his <hi>own</hi>
Throne. For, as hath been said, he
hath promised <hi>To grant unto him that
overcometh that he shall sit with him upon
his Throne, even as he also overcame, and
is set down with his Father upon his Throne.</hi>
He applieth himself to that Principle
which is most predominant in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
so that if the love of <hi>himself</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
yet the love of our <hi>own selves</hi> may
even compel us to come in to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>But one would think we should find it
no less impossible to be so Disingenuous
towards our dear Lord, than to be so
cruel to our selves as to slight <hi>such</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or <hi>that</hi> his most gracious and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Invitation, <hi>Come unto me all ye that
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100709:188"/>
labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
you Rest. Take my yoke upon you, and
learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in
heart, and ye shall find Rest to your Souls.
For my yoke is easie, and my burden is light,</hi>
Matth. 11. 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>But then are we able to think of it with
any Patience, that Christ should Do
and Suffer in our behalf so much <hi>in vain;</hi>
that we should <hi>frustrate</hi> the Design of his
Astonishing Condescension in assuming
our Nature, and of all he did and suffered
for us?</p>
            <p>Hath he paid so Excessively dear for us,
and can we be content that after all he
should <hi>lose</hi> his Purchase? Especially
since he purchased us, not because he
stood in the least need of our Service, but
that we might serve our <hi>selves</hi> in serving
<hi>him,</hi> and be made thereby unconceivably
and Everlastingly Happy.</p>
            <p>Do we not look upon the <hi>Iews</hi> as a very
strange Generation of Pople, and as no
less <hi>Ill-natured</hi> than <hi>Foolish,</hi> that they
would not be prevailed with to accept of
Deliverance from the Burdensom Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law; that they should
be so fond of that Servile Dispensation
they were under, as to refuse to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100709:189"/>
from it? Whenas the Abolishing
thereof was evidenced in as full and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
a manner as its Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
before was: Nay, when <hi>that</hi> of the
Gospel set up in the room of it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
in a far <hi>more</hi> glorious manner
to be of God, by Christ himself before
his death, by his Resurrection from the
dead, and Ascension into Heaven, and
by the Spirit in the Apostles and others
afterward. And shall <hi>we</hi> refuse to be set
at Liberty by our Saviour from the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of <hi>Sin,</hi> which is infinitely <hi>more</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and unsufferable, and the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of which are so sad and intolerable?
While we so do, let us never blame the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and much less accuse them of being
<hi>so</hi> perverse, hard-hearted and stiff-neckt
a People; for <hi>then,</hi> wherein we judge
<hi>them</hi> we condemn <hi>our selves,</hi> for we that
judge <hi>them</hi> do not onely the <hi>same,</hi> but a
far more unaccountable thing. And
think we this that so judge them that
have done such a thing, and do the same
and so much worse, that <hi>we</hi> shall escape
the judgment of God? Nay, are we able
not to think that it shall be much more
intolerable for <hi>us</hi> at the day of Judgment
than for <hi>them,</hi> if we persist in so doing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:100709:189"/>We are apt to believe that no People
ever deserved so ill of our Saviour as those
<hi>Pharisees</hi> who ascribed his casting out
Devils to the Assistance of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the
Prince of the Devils: But how much
<hi>better</hi> do we think <hi>those</hi> deserve of him
who will not obey him, after they have
had far <hi>greater</hi> Evidence of his being the
Son of God than <hi>they</hi> at that time were in
a possibility of having? And if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
did accuse those of <hi>despising</hi> both <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
and his <hi>Father that sent him,</hi> who
would not be perswaded by his Mighty
WORKS to believe in him while he
was on <hi>Earth,</hi> what a high Affront then
do those put upon both, who will not
give up themselves to be ruled by him,
and quit the service of <hi>Satan</hi> for <hi>his</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
(which is the same thing with not
believing in him) now he is in <hi>Heaven,</hi>
and in all his Glory? This he must needs
take far more unkindly and hainously at
our hands. And be we assured (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more Evident) that, as <hi>he</hi> is a
most unreasonable Creature, who after
such marvellous Evidence of <hi>Iesus</hi> his
being the Son of God, and now <hi>sate down
on the Right Hand of the Majesty on High,</hi>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:100709:190"/>
will not give credit to these Doctrines;
so <hi>he</hi> is much <hi>more</hi> Unreasonable who
<hi>doth</hi> give credit to them, and yet behave
himself as if he believed no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>O that therefore we would (those of
us who have hitherto neglected to do it)
before it be too late and without farther
delay, <hi>Consider these things, and shew our
selves Men;</hi> and then we shall with great
Courage and Resolution make use of
those Weapons which the Captain of
our Salvation hath put into our hands,
for the Vanquishing the Enemies of our
Souls; which Weapons <hi>are not Carnal,
but Mighty through God.</hi> And if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe
in so doing, then shall those who
have held such a severe hand over us fly
before us; then shall those Lords who
so subjected <hi>us,</hi> and kept us under, be
brought under by us, be <hi>our</hi> Subjects.
Then shall our Prison-doors fly open, we
shall be no longer under Restraint and
Confinement. We shall be our own
Men, and <hi>walk at Liberty; We shall run
and not be weary, walk and not faint, until
we appear before God in Sion;</hi> Until we
are delivered from all Molestation <hi>from,</hi>
