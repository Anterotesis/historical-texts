            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

Miniſters, who diligently preach the Goſpel, are worthie of the like at this day; and neither of them obliged to preach the Goſpell freely without any recompence, wages, reward, as ſome Seducers now pretend.</p>

                     </p>

By the grounds of Commutative Juſtice, They are (or at leaſtwiſe may be if they will themſelves, the caſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of obſtinate Separatiſts) <hi>partakers of the Ministers ſpiritual things and pains:</hi> therefore ought in juſtice, duty, to pay and render them ſome proportionable recompence for what they receive from them; even as all other Merchants, Tradeſmen who barter or ſell one commodity for another, or for ready money, uſe to doe.</p>

From the nature, value of the things they receive from Miniſters; and of thoſe things they render back to them by way of exchange, which will hold no ballance nor equal value with what they firſt receive: For the things the people enjoy by Miniſters, are <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> which concern their ſouls, ſpirits, everlaſting ſalvation, eternal happineſs, and are the <hi>moſt excellent, precious things of all other, farr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling Gold, Silver, Tithes, and all earthly Treaſures.

But the things and recompence they return to Miniſters for them, are only <hi>their carnal things,</hi> for the neceſſary ſupport of their bodies and families, which are no way comparable in value, worth, benefit, uſe to what they receive from them, as the laſt recited Texts and others reſolve. The people therefore receiving from their Miniſters <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and things of infinite more value, benefit, than what they render to them; the carnal things they receive for their <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> (though in a liberal proportion) muſt needs be a

reaſons, motives to convince all of the juſtice of our Miniſters maintenance, and to induce them chearfully to render it unto them, though it were not due by humane Laws, as we know it is.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. The very Goſpel enjoyns all Chriſtians, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20, 21. <hi>To diſtribute to the neceſſitie of the Saints,</hi> and <hi>to be hoſpitable</hi> (not only to thoſe we know, but) <hi>even to ſtrangers. Heb:</hi> 13.2. And if <hi>our enemie hunger,</hi> it commands us <hi>to feed him; if he thirſt, to give him drink</hi>; and <hi>Not to be overcome with evil, but to overcome evil with good</hi>; ſeconded with <hi>Mat:</hi> 5.44, 45, 46, 47, 48. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.32, to 37. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.22. whence thus I argue: If Chriſtians muſt diſtribute to the neceſſities of, and be hoſpitable to Saints and others, who are meer ſtrangers to them, yea give meat, drink to their very enemies, and overcome their evil with goodneſs; Then it neceſſarily followes, they muſt much more diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the neceſſities of, be hoſpitable, liberal, give meat, drink, maintenance to their own faithfull preaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and recompence their good with good again, <hi>elſe they ſhall be worſe than Publicans and ſinners, who doe good to thoſe that do good to and for them, Mat.</hi> 5.46, 47.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. This is evident by the practice of the primitive Saints and Chriſtians recorded in the Goſpel for our imitation; who though they paid all civil Tributes, Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, Duties to the civil Magiſtrates, and likewiſe Tithes and other duties to the Jewiſh or Pagan Prieſts under whom they lived; yet they likewiſe freely and liberally miniſtred, contributed of their ſubſtance and temporal eſtates towards the maintenance of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Miniſters of the Goſpel. Hence we read, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.2, 3. That <hi>Mary Magdalen, Joanna the wife of</hi> Cuza, Herods <hi>Steward, Suſanna and MAN, others</hi> (of our Saviours au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors) <hi>ministred to him of their ſubſtance:</hi> put, it ſeems, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>common purſe</hi> for the maintenance of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which <hi>Judas kept; who provided bread, meat and other neceſſaries out of it</hi>; as is evident by <hi>John</hi> 4.8, 31. &amp; 12.5, 6. &amp; 13.29. &amp; 6.5, 7. compared together.

And when he was preſent with them, and wanted, that which was wanting unto him, the Brethren that came from Macedonia <hi>ſupplied</hi>; that in all things he might keep himſelf from being burdenſome to the Corinthians</hi>; (for reaſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by him) In which reſpect, of not miniſtring to him of their ſubſtance, he writes, <hi>they were inferiour to other Churches,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 13. How bountifull the Church and Saints of <hi>Philippi</hi> were to <hi>Paul,</hi> not only whiles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them and preaching among them, but alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them, preaching the Goſpell in other places, and how pleaſing this their liberalitie was to God, he thus records; <hi>Phil:</hi> 4.10, to 21. <hi>But I rejoyced in the Lord great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that at laſt your care of me is revived; wherein ye were alſo <hi>Carefull,</hi> but ye lacked opportunity: Not that I ſpeak in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

Now ye</hi> Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>know alſo, that in the beginning of the Goſpel, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Macedonia, no Churches communicated with me as concerning <hi>Giving</hi> and <hi>Receiving, but ye only</hi>: For even in Theſſalonica <hi>Ye ſent once</hi> and <hi>again to my neceſſity.</hi> Not becauſe I deſire a gift, but I deſire fruit that may abound to your accompt. But I have received all, and <hi>abound</hi> and <hi>am full,</hi> having received of</hi> Epaphroditus <hi>the things ſent from you; an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a Sacrifice Acceptable, well-pleaſing to God. But my God ſhall ſupply all your needs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his riches in glory by Jeſus Chriſt; Now unto God and our Father, be glory for ever and ever Amen.</hi> And in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. He makes this memorable Teſtimony of and prayer for <hi>Oneſiphorus: The Lord give mercy unto the houſe of</hi> Oneſiphorus, <hi>for he often refreſhed me, and was not aſhamed of my chain: But when he was in Rome, he ſought me out very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and found me: The Lord grant unto him, that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: And in <hi>how many things he Miniſtred unto me at Epheſus</hi> thou knoweſt very well.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From all which precedents coupled together, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions naturally, and neceſſarily ariſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is not only the practice, but duty of the Saints and Chriſtians under the Goſpel, chearfully and liberally to contribute to the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpel; and that not only whiles they are actually preaching and reſident amongſt them, but whiles abſent preaching, the Goſpel in other places, or ſuffering for the Goſpel in bonds and priſons, if their neceſſities ſo require.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they ought not only barely to ſupply their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, when they are in want; but in ſuch a plentiful manner, that they may truly ſay, <hi>We abound and are full, bleſſe God for, rejoyce in their peoples liberality, and pray to God for a bleſſing upon them and theirs, with greater chearfulneſs and zeal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That in caſes of neceſſity, when the wants of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Miniſters and Saints of God require it, Chriſtians are not only bound to pay them the Tithes of their Lands
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100818:22"/>
and other ſetled Dues, but even to <hi>ſell their very Lands, Houſes, Eſtates themſelves and lay them down at the Apoſtles and Miniſters feet for their common ſupply</hi>; as the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did; they being not real proprietors, but <hi>meer Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of their worldly eſtates</hi>; which as they all <hi>proceed from Gods hand, gift, bleſſing</hi>; ſo they are ſtill, <hi>Gods own,</hi> not mans; and therefore in ſuch caſes, to be chearfully expended for the maintenance and ſupply of the neceſſities of his <hi>Miniſters, ſervants, worſhip</hi>: 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the maintenance of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is not meer <hi>pure Almes,</hi> (as ſome have held) but <hi>wages</hi>; which though <hi>Paul</hi> (for ſome ſpecial reaſons) received not from the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> yet he did from other Churches, under the name of <hi>wages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That niggardlineſſe, and not contributing towards the maintenance of painful Miniſters, is a <hi>ſhame, infamy, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to a Church and people,</hi> making them <hi>inferiour</hi> to all <hi>other Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. That peoples liberal, bountifull contributing to the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpel, is a <hi>great joy, comfort, encouragement to them,</hi> yea a means to <hi>enlarge their hearts in prayers to God for ſpiritual and temporal bleſſings on them and their houſholds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. That bountifull and chearfull contributions to the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt, is not only a <hi>well doing,</hi> or good work, <hi>but an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable and well pleaſing unto God,</hi> though it ſtinks in the noſtrils of many covetous earth-wormes, ſectaries and pretended godly Saints now adaies.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That Liberality to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and paying them their juſt deſerved Tithes, Dues, is ſo farr from impoveriſhing and hurting mens eſtates, that it <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to their ſpiritual and temporal accompt too; cauſeth God to ſupply all their wants, and to bleſſe both them and their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies with ſpiritual, temporal, eternal mercies and rewards</hi>; as the ſeveral forecited Scriptures, with <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.41, 42. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.41. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6, to 13. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.8, to 38. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.10, to 24. moſt abundantly prove.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100818:23"/>9. That the willful detaining, withdrawing of any thing ſolemnly devoted to the neceſſary maintenance of the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpel, brings <hi>exemplary curſes, judgements on thoſe who are guilty</hi> thereof, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> teſtifie, compared with <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8, 9, 11. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11, &amp; 2.16, 17, 18, 19. further illuſtrating it: which all ſacrilegious invaders, plunderers, detainers, oppugners of our Miniſters ancient eſtabliſhed Maintenance, Tithes, Dues, may do well now ſeriouſly to ruminate upon, and then reform their practice, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their pretended Chriſtianity and Saintſhip, ſo much ſwarving from the recited precedents of the firſt and pureſt Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. This is further proved by <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.31. <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, <hi>do even ſo to them,</hi> for this is the Law and the Prophets</hi>; yea and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> too; thus twice enjoyning it, from Chriſts own mouth. Whence thus I argue. All Eſtates, Callings, Profeſſions of men whatſoever; whether Kings, Princes, Rulers, Judges, Magiſtrates of all ſorts, Lawyers, Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chirurgeons, Merchants, Artificers, Traders, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, Labourers of all kinds, Sea-men; yea all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Commanders, Collonels, Captains, Governours of Forts, and common Souldiers whatſoever, with all ſorts of civil Officers in their reſpective Offices, Imployments, do and juſtly may by the Law of God, Nature, Nations, expect and receive a juſt, certain comfortable ſalary, reward, hire, maintenance, ſubſiſtence for their reſpective pains, workes, imployments, exerciſes of their callings, talents from thoſe that do imploy them, or for whoſe good they worke and ſerve. Therefore by the ſelf-ſame Lawes, Rules of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, natural, moral juſtice and equity, all Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpel may juſtly expect and receive the like, from thoſe to whom they preach; Elſe all others whatſoever muſt exerciſe their reſpective Offices, Callings, Trades, Imployments, Studies, Labours freely, without expecting or receiving any ſtipend, wages, reward or maintenance, as well as Miniſters; which they will never do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100818:23"/>And great reaſon is there that the painfull, faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel ſhould receive a liberal, comfortable, competent, ſetled maintenance and reward for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, as well as any other Callings, or Profeſſions of men, or as any Officers or Soldiers in the Armie, between whom alone and Miniſters I ſhall here only make the parallel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they moſt violently oppugne our Miniſters mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (if not their Miniſtrie too) of all others I have yet conferred with.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, all able, learned, judicious, pious Miniſters, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Original Tongues, and learned Languages, wherein the Scriptures were penned (very neceſſarie for them to underſtand) able <hi>ſoundly, judiciouſly, like work-men who need not be aſhamed, to defend the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to ſtop the mouthes of Blaſphemers, Hereticks, Seducers, that oppugne it; to divide and preach the, Word of God aright</hi> as they ought. (Elſe they hardly merit the name of <hi>able Ministers,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. 1 Tim. 1.7, 12. 2 Tim. 2.15. &amp; 4.2, 3, 4, 5. Tit. 1.9, 10, 11. but rather of <hi>pratlers, wranglers, underſtanding neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm, wresting the ſcriptures to their own and others deſtruction through ignorance and want of learning,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16. the caſe of many unlearned uſurpers of the office of Teachers now) All ſuch before they can be fit for the work of the Miniſtrie, ſpend ſixteen or twentie years time, in hard ſtudies day and night at their Books in Schools, Univerſities, double the yeares, ſtudie, induſtrie, that moſt other Artiſts (except Lawyers and Phyſicians) ſpend in fitting themſelves for, and in learning their mechanick Trades and Profeſſions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all common Souldiers, yea many Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of late times, ruſh juſt like their horſes, into their work, calling, without one years, weeks, dayes preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtudie, practice in the Wars, learning their trade of Souldiers and Commanders, after they are liſted, as ſuch, by practice and experience only without ſtudie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Moſt Miniſters, or their Parents, Friends are at very great expences for many years time in ſitting them for the Miniſtry, both in Schools and in our Univerſities, before they enter into, or are able for it: whereas all our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100818:24"/>
&amp; Army-Officers were at no expence at all, receiving full pay, as ſuch, from the firſt day of their liſting, yea many of them advance money to boot, before any practice at all or ſtudy, judgement in their Art; learning their Military skill, not at their own, but only at the peoples great coſts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Learned Miniſters both before and after their admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the Miniſtry, are at great charges, expences, to furniſh themſelves with Bookes, Libraries, neceſſary for their Calling: whereas our Army-Officers, Soldiers are and were furniſhed with all ſorts of Armes, Ammunition fitting for their calling out of the publick Treaſury only, which continually recruits them when loſt in Service.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The calling of the Miniſtry requires men of far more able parts and eminency of gifts (whereby they might gain far more worldly wealth, riches, honours in many other callings, than they do or can do by the Miniſtry, by which they are commonly loſers in reſpect of worldly gains and preferments, a thing very conſiderable) than the calling of an ordinary Souldier, or moſt warlike Officers doe; as experience manifeſts, and I think moſt Souldiers, Officers will acknowledge; and thereupon muſt admit them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable allowance to their parts, work in the Miniſtry it ſelf, and what they might probably gain in other functions.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Miniſters when once entred into their callings, are alwaies day and night upon conſtant duty, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; their whole lives being ſo taken up with ſtudy, preaching, catechizing, praying, faſting, exhorting, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, reproving, comforting, viſiting the ſick in body, troubled in mind, reſolving doubts of conſcience, and other Miniſterial duties as well <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2.46. c. 20.20. 2 Tim. 4.1, 2.

other Governours, Officers before them had done; and that <hi>becauſe of the fear of God, becauſe the bondage was great upon the people</hi>; expecting only a reward from God.

                     <p>The third Objection is from the 3 <hi>Epiſtle of John verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7.<note place="margin">Object. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> Where <hi>John</hi> writes to <hi>Gaius; Beloved, thou dost faithfully whatſoever thou dost, both to the Brethren and to ſtrangers:

                        </hi> (or Liberalitie) <hi>before the Church, whom if thou bring on forward on their journey <hi>thou ſhalt do well,</hi> becauſe that for his name ſake <hi>they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles</hi>.</hi> Whence ſome may inferr, (though I hear not this Text urged by any) That Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought now to preach the Goſpel freely to the people, and to take nothing of them; becauſe <hi>John</hi> mentions ſome ſuch that in his time preached to the Gentiles taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them. To which I Anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That this Text queſtionleſs was meant of <hi>Paul</hi> (the <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles,</hi> and his <hi>companions Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anſw:</note> who took nothing of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14, 15, 16, 17, 18.) ſeeing <hi>Gaius</hi> was not only St. <hi>Pauls companion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, being converted, baptized by him, Act.</hi> 19.29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. but expreſly ſtiled by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Gaius <hi>mine Hoſt,</hi> and <hi>of all the Churches</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. It is evident, that this <hi>Gaius</hi> (for ſome time at leaſt) lodged <hi>Paul and other Brethren</hi>; being not only faithfull, but <hi>charitable</hi> and <hi>liberal</hi> towards them, though the other <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not ſo.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. St. <hi>John</hi> addes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>We therefore ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch, that <hi>we might be fellow helpers to the truth:</hi>

So as this Scripture fully warrants my Propoſition, not oppugnes it.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Objection,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> is the opinion of our famous Engliſh Apoſtle, <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> who held <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> maintenance to be <hi>meer alms,</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>they were originally given by people to the Miniſters that were needie, out of charitie and compaſſion, <hi>for Gods ſake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </hi>,</hi> as well as for their work ſake.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe Miniſters after their own wants ſupplied, did uſe to diſtribute part of them to the poor and needy, as alms, and are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged ſtill to do it</hi>; (as <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens Hiſtory of Tithes, ch. 5.7.10.11. &amp; Littleton, Tit.

                     <p n="3">3.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. As they ſtiled <hi>Tithes Alms</hi> in theſe reſpects: ſo they likewiſe granted <hi>Alms to poor people,</hi> and <hi>Tithes to be</hi>

that as well on the behalf of him that giveth the Tithes, as alſo in the behalf of the Curate, every ſuch Miniſtry ought freely to be given, and not by any civil exchange.</hi> I conceive it both a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy and errour in them, being a juſt debt which may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a Divine and Civil right too, when and where ſetled by a civil law, though freely to be given to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, without coercion or ſute of Law both in point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and by way of civil exchange too, out of a civil compact or contract.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p>Before ever the Levitical or Ceremonial Law was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; as the <hi>godly Patriarchs built Altars and Houſes for publick worſhip unto God, Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4. c. 8.20. c. 12.7, 8. c. 13.4, 18. c. 22.9: c. 26.25. c. 28.20, 21, 22. c. 33.20: &amp; 35.1, 3, 7.

Whence the Scripure expreſly records of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> (the two firſt-born of the world) <hi>Gen:</hi> 4.2, 3, 4, 5. That <hi>Cain being a tiller of the ground, brought of the fruits of the ground an offering to God</hi>; and that <hi>Abel being a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſheep, he alſo brought of the firſtlings of his flock, and the fat thereof for an Offering to the Lord</hi>; as moſt conceive their father <hi>Adam</hi> did before them: by whoſe precept and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they did it: After them we read, that <hi>Noah built an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the Altar, when he went out of the Ark, Gen.</hi> 8.20.

And for the Prieſts encouragement (directed by the very dictate of Nature, Reaſon informing them, <hi>That every Labourer was worthy of ſome competent hire,</hi> as Chriſt reſolves <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17.) they pitched upon <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 14.20. &amp; 28.21, 22.

end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a Prieſt continually. Now conſider how great this man was, unto whom even the Patriarch</hi> Abraham <hi>gave the tenth of the ſpoils.

                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall draw my Obſervations, Arguments concerning <hi>Tithes</hi> from both theſe Scriptures here recited, and then anſwer the main (if not ſole) Scripture objected againſt <hi>Tithes,</hi> drawn from the cloze of the Apoſtles words.</p>

                        </hi> (And why ſo?) <hi>For he loveth our Nation, and <hi>hath built us a Synagogue:</hi> Whereupon Jeſus went with them, and healed his ſervant; marvelling at the Centurions words, and turning about, and ſaying unto the people that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, I have not found ſo great Faith, no not in Iſrael.</hi> This great Centurion and Commander was no Jew, but a Gentile, one who but newly heard of Chriſts name and ſame; yet he had ſo much Piety and Bounty, as out of his very Spoyls and Gains of Warre (for we read of no other Lands or Gains he had) <hi>to build a Synagogue</hi> for <hi>Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>; which the Elders of the Jews, and Chriſt too, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a <hi>worthy act,</hi> and a ſufficient inducement for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to go with him and cure his ſervant. O that all our Centurions who have Souldiers under them, and exceed or equal him in command, would imitate and equal this <hi>Goſpel Centurion,</hi> in his pious munificence in building, in ſtead of contriving how to deface Temples, Churches, Synagogues, to aboliſh Tithes, ingroſſe Church Lands and Livings into their own hands; then ſhould they receive as large Encomiums of the reality and tranſcendency of their Faith, Piety, Charity from men, as he did from our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the Elders of the Jews, for building this new Synagogue.</p>

by <hi>the Tenth, or Tithes of all,</hi> in the two precedent Texts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is moſt probable, that <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tithes of all his own ſubſtance to <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> as well as of the ſpoyls; there being the ſelf-ſame, if not a ſtronger ground, for him to pay <hi>Tithes of all his other goods,</hi> encreaſe, as of theſe caſual ſpoyls, out of which no conſtant maintenance could be raiſed for any Paſtor, or Miniſter, as there might be out of the Tithes of his Cattel and Subſtance encreaſing every year. Now Tithes being intended for the Prieſts and Miniſters conſtant maintenance by God and Man, and this Precedent of <hi>Abraham,</hi> recorded for that end; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without an abſurdity, reſtrain his <hi>paying Tithes of all,</hi> only to the ſpoyls then, and then only unexpectedly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the enemy by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and reſtored by him to the right owners, the tenths of them only excepted; but, of the Tithes of all his <hi>Subſtance</hi> principally, whence a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant livelihood for the Prieſt could only ariſe, and of the ſpoyls of Warr only by reaſon of his occaſional meeting of <hi>Abraham</hi> then returning from the Warrs, and bleſſing him at that time.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This preſident of his, was in all probability, the ground of Gods appointing <hi>Tithes, by a ſpecial Law, for all the Prieſts and Levites MAINTENANCE amongst the Iſraelites, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Posterity,</hi> and the Apoſtle intimates as much, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. <hi>that they receive Tithes of their Brethren in the ſame manner by the Law, as Melchiſedec did of their Father Abraham.</hi> Now they received <hi>Tithes of Corn, Wine, Oyl,</hi> Cattel, all ſorts of herbs and fruits, for their ſtanding main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Inheritance too; <hi>Num.</hi> 18.20, to the end, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 27.30, 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.22, 28. Therefore it is moſt probable, if not infallible, that <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tithes to <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> of all thoſe things which the Levites and Prieſts afterward received from their brethren, not of the ſpoyls alone, out of which no certain Maintenance could be raiſed, not ſpecified therefore in thoſe general precepts concerning Tithes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Apoſtle arguing the natural juſtice of Miniſters maintenance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.27. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. uſeth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. <hi>If we have ſowen unto you ſpiritual things</hi> (in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

But how doth this appear? By theſe emphatical words; <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord Ordained</hi> (in the Preterperfect Tenſe) <hi>That they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel</hi>; But where hath the Lord ordained this? The Apoſtle thrice reſolves expreſly, that he hath done it in the Levitical Law, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>For it is written in the Laws of</hi> Moſes <hi>(Deut.</hi> 25.4.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn; doth God take care for Oxen?

                        </hi>; Which he again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.18. If this Precept concerning the meat and maintenance of Oxen only in the Letter, though part of the Levitical Law, was doubtleſs written for, and really intended of the Miniſters of the Goſpels food and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and in full force under the Goſpel, as the Apoſtle clearly reſolves; then <hi>a fortiori,</hi> the Precepts of the Law concerning the food and livelihood of Gods Prieſts, and Levites under the Law, by Glebes and Tithes, not pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremonial (as I have already proved) muſt doubtleſſe be intended of them, and be in full force likewiſe in their natural, equitable Sence and Proportion, in relation to their Livelihood for preaching of the Goſpel; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater Analogy, Proportion between them and Preachers of the Goſpel, than betwixt them and Oxen. To put it out of doubt, he ſubjoyns; <hi>Do not ye know, that they which minister about holy things, live of the things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar?</hi> To wit, by Gods expreſſe Ordinance in the Levitical Law, which <hi>ye know,</hi> and therefore I need not particularly cite the words, as I did the other, <hi>of not

muzzling the Ox,</hi> &amp;c. which were more obſcure, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my former Paraphraſe on them; but thus mind you of them in the general: And then he inferrs and ſubjoyns: <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained</hi> (to wit, by the very natural, moral Equity of the Lawes, Ordinances he made for the Prieſts and Levites Maintenance by Tithes, Glebes, and Free-will-offerings, for officiating in the Temple, and at the Altar under the Law) that the <hi>Preachers of the Goſpel</hi> (who now ſucceed, and ſupply their places, though in different ſervices in the Churches of Chriſt under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) <hi>ſhould live of the Goſpel; even ſo</hi> fully, comfortably, and in ſuch ſort, as they did under the Law: Or at leaſt by this <hi>Goſpel text,</hi> ſuperadded to them by Gods Spirit.

                        <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> To this I reply, 1. That Chriſt and his Apoſtles lived amongſt the Jews, who at that time were obliged by Gods <hi>own Law to pay their Tithes only to ſuch Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites as were of the Tribe of Levi, of which Tribe Christ and his Apoſtles were not; therefore they challenged not Tithes from them,</hi> Heb. 7.5. to 15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They then paid <hi>their Tithes duly to their Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> (mentioned John 1.19.) for which Chriſt <hi>commended them,</hi> reſolving they <hi>ought not to omit it,</hi> Mat. 23.23. Luke 11.42. ch. 18.12. Therefore it was no reaſon they ſhould pay them over again to Chriſt or his Apoſtles (no more than Papiſts, who pay Tithes in kind againſt their wills unto our Miniſters, though not to their own Prieſts, but only voluntary Contributions) whiles their Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſtood in force, which they generally ſubmitted to.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The total abrogation of the Levitical Prieſthood and Ceremonies by the death of Chriſt, was not <hi>certainly known to, nor reſolved by the Apoſtles and believing Jews or Gentiles, till ſome years ſpace after our Saviours Aſcenſion, as is evident by</hi> Acts 15. in the great caſe of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> about which there was a <hi>Synod</hi> aſſembled; by Pauls <hi>circumciſing</hi> Timothy <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, becauſe of the Jews,</hi> Acts 16.3. his <hi>purifying himſelf, and ſhaving his head after the Jewiſh manner, many years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Acts 21.20, to 28. which he being a <hi>Jew, was obliged even then to obſerve to avoid ſcandal, but not the Gentiles.</hi> Therefore Tithes amongſt the Jewes upon this account, were then ſtill paid to their Levitical Prieſts, not to the Apoſtles.</p>

                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:100818:82"/>4. Though Chriſt whiles on earth, received no Tithes from the Jewes, yet he had a juſt Right, Title to Tithes from <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his Poſterity, yea from the Levitical Prieſts themſelves (eſpecially after their abolition) as he was a Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> to whom <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf and the <hi>Levites then in his loins paid Tithes of all,</hi> Heb. 7.1, to 15.

                     <p n="2">2ly. There is one Notable conſiderable circumſtance of time in <hi>Abrahams</hi> payment of <hi>Tithes of all</hi> to Chriſt, the true <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> not formerly obſerved or preſſed by any I have ſeen; which (in my opinion) unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proves, that this Preſident of his moſt principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, related to the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> under the Goſpel, and as ſtrongly obligeth them (his true ſpiritual <hi>ſeed</hi>) to the due payment of Tithes to Chriſt and his Miniſters, now, as ever it did the <hi>Jews,</hi> his <hi>natural Poſterity,</hi> to pay Tithes to their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> under the Law, if not more firmly: Namely, that he thus paid Tithes to Chriſt, ſome good ſpace before <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> inſtituted, whiles he was yet <hi>uncircumciſed</hi>; as is moſt evident by comparing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, 10, to 15. <hi>Now as the Apostle</hi> thus firmly and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically argues from this very <hi>circumſtance of time, in the point of</hi> Abrahams <hi>justification by Faith, whiles he was yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed,</hi> as preſidential, exemplary, obligatory to all believing Gentiles, and ſpiritual Sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> under
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100818:91"/>
the Goſpel, who are not circumciſed, as well as to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural believing children of <hi>Abraham</hi> under the Law, who were circumciſed. Rom. 4.9, to 13. <q>Commeth this bleſſedneſſe then, upon the Circumciſion only, or upon the Uncircumciſion also? for we ſay, that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for Righteouſnes. How was it then reckoned, <hi>when he was in Circumciſion, or in Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion? Not in Circumciſion, but in Vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi> And he received Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Faith, which he had <hi>yet being Vncircumciſed,</hi> that he might be <hi>the Father of them that believe</hi> (under the Goſpel) <hi>though they be not Circumciſed,</hi> that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes might be imputed <hi>unto them alſo.</hi> And the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Circumciſion,</hi> to them who are not of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion only, but alſo walk in the ſteps of the Faith of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> which <hi>he had yet being uncircumciſed.</hi>
                        </q> So I, by parity of Reaſon, from this very Text, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ſame Apoſtles relation, of <hi>Abrahams pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tithes of all to Melchiſedec,</hi> Hebr. 7.1, to 15. and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences thence formerly inſiſted on, may as firmly, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly conclude, That his payment of Tithes to Chriſt the true <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> not after his Circumciſion, but <hi>whiles yet uncircumciſed,</hi> and before Circumciſion inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and that, as the <hi>Common-Father,</hi> Head of all the <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, faithfull, believing uncircumciſed Gentiles</hi> before the Law, and under the Goſpel, (as well as of the circumciſed believing Jews) <hi>walking in the ſteps of his Faith, which he had yet being uncircumciſed</hi>; doth as ſtrongly oblige all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles &amp; Chriſtians, though uncircumciſed, to pay Tithes of all to Chriſt and his Miniſters under the Goſpel, as it did his believing circumciſed Poſterity to render the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Chriſt himſelf originally, and his Prieſts and Levites ſecondarily under the Law; if not much more; ſince <hi>Abraham</hi> paid them to Chriſt before he was circumciſed, <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 14.17, 18, 19.

                     <p>HAving diſpatched the two principal Propoſitions of greateſt concernment, (wherein I have been larger than I at firſt intended) to ſatisfie all mens Conſciences, and ſtop the mouths of all <hi>Gain-ſayers,</hi> I now proceed to the third Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That if Tithes and other maintenance by Glebes, Oblations, Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, formerly ſetled on our Miniſters, be either wilfully withheld, or ſubstracted from them by the people, in part or in whole, the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates may and ought by coercive Laws, Penalties to inforce the payment of them in due form and time, both by the Law of God, and Rules of Iuſtice, without any Injury or Oppreſsion to the people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Propoſition neceſſarily follows from the former two: for if there be a juſt, competent, comfortable Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance due to all lawfull painfull Preachers, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, even by divine Right, inſtitution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Precepts, both of the Goſpel and Law of God; and that as a <hi>juſt Debt, hire, wages, ſalary, right,</hi> not as a mere voluntary Gift, Alms, Benevolence; and the ſetled main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of our Miniſters by Tithes, Glebes, Oblations, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and other Duties, be ſuch; as I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated: then the Civil Magiſtrates may and ought by coercive <hi>Laws</hi> and Penalties to enforce the payment of them in due form and time (as our very Officers by ſuch means enforce their Souldiers, Parents their Children and Servants, Schoolmaſters their Scholars, yea our Troopers their very Horſes, held in with Bits and Bridles when unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and quickned with Spurs when lazy: and Shepheards their very Sheep, with their Dogs and hooks, when there is cauſe, to do their duties, and reform their Errors) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2ly.

                     <p n="4">4ly.

and Commotions within the Realm.</hi> And will not then the aboliſhing of all Tithes in every Pariſh, to the prejudice of the Patrons, Miniſters, (yea and people too, as I ſhall prove anon) the ſcandal of moſt godly men, undoing of thouſands of families, and confounding all Pariſhes, and order in them, now much more do it, in theſe dangerous generally diſcontented times, inſtead of ſetling Unity, Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Peace, and propagating the Goſpel, as ſome pretend?

                     <p>Object. Firſt, <hi>That there is no expreſſe Precept in the Goſpel, nor any ſuch penal Laws, enforcing the payment of Tithes to be found in the Primitive and pureſt times for 500. years after Chriſt; Therefore they are unlawfull, oppreſsive, un-evangelical, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, antichriſtian</hi>; as <hi>Canne</hi> terms them, in his thundering <hi>empty voyce.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p n="3">3ly. The reaſon why there were no coercive Laws for the payment of Tithes or Miniſters dues in the Primitive Church for above 500 years was this, becauſe Chriſtians then were ſo zealous, ready, forwards to render them with an <hi>overplus,</hi> and <hi>to ſell their very Houſes, Lands, Poſſeſsions, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and lay them down at the Apoſtles and Ministers feet to maintain them, and relieve their poor Chriſtian Brethren,</hi> witneſs Acts 2.44, 45. c 4.34, 35, 37. c. 5.1, 2. 2 Cor. 11.9.

What need then any Law to compel the Chriſtians to pay Tithes or Miniſters dues, when in the heat of Perſecution, they were ſo bountifull to them and the Poor as thus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to contribute their whole Eſtates for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? Whoſe Preſident if the Cavillers againſt our preſent penal <hi>Laws, Ordinances for Tithes</hi> would imitate, no Miniſter nor other voluntary <hi>Tith-payers</hi> would oppoſe their repeal. And though in theſe Primitive times of Perſecution, the Chriſtians being ſpoyled of their Lands and Poſſeſſions, could not pay <hi>Tithes</hi> in kind in moſt places, but were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to ſuch <hi>voluntary Contributions</hi> as theſe, yet without all peradventure they held the payment of Tithes to Miniſters in kind, a <hi>Divine Moral Duty,</hi> and in ſome places, and at ſome times (when and where they could) did voluntarily pay Tithes as a Duty for their Maintenance without any coercive Laws or Canons, upon the bare demand or exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Miniſters, by vertue of <hi>Gods own Divine Laws,</hi> as is undeniable by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> l. 4. c. 34. <hi>who records, That the Chriſtians in his time</hi> (being but 180. years after Chriſt) <hi>did not give leſſe to their Miniſters than the Jews did to their Prieſts by the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>who received the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated</hi> TITHES <hi>of their people, but more,</hi> Deſigning <hi>omnia quae ſunt ipſorum, all they had to the <hi>Lords uſe, Hilariter ac liberaliter ea quae non ſunt minera:</hi> Giving chearfully and freely thoſe things which were not leſſe than Tithes, as having greater hope than they.</hi> And further confirmed by <hi>Origen,</hi> Homil. 11 in Numeros: Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> lib. 1.

And no ſooner were the times of Perſecution paſt, but the <hi>Divine Right of Tithes was aſſerted, preſſed,</hi> and the due payment of them inculcated by St. <hi>Hilary, Nazianzen, Ambroſe, Hierom, Chryſoſtom, Auguſtine, Euſebius, Caſſian, Cyril of Jeruſalem, Iſiodore Peluſiota, and Caeſarius Arelatenſis,</hi> all flouriſhing within 500. years after Chriſt, as Dr. <hi>Tilleſly</hi> proves at large; And the people during that ſpace paying their Tithes freely, without any compulſion in all places, there needed neither <hi>Laws</hi> nor <hi>Canons</hi> to enforce their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whence<note n="a" place="margin">Operum, p. 278.</note> 
                        <hi>Agobardus</hi> writes thus (about the year of our Lord 820. when <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> began to be made for their payment) of the precedent times: <hi>Nulla compulit neceſſitas fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vente ubique religioſa devotione, &amp; amore illustrandi Eccleſiae ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro aestuante.</hi> That there was no need of Canons or Laws to compel the payment of Tithes, whiles fervent religious Devotion, and love of illuſtrating Churches every where abounded.

                        <hi>love and zeal of many Chriſtians to God, Religion, and Miniſters began to grow lukewarm, and colder than before,</hi> ſo as they began to detain their Tithes and Miniſters dues, then preſently Chriſtian Kings and Biſhops in Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal Synods and Councils, began generally in all places, to make <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> for the due payment of them; declaring in them only the Divine Right, Laws and Precepts of God to the People both in the Old and New Teſtament, as a ſufficient obligation (ſeconded by their bare Canons and Edicts) without any <hi>coercion</hi> or <hi>penalty</hi> to oblige them to their due payment. The firſt unqueſtionable Canon for the payment of <hi>Tithes</hi> I find extant, is that of the ſecond Council of <hi>Maſcin</hi> forecited, An. 586. cap. 5.

                     <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 1. That the payment of Tithes being not only warranted but commanded in and by the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and the conſtant practice of Chriſtians in all Ages, Churches, there neither is, nor can be the leaſt pretence of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> for the non-payment of them.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>I have anſwered this Objection elſewhere, and ſhall here only declare, whence, I conceive, this Error (that <hi>Tithes are mere Alms</hi>) originally proceeded, to rectifie miſtakes of the meaning of ſome antient Authors, and clear two Texts of Scripture which ſome Scholars and ignorant People miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I conceive this Error ſprang originally from the miſunderſtanding of that Text of Deutr. 14.28, 29. <hi>At the end of three years thou ſhalt bring forth all the Tith of thine encreaſe</hi> THE SAME YEAR, and ſhalt <hi>lay it up within thy Gates. And the Levite (becauſe he hath no place, no Inheritance with thee</hi>) and <hi>the Stranger, and the Fatherleſſe and the Widow, which are within thy Gates ſhall come, <hi>and ſhall eat (thereof</hi>
                        </hi>) and <hi>be ſatisfied</hi>; <hi>That the Lord may bleſs thee in all the work of thine hands which thou doeſt</hi>; compared with Deutr. 26.12, 13, 14. <hi>When thou haſt made an end of <hi>tithing all the Tithes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100818:122"/>
of thine Encreaſe, the third year, which is the year of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> and haſt <hi>given</hi> unto <hi>the Levite, the Stranger, the Fatherleſs and Widow</hi>,</hi> that <hi>they may eat within thy Gates, <hi>and be filled</hi>; Then thou ſhalt ſay before the Lord thy God, I have brought away <hi>the hallowed Thing</hi> out of mine Houſe, and alſo <hi>have given them</hi> unto the Levite, and unto the Stranger, to the Fatherleſs and to the Widow; <hi>according to all thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements which thou haſt commanded me</hi>; I have not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed <hi>thy Commandements,</hi> neither have I forgotten them; I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, <hi>neither have I taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ought thereof for any uncleaneſs,</hi> nor given ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for the Dead, <hi>but have hearkned unto the voyce of the Lord my God, and done according all thou haſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me:</hi>
                        </hi> To which that of <hi>Amos</hi> may be referred. From which Texts ſome have conceived, That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paid Tithes only every third year. 2ly. That they paid them then not to the Levites only, but to the Stranger, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, Widows and Poor amongſt them, who had a right and ſhare in them as well as the Levites. 3ly. That theſe Texts uſe the phraſe not of <hi>paying</hi> Tithes, as a Debt or Duty, but of GIVING them as an Alms; and ſeeing they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thus to the Stranger, Fatherleſs, Widow as Alms; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Levites likewiſe, here coupled with them. This doubtleſs was the true ground that <hi>Tithes were reputed mere Alms</hi> by ſome, and not a <hi>Divine Right peculiar to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To diſperſe theſe Miſts of Error. Firſt take notice, That neither theſe, nor any other Texts in Scripture ſtile Tithes <hi>Almes,</hi> much leſſe <hi>pure Almes,</hi> which men may give or retain at their pleaſures. 2ly. That they expreſſely reſolve the contrarie that they are no Alms at all in the objected ſenſe, but a moſt certain poſitive commanded Debt and Dutie, no waies arbitrarie in the leaſt degree. For 1. By expreſs poſitive Laws and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God oft repeated, all the particulars of this Dutie are defined. 1. The <hi>Quota pars</hi> or quantitie: <hi>All the Tithe of thine Encreaſe the ſame year.</hi> 2ly. The time of it: <hi>every third year,</hi> which is the year of Tithing, at the end of three years. 3ly. The place of Stowage: <hi>Thou ſhalt lay it up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100818:123"/>
thy gates.</hi> 4ly. The perſons who muſt receive it: <hi>The Levite, Stranger, Fatherleſs, Widow.</hi> 5ly. The place of their receiving it: <hi>Within thy gates.</hi> 6ly. The manner of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: <hi>They ſhall come and eat thereof and be filled.</hi> Secondly, which is moſt conſiderable, the Owners and Tithe-payers had no diſpoſing power over it for their own uſes upon any occaſion or neceſſitie. For, 1. <hi>They muſt</hi> bring all of it out of their Houſes as an hallowed thing. 2ly. They muſt make a ſolemn Proteſtation before the <hi>Lord,</hi> that <hi>they had given it all to the Levite, Stranger, Fatherleſs, Widow,</hi> and that not of their own free voluntarie bountie, but as a bounden debt and dutie, <hi>according to all Gods Commandments which he had commanded them.</hi> 2ly. <hi>That they had neither wilfully tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed,</hi> nor negligentlie forgotten <hi>his Commandments</hi> herein. 3. That they <hi>had neither eaten thereof in their mourning</hi> (in times of want and diſtreſs) <hi>neither had they taken away ought thereof for any unclean uſe, &amp;c.</hi> but have <hi>hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, and done according to all that he commanded them:</hi> The reaſon of which Proteſtation was, becauſe God committed the cuſtodie and diſpencing of theſe three years Tithes to the Owners themſelves, who might be apt to purloin and pervert part of them to their own private uſes. I appeal now to all mens conſciences, whether theſe very Texts do not unanſwerably prove Tithes to be no <hi>Alms</hi> or <hi>arbitrary Benevolence</hi> at all, but a moſt preciſe, poſitive, certain <hi>Debt</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> moſt punctually limitted in each particular? and whether that we now uſually call <hi>Alms to the Poor,</hi> be not a <hi>Debt</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.27. with other Texts reſolve it, not a meer <hi>Freewill Gift,</hi> which we may neglect or diſpence with as we pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Having cleared the Text as to <hi>Alms,</hi> I ſhall next vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them from the other miſtakes concerning the time of Tithing, and Perſons receiving Tithes.

                        <hi>That God alone hath given to every Man the Lands and all he holds and poſſeſſeth, whereby he gains his food and living; and therefore out of the Land and Trade, whereby every one gets neceſſary ſupply for his body, he ought to contribute a Tenth and Tribute towards the Service of God, and Salvation of his Soul, much better than his Body</hi>; as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 229.

                        <hi>Law-books</hi> reſolve, <hi>That no Lay-man can by the very Common Law of England, allege any Cuſtome or Preſcription, for <hi>not paying Tithes</hi>; but only a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> in recompence of his Tithes; which he may in ſome caſes plead, becauſe grounded on ſome antient Contract and a valuable conſideration in Lieu of Tithes.</hi> Moreover, as all Men took their Purchaſes, Farmes, Leaſes or Inheritances, by Deſcent thus charged; ſo this charge was univerſally known to all Purchaſers, Leſees, and the full annual value of the Predial Tithes they pay out of their Lands, or Leaſes, abated them in their Purchaſes, Rents, Fines, by the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Leſſers, of purpoſe to defray the publick neceſſary annual Charge; which if the Lands had been <hi>Tithe-Free,</hi> had been proportionably raiſed, to the common value of the Tithes, in the Purchaſe-Moneys, Fines, or Rents; and will be ſo by every Seller of Lands, and Land-lord, when ever Tithes be ſuppreſſed. This being a clear undeniable Truth, which every rational man muſt ſubſcribe to; it is certain, no perſon this day living, complaining or not complaining againſt Tithes, can in Verity, Equity, Juſtice, Reaſon, repute or call them, either an <hi>unjuſt or oppreſſing Yoak, Bond, Burden</hi> (as many <hi>Ignoramuſſes</hi> do, without ſenſe or reaſon) nor any burden or charge at all to him,

ſince he had, or rather hath the full annual value of them allowed him in his Purchaſe, Fine, or Rent, by him that ſold or leaſed his Lands unto him. And although it be true, that in ſuch Tithes as the Earth doth not naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce without labour (as it doth Graſſe, Wood, Fruits,) <hi>viz.</hi> Corn, Hops, Saffron, Woad, and the like, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter enjoyes the Tenth of the Husbandmans increaſe, ſeed, labour and coſts in tillage and improvement (the great Objection againſt Tithes as an Heavy Burthen, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) yet all this pretended great coſt and charge (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only in Caſes of Improvements) was altogether, or for the moſt part allowed and defalked in the Purchaſe, Rent, or Fine; which if <hi>Tithe-free</hi> would have <note n="a" place="margin">For which there is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Allowance given in caſe of mere Heath and Baren grounds by the Stat. or 2 E. 6. c. 13.</note> been, (and when made <hi>Tithe-free,</hi> will be) raiſed to the full value of the Tithes, even one years purchaſe more in ten ſales, and 28.

                        <hi>promiſed and entayled to the true payment of Tithes,</hi> and are only procured by his Miniſters prayers, without which his ſeed, crop, and all his eſtate would be blaſted with a Curſe, &amp; amount not to a tenth part, of what he now enjoys by Gods promiſe and bleſſing by paying Tithes, and his Miniſters prayers; deſerves not the name of a rational man, much leſſe of a Chriſtian; and can expect nothing but Gods curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all he ſowes, plants, enjoyes, inſtead of a bleſſed Crop or Harveſt. All which conſidered, I appeal to any Chriſtian, or rational mans Conſcience, whether Tithes be any ſuch heavy, oppreſſing, intollerable, diſcouraging Yoak, Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, Burden, Oppreſsion as ſome now declaim them, which Gods chiefeſt Saints before the Law voluntarily rendred without murmuring, and chearfully vowed, paid unto God without a Law, and his antient people rendred without murmuring (though double to our Tithes now) by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Law, during all the <hi>Levitical Priesthood,</hi> and all our own Anceſtors, as well Proteſtants as Papiſts, have for ſo
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100818:131"/>
many hundred of years chearfully rendred without diſpute, and all now living came charged with into the world, and were thus allowed the value of them in their Purchaſes, Fines, and Leaſes. And whether all Tithe payers have not far more cauſe to Petition againſt all Old and New Rent-Services, Rent Charges, Annuities, Quit-Rents, Statutes, Debts, wherewith they were charged by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors Grants or Contracts, and of all the antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms for Merchandize for defence of the Seas or Realm, as intollerable oppreſsing Burdens, Yoaks, Grievances (as the <hi>Levellers</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in ſome late printed papers ſtile all <hi>Cuſtoms, Tonnage, Poundage, Impoſitions</hi> whatſoever, as well as Tithes, our Exciſes, or monthly Taxes, of new illegal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as well as Impoſition) than thus to murmur, complain, Petition againſt their predial Tithes, our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters chiefeſt Livelihood, except in Cities which have no Tillage, Woods, or Meadows? And ſo much brieflly for proof, <hi>That Tithes are no real Grievance, Burden, Oppreſsion, to Gods people</hi>; eſpecially ſince orignally granted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God himſelf, <hi>whoſe Commandements are not grievous,</hi> 1 John 5.3. and whoſe heavieſt <hi>Yoak is eaſie, and Burden light,</hi> Matth. 11.30. And thoſe <hi>New-Saints,</hi> who ſhall think otherwiſe of this Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, Yoak, and Burden of Tithes, under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, give the <hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the lye herein.</p>
                     <p>For the 2d. Branch, <hi>That the aboliſhing of Tithes will be no real Eaſe, Gain, or Advantage to Farmors, Leſſees, and the poorer ſort of People, lyable to pay Tithes</hi> (other poor being not concerned in the Controverſy, whoſe poverty it ſelf ex-exempts them from this ſurmiſed Grievance) <hi>but a Gain and Benefit, only to rich Landlords and Landed-men,</hi> is apparent by the premiſes. For no ſooner ſhall Tithes be abrogated, but every Landlord will raiſe the full annual value of them in his annual Rents, or Fines, and exact more for them from his poor Tenants, Farmers, Leſſees, than they might have compounded for with their Miniſters: and where then is their expected Gain, or Eaſe, wherewith they are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Impoſtors? As for the rich <hi>Landlords,</hi> they complain not of Tithes as a Burden, and need no exemption from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100818:131"/>
them: and as all predial Tithes now really iſſue out of their Inheritances charged with them in perpetuity, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abate, allow the full value of them to their Farmers and Tenants in their Fees and Rents, by way of Defalcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they being in truth the greateſt and moſt conſiderable Tithe-payers, not the poor Farmers, or under Tenants: So their Inheritances only will be much improved, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Tithes aboliſhing at leaſt one part in ten; whiles the poor Miniſters and Families ſhall be ſtarved, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants then more racked by the Landlords than by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters now. And this is the Godly goodly Eaſe this Saint-like Project will effect, if put into execution, by which none will be real Gainers, in their Temporal Eſtate, but thoſe who have Inheritances; and all loſers in their Spiritual Eſtate, by the loſſe or great diſcouragements of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Hebr. 13.17. This will appear by the practice of ſome greedy Land-lords of old, thus recited, condemned in this Decree of the <hi>Council of Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

And as no waies contentious or litigious in it ſelf, were people as juſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable to pay their Tithes, there being many Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> (and that wherein I live one) wherein I never heard of any ſute or quarrel betwixt the Miniſters and Pariſhioners for Tithes, there being farre more ſutes and contentions for juſt Rents, Annuities and Debts throughout the Nation than for Tithes (at leaſt ten for one in proportion) before theſe late contentious Lawleſs times, when many <hi>unconſcionable, unrighteous Wretches</hi> (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Religion, to cover their fraud, covetouſneſs and oppreſſion) will pretend Conſcience for not paying their very Rents, and Debts, as well as Tithes: And ſuch who have ſo little grace or fear of God as to contend with their Miniſters for their juſt Tithes, will be altogether Litigious towards them, for any other <hi>Annuity,</hi> or ſetled way of Maintenance that can be deviſed in lieu of Tithes, ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will content ſuch perverſe and contentious Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but a Liberty to pay their Miniſters only what they pleaſe, and that in concluſion ſhall be juſt nothing, as their ſubſequent Petitions and preſent Practices now manifeſt to God, Angels and men. And I doubt the Change of this antient, known, long approved certain Maintenance by Tithes, to any other certain or uncertain way, will create more ſutes and troubles among people, than ever our Tithes did ſince their firſt inſtitution.

                     <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 1. That this Objection no waies concerns Soldiers, Weavers, Tailors, Tradeſmen, Townſmen and other Mechanicks, who are the moſt and greateſt Sticklers and Petitioners againſt Tithes; but only Husbandmen and Countrey Gentlemen and Farmers living upon Tillage, very few of which (not one of a thouſand) ever yet petitioned againſt Tithes, as ſuch a grievous Oppreſſion (at leaſtwiſe as a Farmer) for the burdenſomneſs of Tithes, but only as an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> or other <hi>Sectary,</hi> out of hatred and oppoſition to our <hi>Miniſters Callings</hi> or <hi>Perſons.</hi> And till the Generality or Major part of the Gentry, Yeoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Country Farmers in each County Petition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt their <hi>Predial Tithes</hi> as ſuch an intollerable <hi>Grievance,</hi> no Officers, Soldiers, Citizens, Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Mechanicks, and buſie-bodies in other mens Callings and Grievances which concern them not, are no waies to be heard, countenanced or credited in this particular, by any Powers whatſoever in point of <hi>Juſtice</hi> or Prudence. 2ly.

                        <hi>Bleſsing promiſed to their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes,</hi> being a greater improvement to them in their Crops, than all their extraordinary coſt and pains amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to: Wherefore it can be no impediment or diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any real Saints good Husbandry or Improvement now; who deſerves to reap no benefit by his Labour or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, if God himſelf ſhall have no ſhare or portion out of them for the maintenance of his publick worſhip and Miniſters. 5ly. If there were any truth or ſtrength in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, yet it extends not unto all <hi>tithes,</hi> but only to ſuch as are paid out of extraordinary chargeable Improvements; as to make mere barren Heath, Ling and Sands, out of which no former profits naturally grew, manurable for Corn or Paſture, Tillage and Meadows, Woods, out of which moſt predial Tithes ariſe; So there is a ſufficient remedy againſt this <hi>pretended Miſchief</hi> already provided in the <hi>beſt and stricteſt Statute</hi> made by the beſt of our <hi>Proteſtant Kings, for the true payment of Tithes,</hi> at the beginning our <hi>Reformation,</hi> when <hi>Popery was baniſhed</hi> in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 2 E. 6. c. 13. which provides, <hi>That all ſuch barren Heath, or waſte Grounds, which before that time have lyen barren, and paid no Tithes by reaſon of the ſaid barronneſs, and now be, or hereafter ſhall be improved or converted into arable Ground or Meadow, ſhall from henceforth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the term and end of ſeven years, next after ſuch Improvement fully ended and determined, pay Tithe of the Corn and Hay growing on the ſame, and be diſcharged in the interim,</hi> as the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and our <hi>Judges</hi> have expounded it. All which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, this Objection muſt be henceforth exploded and LEVELLED to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe I find a clear Deſign and Endeavour in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <hi>Anabaptists, Officers, Souldiers,</hi> if they cannot prevail to put down Tithes upon other pretexts, yet to rob the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of them at preſent, if not in perpetuity, upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to <hi>ſequeſter and convert them to the uſe of the Army, for the pretended eaſe of the people in their future taxes.</hi> I ſhal for the cloze of this Propoſition, and prevention of this deteſtable impious Sacrilegious plot againſt our Miniſters and Religion too,

                     <p>The firſt part of the Propoſition is ſufficiently manifeſted by the premiſes, wherein I have anſwered all Objections from pretended Grounds of Piety, Conſcience, and ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Inconveniences or Miſchiefs made againſt Tithes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them to be mere Impoſtures, and falſe <hi>Surmiſes,</hi> and the principal Objections againſt them are, that <hi>they are Jewiſh, Popiſh</hi>: And <hi>Iohn Canne</hi> in his <hi>Second Voyce</hi> from the <hi>Alehouſe</hi> (for ſurely it came from thence, not from the <hi>Temple</hi>) to ſhew his skill in Divinity moſt impudently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. <hi>That payment of Tithes is <hi>a Sin two waies againſt the ſecond Commandement</hi>,</hi> 1. <hi>In it ſelf, as being Iewiſh and Superſtitious, giving honour to the wayes and deviſes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.

Surely a <hi>Lyer</hi> ought to have a good Memory; He confeſſeth, p. 15. <hi>That Tithes were paid by Abraham, vowed by Iacob, and preſcribed by God himſelf in the Ceremonial law.</hi> Therefore neither Jewiſh, nor Popiſh, nor Superſtitions, nor a Sin againſt the 2d.

                     <p>To clear this Propoſition more fully in all its branches, I have obſerved, that there are five ſorts of perſons of late, very buſie, active both againſt our Miniſters tiths and callings too.</p>
                     <p>The firſt are <hi>Souldiers:</hi> The 2d. <hi>Anabaptists, Dippers, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> with other late <hi>blaſphemous Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi>: The 3d. prophane, covetous Earthworms, and Atheiſtical Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; who ſay in their Hearts, and ſometimes boldly profeſs, not only by their Lives, but with their Tongues in this law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Age, <hi>There is no GOD.</hi> The 4th. prophane, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, cheating <hi>Prognoſticators</hi> and <hi>Aſtronomers</hi>: The 5th. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, popiſh Prieſts and Romiſh Emiſſaries,</hi> ſent from all parts to ruine our Miniſters and Religion.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, they are either Officers and Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and thoſe, either ſuch who have gained or purchaſed Lands ſince the Wars, lyable to Tithes; for ſuch who have no Lands at all, and ſo not of preſent Ability, Capacity to pay Tithes. Thoſe who have any purchaſed Lands lyable to Tithes, are now ſo fierce againſt them, (for ought I can diſcern) not out of any grounds of <hi>piety</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi>; but, either out of an unworthy, covetous, degenerous, ſordid diſpoſition, to eaſe themſelves and their Heirs from this juſt antient Debt, yea a charge of Tithes upon their <hi>New cheap Purchaſes,</hi> and gain them as an <hi>Over-plus</hi> into their Bargains, to improve their <hi>Purchaſes</hi> to an higher value; the caſe of ſuch of them who approve of our Miniſters, our publick <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and are no <hi>Speakers, Anabaptiſts, Sectaries.</hi> Or elſe a like avaritious Diſpoſition, mixed with and heightned

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100818:151"/>
true cauſes why the <hi>General Council of Officers of the Army,</hi> with the <hi>Souldiers</hi> under them, by their directions, as a New <hi>created All-ſwaying Military Corporation,</hi> have ſo oft appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publickly againſt our <hi>Miniſters Tithes</hi> to aboliſh them (and their Miniſtry by neceſſary conſequence with them) which all other Opponents (being inconſiderable) were never able to effect, but by their armed power. Theſe are all the real principles of <hi>Piety, Conſcience</hi> (if they deſerve the Title) I could ever yet find amongſt them; engaging the <hi>Army-Officers</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> againſt <hi>Tithes,</hi> which how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent they are with the real profeſſion, or grounds of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, Piety, Conſcience, Justice, Saintſhip,</hi> let their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and the world reſolve; and what Cenſures, Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, Judgements they may in Juſtice expect from God, for ſuch a <hi>Sacrilegious Rapine,</hi> as they intend upon theſe <hi>carnal, impious, atheiſtical grounds, policies, hypocritically gilded over with the paint of Conſcience,</hi> Reformation, <hi>Religion, Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi> which makes the Deſign more dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable both to God and all good men.</p>

And when they had the gifts of any not improved, they gave them unto their Friends, of the which alwaies ſome were learned, for the Monks found of their Friends Children at School. And though they were not learned, yet they kept Hoſpitality and helped their poor Friends. And if the Parſonages were impropred, the Monks were bound to deal Almeſſe to the poor and to keep Hoſpitality, as the writings of the Gifts of ſuch Parſonages and Lands do plainly declare in theſe words, <hi>In puram Eleemoſynam.</hi> And as touching the Almeſſe that they dealt, and the Hoſpitality that they kept, every man knoweth, that many thouſands were well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of them, and might have been better, if they had not had ſo many great Mens Horſe to feed, and had not been over-charged with ſuch idle Gentlemen, as were never out of the Abbies. And if they had any Vicarage in their hands, they ſet in ſome time ſome ſufficient Vicar, (though it were but ſeldom) to preach and to teach. But now that all the Abbies, with their Lands, Goods and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propred Parſonages be in temporal mens hands, I do not hear tell that one half peny worth of Alms, or any other profit cometh unto the people of thoſe Pariſhes. Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of putting down Abbies, was to amend that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in them. It was far amiſs, that a great part of the Lands of the Abbies (which were given to bring up learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men that might be Preachers, to keep Hoſpitality and give Alms to the poor) ſhould be ſpent upon a few Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Monks, which gave not XL. pound in Alms, when they ſhould have given CC. It was amiſs, that the Monks ſhould have Parſonages in their hands, and deal but the XX. part thereof to the poor, and preached but once in a

year <hi>to them that paid the Tithes of Parſonages.</hi> It was amiſs, that they ſcarcely among XX ſet not one ſufficient Vicar to preach <hi>for the Tithes that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> But ſee now, how it that was amiſs, is amended, <hi>for all the Pretence.</hi> It is amended even as the Devil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Dams Leg (as it is in the Proverb) when he ſhould have ſet it right, he brake it quite in pieces. The Monks gave too little Alms, and ſet unable Perſons many times in their Benefices. But now where xx. pound was yearly given to the poor, in more than C. places in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is not one meals meat given. <hi>This is a fair Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Where they had alwaies one or other Vicar, that either preached or hired ſome to preach, <hi>Now is there no Vicar at all</hi>: but the Farmor is Vicar and Parſon alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and only an old caſt away Monk or Frier which can ſcarcely ſay his Mattins, is hired for xx. or xxx. ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Meat and Drink, yea in ſome places for Meat and Drink alone, <hi>without any wages.</hi> I know, and not I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but xx.

determines <hi>Tribute is now due unto him for this cauſe</hi>: I now alſo think, that <hi>Rome</hi> ought to render Tribute unto me, becauſe my Anceſtors heretofore got it by Conqueſt: Whereupon they all reſolved to aſſiſt King <hi>Arthur</hi> with their Armes againſt this unrighteous Tribute, and Title to it by Conqueſt; and profeſſed they would ſpend their lives in the quarrel.
