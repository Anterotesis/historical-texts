         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 1.</hi> IN relation to the Controverſies concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Gods Grace</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> nothing was ever Superior, in my thoughts, to the feare that the great Intereſts of Religion, <hi>Chriſtian practiſe,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of <hi>Charity,</hi> might be obſtructed by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 2.</hi> It hath long been the Complaint of pious and learned men, (of the juſtice whereof, if formerly we had, we cannot now reaſonably retain any doubt,) that the crude and unwary treating of theſe, and (from thence derived,) an haſty premature perſwaſion of their being in Chriſt, (aſsiſted by a beliefe of <hi>irreſpective Decrees,</hi> and <hi>Grace irreſiſtible,</hi> and no poſſibility of <hi>interrupting</hi> their juſtified eſtate,) was apt to contribute to the preſumtions, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities, and finall impenitences of ſome men,
<pb facs="tcp:103954:3"/>
who having moſt loudly renounced the <hi>power,</hi> chooſe yet not to quit <hi>the forme of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 3.</hi> And for the heares, and uncharitable diſtempers, which the managing of theſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies particularly have been guilty of, we need not look abroad among the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites, Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> for proofes. Our own Region hath not of a long time failed of evidences. The old weapon of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, crying down for <hi>carnall</hi> men and <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Socinians,</hi> and what not? (even rifling the Poets Hell to fetch out Titles for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaryes,) hath never been more nimbly taken up, and vigorouſly handled, then in theſe dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 4.</hi> And as if fewell to diſſentions were ſtill wanting, it hath been the endeavour of ſome to ſuggeſt this jealouſy, and clancularly to infuſe it into the minds of men, that they which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>unconditionate Decrees,</hi> &amp;c. (and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to think they effectually ſerve the ends of Chriſtianity thereby,) have entertained ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſlikes, and averſations to all that Scheme of doctrines, that they retain no <hi>charity</hi> to the maintainers of them, though they be in other things as conſtant, obedient ſonns of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as any; and when opportunity ſhall aſsiſt their deſigne, will take care rigorouſly to fence their communion from them, and whatever
<pb facs="tcp:103954:3"/>
the accord be in other doctrines, (wherein our Church is eminently concerned againſt the common Adverſaries,) will proceed finally to exterminate and exclude them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 5.</hi> The Conſequences of this perſwaſion, once imbibed, be it never ſo cauſeleſſe and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, how noxious and inauſpicious they may prove to all that are on either ſide concerned in them, what leven of <hi>bitter zele</hi> and animoſityes it may cauſe to ferment in the minds of ſome, what blaſts and improſperityes it may bring on the endeavours of others; and, betwixt both, what detriment to the true and ſolid ends, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Reformation,</hi> (the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our lives according to that other, more ſublime, patterne in the mount, <hi>Mat. v.</hi> the inhaunſed, tranſcendent, indiſpenſable Lawes of <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Peaceableneſs,)</hi> I ſhall not here need to ſet forth, every man's ſagacity ſerving him competently to make this diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 6.</hi> Yet was it not a rationall hope, that the bare diſclaiming and renouncing ſo great a guilt, would be admitted to the purgation of thoſe, againſt whom it had been ſuggeſted and believed. It therefore ſeemed to me more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to tender an ocular demonſtration of the contrary, by bringing my <hi>Lamb,</hi> or <hi>Turtle,</hi> (my offering to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Peace,)</hi> and really exemplifying the <hi>charity</hi> and accordance, that may readily be attained between diſſenters,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 7.</hi> In order to this end, it ſeemed not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, to offer at this time to publick view the preſent Sentiments of the Judicious Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the <hi>Regius Profeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> (and the rather, becauſe ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript Tables of his former thoughts, and ſome paſſages from his Sermons, long ſince preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and now republiſhed, have been made uſe of, to gain authority to thoſe Doctrines which he is now far from owning,) and briefely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly to annex unto, and compare with them, thoſe <hi>Amicable</hi> and <hi>Pacifick</hi> Reflexions, which may hope to gain the unanimous conſent of all true Sons of our Venerable Mother, the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whoſe chiefe aime it hath alwayes been to diſcountenance diviſions and fractions, and occaſions and fomenters of thoſe, especially <hi>ſingular Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Novell Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and in a <hi>Catholick</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious charity, to plant <hi>Primitive</hi> belief, and <hi>zele of good workes,</hi> and ſo inſtead of the empty <hi>Forme,</hi> the full <hi>power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

            <p>§. 1. HAving had a ſight of the Letter which you ſent M.—about the Antiremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant Controverſies dated <hi>Mar.</hi> 26. and obſerving one of the reaſons, which you render of your having avoided to appear on that theme, <hi>[A loathneſs to engage in a quarrell whereof you ſhould never hope to ſee an end]</hi> I thought my ſelf in ſome degree qualified to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this reaſon of yours, and thereby to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice to many, who do not think fit that any conſiderations, which have not real and weighty truth in them, ſhould obſtruct that which may be ſo much to the common good, I mean, your writing and declaring your mind on any profitable ſubject.</p>
            <p>§. 2. That which qualifies me more then ſome others, to evacuate the force of this one reaſon of yours, and makes me willing to attempt it, though not to appear in oppoſition to any other paſſage, that ever you have written, is the true friendſhip that hath paſſed between us, and the ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation that for ſometime we enjoyed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

any allay or unequableneſs, ſharp word, or unkind, or jealous thought. The remembrance whereof aſſures me unqueſtionably, that you and I may engage in this queſtion, as far as either of us ſhall think profitable, without any the leaſt beginning of a <hi>quarrel,</hi> and then that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently be removed from ſuch, as of which <hi>you cannot hope to ſee an end.</hi>

And before I go any farther, I appeal to your own judgement, whether herein I do not at leaſt ſpeak probably, and then whether it were not a miſpriſion, which you are in all reaſon to depoſite, to apprehend ſuch inſuperable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or impoſſibilities at a diſtance, which when they are prudently approached, and examined, ſo preſently vaniſh before you. If this one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection do not convince you, it remains, that the ſpeculation be brought to practice, and exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to your ſenſes.</p>
            <p>§ 4. You ſet out with a mention of ſome <note place="margin">Five Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons agreed on by all.</note>

to the undoubted truth of each of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and do it alſo upon the very ſame three grounds (of Scripture, Reaſon, and Experience) which you mention, need not the interceſſion of our friendſhip to render it impoſſible to give you any the leaſt trouble of ſo much as explaining your ſence in any of theſe.</p>

§. 6.

               </gap>, the manner of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling praeſcience with contingency, that as I fully conſent to it in every part of your period, ſo I doubt not but the laſt part alone hath made it as intelligible to any ordinary underſtanding, as whole books of Philoſophers have attempted to do.</p>
            <p>§. 7. For Gods praeſcience from all eternity being but the ſeeing every thing that ever exiſts, as it is, contingents, as contingents, neceſſary, as neceſſary, can neither work any change in the object, by thus ſeeing it, (convert a contingent into a neceſſary) nor it ſelf be deceived in what it ſees, which it muſt be, if any thing in proceſs of time ſhould be otherwiſe, then from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity God ſaw it to be.</p>
            <p>§. 8. I was lately adviſed with by a Divine, to

me unknown, but one that ſeems to be a man of good learning, about the diſtinction frequently made in this matter, betwixt <hi>inevitably</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,</hi> and my anſwer and replyes to his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall objections, (becauſe I would demonſtrate the perfect accordance betwixt you and me in this, which, within this year or two is put into a very grave attire, and revered as a great difficulty) I will give you at large by way of Appendage at the end of this Letter, having by hap a copy retained by me, and though it coſt you ſome minutes to ſurvey them, yet I know your patience of all ſuch exerciſes ſo well, that I doubt not of your willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be thus detained by me, which yet here you ſhall not, <hi>loco non ſuo.</hi>

and doth it expreſly in Biſhop <hi>Overals</hi> way, ſo this ſuppoſeth Grace ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and ſalvation to be given to thoſe, who are not converted, and ſaved, quite contrary to the three grand praetenſions of Doctor <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> the <hi>Supralapſarians,</hi> and <hi>Sublapſarians,</hi> and whether it be true or no, is preſently freed from all the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences charged on the ſeveral Schemes of the Antiremonſtrants, and ſo may ſafely be granted, or not oppoſed by them, who yet want evidence of Scripture to eſtabliſh it, and ſo this is not likely to bring any uneaſie engagement upon you.</p>
            <p>§. 10.

Were any of us ſo left or paſt by, as to be denyed <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> and yet deſtined to periſh, meerly through want of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; the whole blame could not rationally fall on our ſelves, it could not be ſaid of Chriſts <hi>yoke,</hi> that it were <note n="*" place="margin">Matth xi.</note>

But <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> being tendred by God, and by no default, but their own, proving ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the entire blame falls unavoidably on thoſe, who do not thus <hi>open</hi> to him that <hi>knocks,</hi> ſo receive, as to make uſe of it, but <hi>reſiſt,</hi> or <hi>grieve,</hi> or <hi>quench</hi> what was ſo mercifully deſigned, and might have been improved by the humble and diligent receivers unto their greateſt advantages.</p>

                  <hi>An Hiſtory of Doctor</hi> Sanderſons <hi>thoughts in theſe points.</hi>
               </note> it uſefull to the Reader, in diſcovering to him the true and ſole originall of the thriving (for ſome time) of thoſe Doctrines among us, and how ſo many of our Church came to be ſeaſoned with them, and in giving him a but neceſſary caution for the laying the grounds of the ſtudy of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the writings of the antient Church, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in our modern ſyſtemes and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Your words are theſe,</p>
            <p>§. 14. <hi>When I began to ſet my ſelf to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Divinity as my proper buſineſs, (which was after I had the degree of Maſter of Arts, being then newly xxi. years of age) the first thing I thought fit for me to do, was to conſider well of the Articles of the Church of England, which I had formerly read over twice, or thrice, and whereunto I had ſubſcribed. And becauſe I had then met with ſome Puritanicall Pamphlets written againſt the</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103954:9"/>
               <hi>Liturgie, and Ceremonies; although moſt of the Arguments therein were ſuch as needed no great skill to give ſatisfactory anſwers unto, yet for my fuller ſatisfaction (the queſtions being</hi> de rebus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendis, <hi>and ſo the more ſuitable to my proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination) I read over with great diligence and no leſs delight that excellent piece of Learned</hi> Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Politie. And I have great cauſe to bleſs God for it that ſo I did, not onely for that it much both cleared and ſetled my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ever after in very many weighty points (as of Scandall, Christian Liberty, Obligation of Laws, Obedience, &amp;c.) but that it alſo proved (by his good providence) a good preparative to me (that I ſay not, Antidote) for the reading of</hi> Calvin's <hi>Inſtitutions with more caution then perhaps (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) I ſhould have done. For that Book was commended to me, as it was generally to all young Scholars in thoſe times, as the beſt and perfectest ſyſteme of Divinity, and fitteſt to be laid as a ground work in the ſtudy of that profeſſion. And indeed being ſo prepared as is ſaid, my expectation was not at all deceived, in the reading of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. I found, ſo far as I was then able to judge, the method exact, the expreſſions clear, the ſtyle grave, equall and unaffected: his Doctrine for the moſt part conform to S.</hi> Auguſtines, <hi>in a word, the whole worke very elaborate, and uſefull to the Churches of God in a good meaſure; and might have been (I verily believe) much more uſefull, if the honour of his name had not given ſo much reputation to his very errours. I muſt acknowledge my ſelf to have reaped great benefit by the reading thereof. But as for the queſtions of Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Effectuall Grace, Perſeverance, &amp;c. I</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:103954:10"/>
               <hi>took as little notice of the two firſt, as of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing contained in the book; both becauſe I was alwayes affraid to pry much into thoſe ſecrets, and becauſe I could not certainly inform my ſelf from his own writings, whether he were a Supralapſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (as moſt ſpeak him, and he ſeemeth often to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline much that way) or a Sublapſarian, as ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry paſſages in the book ſeem to import. But giving my ſelf moſtly ſtill to the ſtudy of Moral Divinity, (and taking moſt other things upon truſt, as they were in a manner generally taught both in the Schools and Pulpits in both Vniverſities) I did for many years together acquieſce without troubling my ſelf any farther about them, in the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received opinions concerning both theſe two, and the other points depending thereupon. Yet in the Sublapſarian way ever, which ſeemed to me of the two, the more moderate, rationally and agreeable to the goodneſs, and juſtice of God: for the rigid Supralapſarian doctrine could never find any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in my thoughts from firſt to laſt. But MDCXXV. a Parliament being called, wherein I was choſen one of the Clerks of the Convocation for the Dioceſſe of</hi> Lincoln, <hi>during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that Parliament (which was about four moneths, as I remember) there was ſome expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thoſe Arminian points (the onely queſtions almost in agitation at that time) ſhould have been debated by the Clergy, in that CONVOCATION. Which occaſioned me (as it did ſundry others) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then at ſome leaſure, to endeavour by ſtudy and conference to inform my ſelf, as throughly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the ſtate of thoſe Controverſies, as I could have opportunity, and as my wit would ſerve me for it. In order whereunto, I made it my firſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:103954:10"/>
               <hi>to take a ſurvey of the ſeverall different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning the ordering of Gods Decrees, as to the ſalvation or damnation of men; not as they are ſuppoſed to be really in</hi> Mente Divina <hi>(for all his Decrees are eternall and therefore coeternall, and ſo no priority or poſteriority among them:) but</hi> quoad noſtrum intelligendi modum, <hi>becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive or ſpeak of the things of God, but in a way ſuitable to our own finite condition, and underſtanding: Even as God himſelf hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reveal himſelf to us in the holy Scriptures by the like ſuitable condeſcenſions and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which opinions, the better to repreſent their differences to the eye,</hi> uno quaſi intuitu, <hi>for their more eaſie conveying to the underſtanding by that means, and the avoiding of confuſion and tedious diſcourſings, I reduced into five Schemes or Tables, much after the manner as I had uſed to draw Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees (a thing which I think you know I have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much fancied, as to me of all others the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull recreation) of which Schemes, ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friends, to whom I ſhewed them, deſired copies: who, as it ſeemeth, valuing them more then I did (for divers men have copies of them, as I hear, but I do not know that I have any ſuch my ſelf) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated them farther, and ſo they are come into many hands. Thoſe are they which Doctor</hi> Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, <hi>in his Epiſtle prefixed to Master</hi> Barlees <hi>Correptory Correction, had taken notice of. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all theſe Schemes before my eyes at once, ſo as I might with eaſe compare them one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and having conſidered of the conveniences and inconveniences of each, as well as I could, I ſoon diſcerned a neceſſity of quitting the Sublapſarian way of which I had a better liking before, as well</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103954:11"/>
               <hi>as the Supralapſarian, which I could never fancy.]</hi>

            <p>§. 15. <hi>Thus far your hiſtory,</hi> which, I verily believe to have perfect truth in every ſtep of it, without any diſguiſe or varniſh, and ſo I paſs from it without any farther Reflections.</p>
            <p>§. 16. Next then follows your diſtincter view of the ſeverall wayes, which have been embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by thoſe of the Antiremonſtrant perſwaſion, and the motives on which you were forced to diſſent and depart from each of them, and to this I am obliged to attend you <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. And the wayes being eſpecially three, the method of greateſt advantage will be to begin with a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient view of thoſe, each of which you with great reaſon reject, and to ſet Doctor <hi>Twiſſes</hi> firſt (though it came laſt into the world and adorn'd it ſelf with the ſpoiles of the other two) becauſe that ſets the object of Election higher, then the other do, <hi>homo creabilis,</hi> man conſidered before he is created.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103954:11"/>
that of theſe his ſuppoſed coordinate decrees ſome are after others in execution (the fall after the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the coming of Chriſt after both, and ſo of the reſt) ſo if he will ſtand to his principle, he muſt, as you ſay, grant, <hi>that thoſe that were thus after any other in the execution, were in Gods inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before them,</hi> which will neceſſarily bring in a <hi>ſubordination</hi> among them, and <hi>ſo quite overthrow this</hi> (as you call it) <hi>new crochet of coordination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 17. Your other cauſes of diſlike to His way are equally rational, 1. the <hi>falſneſs of that his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Maxime,</hi> which he builds ſo much upon, which yet hath no <hi>certain truth, or other then ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, but when it is applyed to final cauſes, and the means uſed for the attaining any end.</hi> 2.

               <hi>God, in regard of his abſolute power over his own creature, yet it ſeems very hardly reconcileable with the goodneſs of God, and his exceeding great love to mankind, as they are plentifully and paſſionately ſet forth in his holy word, to decree the eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the greater part of mankind, for that ſin, and for that ſin onely which was utterly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible for him to avoid, for the Decree of Reprobation according to the Sublapſarian Doctrine, being nothing elſe but a meer preterition or non-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſome perſons whom God left, as he found them, involved in the guilt of the firſt Adams tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, without any actuall perſonall ſin of their own, when he withdrew ſome others, as guilty as they, without any respect to Chriſt the ſecond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, it muſt needs follow that the perſons ſo left are deſtin'd to eternall miſery, for no other cauſe, but this onely, that Adam ſome thouſand years ſince did eat the forbidden fruit, and they being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born could not help it.</hi>

            <p>§. 20. The other reaſon was, <hi>becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture not onely ſaith expreſly, that God hath choſen us in Chriſt before the foundation of the world,</hi>

Eph. 1. 4, 5. <hi>and conſequently the decree of ſending Chriſt muſt be praecedaneous to that of Election, but alſo doth every where, and upon all occaſions hold forth the death of Chriſt, as intended by God for the benefit of mankind, in the utmoſt extent, [the world, the whole world, mankind, every man, &amp;c.] and not for the benefit of ſome few onely, the reſt by an antecedent peremptory decree excluded. To which it would be conſequent, that according to the tenure of (the more moderate of theſe) the Sublapſarians doctrine, Jeſus Chriſt the Judge at the laſt day, when he ſhould proceed to pronounce ſentence upon the damned, ſhould beſpeak them to this effect,</hi> Ite maledicti, voluit enim Pater meus pro beneplacito, ut Adam peccato ſuo vos perderet, noluit ut ego ſanguine meo vos redimerem, <hi>Go ye curſed, for my Father of his meer pleaſure will'd that Adam by his ſin ſhould deſtroy you, will'd not that I by my blood ſhould redeem you, the very thought whereof</hi> (you ſay) your <hi>ſoul ſo much abhorr'd, that you were forced to forſake that opinion of the Sublapſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> (having, as you profeſs, never <hi>phanſied the Superlapſarians) and conclude it unſafe to place the decree of Election before that of ſending Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>§. 24. This I ſuppoſe the reaſon both of our Churches Moderation in framing the <hi>Article of</hi>

The doctrines being deemed doctrines of God, are counted evidences of ſanctified men, and affix the cenſure of carnality on oppoſers, and from hence come <hi>bitter envyings, railings,</hi> and at the leaſt <hi>evil ſurmiſings,</hi> and theſe are moſt contrary to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace of a Church or Nation.</p>
            <p>§. 25.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103954:17"/>
preached to, of which ſome believe, and are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, and thoſe have their parts in the firſt <hi>decree,</hi> that of <hi>election</hi> to ſalvation, ſome reject the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and believe not, and thoſe fall under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond branch, that of rejection to Damnation.</p>
            <p>§. 37. Againſt the evidence of this, no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">All Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture decrees conditionate,</note> can be made, and to this it is undeniably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, that all the Decrees whereof Scripture treateth, are <hi>conditionate,</hi> receiving Chriſt as the Goſpel offers him, as <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as well as the latter being the condition of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-election, and the rejecting or not receiving him thus, the condition of the Scripture-repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
            <p>§. 38. As for any other which can be phanſied diſtant from this (and ſo all abſolute Election or inconditionate Reprobation) it muſt needs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be the meer invention and fabrick of mens brains, without the duct of Gods Spirit in Scripture, which if at leaſt it hold not a ſtrict ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with that which the Scripture hath thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, will never be excuſed from great te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity, <note place="margin">Temerity of introducing abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> and the ſin of dogmatizing, the rifling Gods ſecrets, and ſetting up our own imaginations, if not prejudices, for the oracles of God. If this were well thought of, it would infallibly ſet a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to all further diſputes, on this ſubject. And the propoſition, which I have laſt ſet down from you, is ſo irrefragably convincing, that I hope it may be ſucceſsful to ſo good an end, and all men that read it, reſolve it their duty to preach no other Decrees of God from Scripture, but this, that all <hi>that receive the Goſpel preached, and live according to the praeſcript rule thereof,</hi> (for that is to <hi>receive Chriſt as there he is offered to them, as a Lord and</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103954:18"/>
               <hi>Saviour)</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and all they that reject it, when it is thus revealed, or live in contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the terms whereon it is eſtabliſhed, ſhall be damned. This would probably change curioſity into induſtry, unprofitable diſquiſitions into the <hi>ſearch and trying of our own wayes,</hi> and <hi>working out our own ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 39. To this propoſition, if it ſhall be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you annex <hi>two Corollaries,</hi> and I that have not onely yielded but challenged the undoubted truth of the Propoſition, can make no queſtion of the Corollaries, The <hi>firſt</hi> is this,</p>
            <p>§. 40. <hi>That it will be impoſſible to maintain the Doctrine of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Grace in that manner as the Remonſtrants are ſaid to aſſert it, againſt the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is uſually made by their adverſaries, how evangelical Grace can be offer'd to ſuch nations or perſons, as never had the Gospel preached unto them.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 41. The truth of this Corollary (as of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) muſt be judged of by the dependence from <note place="margin">Whether the heathens have Evangelical Grace.</note> the <hi>Principle,</hi> the connexion it hath with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer propoſition; That ſpake of the <hi>Decrees, as they are ſet forth in Scripture,</hi> and of the <hi>condition</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them that are <hi>elected to ſalvation, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Christ preached, as he is offered in the Gospel,</hi> and accordingly it is moſt evident, that they that will found their Doctrine on <hi>Scripture,</hi> muſt find not onely difficulty, but impoſſibility to maintain the gift of <hi>evangelicall Grace</hi> (which I ſuppoſe to be a ſupernaturall power to believe and obey the Goſpel) to thoſe, to whom the Goſpel hath never been revealed. What the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> are ſaid to aſſert in this matter, I ſhall forbear to examine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I deſign not to engage in any controverſie at
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103954:18"/>
this time with any; onely as on one ſide it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that their adverſaries can receive no benefit by the objection, the ſalvability of all to whom the Goſpel is preached, being as contrary to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>onely the Elect,</hi> as it would be, if exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the heathens alſo, all Chriſtians being not with them in the number of the Elect; ſo on the other ſide, I ſhould think it ſtrange, that in our preſent notion of <hi>Evangelical grace,</hi> for a <hi>ſtrength</hi> from <hi>God to receive and obey the Gospel</hi> preached, it ſhould, by the Remonſtrants, or any other, be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from Scripture, that it is given, or offered to thoſe to whom the Goſpel hath not been revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles the <hi>Gospel, the power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, and</hi> the preaching of it the <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>adminiſtration of the ſpirit,</hi> and indeed the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is in Scripture promiſed onely to them who <hi>believe in Chriſt,</hi> and therefore ſpeaking of what may be maintained by Scripture, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſpeech to <hi>evangelical Grace,</hi> the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of it can no farther be by that maintained to extend, then to thoſe to whom the Goſpel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, for if <hi>Faith cometh by hearing,</hi> and <hi>hearing by the word,</hi> i. e. preaching the Goſpel, it muſt follow, <hi>they cannot believe,</hi> and ſo have not Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Grace, or ſtrength to believe, <hi>without a Preacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 42. And therefore I remember the Learned Biſhop of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> Doctor <hi>Davenant</hi> in his Lent Sermon (I think the laſt he preached before the King) declared his opinion to be (as for <hi>

with the ſcantneſs of that declaration, but thought it as much, as, ſpeaking of Grace in the Scripture notion of it, <hi>evangelical Grace,</hi> could with any reaſon be required of him.</p>
            <p>§. 43. As for the ſtate and condition of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to whom the Goſpel is not revealed, and yet it is no fault of theirs that it is not, as all thoſe that lived before Chriſt and many ſince, as it is evident the Scripture was not delivered to them, nor conſequently gave to us Chriſtians rules for the judging of them, ſo it is moſt reaſonable which you add in your ſecond Corollary, which is this,</p>
            <p>§. 44. That <hi>into the conſideration of Gods Decrees</hi>

And this the rather <note place="margin">Four Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations concerning them. The first.</note> upon four conſiderations which Scripture aſſures us of. Firſt, that as <hi>all men</hi> were <hi>dead in Adam,</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſt died for all,</hi> that were thus <hi>dead,</hi> for <hi>every man,</hi> even for thoſe that <hi>deny him,</hi> and finally <hi>periſh:</hi> which as it muſt needs extend and be intended by him, that thus <hi>taſted death for</hi> them, to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of thoſe that knew him not (for if he <hi>died for</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:103954:19"/>
               <hi>them that deny him,</hi> why not for them that are leſs guilty, as having never heard of him, eſpecially when 'tis not the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Chriſt, to which the <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> is affixt, but his <hi>Death)</hi> ſo the certain truth of this is moſt expreſly revealed and frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in the Scripture (though nothing be there found of Gods decrees concerning them) upon this ground eſpecially, that no perſon of what nation ſoever ſhould have any prejudice to Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when it ſhould be firſt revealed to him, when he finds his intereſt ſo expreſly provided for by ſo gracious a Redeemer, who if he had not dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>every man,</hi> 'twere impoſſible for any Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to aſſure an Infidel, that he dyed for him, or propoſe any conſtringent reaſon to him, why he ſhould believe on him for ſalvation. To this it is conſequent, that whatſoever Gods unrevealed wayes are, to deal with any heathen, what degree of <hi>repentance from Dead works,</hi> obedience, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance ſoever he accept from them, this muſt needs be founded in the Covenant made with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in Chriſt, which you moſt truly have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, there being <hi>no other name under heaven,</hi> no ſalvation poſſible to lapſed man by any other Covenant; Which, being ſet in oppoſition to the firſt Covenant of perfect unſinning obedience, and therefore called a ſecond and Evangelical Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, on condition onely of ſincere obedience, of doing what by Gods gift, purchaſed by Chriſt, men are enabled to do, it follows ſtill, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever acceptation or mercy they, who never heard of Chriſt, can be imagined to have afforded them by God, muſt be conformable to the tenure of the Evangelicall Covenant, and <hi>ſo to the praiſe of the Glory of that Grace,</hi> whereby whoſoever is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted

by God, is <hi>accepted in the beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 45. The ſecond Conſideration is the analogy, <note place="margin">The ſecond,</note> which, in one reſpect, is obſervable between thoſe to whom the Goſpel is not revealed, and all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Idiots within the pale of the Church, for although believing in Chriſt were ſuppoſed equally by the law of Scripture to be exacted of all, and ſo of both thoſe ſorts (nay by the intervention of the vow of Baptiſm to be more expreſly the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of thoſe that are baptized, then thoſe that are not) yet there is no reaſon producible to free the Chriſtian children and idiots from the blame of not believing, which will not with equall force be producible for thoſe heathens, to whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was never revealed, it being as impoſſible to ſee without the preſence of the <hi>object,</hi> as without the <hi>faculty</hi> of ſight, without the <hi>Sun,</hi> as without eyes, without the revelation of Chriſt, as without the intellective faculty; which if it be not part of the importance of that decree of heaven, <hi>Go and preach, and then he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> yet it is fully accordant to it, and ſhews that that Text was not deſigned to give ſuffrage to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all but Chriſtians, which is all that your Corollary, or my obſervations have aſpired unto; to which it is yet farther neceſſarily conſequent, that theſe <hi>Scripture Decrees</hi> which you ſpeak of (and whoſoever ſpeaks of any other muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſpeak from ſome other dictate, then that of Scripture) comprize not all men, no nor all ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized Chriſtians under them, being terminated onely in thoſe to whom the Goſpel is revealed, and thoſe certainly are not all that are brought into the world, or even to <hi>Baptiſmal</hi> new birth.</p>
            <p>§. 46. The third conſideration is, that ſeeing <note place="margin">The third.</note>

the Scripture aſſures us, that they which have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more, of them more ſhall be required,</hi> and that <hi>he that knoweth and doeth not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> this muſt needs advertiſe us, that whatever priviledges Chriſtians may have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond heathens, this is not one, that a ſmaller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of obedience and performances ſhall be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted of them, then of heathens would be, but the contrary, that to whom <hi>leſs is given, leſs will be required,</hi> according to that of S. <hi>Auguſtine, Ex</hi>

            </p>
            <p>§. 47. The fourth Conſideration is, that God rewards thoſe that have made uſe of the ſingle ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <note place="margin">The fourth.</note> that loweſt proportion of Grace, which he is pleaſed to give; and the method of his reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is by giving them more grace, which as it is in ſome degree applicable to heathens, who have certainly the talent of naturall knowledge, and are ſtrictly reſponſible for it, ſo if they uſe not that, but <hi>retain the truth in unrighteouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 1. 18. that makes their condition but the ſame with ours, (who are finally loſt alſo, and at the preſent have our talent taken away from us) if we make not the due uſe of it.</p>
            <p>§. 48. This, 'tis viſible, hath befaln thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who once had the Goſpel preacht to them, and after the knowledge of the truth, return'd to their heathen ſins, and ſo had their candleſtick ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them (to which and not to Gods prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry denying them Evangelical Grace, their preſent Barbarity is to be imputed) And the onely conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which we can hence duely make, is the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Gods juſt judgements on them, and reaſonable fear leſt he deal in like manner with us,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103954:21"/>
if we tranſcribe their copy, imitate them in their demerits. Should God moſt juſtly thus puniſh this nation at this time, could it either now or in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages be reaſonable hence to argue againſt the Doctrine of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Grace,</hi> in caſe there were a concurrence of all other evidences for the truth of the Doctrine? Certainly it could not. In like manner then it cannot be reaſonable to argue thus from the like fate, and effects on other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>§. 49. To which I may add, that Chriſt being, we know, in Gods decree and promiſe, <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world,</hi> if this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be now of force againſt the heathens, it muſt equally hold againſt all that underſtood no more of the <hi>Predictions</hi> of Chriſt, then the Pagans do now of the <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 50. And then it muſt, ſhould it have force, follow, not onely that the Sacrifice of Chriſt was intended to be of avail to none but the Jews, to whom onely the Oracles of God were committed, (which yet you acknowledge was intended to all) but alſo that as far as we have wayes of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a very ſmall part of thoſe Jews received the ſalvifick Grace of Chriſt, if it were confined and annext to the revelation and belief of him; For if we may judge of other ages by that wherein Chriſt appeared, the Prophecies of the Crucified Meſſias were very little underſtood by that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. All this makes it more prudent, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and pious to ſearch our own wayes, then to paſs ſentence on other men, which is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing I have aimed at in theſe four Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>§. 51. Your ſecond Propoſition, which you
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103954:21"/>
tender as a <hi>Conjecture,</hi> I cannot but own under an <note place="margin">The ſecond Conjecture an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth.</note> higher ſtyle of an evident truth of Scripture, It is this, <hi>That there is to the outward tender of Grace in the miniſtry of the Gospel annexed an inward offer alſo of the ſame to the heart, by the ſpirit of God</hi>

               </gap> 
               <hi>the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> which the Father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes by <hi>verbum vehiculum Spiritus,</hi> the <hi>word is the chariot in which the Spirit deſcends to us,</hi> 2. that deſcription of <hi>reſiſting the holy ſpirit,</hi> which S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> gives us, <hi>Act.</hi> vii. 51. by their being like the Jews, <hi>which perſecuted the Prophets which ſpake unto them,</hi> which concludes the <hi>holy ſpirit to be given with the preaching</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> elſe how
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103954:22"/>
could the rejecting and perſecuting the one be the <hi>reſiſting</hi> of the other? So likewiſe though you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but one <hi>reaſon,</hi> yet that is as conſtringent as many, nothing but ſufficiency of ſupernaturall Grace being competent to render him, that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged naturally impotent, <hi>unexcuſable.</hi> And therefore deeming that abundantly confirmed to advance it above a diſputable probleme, I proceed to the next Propoſition, the third, which you rank under the ſtyle of Conjectures, It is this,</p>
            <p>§ 52. That <hi>becauſe the ſufficiency of this General</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The third Conjecture of effectual Grace and Scripture-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation.</note> 
               <hi>Grace notwithſtanding, through the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruption it might happen to prove uneffectuall to all perſons, God vouchſafed out of the ſuperefflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his goodneſs, yet</hi> ex mero beneplacito, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing on their part to deſerve it, to confer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch perſons as it pleaſed him to fix upon, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inquiring into under what qualifications, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or diſpoſitions conſidered,) a more ſpeciall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace which ſhould effectually work in them faith and perſeverance unto ſalvation]</hi> This (you ſay) you take to be <hi>the election eſpecially ſpoken of in the Scriptures,</hi> and if ſo, then the <hi>Decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation must be nothing els but the dereliction or preterition of the reſt, as to that ſpecial favour of conferring upon them this higher degree of effectuall Grace.

            <p>§. 53. Of this Propoſition, as being the firſt by you produced, to which your caution ſeems to be <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>§. 54. Now of theſe (which is the ſecond thing to be <note place="margin">The ſecond from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> obſerved in your propoſition) it is manifeſt, that if (as you ſuppoſe both in the former, and in this Propoſition,) they have <hi>grace</hi> truly <hi>ſufficient</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them, then they want nothing neceſſary to a faln weak ſinful creature, to converſion, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſalvation, and if ſo, then by the ſtrength of this Grace, without addition of any more, they may effectually convert, perſevere and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and then though what may be, may alſo not be, and ſo it be alſo poſſible that of all that are thus preach'd to, and made partakers of this Grace, no one ſhall make uſe of it to theſe effects, yet this is but barely poſſible, and not rendred ſo much as probable, either upon any grounds of Scripture or Reaſon. In the Scripture there is no word revealed to that ſenſe, or, that I ever heard of, produced or applyed to it, but on the contrary, in the Parable of the Talents (which ſeems to reſpect this matter particularly) they that received the Talents to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate with, did all of them, except one, make profit of them, and bring in that account to their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103954:23"/>
Maſter, which received a reward, which is utterly unreconcileable with the hypotheſis of Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that the talent of ſufficient Grace would be made uſe of by none that received no more then ſo. As for that one that made not uſe of it, all that is intimated concerning him, is, that if his ſhare comparatively was mean, yet by the Lord he is charged as guilty for not <hi>putting it into the bank, that at his coming he might receive his own with u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,</hi> which certainly evinces, that that lazy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is there conſidered as one that might have managed his ſtock as well as the reſt, and that that ſtock was improvable no leſs then the other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeverall proportions, and ſo herein there is no difference taken notice of in favour to your Conjecture.</p>

            <p n="4">4. That the method which he hath decreed to uſe in diſpenſing this ſufficient Grace, is, 1. to prevent and prepare mens hearts by giving them the grace of humility, repentance and probity of heart, i. e. by awaking and convincing men of ſin, and giving them (in anſwer to their diligent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) grace ſufficient to produce this in their hearts, and then upon their making uſe of this Grace to the deſigned end to add more powerfull aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and excitations, enabling them both to will and to do, and upon their conſtant right uſe of theſe, ſtill to advance them to an higher degree of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and perſeverance, till at length he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh and reward them with a crown of Glory.</p>

            <p>§. 72. How clearly every part of this Scheme is agreeable to the ſeveral parables, whereby Chriſt <note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> was pleaſed to adumbrate the kingdome of heaven, and innumerable other paſſages in the Goſpel, and the whole purport of the new Covenant, I leave to every man to conſider, and then to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether it be not ſafer and more Chriſtian to content our ſelves with this portion, which Chriſt hath thought fit to reveal to us, then to permit our curioſities to deeper and more pragmatick ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, eſpecially if thoſe ſhall either directly, or but conſequentially undo, or but darken what is thus explicitly ſettled.</p>
            <p>§. 73. I proceed now to your ſecond head of Diſcourſe, (which alſo I ſuppoſe, is, by what hath <note place="margin">Of the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Grace.</note> been already conſidered, competently eſtabliſhed) concerning the <hi>efficacy of Grace,</hi> &amp;c. where your Propoſition is thus ſet down.</p>

               <hi>therewith (for no man is converted or believeth without his own conſent) all parties pretend to agree.

            </p>
            <p>§. 75. In this propoſition, it being by you in the Concluſion moſt undeniably and Chriſtianly <note place="margin">The Power of Grace in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, &amp;c</note> reſolved, that the one care ought to be, that <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the glory of Gods Grace be eclipſed, nor the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of man's will deſtroyed,</hi> It would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs a little to reflect on the former part, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether your expreſſion were not a little too cautious, in ſaying, <hi>the grace of God hath the main ſtroke and chiefeſt operation]</hi> did I not diſcern the ground of that caution, becauſe you were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that whereunto <hi>all parties</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to <hi>conſent.</hi> This being abundantly ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for your caution, I ſhall not doubt of your concurrence with me, that it may with truth be ſaid, and I ſuppoſe alſo by the agreement, if not of all Chriſtians, yet of both parties in this debate, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Remonſtrants, that the Grace of God is in lapſed man the <hi>one ſole principle of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, Converſion, Regeneration, Repentance, Faith and all other Evangelical vertues,</hi> and that all that can juſtly be attributed to our will in any of theſe, is the obeying the motions, and making uſe of the powers, which are thus beſtowed upon us, by that ſupernatural principle; To <hi>work</hi> and <hi>work out our own ſalvation,</hi> upon the ſtrength of

For indeed when it is conſidered, what the ſtate of our corrupt will is, being naturally averted from God, and ſtrongly inclined to evil, it ſeems to me ſcarce proper to call this, in relation to ſupernatural ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, a <hi>free will,</hi> till God by his preventing Grace hath in ſome degree manumitted it, till Chriſt hath made it free; Being then what it is, i. e. in ſome degree emancipated by Gods Grace, and by Grace onely, (this act of Chriſts love, and Grace being reached out to enemies, to men in their corrupt ſtate of averſion and oppoſition to God) the will is then enabled (ſtill by the ſame principle of Grace) to <hi>chooſe life,</hi> when it is propoſed, and <note place="margin">What the freedome of will now it.</note> the wayes and means to it, and though it be left free to act or not to act, to chooſe or not to chooſe, yet when it doth act and chooſe life, it doth it no otherwiſe (to my underſtanding) then the body doth perform all the actions of life, meerly by the ſtrength of the ſoul, and that continuall animati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it hath, it receives from it; which makes the parallel compleat, and gave ground to the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and compariſon betwixt giving of natural life, and regeneration.</p>
            <p>§. 76. What freedome the will naturally (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this corrupt ſtate) hath to other things, of all ſorts, I do not now conſider any farther, then that it is fully furniſhed with ability to ſin, and <note place="margin">Ability to ſin.</note>

ſo to refuſe and contemn, and to receive in vain the Grace of God, and Grace it ſelf doth not deprive it of that part of its corrupt patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: As for an uniform conſtant choice of thoſe things that belong to our peace and ſpiritual end, for the beginning of that, and every ſtep of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through, and perſeverance in it, Its freedome, and ſtrength, and every degree of life, or action, is wholly and entirely from Grace, and then he that without him <hi>can do nothing, can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens him.</hi> And ſo the onely remaining queſtion is (which to me, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is a poſing one) What exception can poſſibly be ſtarted againſt this ſtating, and conſequently what farther doubt there can be in this matter.</p>
            <p>§. 77.

From hence it ſeems to me neceſſary either to interpret your ſpeech of final perſeverance, as if none were <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually converted,</hi> but ſuch who perſevere, (which as it belongs to another queſtion, that of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to which you after proceed, and not to this of reconciling <hi>irreſiſtibility</hi> and <hi>free will,</hi> ſo it would ſeem to ſtate it otherwiſe, then I perceive you afterwards do) or, to avoid that, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no more by <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> then any other two names, ſuppoſe <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Richard, John at Noke and John at Stile,</hi> (as you ſince tell me your meaning was) the one converted effectually, i. e.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103954:34"/>
really, the other not, when both are ſuppoſed to have the ſame outward means of converſion equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to them.</p>
            <p>§. 82. Now to the queſtion thus ſet of any two, and ſuppoſing what hath been granted between you and me, that the outward means are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed to both with a ſufficient meaſure of inward Grace, My anſwer you diſcern already, that the <note place="margin">Whence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination comes.</note> Diſcrimination comes immediately from one mans reſiſting ſufficient Grace, which the other doth not reſiſt, but makes uſe of: In this ſhould I add no more, there could be no difficulty, becauſe as it is from corruption, and liberty to do evil, (that meeting with the reſiſtibility of this ſufficient grace) that one reſiſts it, ſo it is wholly from the work of Grace upon an obedient heart, that the other is converted; And ſo this ſtating aſcribes all the good to the work of Grace, i. e. to that power, which by ſupernatural Grace is given him, and all <note place="margin">From mans liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</note> the ill to man and his liberty, or ability to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>§. 83. But from what hath been ſaid, there is yet more to be added, viz. that the obedience of the one to the call of Grace, when the other, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have ſufficient, if not an equal meaſure, obeyes not, may reaſonably be imputed to the humble, malleable, melting temper, (which the <note place="margin">From Gods Preventions.</note> other wanted) and that again owing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Graces of God, and not to the naturall probity, or free will of Man, whereas the other, having reſiſted thoſe preparing Graces, or not made uſe of them, lyeth under ſome degree of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration, pride, ſloth, voluptuouſneſs, &amp;c. and that makes the diſcrimination on his ſide, i. e. ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him unqualified and uncapable to be wrought on by ſufficient Grace, and ſo ſtill, if it be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103954:34"/>
weighed, this attributes nothing to free will, conſidered by it ſelf, but the power of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to man but power of reſiſting.</note> and fruſtrating Gods methods (which I ſhould think, they that are ſuch aſſertors of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our nature, ſhould make no difficulty to yield him, but that they alſo aſſert the irreſiſtibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Grace, and that is not reconcileable with it) yielding the glory of all the work of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all the firſt preparations to it, to his ſole Grace, by which the will is firſt ſet free, then fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The whole work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to Grace.</note> and cultivated, and then the ſeed of eternal life ſucceſsfully ſowed in it.</p>
            <p>§. 84. If the Remonſtrants yield not this, you ſee my profeſſion of diſſent from them, if they do, as for ought I ever heard or read (which indeed hath been but little in their works, that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my ſelf to judge of theſe things, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion) they doubt not to do, you ſee you have had them miſrepreſented to you. But this either way is extrinſecall and unconcernant to the merit of the cauſe, which is not to be defended or patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by names (but arguments) much leſs to be prejudged or blaſted by them.</p>
            <p>§. 85. You now add, as a reaſon to inforce your laſt propoſition, <hi>That although the Grace of God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner &amp;c. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Grace effectuall.</note>

               <hi>of the ſon of</hi> Syrach, Fortiter &amp; Suaviter, <hi>is an excellent Motto, and fit to be affixed, as to all the wayes of Gods providence in generall, ſo to this of the effectuall working of his Grace in particular.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 86. This for the ſubſtance falls in with the <note place="margin">This a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</note> laſt of thoſe which you ſo cautiouſly ſet down for meer conjectures, ſeeming to you not improbable. And ſo here you continue to propoſe it, 1, as that, <hi>which God can do,</hi> (and thus no Chriſtian can doubt of it) 2. by the one teſtimony which you tender for the proof of it, the words of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus [ſtrongly but ſweetly;]</hi> which though <note place="margin">Fortiter &amp; ſuaviter.</note> it be there moſt probably interpreted of the works of Gods providence, not particularly of his Grace, ſo if it were, moſt fully expreſſes their thoughts, who building on the promiſe of ſufficient Grace, and the way of the working of that by moral ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will apply the <hi>fortiter</hi> to the ſufficiency, and the <hi>ſuaviter</hi> to the ſuaſion, and yet reſolve (what frequent experience tells us) that thoſe that are thus wrought on, <hi>ſtrongly</hi> and <hi>ſweetly</hi> too, and as <hi>ſtrongly</hi> and <hi>ſweetly</hi> (if not ſometimes more ſo) as they that are converted by it, are yet very (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) many times, not converted.</p>
            <p>§. 87. Here therefore the point lyes, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God <hi>can</hi> thus effectually work upon all that he tenders ſufficient grace unto, nor again, whether ſometimes (and whenſoever he pleaſeth) he doth thus work, (for as this is the moſt that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſo this is moſt evident, and readily granted) but 1. whether all are effectually converted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, and ſo are finally ſaved, on whom God <note place="margin">What is the only queſtion here.</note> doth work thus ſweetly and powerfully, attemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the outward and inward means, applications and inſinuations, by the ſecret imperceptible ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103954:35"/>
of his ſpirit, and that in a congruous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (I add time alſo) 2. Whether his doing thus is ſuch an act of his Election, as that all to whom this is not done, ſhall be ſaid in Scripture to be left, paſt by, and reprobated.</p>
            <p>§. 88. If thus it is, (not onely can be) and if it may be convincingly teſtified by any text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that this really is the <hi>Scripture Election,</hi> it ſhall be moſt willingly and gladly yielded to: But till this be done, 1. that other Scheme, which I ſo lately ſet down, may be allowed to maintain it's competition againſt this, and 2. it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred from the premiſes, that the glory of Gods Grace in every one's converſion is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken care of, and ſecured, without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this: 3. that the ground of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonſtrants exception to the Arminian occurrs in this way of ſtating too, for ſince 'tis here affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Grace even thus applyed is poſſible to be reſiſted, why may not the accepting this higher degree be as imputable to mans wil, as of the other barely ſufficient Grace the objecter ſuppoſes it to be?</p>
            <p>§. 89. Laſtly, the ſaying of our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 21. is of no ſmall moment in the caſe, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat. xi.</hi> 21. <hi>a ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Conjecture.</hi>
               </note> yields a ſubſtantial prejudice to this way. For 1. it is expreſly affirmed verſ. 20. of thoſe Cities wherein were <hi>wrought</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103954:36"/>
of believing it here, where it is ſaid, Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>began to reproach and upbraid them,</hi> that the miracles had been ſo ſucceſsleſs among them, which he could with no propriety do, if any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance needfull to their efficacy had been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them: and v. 22. the more intolerable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of damnation, which is denounced againſt them, puts this beyond queſtion, that theſe want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the more <hi>ſuperabundant</hi> advantages of Grace. Secondly, it is alſo as explicitly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Chriſt, that thoſe miracles and that Grace which were not effectuall to the converſion of thoſe Jewiſh cities, <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> would have been ſucceſsful to the converſion of others, and made them Proſelytes and penitents of the ſevereſt kind, <hi>in ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> Whereupon I demand, Had thoſe means, thoſe <hi>miracles</hi> (the inſtruments and vehicles of Grace, that were then uſed to <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida)</hi> the timings and other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous circumſtances, which the opinion, now under conſideration, pretends to be the infallible means of the ſalvation of the elect, or had they not? If they had, then it ſeems theſe may fail of converting, and ſo have not that ſpeciall <hi>efficacy,</hi> which is pretended, it being expreſly affirmed, that here they ſucceeded not to converſion. But if they had not the timings &amp;c. then it remains as undeniable, as the affirmation of Chriſt can render it, that thoſe means, that Grace, which hath not thoſe advantageous circumſtances, may be, nay, if granted to <hi>Tyre and Sidon,</hi> heathen cities, would actually have been ſucceſsfull to them. And what can be more effectuall to the prejudice of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, then this double force of the words of Chriſt confronted expreſly to both branches of it?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103954:36"/>
And then I hope I may with modeſty conclude, that there remains no viſible advantage of this way, to recommend it, in caſe the Scripture be not found to own, and more then favour it in ſome other paſſages.</p>
            <p>§. 90. Your laſt Propoſition on this Theme is, that <hi>Sith the Conſiſtence of Grace and free will is a Myſtery ſo tranſcending our weak underſtandings, that it hath for many years exerciſed and puzzled the wits of the acuteſt Schoolmen to find it out, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as hundreds of volumes have been written and daily are</hi> de concurſu Gratiae &amp; liberi arbitrii, <hi>and yet no accord hath hitherto followed,</hi> you ſay, <hi>you have ever held, and ſtill do hold it the more pious and ſafe way, to place the Grace of God in the throne, where we think it ſhould ſtand, and ſo to leave the will of man to ſhift for the maintenance of its own freedome, as well as it can, then to establiſh the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and liberty of free will at the height, and then to be at a loſs how to maintain the power and efficacy of Gods Grace,]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 91. But if what hath been clearly laid down, for the attributing all our ſpirituall good to the work of Grace, and aſſuming nothing of this kind to the innate power of free will, but a liberty to reſiſt Grace, the reſt being humbly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be due to a ſupernaturally conferred free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or emancipation, whereby we are enabled to make uſe of Grace, and by the power thereof to cooperate with it; Then 1. the <hi>conſiſtence of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Conſiſtance of Grace and free will.</note> 
               <hi>grace and free will</hi> in this ſenſe, is no ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Myſtery, and I think there is no text in Scripture that ſounds any thing towards the making it ſo. 2. 'Tis evident, that the difficulties that have exerciſed the <hi>Schools</hi> in this matter ariſe from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103954:37"/>
their endeavouring to ſtate it otherwiſe, ſome by maintaining <hi>Predetermination and irreſiſtibility,</hi>

For hereby we <hi>place the Grace of God in the throne,</hi> to rule and reign in the whole work of converſion, perſeverance, and ſalvation, (and what can be more demanded, that we have not aſſerted? certainly nothing by you, who in ſetting down the conſent of all parties, expreſt it by no more then its having the main ſtroke and chiefeſt operation) and need not put the <hi>will of man to ſhift for the maintenance of its own freedome,</hi> as long as we can do it with much more ſafety and temper, then either by ſetting it at the height with the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> or endangering to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it into a meer trunk, or leaving men to the duct of their own humours, either to advance it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove its due, and grow inſolent, or depreſſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low what is meet, and ſo give up themſelves to ſloth, and indifferency.</p>
            <p>§. 92. On the third or laſt head concerning <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>perſeverance,</hi> your propoſitions are three, the two former I ſhall ſet down together, becauſe the firſt is but a preparative to, or one way of proof of the ſecond, which onely concerns our purpoſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>§. 99. In this propoſition I can fully yeild my concurrence, if by rendering my reaſons for my conſent, I may be allowed to expreſſe what I mean by it. This I ſhall do through the ſeverall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I believe not onely that ſecurely we may, but that of neceſſity (and under the pain of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>in adjecto,)</hi> we muſt admit the doctrine of <hi>Perſeverance of Gods Elect,</hi> and the certainty, (moſt unqueſtionable certainty) thereof, Gods Election of any perſon to the reward of the covenant, being undoubtedly founded in the <hi>perſeverance</hi> of that perſon in the faith, this perſeverance being the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe condition of the covenant, <hi>He that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaveá,</hi> he and <note place="margin">

            <p>§. 100. Which that it is nothing available to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward concluding that they which can fall totally from their juſtified ſtate, may not yet fall finally alſo, I infer to be your ſence from your great

diſlike to the <hi>Calviniſts Salvo,</hi> taken from the <hi>diſtinction of a true and temporary faith,</hi> which <note place="margin">Temporary faith may be true.</note> aſſures me, you take that faith for <hi>true,</hi> which yet is but <hi>temporary,</hi> then which nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the eſtabliſhing the perſeverance of all the faithfull, unleſſe there be ſome promiſe that all temporaries ſhall ſo recover again before their death, as finally to perſevere, (which as I think, 'twill not be pretended, ſo if it be, they are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger temporaries,) or unleſſe it ceaſe to be in their power to continue in their ſins, into which they are fallen, which ſure it cannot, unleſſe the grace of <hi>perſeverance</hi> be <hi>irreſiſtible,</hi> which if it were, there is no reaſon, why that of <hi>converſion,</hi> to all that are converted, ſhould not be irreſiſtible alſo.</p>
            <p>§. 101. 2. For their great, (perhaps totall) interruptions and interciſions in the meane time, <note place="margin">The elect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions.</note> I can no way doubt, but thoſe are ſubject to them, who yet upon Gods foreſight of their returne, and perſevering conſtancy at length, are elected to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It is certain, which the <hi>Article</hi> of our Church ſaith, that as they <hi>which have received the holy Ghoſt may depart from grace given and fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> ſo by the <hi>ſame grace of God they may returne again,</hi> and then returning they may no doubt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, and then 'tis certain they are elected to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the mercy and pardon in Chriſt extending not onely to the ſins of an unregenerate ſtate, and the infirmities and frailties of the regenerate; but alſo to all the willfull ſins and falls of thoſe that do timely returne again by repentance, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did (but <hi>Judas</hi> certainly, <hi>Solomon</hi> poſſibly did not,) and then continue ſtedfaſt unto the end. And ſo 'tis onely the finall perſeverance
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103954:40"/>
that is required indiſpenſably of the elect, which is reconcileable with their great, perhaps totall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terciſions.</p>
            <p>§. 102. But 'tis not amiſs here to advert, that this doth no more ſuppoſe or include the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation <note place="margin">The falls of thoſe that have been once regenerate no more recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with Gods favour then of the unregenerate.</note> or favour of God, to thoſe that have been once regenerate, when they are fallen into groſſe ſins, then to the unregenerate remaining in the ſame or greater ſinns, it being as poſſible in reſpect of us, (perhaps more probable in reſpect of God,) that the unregenerate may convert and perſevere, (and then they are approved to be the elect,) as that they that were once regenerate, but now fallen, may return again. It is as certain from before <hi>Paul</hi>'s birth, and from all eternity, that he was elected, as that <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> was, and then either his blaſphemous perſecuting the name of Chriſt muſt have been at the time when he was guilty of that, reconcileable with Gods favour, <hi>viz.</hi> before his converſion, (and then for the gaining of Gods ſavour what needed his converſion?) or elſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s denying and abjuring of Chriſt, <hi>Davids</hi> adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and murther muſt not be reconcileable, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their ſuppoſed <hi>Election.</hi> For as to the ſonſhip of <hi>their</hi> former life, that will no more excuſe their contrary waſting ſins, then the future <note place="margin">Nay the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is on the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates part.</note> ſonſhip of the other, nay it will ſet the advantage on the other ſide, the unconverted <hi>Saul obtaines</hi>

§. 103. 3. That there is a <hi>Certitudo Objecti</hi> to <note place="margin">Certainty of the object.</note> all the <hi>Elect,</hi> cannot be doubted, for if they be elected to ſalvation, they will finally perſevere, if they perſevere not, they were not elected. Again this certainty of the object, is a certainty in regard of the knowledge and purpoſe of God, 1. Of his knowledge that either they will not fall, or if they do, that they will riſe again, and then finally perſevere. 2. Of his purpoſe or decree of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that every ſuch, finally perſevering, though formerly lapſed Chriſtian, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>§. 104. 4. For the <hi>Certitudo ſubjecti;</hi> as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <note place="margin">Certatinty of the ſubject.</note> to you fully in diſclaiming any neceſſity of that, ſo I ſuppoſe it is wholly extrinſecall to this ſubject, devolving to this other queſtion, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every one that is elect, be ſure he ſhall not fall away, but whether every believer be or ought to be ſure of his election? Of which if he were ſure, I could not reſiſt his being obliged to believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf certain of his finall <hi>Perſeverance;</hi> Election and finall failing being incompetible.</p>
            <p>§. 105. Having given you this interpretation of my ſence, and ſo conſent to each branch of your propoſition, I have no more to add, but that if you mean it in a farther ſence, proportionable to your former conjecture on the head of decrees, of Biſhop <hi>Overall</hi>'s opinion, I ſhall no otherwiſe debate or queſtion it, then I did that, and ſo the fate of this and that, are folded up the one in the other, and if the Scripture ſhall be found favourable to the one, it ſhall be yeilded, and then there will be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy of the other.</p>

            </p>
            <p>§. 107. The ſame I ſay of <hi>Grace,</hi> as it ſignifies <note place="margin">Of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious children</note> the paternall favour of God to his Elect children, which is thought by ſome to be onely <hi>clouded,</hi> and, as to their ſenſe and preſent experience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, darkned by their moſt willfull ſins, ſo as God may be highly diſpleaſed with them, as <hi>David</hi> with his ſon <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and yet continue his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Love and favour to them, as <hi>David</hi> did his to that ungracious ſon, in the height of his Rebellion.</p>
            <p>§. 108. 'Tis poſſible this Example of <hi>David</hi> may have ſome Rhetoricall Energy in it, to perſwade and deceive ſome. If it have, then 1. I may not unfitly ask this queſtion, whether they think God had then that kindneſs to <hi>Abſolom</hi> that <hi>David</hi> had? If he had not, how can it be drawn into example to God? If he had, how then can it agree with it, to cut him off in the midſt of his Rebellion, which 'tis manifeſt <hi>David</hi> would not have done. But omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that, I anſwer 2. that 'tis viſible, that this in <hi>David</hi> was paſſionate indulgence, ſuch as men (as <hi>Joab</hi> tells him) diſliked, and to this kind of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane paſſionate, I oppoſe that other kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpaſſionate love, producing in God bowels of pity, frequent admonitions and warnings, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull

And the more force there is in this one conſideration, thus to incline you, the leſſe ſhall <note place="margin">Other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to prejudice it.</note> I deſpair, that two more conſiderations, which then encompaſſed this, and the ſuperadded tender of another way, that the Scripture-grounds, eſpecially <hi>Chriſt's parables</hi> in the Goſpel, ſuggeſted, will in ſome degree prevaile with you, to depoſite this conjecture, which (beſide other prejudices againſt it,) hath no grounds of Scripture to pretend to, in exchange for that other, that hath, and pretends no further, then it ſhall approve it ſelfe to be thus founded.</p>
            <p>§. 5. This is all that I may ſay to an objection which I was to cheriſh and ſtrengthen, (rather then anſwer.) But I ſhall not think that needfull, onely I leave it to have that force with you, which you ſhall ſee fit to give it, remembring onely that it ought not to have force with him, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts not that Scheme, that alone is concerned in it.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Which Scheme having been propoſed by you with perfect warineſſe, and profeſſion of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103954:44"/>
allowing it to be no more then a <hi>conjecture,</hi> one ſuch difficulty as this, is, I acknowledge, ſufficient to remove you from it, and in that caſe it will not be unſeaſonable again to tender that which you may finde better qualified for your acceptance, having without queſtion an advantage, from the <note place="margin">The other way confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the parable of the ſower.</note> 
               <hi>parable of the ſower,</hi> to recommend it. I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make this cleare to you. Your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed intricacy, or unfathomable queſtion, is, what it is that makes <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> to be <hi>effectuall</hi> to <note place="margin">The queſtion what makes ſufficient grace effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> any? I ſay the <hi>parable</hi> of the <hi>ſower</hi> was intended by Chriſt on purpoſe to anſwer that queſtion, which it hath competently performed, for here wee ſee, the <hi>ſeed</hi> being the ſame, (whether that <note place="margin">Punctually anſwered by Chriſt.</note> were the <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>grace,</hi> it matters not, as long as 'tis remembred that <hi>the word is the vehicle of grace,</hi> and the inſtrument of conveighing it to the heart,) all the difference taken notice of, is onely in the ſoyle, <hi>viz:</hi> ſome <hi>troden down,</hi> and cruſted; <note place="margin">The fourfold difference of ſoile.</note> ſome <hi>ſtony;</hi> ſome <hi>thorny;</hi> ſome <hi>good,</hi> and mellow. Proportionably to this four-fold difference of the ground, the ſeverall fates of the ſeed are deſcribed, and your one queſtion divided into four, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer exactly accommodated to each.</p>
            <p>§. 7. The <hi>firſt</hi> queſtion is this, what is it that <note place="margin">The one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion divided into foure. The firſt.</note> makes <hi>ſufficient grace, uneffectuall,</hi> to ſome men, ſo that though it be on Gods part freely afforded them, and as freely as to any other, yet it hath not the leaſt effect upon them? And the anſwer is evident in the explanation of that parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> XIII. 19. becauſe he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>one that heares the word,</hi> to which that grace is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, but either <hi>underſtands</hi> it <hi>not,</hi> or <hi>minds</hi> it <hi>not;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Divil comes and catcheth away that which was ſown,</hi> (and in that caſe there is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103954:45"/>
no great need of that <hi>Divil</hi> towards the obſtructing effectuallneſs, let the ſeed ly there never ſo long, if it be not <hi>minded,</hi> it can ſignifie nothing toward an harveſt.)</p>
            <p>§. 8. The <hi>ſecond</hi> queſtion is, what is it that makes <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> ſufficient Grace, after it is <hi>received,</hi> and that <hi>with joy,</hi> (great forwardneſs and alacrity at the firſt) to become ſo uneffectuall to the ſupporting a man in time of <hi>temptation,</hi> that rather then endure any ſmart for piety, he falls into any the groſſeſt ſins? And the anſwer follows v. 21. becauſe ſuch a man is of a temper that yields not Grace any <hi>depth</hi> to <hi>root</hi> in, he hath ſome <hi>ſtonyneſs</hi> at the bottome, ſome pleaſure, or paſſion, or other remains of reſiſtance rooted in him, which he hath not diveſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of, and when duty begins any way to check that, he is impatient, and throws off Piety, of which he made very fair profeſſions, and ſuch as had, as far as his trialls formerly went, reality in them, till this laſt ſignall tryall was made of him, for which, it ſeems by the effect, he was not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>§. 9. The <hi>third</hi> queſtion is, what is the reaſon <note place="margin">The third.</note> that ſufficient Grace, once received and bringing forth fruits, though it come not to combat with any ſharp tryalls, doth yet many times decay and periſh <hi>after a while?</hi> And the anſwer is v. 22. that there remained in the heart of ſuch ſome piece of ill temper unreformed, which in time prolified, and ſent out great and waſting ſins (though not ſo generally decryed in the world) viz. <hi>worldly ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi> and ſuch as the wealth of the world is apt to beget in men that have or ſeek it, and theſe being permitted to thrive in the ſoul, 'tis regular that Grace, which cannot conſiſt with ſuch <hi>(you cannot</hi>

            <p>§. 10. And this introduceth the <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt <note place="margin">The fourth.</note> queſtion, What then is it that renders ſufficient Grace Effectuall both to Converſion and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? And the Anſwer is v. 23. the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the ſoile, <hi>probity</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> wherein that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Grace is received, and what that is, is beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the oppoſition to all the former three, <note place="margin">The Character of the honeſt heart.</note> 1. it is a ſincerely pliable, ductile temper, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects not to make uſe of any grain of Grace, 2. it hath an uniform Courage to combat with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and is not enſlaved to pleaſures. 3. it utterly deſpiſes the world, the allurements and the terrors of it, and uſes it, as if it uſed it not. The former part of this temper renders it effectuall to converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the two latter to perſeverance alſo. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that parable is ſet down by Chriſt to give account of the various ſucceſſes of the <hi>word of the kingdome,</hi> i. e. of the Goſpel among all thoſe to whom it is made known, who with you are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate object of the <hi>Scripture-election,</hi> and <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> what can be farther required to the clear ſatisfaction of your whole difficulty?</p>
            <p>§. 11. And then remembring that the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining queſtion, viz. <hi>whence is this probity?</hi> hath <note place="margin">The Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with this other way.</note> been fully anſwered in the former papers, I appeal to no other then your ſelf, whether this be not both a perſpicuous, and authorized ſtating, having ſo weighty a paſſage of Goſpel to found it, and therefore in all juſtice preferrable to your bare Conjecture, which, beſides that it is preſſed with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103954:46"/>
difficulties (as your ſelf acknowledge) which to you ſeem unanſwerable, is not provided of any pretenſe of a foundation, hath no authority from holy Scripture to recommend it.</p>
            <p>§. 12. If it have any, it is moſt probably that <note place="margin">One pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Conjecture, From the finding the hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> other ſhort parable in the ſame Chapter, v. 44. where the <hi>kingdome of God is compared to a treaſure hid in the field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, &amp;c.</hi> There the man, which found the treaſure, is not ſuppoſed to <hi>ſeek</hi> it (for that makes another parable v. 45.) but by the meer <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of God (which the heathen Philoſophers were wont to ſtile chance, and commonly give this very inſtance of it <hi>the treaſure found in the field,)</hi> happily to fall upon it, when he paſſeth by on ſome other errand; And this indeed is matter of frequent obſervation, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is converted <note place="margin">The converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine. Of Saul.</note> by S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s Sermon, when he came to it on no ſuch deſign, <hi>Saul</hi> is called to from heaven, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtianity, when he was going to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi> on the moſt diſtant deſign of perſecuting it. And to omit the many more examples of thoſe of whom it hath been litterally true, that they have <hi>found</hi> God, <hi>when they ſought him not, asked not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him,</hi> one eminent ſtory our books give us, of two young children brought to a city to be ſold, at a time when a devout Nun had vowed to take ſome <note place="margin">The diſtant fate of two children.</note> young child, and beſtow her whole life, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt induſtry to bring it up in ſtrict piety, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly came and bought one of them, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as ſhe had bought her, a bawd came in her preſence and bought the other, by which means theſe two, which were ſo lately in the very ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different condition, by this act of Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (to which this was to be attributed) were
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103954:46"/>
ſtrangely <hi>diſcriminated,</hi> the one brought up and early engaged, and ſo perſevering to the lives end in all piety, and the other by the contrary diſcipline debauched, and educated to the trade of harlotry, wherein ſhe lived and perſevered. In which it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how ſignal an influence this one act of Divine <hi>Providence</hi> had on ſo diſtant eternall fates of theſe two, and how eminent an ingredient it was in the ſaving the one and damning the other.</p>
            <p>§. 13. But from all theſe and innumerable the <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> like, (which are freely granted, and allowed to be competent to confirm your main concluſion, that the <hi>Providence of God is Abyſſus multa)</hi> you will ſoon diſcern, that there comes in no leaſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to that <hi>Learned Biſhops Scheme,</hi> which is the matter of your Conjecture, and our onely preſent enquiry. The whole weight of that (as far as I, or any man queſtions it) being laid, not on the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundance afforded to one above the other, (which is willingly granted) but on the foreſeen <hi>univerſall inefficaciouſneſs</hi> of the barely <hi>ſufficient</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The point of the difficulty Whether the barely ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grace be univerſally inefficacious.</note> 
               <hi>Grace,</hi> acknowledged to be given to all, till that ſuperadded advantage adminiſtred by <hi>Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in the choice of the <hi>congruous timing,</hi> come in, as the work of <hi>Gods Election,</hi> to make the diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>§. 14. Now ſeeing in all theſe examples, and in <note place="margin">No pretenſe for this.</note> that parable, nothing like this is to be found, no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or intimation of Gods foreſeeing, 1. that that man that found the treaſure, would never have been wrought on by that meaſure of <hi>ſufficient Grace,</hi> which that opinion allows God formerly to have afforded him, unleſs by that ſeaſonable act of <hi>Providence</hi> he had thus faln on the treaſure in the parable, or 2. that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would never have
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103954:47"/>
been converted, if he had not been ſurprized by S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s Sermon, or 3. that <hi>Saul</hi> would not have been converted at another time, without, or even with that viſion, and voice from heaven, or laſtly that that fortunate child, that fell into the <hi>Nun's,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>bawd's</hi> hands, would never have been brought to heaven any other way, and could not have miſcarried under this method: Through all theſe inſtances, I ſay, it is ſtill appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that nothing is gained toward the approving the Conjecture, theſe advantageous turns of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence afforded one man and not another, and the ſignall efficacy of ſuch, being moſt freely granted by thoſe who deem the <hi>Conjecture</hi> impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
            <p>§. 15. And indeed, if it be well conſidered, all that theſe, and a myriad of the like inſtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, is no more then this, the great and admirable <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Gods providentiall acts,</hi> not as thoſe are all one with, but as in his hands they are inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and ſubſervient to his <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe manners <hi>grace</hi> is advantageouſly aſſiſted by <hi>providence,</hi> to one in this wiſe, and admirable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to another in that; No man, who is allowed the <hi>ſufficient Grace,</hi> being denyed ſome benefit or <note place="margin">Providence allowed to aſsiſt Grace.</note> other of <hi>Providence</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Grace,</hi> and make it more then probable to become effectuall to him, if he doth not betray and fruſtrate the <hi>opportunities</hi> of the one, as well as the <hi>power</hi> and efficacy of the other.</p>
            <p>§. 16. So that ſtill acknowledging moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and admiring the <hi>abyſs of Providence,</hi> this no <note place="margin">But is of no force to the Queſtion.</note> way obſtructs the comprehending the manner (or perplexes the doctrine) of the <hi>cooperation</hi> of the <hi>Grace of God</hi> with the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> but leaves it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103954:47"/>
where the Parable of the Sower ſet it, that the <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and ſucceſsfulneſs, whether to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> or <hi>perſeverance</hi> proceeds from the mellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and preparedneſs of the ſoile, from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which it meets with in the <hi>honeſt heart,</hi> as that again is wholly due to Gods preventing Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which have thus fitted the ſoile for the kindly ſeeds-time, planted pliableneſs, humility in the heart, where Grace may be deeply and durably rooted, but this ſtill <hi>reſiſtibly</hi> in both parts, as hath formerly been expreſt.</p>
            <p>§. 17. One phanſie I know there is, which hath <note place="margin">
                  <hi>A Phanſie of Gods giving the Elect</hi> ipſam non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtentiam</note> pleaſed ſome men in this matter, that God gives <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> to thoſe who do not make uſe of it, but reſiſt it, and yet more then ſo, the power of uſing, or accepting, or not reſiſting it, but gives to the Elect and onely to the <hi>Elect, ipſam non reſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, the very not reſiſting,</hi> and this they will have to be the ſignal <hi>diſcriminating Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 18. Of theſe I ſhall demand 1. whether in thoſe which have not this <hi>ipſam non-reſiſtentiam</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, this be an effect of God's Decree, which <note place="margin">Examined, and found weake.</note> hath determined the certain infallible giving it to ſome peculiar perſons, and ſo the not giving it to all others? If it be not, then this is no foundation of <hi>diſcriminating Grace,</hi> or conſequently fruit of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> and ſo is ſtill impertinent to the matter for which it is brought.</p>
            <p>§. 19. But if it be the effect of Gods Decree, determining the giving it to ſome, and denying it to others, I then 2. demand, whether all they to whom it is not given, do therefore infallibly <hi>receive the grace of God in vain,</hi> becauſe they have not this <hi>ipſa non-reſiſtentia</hi> (which is more then the power of not reſiſting) given them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:103954:48"/>
§. 20. If this be not affirmed, then, as before, this comes not home to <hi>diſcriminating Grace,</hi> nor conſequently to the buſineſs of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> which it was meant to aſſiſt. But if it ſhall be ſaid, that they therefore infallibly reſiſt, or <hi>receive in vain,</hi> becauſe this <hi>ipſa non-reſiſtentia</hi> is not given them, then it ſeems this gift of <hi>ipſa non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentia</hi> is ſuch, as that they who have it not, want ſomewhat which is neceſſary to their effectuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, or not-reſiſting Grace, and if this be the condition of the far greateſt part of the world, then how can it with any ſincerity be affirmed (as by thoſe that make uſe of this expedient, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt) that God hath to all mankind given <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>in him all things,</hi> and particularly <hi>Grace ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> and the power of not-reſiſting Grace, which according to this phanſie, none can chooſe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, who have not the <hi>ipſam non-reſiſtentiam</hi> given them, which yet they affirm to be given but to a few, i. e. to none but the <hi>elect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 21. This were (by interpretation, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) for God to give to all men a power to an act, which yet the greateſt part of thoſe which have it given them, can never make uſe of to that act, for want of ſomewhat elſe which is not given them, which to all them which have not that ſomewhat elſe given (and thoſe the far greateſt number of men for whom <hi>Chriſt dyed)</hi> is not a power to that act, viz. of not-reſiſting; which what is it other then a direct <hi>contradiction,</hi> a power and not a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the ſame act? and withall ſo far from being a favour to them, that it is in event infallibly and inevitably the greateſt curſe, that could have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln them, viz. the heightening and extreamly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating of their guilt and puniſhment, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103954:48"/>
to their ſin of reſiſting ſuch ſufficient grace, of ſtanding out againſt Chriſt, which as it is the height of guilt, (and awarded the dregs of Gods wrath,) now under the Goſpel, and makes their condition in the world to come, much worſe, then it would have been, if Chriſt had never been borne, or preached to them, ſo it had never been thus direfully charged upon them, if they had not had the <hi>power of not reſiſting</hi> given them by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 22. This is a competent prejudice and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement <note place="margin">Conſidered in relation to this phanſie.</note> to this phanſy, of founding diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating grace and the doctrine of unconditionate decrees in this difference betwixt the <hi>power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting,</hi> and the <hi>ipſa non-reſiſtentia,</hi> the latter given onely to the <hi>Elect.</hi>

§. 26. This farther and moſt irrefragably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the <hi>perſons,</hi> to whom both the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this enforcement thereof is tendred, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>brethren</hi> indefinitely, or <hi>beloved, verſe.</hi> 12. the whole Church of <hi>Profeſſors</hi> at <hi>Philippi</hi> to whom he writes, which being not made up wholly of the elect, ſincere, and perſevering Chriſtians, but like the net, in Chriſt's parable, that <hi>caught both good and bad,</hi> and had no doubt ſome inſincere perſons, hypocrites, and temporaryes in it, the affirmation notwithſtanding is indiſcriminately of all, <hi>God worketh in</hi> them <hi>to work,</hi> which could not hold, if by this phraſe were meant his giving the <hi>ipſa non-reſiſtentia,</hi> and that as an evidence of <hi>diſcriminating grace,</hi> and an effect of his <hi>Election,</hi> for this is not ſuppoſable to have belonged to that <hi>whole</hi> Church, any more then it then did, or now is believed to do to <hi>all</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>§. 27. I have enlarged thus far, becauſe I was not willing to omit, but rather to prevent what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I could foreſee might probably be objected in this buſineſſe. And ſo this may ſuffice to have returned to your firſt difficulty.</p>
            <p>§. 28. The ſecond difficulty you thus propoſe, <note place="margin">The ſecond difficultye. Concerning Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing ſufficient grace.</note> 
               <hi>Whereas it is ſaid, and that, (as you conceive,) moſt truly and agreably to plain evidence of Scripture, that God withdraweth his grace from ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting it when it is offered to them by the preaching of the Goſpel, do thereby fruſtrate the Counſell of God againſt themſelves, it ſeemeth hard to conceive how the grace of God ſhould be ſo withdrawn from them, that ſo do, but that, ſo long as they are not deprived of the outward means, the ſame ſufficient grace that was offered to them at the firſt hearing</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:103954:50"/>
               <hi>of the Goſpel, is offered to them ſtill; which if it was then ſufficient on God's part, to do the work, is alſo ſtill ſufficient, and that in the ſame degree, and how then can it be ſaid to be withdrawn? It is true that the converſion of ſuch a perſon, after ſo long obſtinacy and refuſall is more difficult then before, which may ariſe from the greater indiſpoſition of the perſon to be wrought upon, but how it can be imputed in the leaſt, to the withdrawing of the divine grace, (to which yet undoubtedly it may and ought to be imputed,) upon the former ſuppoſall on the like ſufficiency remaining, I must profeſſe my ſelf not able to underſtand.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 29. To this I ſhall not doubt to apply a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwer, and ſuch as you will acknowledge to be ſuch, by diſtinguiſhing of <hi>Gods withdrawing his grace.</hi> For, 1. it being Gods method to <hi>give</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The ſeverall wayes of Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing grace. The firſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with-holding.</note> 
               <hi>more grace</hi> to thoſe that walk worthy of it, the humble obedient children of grace, when he on our provocations ſtops that current, this may be called <hi>withdrawing.</hi> God's ſmitings are his admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>(heare ye the Rod,)</hi> his admonitions, as any other diſpenſation of his word are <hi>vehicles of grace,</hi> and when theſe prevaile not, they are thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, <hi>i. e.</hi> not farther encreaſed, <hi>(why ſhould yee be ſmitten any more,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1.) Yet is this <hi>withdrawing</hi> conſiſtent with Gods affording <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Conſiſts with his affording ſufficient.</note> 
               <hi>grace,</hi> either by inſtruments of ſome other kinde, or even of the ſame kinde, the continuance of that proportion, which was formerly afforded; as he that gives a competency, and would if he ſaw it well uſed, daily make additions to it, though he ſee cauſe to with-hold thoſe additions, yet he may continue that competency. But in propriety of ſpeech, (the truth is,) this is rather <hi>with-holding,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:103954:50"/>
then <hi>withdrawing,</hi> yet becauſe the not giving what was promiſed to be given is tantamount to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing,</hi> I therefore place this in the firſt ranke, ſuppoſing it cleare, that this doth not onely leave ſufficient grace; but is it ſelf deſigned to awaken and quicken thoſe that did not formerly make good uſe of it, <hi>Leſt a worſe thing yet befall</hi> them.</p>
            <p>§. 30. <hi>Secondly,</hi> then <hi>withdrawing</hi> being taken <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> in the proper ſenſe, for <hi>taking away</hi> from and diminiſhing the ſtock, before afforded, that may yet be but in <hi>part,</hi> not <hi>totall,</hi> and there being a <note place="margin">Not totall.</note> latitude in <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> ſome degrees of that may be taken away, and yet that which remaines be ſufficient, an image of which is that degree of <hi>Church-cenſures,</hi> which cutting off from the participation of the Euchariſt, or ſuſpending from it, allowes the hearing of the word, and partaking in the prayers of the faithfull, And this act of <hi>Gods withdrawing,</hi> again is ſo far from denying <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> that it is purpoſely uſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, as the moſt probable means to make that <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> effectuall, which formerly had not been ſo.</p>
            <p>§. 31. There may yet be a <hi>third,</hi> and yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of <hi>withdrawing,</hi> which at the preſent, <note place="margin">The third to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, but only for the time, and neither ſimply totall.</note> and as to <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>totall, i. e.</hi> ſuch a withdrawing of grace at the preſent, that it ſhall truly be ſaid ſuch a man is not now allowed ſufficient for his neceſſities, whether it be that his neceſſities are grown greater, and ſo the former competency will not ſuffice, or be it alſo, that ſome of that which he had is <hi>withdrawn,</hi> as when he that for ſome time had no violent temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and was furniſhed with ſtrength propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103954:51"/>
to what he had, upon his betraying this ſtrength, and ſinning willfully againſt it, is by God called out to ſharper combats, having been foiled with the weaker, and perhaps ſome part of his former ſtrength <hi>withdrawn</hi> from him alſo, when he hath moſt need of ſuccours, and ſhould certainly have had them, had he not thus provoked the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them. In this caſe the aime of this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods is yet moſt wiſe and mercifull, thus to convince ſuch a man of his guilts, and impotence, (the effect of them,) and ſo as by turning <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> into the field, thorowly to humble him, to excite ardency of prayers, both for <hi>pardon,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> which God in that caſe failes not to give, and ſo to reſtore ſuch a man to a greater ſtability of his former ſtate.</p>
            <p>§. 32. And ſo ſtill this is neither <hi>finall,</hi> nor ſimply <hi>totall,</hi> as that ſignifies <hi>withdrawing all grace,</hi> but onely totall for a time in the ſence declared, as it ſignified the withdrawing what was neceſſary to their preſent ſtate.</p>
            <p>§. 33. And I need not ſhew you how far this is reconcileable with <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> any farther then thus, that ſuch an one though ſeverely mulcted hath yet time for repentance and grace to make ſome uſe of it, which if he failes not in, he hath aſſurance of <hi>more grace,</hi> and this demonſtrated to be ſo, by his not being cut off in his ſins, (Gods <hi>long-ſuffering leading him to repentance,)</hi> and by <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom. li.</hi> 4.</note> the light of Gods word, and articulation of his calls dayly continued to him, which are not void of that <hi>grace,</hi> which is ſufficient to work conviction, and hath the promiſe of <hi>more,</hi> (upon asking,) made to him that is thus qualified for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:103954:51"/>
§. 34. Fourthly, there is the <hi>removing the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The fourth total, yet it ſelf deſigned as a Grace, most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of any.</note> the withdrawing all the outward ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means of Grace, the preaching of the Word and Sacraments, which if it be done by the cenſures of the Church, is called the <hi>delivering up to Satan,</hi> or if it be done by Gods judgements, invaſion of barbarians, &amp;c. it is yet to thoſe perſons that are thus puniſhed, perfectly proportionable to that of the <hi>Church-cenſures.</hi> And yet of thoſe it is ſaid expreſly by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that the end of inflicting them is <hi>for edification, that they may be diſciplined,</hi>

            <p>§. 35. They that ſee ſo great a benefit withdrawn from them for their unworthineſs, will be thereby excited to reflect on their provocations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail them, and contend by all regular means to regain what they have forfeited, and to repair their defects ſome other way, and this being the very end to which this puniſhment is by God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, it is not imaginable, he doth yet (till <hi>this</hi> method alſo be deſpiſed) withold that degree of <hi>Grace</hi> from ſuch which is neceſſary for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the Effect.</p>
            <p>§. 36. All the ordinances of God, we know (and ſuch are the <hi>Cenſures)</hi> yea and all the wiſe diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations <note place="margin">Gods puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Grace.</note> of his <hi>providence,</hi> particularly his <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of this life (and therefore this, as the laſt,

beſide exciſion) are inſtruments of <hi>Grace</hi> in the hands of his <hi>wiſdome,</hi> as well as the preaching of the word is, and therefore in all reaſon to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be the <hi>vehicles</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> alſo, and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this any objection againſt Gods giving <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Grace</hi> to thoſe, whom he thus puniſhes, in caſe they begin to make uſe of it. If they do not, but continue ſtill obſtinate, 'tis juſt it ſhould at length be withdrawn from them.</p>
            <p>§, 37. But this muſt be underſtood onely of thoſe perſons to whom the light of the <hi>Gospel</hi> had formerly ſhined, not to their diſtant poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which never have had any gleames of it, though their Anceſtors had the fulleſt Sunſhine.

            <p>§. 38. <hi>Fifthly</hi> there is a <hi>totall</hi> and <hi>finall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing</hi> of all <hi>grace,</hi> as well as the means of it, <note place="margin">The fifth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of all Grace by exciſion.</note> which is viſible in the cutting off ſuch an one in his ſins, and when this comes, our former ſuppoſall of <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> as of the preaching of the word, and God's calls, are utterly at an end, but this breeds no ſhew of difficulty, that man having enjoyed and miſpent his time of <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> and now the <hi>ſtore-houſes are ſhut up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 39. But there is yet poſſibly a <hi>ſixth</hi> ſtate of <hi>with-drawing,</hi> when before either cutting off, or <note place="margin">The ſixth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exciſion.</note> with-drawing Gods <hi>outward calls,</hi> whilſt life, and the preaching of the word is continued, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate ſinner, that hath long hardened his own heart againſt God, thereby provokes him <hi>totally</hi> to <hi>with-draw</hi> all inward Grace from him, as much as if he were already in hell; This ſeems to be <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:103954:52"/>
caſe after the ſixth judgement, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by God to very excellent ends, to make him an example to all thoſe that ſhould be inclined <hi>to harden their hearts againſt God;</hi> And though we know not that God thus deals with any others, yet it is ſure he juſtly may with all whom he may juſtly cut off in their ſins. And in this caſe I acknowledge the <hi>non-converſion</hi> of ſuch a man is not onely impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the <hi>indiſpoſition of the perſon to be wrought on,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>withdrawing of the divine grace,</hi> for then, as I ſaid, the former ſuppoſal (of the like ſufficiency remaining) ceaſeth, and is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated.</p>
            <p>§. 40. What freſh difficulties can ariſe from this conceſſion, I cannot divine, unleſs 1. it ſhould be objected, that then, it ſeems, the word is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the vehicle of Grace, and then 2. who knows when it is ſo, when not? And how then is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with the doctrine of <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanying the word? And to theſe the anſwers are obvious, 1. that it is granted that the <note place="margin">The word is not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Grace to the damned, or the higheſt degree of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate.</note> Word is not the vehicle of Grace to the <hi>Divils who believe and tremble,</hi> to the damned who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their ſentence, nay nor to thoſe that are thus arrived to the higheſt degree of obduration in this life, and have, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> this exterminating ſentence paſſed upon them. It is ſufficient if it be ſo to them that are in a capacity to make uſe of it, and have not utterly <hi>hardened</hi> themſelves againſt it, the Scripture-expreſſion being, that the Goſpel is <hi>the power of God to ſalvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves</hi>

§. 41. As for the <hi>ſecond,</hi> if it were on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed grounds granted, that ſometimes it cannot be known whether or no the preaching of the Word do then bring this Grace with it, yet the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular conſequence would be that we ſhould all be the more carefull to make uſe of <hi>Grace,</hi> when it is afforded: But when to this is added, that this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſeaſon is alwayes the reward of <hi>obſtinate</hi> obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (and of nothing leſs then that) As long as <note place="margin">Where any ſoftneſs, none of that.</note> we have any <hi>ſoftneſs</hi> left, that is our aſſurance that this ſad time is not yet come upon us. They that go on in their obdurate courſe, have reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this fatal period every hour, but they that have <hi>remorſe,</hi> and any degree of ſincere relenting, may know by this, that this ſtate of ſpiritual death hath not yet ſeized them, and that is ſufficient to guard this doctrine from all noxious conſequences, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provided that none ſhall hereby think his ſtate <hi>deſperate,</hi> that is willing to reform it.</p>
            <p>§. 42. But then it is farther to be remembred, that there appears not in the word of God, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther example of this <hi>totall</hi> ſpirituall dereliction fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <note place="margin">Pharaoh the onely example of it in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> inflicted, <hi>before death,</hi> but onely that of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> after the time that <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>hardened his heart;</hi> and the reaſon of this is ſet down, God <hi>keeps him alive,</hi> after the time due to his exciſion, that he <hi>might ſhew in him his power.</hi> And ſuch ſingular examples ought no farther to be <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom. ix.</hi> 17.</note> taken into conſideration by us at this diſtance from them, then to warn us, that we keep as far as it is poſſible from the like provocations, And then there remains not, that I diſcern, any farther appearance of difficulty in this matter.</p>
            <p>§. 43. As for any others that ſhall be apt to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, when men ſet themſelves to conſider of theſe

I received your Letter, and in it your ſence of that difficult point, which I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, but on the contrary aſſure my ſelf, that as <hi>Omnipotence</hi> is not onely the power of doing all <note place="margin">Omniſcience proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence.</note> things that any or all creatures can do, but more then ſo, the doing all things that imply not a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,</hi> (as the ſame thing at once to be and not to be, the doing of thoſe being as impoſſible to God, as it is to lye,) ſo the <hi>Omniſcience</hi> of God is the knowing all things which any creature can know, and not onely ſo, but the knowing all things which implye not a <hi>contradiction</hi> to be known, and then that will be extenſible to all things that are paſt, preſent, or to come, of what ſort ſoever they are; what is paſt, or preſent, or being future is decreed by him, or comes to paſſe by ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſe in nature, which he decrees not to hinder, Gods knowledge of theſe will not, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, be doubted of. All the queſtion will be of <hi>future contingents,</hi> which before they are done, <note place="margin">Future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents with in Gods reach.</note> are poſſible to be, or not to be, but whenſoever
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103954:55"/>
they come to paſſe, are as determinately in being; as is any thing elſe, (the moſt neceſſary,) that is allready done. Unleſſe then, what by being fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is out of my reach, is alſo by being future, out of Gods reach, there can be no pretenſe that any ſuch future contingent ſhould not be objicible to Gods all ſeeing knowledge.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And that nothing that ever ſhall be, or will come to paſſe, is thus out of Gods reach, muſt ſure be yeilded to <hi>Gods immenſity,</hi> which relating <note place="margin">Proved by Gods immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</note> to time, as well as place, it will be equally deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to it to limit it to the preſent <hi>time,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the future, and to the preſent, (be it whatſoever finite,) <hi>place.</hi> This therefore I take to be the one thing fit to be conſidered in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whether Gods <hi>immenſity</hi> comprehend not a commenſuration to all time, and ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, as much as <hi>infinite</hi> is beyond <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. This I ſuppoſe cannot be denyed to the Notion which is due to a Deity, and if ſo, then God was immenſe from all eternity, and cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined to advance or arrive to this by any <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>proficiency,</hi> or improvement, by continuing or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during from the beginning to this time, or to the end of the world, but in every imaginable point of time, even before time was, he was thus <hi>immenſe,</hi> and if ſo, his <hi>knowledge</hi> being as <hi>immenſe</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all that he was from eternity preſent to, <hi>(i. e.</hi> all things that ever were or ſhall be,) muſt needs be objected to his knowledge.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Againſt this, your prime argument is, <hi>that it is no more derogatory to his omniſcience not to know that which is in nature unintelligible, then to his Omnipotence, not to do things impoſſible.]</hi> This
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103954:56"/>
is expreſly <hi>Socinus</hi>'s grand argument, and to it I <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Socinus</hi>'s <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi>
                  </note> anſwer. 1. That the phraſe, <hi>(in nature unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,)</hi> may be ſet to ſignifie no more then what no naturall, <hi>i. e.</hi> created power can <hi>know,</hi> and then there is no truth in the propoſition, unleſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably <hi>[impoſſible]</hi> ſignify what no finite naturall created power can <hi>do:</hi> and if both thoſe phraſes be meant ſo, there is nothing gain'd by it, becauſe a Deity may both do and know more, then any creature can. But then <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the phraſe <hi>[in nature unintelligible]</hi> may alſo ſignifie that which in the nature of things, whether finite or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, created or uncreated, is not poſſible to be underſtood; And thus I ſuppoſe you meane it, and then the interpretation of the phraſe muſt be, that for ſuch a thing to be objicible to any, though infinite, underſtanding, implyes a <hi>contradiction,</hi> (for nothing elſe is ſimply impoſſible:) And <note place="margin">Of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</note> this being your meaning, I abſolutely deny, that for God to be by his immenſity preſent to all time, (and all that he is preſent to, he may ſee,) implyes a <hi>contradiction,</hi> or hath any appearance, (to him that conſiders what infinite is,) of ſo implying. And if you will make tryall and attempt to prove it doth, it muſt be by proceeding on the known definition of <hi>contradictoryes,</hi> a repugnance <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> as <hi>idem eodem reſpectu eſſe &amp; non eſſe,</hi> and then you will ſoon diſcerne the unqueſtionable truth of my deniall. For Gods ſeeing all future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents, will neither imply God to be, and not to be, to ſee, and not to ſee, to ſee certainly, and not to ſee certainly, nor the future contingent to be, and not to be, or to be neceſſarily and not to be neceſſarily, or to be future, and not to be future. For the thing being future, and contingent now,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103954:56"/>
and ſo continuing till it comes to paſſe, and when it comes to paſſe, coming to paſſe contingently, and ſo as it might not come to paſſe alſo, but when it actually is done, it implying a contradiction, (and ſo being impoſſible,) not to be done, and ſo being neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate hypotheticâ,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſuppoſing that it is,</hi> all this God ſees and knowes by the ſeverall acts of his intellect, anſwerable to the ſeverall noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the thing.</p>
               <p>§. 7. From all eternity, and ſo in every point of time, before it comes to paſſe, God ſees it both as <hi>future,</hi> and as <hi>contingent,</hi> and ſo, as that, which till it is, may be or may not be; and when it comes to paſſe, <hi>in ipſo fieri,</hi> he ſees the man that does it, act <hi>freely,</hi> having power to the contrary, and the thing never <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but as being done, and that onely by that <hi>neceſſity,</hi> whereof that propoſition in logick is to be underſtood, <hi>Omne quod eſt, eo quod eſt, neceſſariò eſt.</hi> All which is very obvious to be conceived, and there is not the leaſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or ſhew thereof in it.</p>
               <p>§. 8. This one would thinke you readily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when you ſay, <hi>God infallibly knowes all that is paſt, preſent, or poſſible to be,</hi> (for no man demands any more,) yet you deny it again in theſe words, <hi>[meer contingents which with equall poſſibility may be, or may not be, have no being in act, and therefore can caſt no reflection, or objective being into the mind of God.]</hi> To which I reply, Firſt, that you ought to advert. 1. That what may be, or may not be, may be. 2. What may be, is poſſible, and 3. You your ſelf confeſſe that God knowes all that is <hi>poſſible.</hi> Secondly that the <hi>having no being in act,</hi> (which ſeemes to be your ſtumbling block,) is a phraſe proportioned to the thing, and to our
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103954:57"/>
finite underſtandings, to which the thing is <hi>future</hi> onely, and ſo hath no being yet: but when God is conſidered as <hi>infinite,</hi> then whatſoever ſhall ever be in act, that actuall being of it, is the object of Gods ſight, and hath been ſo from all eternity, and is no more removed from him, then that is removed from me, which is preſent with me; And if you ſay, <hi>God ſees before, what in after time ſhall hang in the ballance of humane indetermination,</hi> i e. what he may do, deliberates, and is free to do, or not to do, but hath not yet done, I demand, why may he not alſo foreſee which end of the ballance doth at length overpoiſe? (Is not one of theſe as truly <hi>future,</hi> as the other, when the man is not yet borne?) And ſo again, which end doth not overpoiſe, and never will, although he ſee it might, if the man ſhould chooſe ſo, and that the man may ſo chooſe, but ſtill that he doth not. This is it, wherein you ſay the <hi>contradiction</hi> is, and now it is viſible there is none, nor the leaſt approach towards any.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Here you add, (which is your ſecond main objection,) <hi>that it is a miſtake to call that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A <hi>ſecond ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>poſſible, which God foreſees ſhall never be, for if God foreſees the contrary,</hi> (i. e. <hi>that it ſhall never be,) it is indeed impoſſible.</hi> But, 1. I pray, is nothing <hi>poſſible</hi> to come to paſſe, but what <hi>actually</hi> comes to paſſe? If ſo, nothing that is, is <hi>contingent.</hi> But if ſome things be <hi>poſſible</hi> to come to paſſe, which yet do not come to paſſe, why may not God ſee they will not come to paſſe? And if he can, then that is no miſtake, which you ſay is. 2. Do but change the word foreſight into (which is the ſame,) ſeeing from all eternity, and then it is plain, that God from all eternity may ſee that thing will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103954:57"/>
actually be, which yet is free for the agent to do, or not to do, (and God ſees that too,) and ſo is <hi>poſſible</hi> every way, ſave onely <hi>ex hypotheſi, on ſuppoſition</hi> that it will never be; And as the bare <hi>hypotheticall neceſſity</hi> is no <hi>abſolute neceſſity,</hi> ſo the bare <hi>hypotheticall impoſſibility</hi> is no <hi>abſolute impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> 3. God ſees every thing as it is, and it's being or not being ſuch, is in order of nature an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to Gods <hi>ſeeing</hi> it; Therefore it infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly followes, that if it be <hi>poſſible</hi> to be, though it ſhall never be, God ſees it is <hi>poſſible</hi> to be, and if God ſees it <hi>poſſible,</hi> it unavoidably followes that it is poſſible.</p>
               <p>§. 10. And it is not fit here to interpoſe, that <hi>though it ſeem to us poſſible, in reſpect of ſecond cauſes, yet if God foreſee the contrary, it is indeed impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;]</hi> For what I am by God left free to do, or not to do, that, not onely ſeemes, but is indeed poſſible, and ſo it is, though in event I never do it, and being ſo in it ſelf, God's ſeeing it will never be, hath no leaſt influence upon it, ſo as to make the leaſt change in it, (for that is the work of his <hi>will,</hi> not of his <hi>knowledge,)</hi> and ſo it cannot from <hi>poſſible</hi> convert it into <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. When therefore you ſay, <hi>no cauſe can effect that which God ſees ſhall never be,</hi> this is onely true <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> that, in caſe it ſhall never be, and ſo God ſees it ſhall never be, no cauſe ſhall effect it, but <hi>in ſenſu diviſo</hi> it is moſt falſe, for I am truly able to write more lines to you then I ſhall ever write, or conſequently then God foreſees I ſhall write, and even this, that I am thus able, God equally <hi>foreſees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§, 12. By this you ſee how far I am from being convinced, or by any reaſon forced to grant, that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103954:58"/>
                  <hi>future determinations of free agents are not foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and what the inconvenience is of affirming they are not, even no leſs then derogating from <hi>Gods Immenſity,</hi> and <hi>Infinity,</hi> and judging the perceptions of an infinite Creator by our finite, created meaſures, his more then unfathom'd Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an by my ſpan, and feigning <hi>contradictions,</hi> where there are none.</p>
               <p>§. 13. Now to the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> which you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerate, <note place="margin">Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. The firſt.</note> I ſhall reply alſo, as oft as I perceive I have not prevented, or anſwered them already. The firſt is, that <hi>the ſight can be no more certain then the things are which are ſeen, and therefore there cannot be a certain knowledge of thoſe things, which in their cauſes are uncertain,]</hi> I anſwer that all the <hi>certainty</hi> of the knowledge of any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon its <hi>being</hi> firſt, and then of its being <hi>known</hi> to be, and not onely upon the <hi>certainty</hi> of its <hi>cauſes;</hi> I do now as certainly know that I have written nine pages to you, as I know that the fire burns, therefore that may be <hi>known certainly,</hi> which is not <hi>certain in its cauſes.</hi> And as that which is preſent to me is certainly known by me, ſo are all things to come from all eternity, preſent to an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe</hi> Creator, be they contingent, or not. And in this caſe there is not <hi>more in the effect then in the cauſe,</hi> for what is contingently come to paſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, is certain, and cannot be undone, and God ſees it, as it is, therefore he ſees it as done, and ſo certain, yet as done contingently, and ſo as that which might not have been, the <hi>being,</hi> certain, the <hi>manner</hi> of its coming to act, <hi>uncertain.</hi> The being then being the cauſe of the ſeeing, or in nature an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to it, and the ſeeing the effect or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the being, the certainty of the effect is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103954:58"/>
but proportionable to, and <hi>exceedeth not the cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 14. The <hi>ſecond Inconvenience</hi> is, that of <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> 
                  <hi>that every thing that happens was certain to be, before it happens]</hi> But I ſay not ſo, unleſs by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you mean <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> certain to be, in caſe it be; for in caſe it ſhould not be, God ſhould ſee it would not be, and then it ſhould be as <hi>certainly</hi> otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 15. The ſhort is, All <hi>Exhortations, Induſtry, Preaching,</hi> &amp;c. are founded in the <hi>liberty</hi> of our actions, and if they be free till they be actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and then are paſt freedome, and become neceſſary, ſo conſequently muſt <hi>Exhortations,</hi> &amp;c. be all uſefull, till the thing be done, (and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as to the doing, or not doing that, they are not uſefull, but their ſecond ſeaſon of uſefulneſs comes in, in caſe it were a ſin, <hi>Exhortation to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> &amp;c.) and that is as much, as can be or need be pretended to, and this is fully competible with Gods ſeeing certainly from all eternity, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall come to paſs in time; His ſeeing it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it done, though for the manner of its being done, that were <hi>contingent,</hi> and if ſo, then is it not certain to be, before it happens, but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be, when it is, and it firſt <hi>is,</hi> in order of nature, before it is <hi>ſeen,</hi> and its being already ſeen, before it be done, depends onely on the <hi>immenſity</hi> of Gods preſence, and ſight, which reacheth out to all that ever ſhall be; ſo that that which is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to us, he is preſent to it, and in that ſence, though he ſees it as future, tis yet preſent to him.</p>
               <p>§. 16. Your <hi>third inconvenience</hi> is, that, <hi>by this, the damnation of ſuch or ſuch men is as fixed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The third.</note> 
                  <hi>as though they were reprobated from all</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:103954:59"/>
                  <hi>eternity, and it is as ill in respect of me, if I muſt inevitably be damned by my own free will, as if I had been ſentenced to Hell by Gods decree, and in respect of God worſe, for he muſt be deprived of the free exerciſe of his omnipotence, (becauſe he cannot make that not to be which he foreſees will be) and brought under a Stoicall Fatality, and ſo be an helpleſs ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of what anothers will is pleaſed to effect.]</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer if by <hi>[ſuch and ſuch men]</hi> you mean ſuch or ſuch individuall entities, without reſpect to their qualifications or demeanures, then all your conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as it is <hi>inconvenient,</hi> ſo it is falſe, for from Gods ſeeing <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> that <hi>Judas</hi> will be reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it follows not, that he ſees he will be reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but for his willfull Treaſon. But if you mean by <hi>ſuch or ſuch men]</hi> men ſo or ſo qualified, i. e. finally impenitent, then 'tis true, but not <hi>inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,</hi> that finall impenitents, ſhould from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity be reprobated. And ſpeaking of theſe in this ſence, 'tis true, which you add, that it is as ill in reſpect of the perſon, i. e. finall impenitents, meaning by <hi>[as ill]</hi> as ſad and penal, nay 'tis more ſad, and penal to be reprobated for final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, which I am guilty of by my own <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> then it would be to be onely by Gods <hi>decree</hi> involved in it, my willful culpable guilt being ſome addition to my miſery, and (as long as God is juſt) it being expectable that thoſe puniſhments will be ſharper, which I bring on my ſelf, by the exerciſe of my free will, then what comes on me by a decree grounded no way in my actions. And ſo ſtill this is no <hi>Inconvenience.</hi> But if you mean by <hi>[as ill]</hi> that which hath as little mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gods goodneſs towards me, then your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is falſe, for to Gods ſeeing <hi>Judas</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103954:59"/>
and his ſeeing it <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> it is no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, that he gives him no power to eſcape Damnation, viz. Grace to be able to ſtand and not fall, or Grace to recover if he will make uſe of it, but the contrary rather follows; For how can God ſee him damned for the <hi>betraying Chriſt,</hi> and not repenting and returning, unleſs this were done wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by him (ſins of <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, as in the caſe of <hi>Saul, perſecuting the Church)</hi> and unleſs he were firſt a <hi>Diſciple of Chriſt,</hi> and ſo were illuminated, and aſſiſted by Chriſt, and if he were ſo, then he had this power and Grace, or might have had it, if he were not wanting to himſelf, and if ſo, then this was not ſo <hi>ill to him</hi> (in this ſenſe, of which now I ſpeak) as to have been irreſpectively reprobated, and never vouchſafed this Grace.</p>
               <p>§. 17. So when you ſay <hi>It is worſe in respect of God, and prove</hi> that <hi>becauſe he muſt be deprived of the free exerciſe of his omnipotence]</hi> there is no truth in that conſequence, or the reaſon of it. For Gods <hi>omnipotence</hi> conſiſts not in being able to make both parts of a <hi>contradiction</hi> true, that were in the very attempt a departing from veracity, a falſeneſs, a ſin, and ſo the greateſt <hi>impotence,</hi> and ſo moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>omnipotence.</hi> And ſuch is that, which alone your conſequence, and the reaſon of that ſuppoſes, making that not to be, which he foreſees will be, for by the latter part of that expreſſion you mean that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> from eternity he ſees to be done, and then to be done and not to be done, is <hi>in terminis contradictory.</hi> And this impotence or not being able to cauſe the ſame thing at once to be and not to be, is far from all notions of <hi>Stoical fatality,</hi> that I ever heard of (els ſure all rationall creatures muſt be <hi>Stoicks,</hi> for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103954:60"/>
they all reſolve that what is, cannot not be) and as far from making <hi>God an idle helpleſs ſpectator of what anothers will is pleaſed to effect:</hi> for his <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtence,</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> belong to other things, not to the making that not to be, when it is, but to the preventing it before it came, giving Grace ſufficient, preventing, reſtraining, exciting, &amp;c. ordering it and diſpoſing of it to his own wiſe ends, when it is done, and puniſhing the doer juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he repent not, to which he is alſo ready to give Grace, if he humbly <hi>ask,</hi> and <hi>ſeek</hi> and <hi>knock</hi> for it: All this is ſuppoſed to be done by God, and ſo God is no <hi>helpleſs ſpectator,</hi> and all this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with the effects being wrought by our free will, as long as <hi>Gods grace</hi> works not irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtibly.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Here I remember that of S. <hi>Auguſtin. de Civ. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>Nullo modo cogimur, aut retenta praeſcientia Dei, tollere voluntat is arbitrium, aut re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tento voluntatis arbitrio, Deum, quod nefas eſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare praeſcium futurorum,</hi> (this is expreſly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both to the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> pretenſion on one ſide, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> on the other.)</p>
               <p>§. 19. Your <hi>fourth inconvenience</hi> is, that <hi>then God never purpoſed to ſave all mankind.]</hi> If by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <note place="margin">The fourth.</note> you mean decreeing, and by ſaving, actually beſtowing heaven upon them, then that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is true, but not in the leaſt wiſe inconvenient, for God never decreed to ſave final impenitents, and ſuch are many of mankind, after the giving of Chriſt, but on the contrary, hath <hi>ſworn</hi> ſuch <hi>ſhall not enter into his reſt.</hi> The ſaving of mankind which God decreed is the redeeming them, and giving them Chriſt, and Grace, and making them <hi>ſalvable,</hi> and being deficient in nothing toward
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103954:60"/>
that end to thoſe, that will make uſe of it. As for the other notion of Salvation, it is no where ſaid that God <hi>purpoſed</hi> that in the notion of <hi>decreeing,</hi> but onely that he ſo <hi>will'd</hi> as to <hi>deſire</hi> it, and to give ſufficient means of effecting it, but thoſe means proportioned to rational agents, and ſo not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or <hi>irreſiſtible,</hi> or ſuch as ſhould, by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to freedome, exclude rewardableneſs.

being far from yielding, that praeſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth any other way, but this, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, <hi>point out</hi> any <hi>to damnation.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore changing that obſcurer for this other more perſpicuous phraſe, I ſay that Gods praeſcience of mens not making uſe of his call, is very reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the <hi>ſeriouſneſs of his call,</hi> which I inferr from Gods own words, and oath, <hi>as I live, ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of him that dyes, turn you, turn you, for why will you dye?</hi> what can be more ſerious then this ſpeech, directed to thoſe that dye, and he ſees, obſtinately <hi>will dye.</hi> But this differs widely from my <hi>warning him to take heed of falling, whom I ſee actually fall'n,</hi> becauſe whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God thus calls not to fall, the man is not fall'n: when he calls him to ariſe again, being fall'n, he is not irreverſibly fall'n, and therefore accordingly he calls him (not, not to fall, but) to riſe again. And what God thus doth in time, God <hi>ab aeterno</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to do, and his foreſeeing it would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the deſired effect, was in order of nature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the decree of doing it, and therefore is in no reaſon to have any influence on (ſo as to change) the decree, and if not ſo, then the decree ſtanding ſtill in force, it is moſt neceſſary that it ſhould be performed, and ſo that God ſhould in time call thus ſeriouſly to repentance.</p>
               <p>§. 21. And indeed, for God to <hi>foreſee</hi> (as he doth, or els would not puniſh for it,) that his moſt <hi>ſerious</hi> call will be <hi>rejected,</hi> and yet not to ſuppoſe his call is moſt <hi>serious,</hi> is an abſolute contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo cannot poſſibly be ſuppoſed or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>

your <hi>firſt,</hi> but <hi>ſecond</hi> queſtion, and ſo I allowed of it, as you ſee, and am not prejudiced by it. For to your concluding queſtion I anſwer expreſly, Chriſt look'd on <hi>Judas's not ſinning,</hi> or <hi>repenting,</hi> as <hi>poſſible,</hi> till by his repudiating all the means of Grace, and his <hi>meaſure of iniquity fill'd up,</hi> he withdrew his Grace from him, which whether he did before, or not till his death, I have no means of deſining. Onely this I reſolve, that Chriſts fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing what he would do, had no leaſt influence on the effect, any more then the <hi>effect</hi> hath on the <hi>cauſe,</hi> or the <hi>ſenſe</hi> on the <hi>object,</hi> Gods foreſight being in nature conſequent to, and cauſed by his doing it, not the cauſe of it. And when you ſay, that <hi>if it were poſſible, then the contrary was not certain,</hi> I grant it was not certain, till it was done, and when you inferr, <hi>then it could not be foreſeen,</hi> I deny the conſequence, for thoſe things which are not <hi>certain,</hi> till they are done, may by an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Deity</hi> be <hi>ab aeterno</hi> ſeen to come to paſſe in time, and ſo that ſight or foreſight be as certain, as a foreſight of what is moſt neceſſary in its cauſes: and the reaſon is clear, becauſe of that which is done, it is as certain that it is done, as of that which is <hi>in cauſis,</hi> it is certain, that it is <hi>in cauſis,</hi> and being ſo, it may caſt a reflexion on the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of him that is preſent to it, and ſo is God to <hi>futures,</hi> as well as to the <hi>preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 24, And when you ſay in your Poſtſcript, that <hi>it is a contradiction to ſay that things paſt or future</hi> are preſent, <hi>and therefore all things are not, nay cannot be preſent to God;]</hi> I anſwer, 1. that you uſe not the right definition of a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> in ſaying thus, for <hi>future</hi> doth not contradict <hi>preſent,</hi> but <hi>preſent and not preſent</hi> is a contradiction, and ſo
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103954:62"/>
                  <hi>future and not future;</hi> 2. although it be granted of any finite thing, that it cannot be both preſent and future, yet God being <hi>immenſe,</hi> may and muſt be preſent to that which is future, or els he is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and limited. Yet this doth not inferr God to <hi>ſee what is future as preſent</hi> (which you ſay <hi>is to be deceived)</hi> but to ſee what is future as future, which though indeed it be future, yet he by his <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity</hi> may be preſent to it. And none of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, which you add, follow on this; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let me tell you (on ſtrength of that Propoſition, <hi>Quicquid eſt neceſſario eſt id quod eſt)</hi> that as God cannot change what is <hi>paſt,</hi> ſo he cannot change that which is preſent, ſo as to make it, when it is <hi>preſent,</hi> not preſent, and then no more can he change that which is <hi>future,</hi> ſo as to make it not future. All that can be done is, either 1. to make that which is <hi>contingent</hi> (and ſo may be or may not be) to become <hi>neceſſary,</hi> by decreeing it; or 2. to come to paſs really, though but <hi>contingently,</hi> or els 3. not to come to paſs, or finally to leave it ſtill free, yet to foreſee what will <hi>freely</hi> be done, as much as what will <hi>neceſſarily</hi> be done.</p>
               <p>§. 25. So that you ſee the maxime which you miſlike, is not ſo much, that <hi>all things are preſent to God,</hi> i. e. repreſented to him <hi>ſub ratione prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentis,</hi> as this, that God by his <hi>immenſity</hi> is preſent to all things, and his ſight being as infinite as his being, this is as eaſie to be underſtood, as the other, or as any <hi>infinite</hi> is comprehenſible by our <hi>finite</hi> underſtandings, which you call <hi>duller apprehenſions,</hi> for ſo ſure are all ours, when we imploy them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>infinites.</hi> You ſee into what a length I am run, indeed much above mine own intentions, but ſhall not repent of it, if it contribute to the diſabuſing

               <p>§. 27. THough yours of—made haſt to me, yet I found no leaſure to afford it any ſerious reflections, till this—and therefore being already guilty of two long delayes, I ſhall not now encreaſe them by prooeme, but fall immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the view of your reply. And in it, what you firſt lay down, partly by way of <hi>conceſſion,</hi> partly by way of <hi>apology</hi> for your own Notion, partly by way of oppoſition to mine, I muſt confeſſe I ſee not what propriety of application it hath to that <note place="margin">The ground of our aſſertion Gods immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and the no implicancy of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Gods immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity extends to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> which was the ground-work of my Paper, <hi>viz: that whatſoever hath a being, or ever ſhall have a being, (which though by being future 'tis out of my reach, yet by being future, is not removed out of Gods reach,) is objicible to Gods all-ſeeing eye of knowledge,</hi> and this upon the grounds of his <hi>infinite unlimited immenſity,</hi> by you and by all Chriſtians acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103954:63"/>
and the <hi>no contradiction,</hi> (which alone renders it impoſſible to God,) which it implyes, for God thus to reach out immenſly, and ſee all <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> which (and in the manner as it) in time comes to paſſe.</p>
               <p>§. 28. In ſtead of ſhewing this <hi>implicancy of a contradiction,</hi> (which alone was to have been done,) you have tendred a reaſon to prove, <hi>[that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">An objection againſt that anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>God's knowledge is not properly ſaid to be immenſe, in regard he knowes all things poſſible,]</hi> viz: <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they</hi> conjunctim <hi>are not abſolutely infinite.</hi> But ſure this hath no force againſt my poſition, which doth not prove Gods immenſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <note place="margin">Gods immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſuppoſed not proved.</note> by this argument of his <hi>knowing all things poſſible,</hi> or by any other, but takes that for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and needing no proofe, and from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres and concludes the other, <hi>viz: his knowing all things paſt, preſent or future,</hi> and againſt this concluding 'tis viſible your reaſon is of no kind of force, <hi>[for that theſe</hi> conjunctim <hi>are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,]</hi> for an <hi>immenſe</hi> knowledge may and muſt ſee all <hi>finites,</hi> though it ſelf be <hi>infinite.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103954:65"/>
latter hath no ſuch negation of his <hi>power of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> but affirmes onely that he <hi>workes in a finite manner,</hi> (which he may do ſometimes, when there is no need of interpoſing his <hi>infinite</hi> power,) but not that he <hi>workes not ab aeterno,</hi> which the proportion, if it were obſerved, would exact, and then that would be as <hi>derogatory to his power</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>§. 37. The obſerving of this will I hope cleare to you that which you ſay is ſo <hi>ſtrange, it being but</hi> the ſame fallacy again in another dreſſe, (which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall no farther purſue,) or if the reaſon which <note place="margin">An eigth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> you add, from the <hi>temporarineſs of the creature, which</hi> ab aeterno <hi>had no being, ſave onely in mere poſſibility,]</hi> have ſtill any force with you, I hope it will ceaſe to have ſo, when 1. you conſider that an <hi>objective being</hi> is ſufficient to cauſe <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and that it's being in time is no hindrance to an <hi>immenſe</hi> Deity to ſee it <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> for if he may ſee it a day before it comes to paſſe, why may he not equally <hi>ab aeterno?</hi> 2. That <hi>futures,</hi> though contingent, differ from <hi>meer poſſibilityes,</hi> that which is <hi>meerly poſſible</hi> never coming to an actuall being, and ſo being not <hi>future,</hi> and of ſuch I ſhould erre indeed ſtrangely, if I thought God did <hi>foreſee</hi> them <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween poſsible and future.</note> as <hi>future,</hi> or ſee them as having an <hi>actuall</hi> being.

               <p>§. 38. You ſay this <hi>is no convincing argument, Gods underſtanding was infinite</hi> ab aeterno, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

§. 39. Having removed theſe rubs, which you ſay thus hinder your conſent, I ſhall hope you will yeild to as much as I pretend, which is not, you ſee, <hi>that God coexiſts to things that neither are, nor</hi>

               <p>§. 41. Secondly, when to your ſaying that <hi>all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> 
                  <hi>things paſt, preſent, or poſſible, are known to the divine wiſdom, I returned</hi> a parentheſis, <hi>[No man demands any more,]</hi> and you now reply, <hi>that I did not fully apprehend your meaning, which was that God knew all things poſſible, not as future,</hi> my rejoynder is, that I well diſcerned the difference betwixt <hi>poſſible</hi> and <hi>future,</hi> all things being not future, which are poſſible; Yet becauſe all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are poſſible, (though all poſſibles are not future,) I could not miſapprehend your words, which ſpake of <hi>all things poſſible,]</hi> in concluding that all futures were comprehended under that ſtyle of <hi>all things poſſible,</hi> for ſure <hi>futures</hi> are in that number, and then if all futures were intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to God, and by you granted to be infallibly known by him, this as I ſaid, was all I demanded. There is difference I conceive, betwixt <hi>poſſible</hi> and <note place="margin">Poſsible and meerly poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble differ.</note> 
                  <hi>meerly poſſible,</hi> all futures are <hi>poſſible,</hi> but what is <hi>meerly poſſible</hi> excludes futurity. Sometimes you ſpeake of <hi>meer poſſibilityes,</hi> and then I never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend you to meane <hi>futures,</hi> as, when you ſpeake of <hi>all that is poſſible,</hi> I am obliged to do.</p>
               <p>§. 42. Now then if you ſpake, or ſpeake of <hi>meer poſſibilityes,</hi> and ſay that God knew all things meerly poſſible, as meerly poſſible, and not as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you ſay moſt truly, but then your example
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103954:67"/>
of <hi>A. B</hi>'s <hi>future marriage</hi> is nothing to your purpoſe, for if it be conſidered as future, then though it be yet poſſible to be, or not to be, yet it is not <hi>meerly poſſible,</hi> for by being ſuppoſed <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> it is conſequent that it ſhall be, whereas what is <hi>meerly poſſible,</hi> ſhall never be. When therefore you ſay, <hi>both are known by God as poſſible,</hi> (viz: <hi>that he ſhall marry, and that he ſhall not,) neither as future,</hi> you deceive your ſelf, for though he ſees both as <hi>poſſible,</hi> yet he ſees one as <hi>future, viz:</hi> as contingently future, future when it might be otherwiſe, and the other as <hi>meerly poſſible, i. e.</hi> not future, ſees it, I ſay, as future, not by conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Scientia me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</note> or <hi>per ſcientiam mediam</hi> onely, in the ordinary notion of that, <hi>viz,</hi> if this be, that will follow, (for which ſcience there is place ſometimes in things <hi>meerly poſſible,</hi> and not <hi>future,</hi> as in the example of the Oracle concerning the men of <hi>Keilah,</hi> that if <hi>David</hi> truſted them, they would deliver him up, when yet he not truſting himſelf to them, they did not, could not deliver him,) but by reaching out ſo far as to ſee it done, in that other notion of <hi>Scientia media,</hi> whereby God ſees what man <hi>will freely do,</hi> and not onely <hi>conditionally</hi> what he <hi>might</hi> or would do.</p>
               <p>§. 43. Your following objections againſt this, <hi>that what is known as future, is certainly known will be, but</hi> A.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103954:68"/>
what it is, and as ſo, it is ſeen by God from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>§. 44. Thirdly, when I ſaid that the <hi>having no being in act, is a phraſe proportioned to the thing, and to our finite underſtandings,</hi> 'tis viſible. 1. That I ſpake of the <hi>phraſe,</hi> and nothing elſe. 2. That my meaning is, <hi>that to our finite underſtandings</hi> that is not preſent, or in act, which is ſtill future, but yet God by his <hi>immenſity</hi> may reach out, and be preſent to it, or ſee it, as wee do that which is before our eyes.</p>
               <p>§. 45. And when againſt my words you argue thus, <hi>[if it be proportionable to the thing, then it is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The third</note> 
                  <hi>alſo to Gods underſtanding which depends thereon,]</hi> 'tis plain again, that you miſapprehend mee, for I oppoſe Gods <hi>infinite,</hi> to our <hi>finite</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and not <hi>Gods underſtanding</hi> the thing, to the <hi>reality</hi> of it; God underſtands it, as it is, and ſo ſees that future, and contingent, which is truly ſo, (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t praeterita ea vera dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus quorum ſuperiori tempore vera fuerunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia,</hi>

                  <hi>ſic futura, quorum conſequenti tempore vera erunt inſtantia, ea vera dicemus,)</hi> but till it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be, God ſees it by his <hi>infinite ſcience,</hi> which by our <hi>finite</hi> we cannot reach.</p>
               <p>§. 46. Let it then be granted that <hi>Gods under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding depends on the thing,</hi> what followes thence? No more but this, that future contingents having yet no being in act, and therefore being not viſible to our finite faculties, have yet a being objective, as being really, though contingently future, <hi>and Gods knowledge being proportioned to the things,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on them as ſuch, <hi>i. e.</hi> as future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and not as actually being, theſe he knowes by his infinite knowledge.</p>

§. 47. But ſay you, <hi>his underſtanding can be no more actuall then the thing is from whence he derives that underſtanding,]</hi> what truth is there in this? I know what is <hi>paſt,</hi> my knowledge is <hi>actuall,</hi> but the thing <hi>past</hi> is not ſo; I know if the courſe of nature be not altered, (or, which as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is equivalent, I believe,) the Sun will riſe to morrow, here my <hi>knowledge</hi> or belief, is <hi>actuall,</hi> but the <hi>object</hi> is <hi>future,</hi> not yet actuall, ſave onely that it is now actually true, that the Sun will riſe then. And then why may not <hi>Gods knowledge</hi> be <hi>actuall</hi> either of what is <hi>paſt,</hi> or <hi>future,</hi> (and ſo now actually is not,) and yet he ſee it as it is, <hi>i. e.</hi> what is paſt as paſt, what future, as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>§. 48. Fourthly, when to my queſtion, <hi>[Why, if God ſees before, that which in after time hangs in the balance of humane indetermination, he may not alſo foreſee which end of the balance will at length overpoiſe?]</hi> You anſwer, <hi>that the foreſight of the former is the foreſight of poſſibles, but the foreſight of the other is the foreſight of a contingent future, and that the one is not as truly future, as the other,]</hi> you cannot but ſee, you do not render any anſwer to the queſtion, <hi>i. e.</hi> any reaſon why he may not ſee what is <hi>really,</hi> though <hi>contingently future,</hi> as well as that which is <hi>meerly poſſible?</hi> It is true, one is not as truly <hi>future,</hi> as the other, but what ſhew is there of reaſon, that what is leſſe future, or not future at all, ſhall be ſeen, and that which is <hi>future,</hi> and ſhall really be, ſhall yet not be ſeen by him that is <hi>Omniſcient?</hi> can it's no kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not ſo much as in <hi>futurition,</hi> ſet the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on that ſide, and make that moſt intelligible, which hath no being, and that leaſt, which hath?
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103954:69"/>
If it do, yet ſure it ſhall be no ground of reſolving that the really future is not at all, even to God <hi>foreſeeable,</hi> or that there is any contradiction in this, which if you remember was incumbent on you to prove, by that of <hi>hanging in the balance,</hi> &amp;c. but is not now attempted by you.</p>
               <p>§. 49. I proceed to your defenſe of your <hi>ſecond</hi>

Or is not Gods <hi>foreſight</hi> agreeable to what is?</p>
               <p>§. 50. But ſay you now, <hi>God that ſees all things as they are, ſees them as poſſible, not the one ſide of a contradictory propoſition as determinately true, and the other as aſſuredly falſe, for ſo he ſhould ſee them as they will be hereafter, but not as they are now,]</hi> I anſwer, 1. God that ſees them as they are, ſees them not onely as <hi>poſſible,</hi> but as <hi>future,</hi> for they are not onely <hi>poſſible,</hi> but <hi>future,</hi> 2.

How wide are theſe one from the other? 2. Then if you review that my ſecond anſwer, to which you make this reply, you ſhall ſee how little propriety it hath to it. It was this, <hi>Change the foreſight into ſeeing from all eternity, and then it is plaine, that God from all eternity may ſee that will never actually be, which yet is free for the agent to do or not to do, (and God ſees that to,) and ſo is poſſible every way, ſave onely</hi> ex hypotheſi <hi>that it will never be, and as the bare hypotheticall neceſſity is no abſolute neceſſity, ſo this bare hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical impoſſibility is no abſolute impoſſibility.</hi> To this your reply is, <hi>that though a bare ſuppoſition prove nothing, yet it being granted, it infallibly proves any thing neceſſarily concluſible from it.]</hi> You ſee now how little this is <hi>ad Iphicli boves,</hi> and yet, 3. If it were pertinent, it would not be for your advantage, for ſuppoſing, (as I alſo do,) that God ſees the thing as <hi>contingently future,</hi> free for the agent to do or not to do, it muſt by your rule neceſſarily follow, that the thing is <hi>contingent,</hi> and ſo not abſolutely neceſſary, or any other wayes, then that when it is, it cannot not be, which was all

What two things can be leſſe all one then theſe? and this the <hi>one purpoſe,</hi> for which the men, with whom you diſpute, do inſiſt on this ſubject, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt Gods <hi>foreſight</hi> and his <hi>decree.</hi> And therefore as you are very ſollicitous that your opinion ſhould be freed from the imputation of derogating from the <hi>Divine immenſity,</hi> and <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience,</hi> ſo at this time it concernes you to be as carefull, leſt you offend againſt Gods <hi>purity,</hi> and other attributes, when you make it all one for his preſcience to <hi>find</hi> and to <hi>render</hi> the object certain; <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſee all the ſins that wee commit, and to cauſe them.

§. 53. I proceed to your defenſe of the <hi>objected inconveniences</hi> againſt my anſwers to them. And firſt, it breakes no ſquare, whether <hi>[in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,]</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The defence of the objected inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> be inſerted, or omitted, 1. becauſe what is in it's <hi>cauſes</hi> utterly uncertain, is ſo in <hi>it ſelf.</hi> 2. becauſe you yeild to all I ſaid on this head as <note place="margin">The firſt.</note> rationall and convincing, and onely queſtion the truth of my <hi>principle,</hi> which you know I was not again to prove in that place, when I was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>objections,</hi> or <hi>inconveniences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 54. Your ſecond inconvenience I underſtood <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> before in the very ſence that your inſtance now ſets it, and accordingly I rendered anſwer to it, and ſhewed wherein it was that <hi>Exhortations,</hi> &amp;c. were founded, viz. <hi>in the liberty of our actions, ſo long as till they be actually committed, and no longer.</hi> And to this you give no anſwer at all, nor to ought I ſay on that head, but onely ſay over in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scheme the ſame thing to which I anſwered.</p>
               <p>§. 55. In this your new Scheme you ſay, that <hi>had it been known aforehand, that</hi> A. B. <hi>would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately have continued in his wickedneſs, it had been vain to have uſed exhortations, and ſo for God (ſuppoſing his preſcience,) it were vain to enjoyne them.]</hi> Here the word <hi>[vain]</hi> in the obvious notion imports unprofitable, or uſeleſſe, and then, 1. I pray conſider, whether it be fit to ſpeak thus <note place="margin">Preſcience makes not exhortations vain.</note> of God. It is certain Chriſt ſaw <hi>Peter</hi> would fall, <hi>Judas</hi> would betray him, yet he told them both of it before, and that telling them was a timely admonition, and equivalent to an exhortation, adding of <hi>Judas</hi> a terrible threat, or denunciation, <hi>that it was better for him, that he had never been borne.</hi> Would you think it tolerable for any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſay hereupon, it was vain, for Chriſt to do
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103954:71"/>
all this? I trow you would not, and therefore will your ſelf think fit to avoid it.</p>
               <p>§. 50. Should you have any ſcruple in this, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the paſſages, <hi>Rom.</hi> IX. referring <note place="margin">The example of Pharoah.</note> to it, would, <hi>à multò majori &amp; fortiori,</hi> ſuperſede or anſwer it. God had there foretold <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he <hi>would harden Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>heart,</hi> which I hope is much more toward inferring a neceſſity, then Chriſt<hi>'s foretelling Peter,</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> of the fall of the one, and treaſon of the other. And yet God exhorts <hi>Pharaoh</hi> after that, and he that objects againſt his doing ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> IX. that ſaith <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>Why doth he yet,</hi> (after that ſixt judgement, when God himſelf hath <hi>ſent his plagues on his heart, why doth he ſtill, or yet) find fault,</hi> is anſwered, <hi>Nay but, O man, who art thou, that diſputeſt againſt God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 57. In the former part of that ſtory, when it was not come to that height, yet it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that from the beginning of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s miſſion to <hi>Pharaoh, God had foretold that Pharaoh,</hi> would <hi>harden his own heart,</hi> and that (alone) is perfectly parallel to our caſe, which is of <hi>preſcience</hi> of future contingent acts of mans will, yet are all Gods meſſages and ſignes by <hi>Moſes</hi> purpoſely ſent to melt, and perſwade him to <hi>let the people go.</hi> Doth any man now want a perſpective to diſcerne that <note place="margin">Acts of Gods wiſdome not ſubmitted to our cenſure.</note> theſe meſſages of heaven were not <hi>vaine?</hi> Or that ſuch acts of Divine wiſdom, <hi>(his wayes, that are not like ours,)</hi> are not to be ſubmitted to our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall, but adored and reverenced, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe approached by us? But then,</p>
               <p>§. 58. Secondly, if by <hi>vain</hi> you meane no more, then that which doth not finally obtain the effect principally deſigned, ſo there will be no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in affirming with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>Gods grace</hi> and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103954:71"/>
ſo his exhortations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be <hi>received in vain,</hi> for ſo God knowes it is too frequent for us to do, mean while what thorow our default becomes fruitleſs to us, doth not returne ſo to God, but ſerves Gods <hi>ſubſequent,</hi> (though it reſiſts his,) <note place="margin">Gods antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent will.</note> 
                  <hi>antecedent will,</hi> which is alſo Gods will, <hi>viz:</hi> to puniſh the obdurate, as well as his antecedent is to ſave the humble and tractable, and the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the exhortations are, ſuppoſing grace an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to enable to make uſe of them, (as you know we ſuppoſe,) the more culpable is the obſtinacy againſt ſuch meanes, and the more culpable, the more juſtly puniſhed, and ſo Gods juſtice vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all aſperſion, and mans freedome aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And the exhortations, that have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all this, will not be deemed vain, though they attain not the fruit primarily intended, the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vifick effect or deſigne of them.</p>
               <p>§. 59. And whereas you compare this to a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallneſs of Gods acts not chargeable on him;</note> 
                  <hi>preſcribing a medicine, which he foreſees will do him no good.]</hi> I muſt ask by what meanes it comes to paſſe that that medicine will do him no good? By it's own inſufficiency or impropriety to the diſeaſe, or by the obſtinacy of the patient, that he will not take it? If by the former, I then acknowledge with you that <hi>Phyſician</hi> were <hi>vain;</hi> but that is no way applyable to God, whoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments are ſufficient, being <hi>the power of God to ſalvation to all that believe.</hi> But if it be by the ſecond onely, then the <hi>Phyſician</hi> is far from <hi>vain,</hi> as doing all that the wit of man can do, or wiſh toward the recovering of his patient. For he that will not uſe his recipe's, ſeemes bent on his own death, and as guilty of it, as he that cuts his own throat, and 'tis no diſparagement to the <hi>Phyſician,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:103954:72"/>
that when he is preſcribing remedies for his feaver or conſumption, he doth not cure his <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,</hi> or that he preſcribes to him, as to a wiſe man he would preſcribe, (though indeed the event be much other, then it would be in a wiſe man, but that is not the Phyſicians fault,) and as little can the vanity be imputed to Gods operations, when by our defaults onely they prove uneffectuall; God himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> V. appealing to us in the like caſe, <hi>what could he have done more to his vineyard which he had not done,</hi> when yet <hi>pro uvis labruſcas, inſtead of grapes it brought forth nothing but wild grapes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 60. In that place no doubt it was poſſible for God to have done ſomewhat which he did not, <note place="margin">Force not competible to a rational vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyard.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> to have forced the ground to bring forth good grapes, but to a vineyard interpreted there to be the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to a <hi>rational vineyard,</hi> and to that which was to be left in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardableneſſe, of doing and not doing, of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the dowry of the will of men and Angels, with which they were created, this was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible and therefore 'tis truly ſaid, <hi>God could do no more, then he did,</hi> or doth, (whatſoever the event be and be foreſeen by him,) and that is as contrary as is poſſible to the objection of <hi>vainneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 61. For the enforcing the <hi>third inconvenience, you ſay it ſeemes hard that finall impenitents ſhould</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The third.</note> 
                  <hi>from all eternity be reprobated, unleſſe conditionally,]</hi> never conſidering, what was moſt conſpicuous in my anſwer, that <hi>final impenitence</hi> it ſelf is that onely <hi>condition.</hi> When therefore you ſay, <hi>It were, as if a perſon ſhould be ſentenced to death for a fact before it be committed,</hi> you fall back into the two miſtakes, which my anſwer, if adverted to, had prevented. 1. You ſpeak of a perſon ſimply, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103954:72"/>
abſtracted from guilt, when I ſpeak of a <hi>final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, i. e.</hi> a perſon ſo very ill qualified, and fouly guilty. 2. I ſuppoſe his ſentence to be founded in his guilt, and his guilt, in order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſentence, but both of them in the mind of God, (who ſeeing his guilt, awards that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, adapts his revenge to that fact,) ſeen as paſt, before ever that ſentence goes out againſt him.</p>
               <p>§. 62. Here you ſay <hi>A. B's, Salvation was</hi> ab aeterno <hi>poſſible,</hi> (which I grant,) <hi>and thence infer, that God did not</hi> ab aeterno <hi>ſee his damnation as certain, but onely as poſſible.</hi> But I deny the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for he may ſee both his ſalvation and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as poſſible, and yet ſee one of them as onely poſſible, the other being alſo future, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, then <hi>onely</hi> or <hi>barely poſſible.</hi> Meane while nothing hinders, but what is, (and God ſees,) thus future, <hi>he might by his omnipotent power have prevented,</hi> (which yet, you ſay, by my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he could not,) onely then, he had not ſeen it as future, but as that which would have been, if he had not prevented it.</p>
               <p>§. 63. Again you ſay, <hi>that if God had infallibly foreſeen that</hi> A. B. <hi>living longer would unavoidably have fallen into ſin, and therein have perſevered till death, you verily believe, in regard of his goodneſs and love to mankind, not onely in generall,</hi> 1 Tim. II. 4. 2 Peter III. 9. <hi>But to</hi> A. B. <hi>himſelf,</hi> Ez. XVIII. 32. <hi>that God would take him away in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, aſſoon as baptized, when he was in the ſtate of grace and ſalvation.]</hi> In this proceſſe of yours, I wonder whence the word <hi>unavoidably</hi> came. For <note place="margin">Wilfull falls are not una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable.</note> I that according to your ſuppoſition, look on <hi>A. B.</hi> as one <hi>baptized,</hi> and in the <hi>ſtate of grace, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:103954:73"/>
can never grant that he <hi>unavoidably falls</hi> and finally perſeveres in ſuch ſin, as brings damnation; I grant he may fall, and that finally, but ſure not <hi>unavoidably,</hi> for by that grace he was enabled to ſtand, and if he fall, he falls <hi>willfully,</hi> but that is not <hi>unavoidably.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 64. And what if <hi>Godſees from all eternity that he will</hi> thus <hi>fall,</hi> doth that render his <hi>fall unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nor made ſo by Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> No, but Gods foreſeeing that he would fall willfully, when he had grace to ſtand, (which circumſtance he foreſaw, as well as the fall it ſelf,) muſt infer the quite contrary, that when he falls he might have ſtood, and ſo fell not <hi>unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 65. But then leaving out that unſeaſonable word, <hi>[unavoidably,]</hi> which in all reaſon you might have done, when in relation to the certitude of Gods preſcience you had ſaid, <hi>[infallibly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,]</hi> there will then be no ground of truth in that propoſition, no ſhew of proof of it from the <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>of God to all,</hi> or to any particular, as thoſe texts or any other expreſs it, for from none of thoſe it is rendred probable in <note place="margin">Gods love to mankind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages him not to prevent them by death, whoſe fall be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees.</note> any degree, that they which are baptized, and have <hi>ſufficient</hi> grace given them, and promiſe of <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> if they make uſe of it, ſhall have violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, or be taken out of the world, rather then they ſhall <hi>fall into wilfull ſin.</hi> Conſult the places again and you will ſoon find there is no propriety in them for the proofe of this.</p>
               <p>§. 66. And yet if even this alſo were true, it would no way incommodate our pretenſions, for <note place="margin">If it did, it is nothing to the caſe of preſcience here.</note> in that caſe of Gods taking away ſuch a man, in his infancy, it would follow by our doctrine, that God foreſaw that from all eternity, and ſo that he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103954:73"/>
foreſaw not <hi>A. B.</hi> a finall impenitent, which is the deſtroying and voiding your whole ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>§. 67. How then this ſeeming advantage could reaſonably incline you, to profeſs it your <hi>thought, that the doctrine of preſcience is very much incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the omnipotence and goodneſs of God,</hi> &amp;c. and that 'tis <hi>ſwallowed without examination,</hi> I now leave you candidly to conſider, by your reflexions on the ſtrength of that reed you laid this weight on. Judge I pray, might not God, if he would, have created a world of men, taken them up into heaven, and crowned them, (if crowning it could be called,) with everlaſting bliſſe, and ſo left none of them in the hazards of this world? Yet did not, (it is evident by the fact,) his love of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind oblige him to this, but men are left to vaſt dangers, and multitudes fall under them. Muſt all this now be imputed to Gods ignorance how all things would frame in the world in this other <note place="margin">Adams ſin foreſeen by God, yet not prevented.</note> courſe, which yet it appeares he hath choſen? The conſequences are too horrid to inſiſt on. Let us inſtance once for all in <hi>Adam,</hi> 'tis certain he fell, and in him all his poſterity, did not God foreſee or know this, till the effect told it him? Then how was Chriſt given <hi>in decreto divino,</hi> before the creation of the world? I hope you will not ſay he was not ſo given, when the Scripture is in many places ſo expreſſe for it, eſpecially, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> I. 4. and when Gods decrees are <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> and ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this, the foundation of all the reſt, of thoſe that concern our ſalvation, Yet can I as little imagine what elſe you can ſay, unleſſe you will forſake your hypotheſis.</p>

                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:103954:74"/>
§. 68. For if he decreed Chriſt before the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then he foreſaw there would be need of him, <note place="margin">Evidence that it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen,</note> if ſo, then he foreſaw <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and then why may he not have foreſeen all other mens ſins, all contingent future events, of which he is no more the author, and of which there is no more neceſſity <note place="margin">The ſame of all other ſinnes.</note> that the free agents ſhould act them, then there was that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ſin before he was created. I pray conſider this, and it will do your whole buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>§. 69. But let us examine your reaſons, by which you will approve your affirmation, that <note place="margin">That preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence derogates not from om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence.</note>

By his <hi>omnipotence</hi> it is certain, he might, by his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> (now revealed,) that he would not prevent it, by his <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> that from all eternity he knew he would not, by his very mercy to him, and for other moſt wiſe ends, that he would actually deliver him up to the wills of the malicious, <hi>able to deſtroy the body,</hi> but no more, which again is founded in his foreſight of their malice, and muſt ſuppoſe it. All which makes it as infallible, that God might have prevented it, as that he would not, did not, therefore this is far
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103954:74"/>
from <hi>derogating from his omnipotence,</hi> in this of his not being able to prevent it, the contrary to which is by this our Scheme expreſsly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

When you take it for mine <hi>acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> then, that <hi>God cannot change that which is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo as to make it not future,</hi> I anſwer, that <hi>ſenſu diviſo</hi> it is moſt falſe, for whatſoever is future, God can change, and make it not future, and then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee it not future. But if you meant <hi>Conjunctim,</hi> that remaining future, he could not make it not future, 1.

               <p>§. 76. In your concluſion that which I miſlike is not the word, <hi>[hypothetical]</hi> but <hi>[meerly]</hi> for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103954:78"/>
that ſignifies God to have no other foreknowledge but that. I doubt not but of all things that are, God foreſees, as <hi>Origen's</hi> words were, <hi>that if this be, that will follow,</hi> and ſo I deny not <hi>hypothetical foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> But I cannot confine Gods foreknowledge <note place="margin">Hypothetical. foreknowledg.</note> to this one head, for why may he not alſo ſee, (and as eaſily,) that this, and that will both be? The principall uſe of <hi>hypothetical foreknowledge,</hi> is in things <hi>meerly poſſible,</hi> which come not to paſſe, (as before I applyed the example of <hi>Keilah,</hi> which you now mention.) But what can that have to do with thoſe things, which do actually come to paſſe, and that meerly by the free will of man, and by no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of conſequences? Though, (as I ſaid,) even in thoſe, God that ſees them as they are, both in their cauſes, and moſt caſuall, or voluntary mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and progreſſion, and all circumſtances conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant, ſees one thing following, (though but freely, not neceſſarily,) out of another, firſt this, and then that, and becauſe this, or upon this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, therefore that; Which as it is far from aſſerting any neceſſary chain of cauſes, contrary to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of mans will, which in that very place <hi>Origen</hi> largely eſtabliſhes, ſo it is far from a knowledge <hi>meerly hypothetical,</hi> for that is not the knowledge of what is, but what will be, if ſomewhat elſe make way for it, which being uncertain, whether it will be or not, there can be no determinate knowledge, that the other will be, which is quite contrary to his inſtances of <hi>Judas</hi>'s <hi>betraying Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Which were as really and determinately foreſeen and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, as they were really acted. And therefore I muſt deſire you not to think this favourable to the <hi>Socinian's</hi> opinion of <hi>Gods foreknowledge of future contingents being onely or meerly hypothetical,</hi> (though
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103954:78"/>
God foreſee <hi>hypothetically,</hi> yet not <hi>onely</hi> ſo,) or that this key will fit all places of Scripture, which foretell things to come, becauſe it fits the caſe of <hi>Keilah,</hi> and <hi>Jer.</hi> 38, 17. and ſome few others.</p>
               <p>§. 77. I have the more largely inſiſted on this, becauſe it ſeemed ſo likely to miſlead you, there being ſome examples of foreknowledge meerly hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical, from whence yet to infer that <hi>Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> indefinitely, is meerly ſuch, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he hath no other, is the ſame errour as from particular premiſſes, or from one or two examples to make an univerſal concluſion.</p>
               <p>§. 78. On view of your fourth objected incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, you grant all I ſaid in anſwer to it, onely, <note place="margin">The fourth's</note> ſay you, <hi>the former difficulty ſeemes to recurre, how</hi> A. B. <hi>may be truly ſalvable, when if abſolute preſcience be granted, his damnation was as certain before he was borne, as it will be when he is in Hell.]</hi> I anſwer. 1. That in anſwer to objected inconveniences all that can be required of any man is, to ſhew that that inconvenience doth not follow, not to eſtabliſh the principal doctrine again, (which before had been done by the no implicancy of contradiction, which left it poſſible for God to foreſee future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents, and then by conſideration of his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which qualifies him to know every thing which is <hi>ſcibile,</hi> or the knowing of which implyes no <hi>contradiction,</hi> and then by the teſtimonies of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who from Gods preſcience foretold ſuch futures,) having therefore done all that was incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on me, I had hoped the difficulty would not ſtill have remained, when all I ſaid was granted. But ſeeing it doth, I anſwer, 2. That ſuppoſing <hi>Gods eternal preſcience,</hi> it cannot but as clearly appeare, that <hi>A. B.</hi> not onely may be, but is truly ſalvable,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103954:79"/>
whilſt he is <hi>in Viâ,</hi> as that he is damned, or no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſalvable, when he is in Hell. For ſuppoſing <hi>A. B. in viâ,</hi> to be one, for whom in Gods decree Chriſt dyed, and ſuppoſing Gods eternall preſcience of all that is, (unqueſtionably of all that he himſelf will do, as he ſure will all that is under his <hi>decree.)</hi> It muſt thence neceſſarily follow, that God foreſees him ſalvable, and ſuppoſing that at length he is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it doth but follow, that God foreſees him dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; Theſe two things then by force of <hi>praeſcience</hi> are equally cleer, that he is one while ſalvable, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while damned, and ſo they are equally certain, and if his having been ſalvable do not hinder his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damned, then neither will his being damned hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his having been ſalvable. He is truly ſalvable <note place="margin">Salvability of Judas as concluſible from Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> who God foreſees will not be ſaved. How ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God truly beſtows upon him all means ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, and that being all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make him <hi>ſalvable,</hi> this is as truly done, when the effect followes not, as when the meanes are moſt ſucceſsfull. And Gods preſcience of the ſucceſsleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, makes no change, hath no influence either on the meanes, or the man, any more then my ſeeing a thing done hath cauſality in the doing it. Now if he be ſalvable, (though in event he never be ſaved, but damned,) and Gods <hi>praeſcience</hi> that he is <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> be as efficacious to conclude him ſalvable, as his preſcience that he is damned, to infer him damned, what a palpable partiality is it to infer from preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that his damnation is certain before he is borne, and yet not to infer from the ſame principle, that his ſalvability was certain before he was borne? Nothing can more irrefragably prove the weakneſs of your inference, then that it is ſo obvious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort it.</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:103954:79"/>
§. 79. The ſhort is, that which is <hi>future</hi> onely <hi>contingently,</hi> it is certain that it is foreſeen by God, yet till it is, it may be otherwiſe, and if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, God ſees it to be otherwiſe, and what may be otherwiſe, is not certain to be ſo, and therefore his damnation is not certain before he is born, which is the direct contradictory to your inference, and that method which will equally infer contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of what force it is to eſtabliſh truth, I leave you to judge who propounded the difficulty.</p>
               <p>§. 80. Here then is the errour, becauſe God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in his foreſight, therefore you conclude from ſuppoſition of his preſcience, that the thing, which you ſpeake of, is certain, when yet it no way appeares to you or me, that God ever foreſaw it, but by our ſuppoſing that it comes to paſs. Hence then comes all the ſuppoſed certainty, from ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to come to paſs, which is the <hi>certitudo ex hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſi,</hi> a certainty that it is, as long as it is ſuppoſed to be, and then Gods preſcience hath nothing to do with it, but it would be as certain without ſuppoſing Gods preſcience, as now it is by ſuppoſing it. And now would you have me ſhew you how <hi>A. B.</hi> is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſalvable whilſt you retain your ſuppoſition that he is damned? This, if you marke, is your difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for you have no other ground to ſuppoſe that God foreſees him damned, but becauſe you ſuppoſe him damned, and ſeeing it is, you ſee what a taske you have ſet me, even to make two members of a contradiction true together. This I confeſſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, and I grant God cannot, yet thus much I will do for you, I will mind you, that even when <hi>A. B.</hi> is in Hell, the propoſition is ſtill true, that <hi>A. B.</hi> when he was on earth was <hi>ſalvable,</hi> and if it be true when he is in Hell, I appeale to you whether it be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103954:80"/>
not true, when God foreſees he will be in Hell, doth Gods foreſeeing him in hell impede more then his actuall being in it? If not, then notwithſtanding Gods preſcience, <hi>A. B.</hi> is ſalvable, and ſo now I hope you ſee both that, and how he is ſo.</p>
               <p>§. 81. In your fifth inconvenience, you ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here that <hi>you think it ſcarcely reconcileable with that</hi>

                  <hi>determinate preſcience which I hold, for God ſeriouſly to call thoſe whom he foreſees</hi> ab aeterno <hi>that they will not repent.</hi> But you take no heed to the place of <note place="margin">Gods ſerious call to thoſe who he ſees will die.</note> Scripture, which I demonſtrated it by, <hi>turne you, turne you, why will you dye?</hi> and, <hi>as I live, I delight not in the death of him that dyes,</hi> where it is evident, God ſeriouſly, (if an oath be a note of ſeriouſneſſe,) calls thoſe who dye and will dye.

               <p>§. 82. I ſaid, <hi>when God calls to a man not to fall, he is not fallen,</hi> and, you ſay true, <hi>but he is fallen in Gods preſcience.]</hi> I now ask you, how you know he is? Your onely poſſible anſwer is, that if he be fallen, then by the doctrine of preſcience, God muſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee him fallen, and you now by way of ſuppoſition, (which 'tis lawfull for diſputations ſake to make,) take it for granted, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuppoſe he is fallen. And then, (as even now I ſaid,) to your voluntary ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition all is due, and with that I cannot reconcile the contradictory, and ſo ſtill what is this to <hi>preſcience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 83. Again you conclude, <hi>that God ſees,</hi> A. B. <hi>will never riſe again,</hi> how do you know, or imagine God ſees it, but becauſe you ſuppoſe it true, that he will never riſe again? and if it be true, then it is alſo infallibly true, whether God ſee it or no. And ſo ſtill what have you gained, your ſuppoſing it true is it to which adheres the ſuppoſition of Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103954:80"/>
and infallibility conſequent to that, but that addes no weight to that which was before ſuppoſed infallible.</p>
               <p>§. 84. Again you aske, <hi>can God ſeriouſly call him, who [he ſees] will never repent, ſeriouſly do that he ſees uſeleſs, and abſolutely ineffectuall?]</hi> I have oft told you, and proved to you, that he may, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he called <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he had predicted he would not hearken, and he moſt ſeriouſly doth things to ſalvifick ends, which do not eventually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe ends, and he foreſees they do not.</p>
               <p>§. 85. I ſaid that what <hi>God doth thus in time, he</hi> ab aeterno <hi>decreed to do,</hi> this (as it is apparent by the antecedent, to which the relative <hi>[thus]</hi> belongs,) I ſpake of <hi>Gods calling men, ſome not to fall, others to riſe again,</hi> and you reply, that <hi>it ſeemes to you utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable that God ſhould do whatſoever he doth, by an antecedent decree.]</hi> I have no temptation to leave our preſent taske, which is ſufficient for the day, to diſpute that queſtion with you in the latitude, as your, <hi>(whatſoever he doth,)</hi> importeth. It will ſuffice, if God doth <hi>any thing</hi> by an antecedent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or decree any thing before he do it, for if <hi>any thing,</hi> then ſure his calls and warnings, which are parts of his covenant of grace, and that is <hi>ſub decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> decreed by him. And then what I ſaid before, is ſtill of full force, <hi>Gods foreſeeing mens diſobediences to his calls, was in order of nature poſteriour and ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to his decree of calling and giving them grace,</hi> and being ſo, cannot move him to change what went before, or preſently to diſannull it, and till it be diſannulled, 'tis certain, and exacted by veracity, that he act according to it, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he call thoſe <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> who yet he foreſees reſiſt him. Why you ſhould here farther inlarge, of the greater <hi>improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:103954:81"/>
                  <hi>that God ſhould without conſideration decree what afterward he perceives would be uſeleſſe,</hi> I gueſs not, being ſure no words of mine gave you tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to think that I affixt inconſiderate decrees to our God of all wiſdome, or counted thoſe calls <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi> which through our obſtinacy, (onely) faile of their deſigned good effect.</p>
               <p>§. 86. No more did I give you cauſe for that harſh-ſounding phraſe of <hi>Gods neceſſarily purſuing it, becauſe it was decreed.]</hi> I ſhould rather have ſuggeſted to you theſe words, inſtead of them, that God is <hi>faithfull,</hi> and juſt, and veracious, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes his part of the covenant of grace with men, howſoever they are, (and he foreſees them,) wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their own part.</p>
               <p>§. 87. What you ſay you underſtand not in my laſt papers, I thus explaine; thoſe calls of God which <note place="margin">Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of mans rejecting his calls and the criminouſneſs thereof a proof of the ſeriouſnes of them.</note> the obdurate reject, are moſt ſeriouſly meant by God to their reformation, elſe he would not puniſh them for rejecting them, as he doth by withdrawing them, &amp;c. This God decrees to do <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> which he could not, unleſſe he ſoreſaw their rejection of them, and yet neither could he foreſee their ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal rejecting them, unleſſe he foreſaw the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of them, and if he foreſaw that, then it is as certain as any thing, that God foreſees that they are ſerious, and although God do not actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puniſhment upon bare foreſight of ſin, yet ſure he may decree to puniſh thoſe whom he foreſees to deſerve it, and that is all that is neceſſary to my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing. Elſe I might tell you that God that accepts not a temporary faith, will never accept ſuch a man as is anſwerable to the <hi>ſtony,</hi> or <hi>thorny ground,</hi> (who in time of <hi>tryall would fall away,)</hi> though he ſhould be taken away before temptations approach.</p>

§. 88. In that of <hi>Judas,</hi> you grant <hi>that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Judas could not be fulfilled in another,</note> 
                  <hi>as terminated in him, could not have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, had he never been born, but then your quere remaines,</hi> ſay you, <hi>whether it might not have been fullfilled in another?]</hi> I anſwer, 1. it could not have been fullfilled in another, without ſome other diſciples doing what he did, and 'tis certain no other did ſo, and therefore what was foretold muſt have been fulfilled in him, or elſe, (which may not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of a divine Oracle,) had not been fulfilled. But then, 2. Chriſts words to <hi>John</hi> pointing out <hi>Judas</hi> for the Traitour, <hi>he that dippeth,</hi> &amp;c. was a prediction of God perfectly terminated in <hi>Judas</hi>'s perſon, and could not be fulfilled in any other, and ſo your new quere is anſwered alſo. And that gives you a farther reaſon, (if what was ſaid before to your ſecond quere were not ſufficient,) that our <hi>Saviours prediction</hi> was not <hi>conditional,</hi> but catego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically <note place="margin">Not conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> enunciative, <hi>verily I ſay unto you that one of you ſhall or will betray me,</hi> and he that <hi>dippeth, at that time</hi> when Chriſt ſpake it, deictically, <hi>i. e.

               <p>§. 89. In your view of what I ſaid to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion, you firſt inſiſt on <hi>my</hi> anſwer, that the event proved the denunciation againſt <hi>Iudas</hi> was not like that againſt <hi>Niniveh</hi> conditional, but I foreſaw the ſmall force of that, which I uſed onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and therefore added a ſecond, that the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iudas was of his ſin,</hi> as well as <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and the prediction of his <hi>ſin,</hi> could not be <hi>conditional,</hi> nor the prediction of the <hi>Ninivites</hi> puniſhment any way be applicable to it, leaving therefore the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, I adhered onely to this, which when you labour alſo to evacuate, by interpreting, <hi>[one of you will betray me,]</hi> by <hi>[unleſſe he repent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi>

That foreſeeing that he <hi>would be ſo diſpoſed, as unleſſe he repented he would betray him,</hi> is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of a future contingent. 3.

               <p>§. 90. But, ſay you, <hi>you ſee not why a conditional prediction may not be applyable as wel to the prevention of ſin, as of puniſhment,]</hi> I ſhall ſhew you why it may not, becauſe the puniſhment is Gods work, and for the averting of that there is force in the

               <p n="91">91. Now for defence of your Poſtſcript, and the contradiction which that charged on our hypotheſis, I pray marke the Iſſue of it. If you can prove that it implyes a contradiction for God to foreſee future <note place="margin">The iſſue of the whole que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether preſcience of contingents imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</note> contingents, then you certainly prevaile, as on the other ſide if you ſucceed not in this attempt, you muſt reſolve your opinion erroneous, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being impoſſible to God but to lie, and ſo to make good both parts of a contradiction, if preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bring not this conſequence, it muſt be poſſible to God, how inexplicable or unintelligible ſoever it be to me, who for want of <hi>facultatem analogam,</hi> cannot judge of the actions of an eternal God, and if it be yeilded poſſible, then the predictions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be proofes beyond queſtion of the truth of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103954:83"/>
it. To this one teſt then let us come. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction you aſſigned was, our ſaying, <hi>that things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are or may be preſent to God.</hi> I ſhewed you the definition of contradictoryes was not competible to theſe, of which <hi>eſt</hi> and <hi>non eſt</hi> is the known example, <note place="margin">The lawes of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and preſent and future are neither preſent and not preſent nor future and not future. And again in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions both parts muſt be conſidered in the <hi>ſame</hi> reſpects, whereas future being enunciated in reſpect of us, and our finite ſight, preſent is expreſt to be in reſpect of God, whoſe ſcience is immenſe, and infinite.</p>
               <p>§. 92. Now to this you reply, 1. <hi>That preſent and future, though they are not formal contradictions, yet really and in ſence they are, for future is that that is not preſent, but to come, and preſent and not preſent are formally contradictory.</hi> 2. <hi>That my conceſſion that no finite thing can both be preſent and future is enough for you, for God cannot be preſent to that which is not preſent to him.]</hi> I now anſwer to your firſt, that there is nothing ſo falſe, that I cannot make good by this your arguing. In particular, by this the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> were equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, <note place="margin">The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, holds equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Trinity, and unity.</note> for <hi>Trinitas</hi> in the wonted notion is not one, but three, and one, and not one, are formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory. This is the direct image and tranſcript of your arguing, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> yet I know you deny not the <hi>Tri-unus Deus,</hi> how then can you on no better proofe deny <hi>preſcience?</hi> The <hi>Socinian's</hi> conformably deny both, but you are partial, and deny but one of them. It is never ſafe to deſpiſe the ordinary rules of art, but ſeldome more dangerous then in this, whereas if Logick were duely revered in it's dictates, and nothing thought contradictory in ſence, but what is an affirmation, and negation
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103954:83"/>
of the ſame thing, this intricacy would be unfolded, and that which is future to me, be preſent to God, without the encumbrance or dread of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>§. 93. To the <hi>ſecond</hi> I anſwer, that it cannot ſuffice to your pretenſions, that no finite thing is both preſent and future, meaning, (as it is plaine I did,) in the <hi>ſame reſpect,</hi> preſent and future <hi>to me:</hi> When yet what is future to me, may be preſent to one that lives a year hence, and ſo much more to God who liveth for ever. When therefore in your proof you ſeeme to ſuppoſe me to <hi>hold, that what is future to me, is not preſent to God,</hi> you did miſtake me, for as I ſaid, that God being immenſe may and muſt be preſent to that which is future, or elſe he is bounded and limited, and ſo not immenſe, infinite, ſo I deemed that, which God is thus preſent to, to be objectively preſent to him, and ſo it was from all eternity, though to us it be not yet preſent, but fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that the other part of the definition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictoryes, if it had been adverted to, had ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded this part of your anſwer alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is the <hi>affirmation and negation of the ſame thing in the ſame reſpects,</hi> as here you ſee it was not, and ſo was not uſefull to you.</p>
               <p>§. 94. But ſay you, <hi>if all future contingents are and</hi> ab aeterno <hi>were all preſent to God, then they are all eternall.]</hi> I deny that conſequence, what is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and in it ſelf yet future, by it's objective pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to God, is not changed into <hi>eternall,</hi> nay even <note place="margin">What is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to God, is not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> that which really is, and ſo is really, (and not onely objectively,) preſent to him, is yet as far from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as Chriſt's body, by being united to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite divinity is from becoming infinite. This then was but a Sophiſme that you will ſoon ſee thorow.</p>

our miſery and guilt, the ſpirit of diviſion hath inſinuated it ſelf as well into our affections as our judgments; that badge of Diſcipleſhip which thou recommendedſt to us, is caſt off, and all the contrary wrath and bitterneſs, anger and clamor, called in to maintain and widen our breaches. O Lord, how long ſhall we thus violate and defame that Goſpel of peace that we profeſs? how long ſhall we thus madly defeat our ſelves, loſe that Chriſtianity which we pretend to ſtrive for? O thou which makeſt men to be of one mind in an houſe, be pleaſed ſo to unite us, that we may be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment. And now that in Civil affairs there ſeems ſome aptneſs to a compoſure, O let not our Spiritual differences be more unreconcilable. Lord, let not the rougheſt winds blow out of the Sanctuary; let not thoſe which ſhould be thy Embaſſadors for peace ſtill ſound a Trumpet for war: but do thou reveal thy ſelf to all our <hi>Eliah's</hi> in that ſtill ſmall voice, which may teach them to eccho thee in the like meek treating with others. Lord, let no unſeaſonable ſtiffneſs of thoſe that are in the right, no perverſe obſtinacy of thoſe that are in the wrong, hinder the cloſing of our wounds; but let the one inſtruct in meekneſs, and be thou pleaſed to give the other repentance to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Truth. To this end do thou, O Lord, mollifie all exaſperated minds, take off all animoſities and prejudices, contempt and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings, and by uniting their hearts prepare for the reconciling their opinions: and that nothing may intercept the clear ſight of thy truth, Lord, let all private and ſecular deſigns be totally depoſited, that gain may no longer be the meaſure of our Godlineſs, but that the one great and common concernment of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103954:86"/>
ruth and peace may be unanimouſly and vigorouſly purſued. Lord, the hearts of all men are in thy hands, O be thou pleaſed to let thy Spirit of peace overſhadow the minds of all contending parties; and, if it be thy will, reſtore this Church to her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſtate, renew her dayes as of old, let her eſcape out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> be ſo entire, that not an hoof may be left behind: But if thy wiſdom ſee it not yet a ſeaſon for ſo ful a deliverance, Lord, defer not, we beſeech thee, ſuch a degree of it; as may at leaſt ſecure her a being; if ſhe cannot recover her beauty, yet, O Lord, grant her health, ſuch a ſoundneſs of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as may preſerve her from diſſolution. Let thy providence find out ſome good Samaritans to cure her preſent wounds: and to whomſoever thou ſhalt commit that important work, Lord, give them skilful hands and compaſſionate hearts; direct them to ſuch applications as may moſt ſpeedily, and yet moſt ſoundly, heal the hurt of the daughter of <hi>Sion;</hi> and make them ſo advert to the intereſts both of truth and peace, that no lawful condeſcenſion may be omitted, nor any unlawful made. And do thou, who art both the wonderful Counſellor and Prince of peace, ſo guide and proſper all pacifick endeavors, that all our diſtractions may be compoſed, and our <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> may again become a City at unity in it ſelf; that thoſe happy primitive dayes may at length revert, wherein Vice was the onely hereſie; that all our inteſtine contentions may be converted into a vigorous oppoſition of our common enemy, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherly feuds into a Chriſtian zeal againſt all that exalts it ſelf againſt the obedience of Chriſt. Lord, hear us, and ordain peace for us, even for his ſake whom thou haſt ordained our Peace-maker, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>O Moſt gracious Lord, who doeſt not afflict willingly, nor grieve the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, who ſmiteſt not till the importunitie of our ſins enforce thee, and then correcteſt in meaſure, we thy unworthy creatures humbly acknowledge that we have abundantly taſted of this patience and lenity of thine. To what an enormous height were our ſins ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd ere thou beganſt to viſit them! and when thou couldſt no longer forbear, yet maſtering thy power, thou haſt not proportion'd thy vengeance to our crimes, but to thy own gracious deſign of reducing and reclaiming us. Lord, had the firſt ſtroke of thy hand been exterminating, our guilts had juſtified the method; but thou haſt proceeded by ſuch eaſy and gentle degrees, as witneſs how much thou deſiredſt to be interrupted, and ſhew us, that all that ſad weight we have long groaned under, hath been accumulated onely by our own incorrigibleneſs. 'Tis now, O Lord, theſe many years that this Nation hath been in the furnace, and yet our droſſe waſts not but increaſes; and it is owing onely to thy unſpeakable mercy, that we, who would not be purified, are not conſumed; that we remain a Nation, who ceaſe not to be a moſt ſinfull, and provoking nation. O Lord, let not this long-ſuffering of thine ſerve onely to upbraid our obſtinacy, and enhanſe our guilt; but let it at laſt have the proper effect on us, melt our hearts, and lead us to repentance. And oh, that this may be the day for us thus to diſcern the things that belong to our peace! that all who are (yea, and all who are not) caſt down this day in an external humiliation, may by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103954:87"/>
of thy mighty Spirit have their ſouls laid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate before thee in a ſincere contrition! O thou who canſt out of the very ſtones raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> work our ſtony flinty hearts into ſuch a temper as may be malleable to the impreſſions of thy grace, that all the ſinners in <hi>Sion</hi> may tremble; that we may not by a perſevering obſtinacy ſeal to our ſelves both temporal and eternal ruine, but inſtead of our mutinous complaining at the puniſhments of our ſins, ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. O be thou pleas'd to grant us this one grand fundamental mercy, that we who ſo impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thirſt after a change without us, may render that poſſible and ſafe by this better and more neceſſary change within us; that our ſins may not, as they have ſo often done, interpoſe and eclipſe that light which now begins to break out upon us. Lord, thy dove ſeems to approach us with an olive-branch in her mouth, oh let not our ſilth and noyſomneſs chace her away; but grant us that true repentance which may at one thee, and that Chriſtian charity which may reconcile us with one another. Lord, let not our breach either with thee or among our ſelves be incurable, but by making up the firſt prepare us for the healing of the latter. And becauſe, O Lord, the way to make us one fold is to have one ſhepheard, be pleas'd to put us all under the conduct of Him to whom that charge belongs; bow the hearts of this people as of one man, that the onely contention may be who ſhall be moſt forward in bringing back our <hi>David.</hi> O let none reflect on their paſt guilts as an argument to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, but repent, and to make their return ſo ſincere as may qualify them not onely for his but thy Mercy. And, Lord, be pleas'd ſo to guide the hearts of all who ſhall be intruſted with that great concernment of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103954:88"/>
this nation, that they may weigh all their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the ballance of the Sanctuary, that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not intereſt, may be the ruling principle, and that they may render to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and to God the things that are Gods; that they may become healers of our breaches, and happy repairers of the ſad ruines both in Church and State: and grant, O Lord, that as thoſe ſins which made them are become Nationall, ſo the repentance may be Nationall alſo, &amp; that evidenc'd by the proper fruits of it, by zeal of reſtoring the rights both of thee and thine Anointed. And doe thou, O Lord, ſo diſpoſe all hearts, and remove all obſtacles, that none may have the will, much leſſe the power, to hinder his peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſtitution. And, Lord, let him bring with him an heart ſo intirely devoted to thee, that he may wiſh his own honour onely as a means to advance thine. O let the precepts and example of his Bleſſed Father never depart from his mind; and as thou wert pleas'd to perfect the one by ſuffering, ſo perfect the other by acting thy will; that He may be a bleſſed inſtrument of replanting the power inſtead of the form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among us, of reſtoring Chriſtian vertue in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and almoſt barbarous Nation. And if any wiſh him for any diſtant ends, if any deſire his ſhadow as a ſhelter for their riots and licenciouſneſſe, O let him come a great but happy defeat to all ſuch, not bring fewel, but cure, to their inordinate appetites; and by his example as a Chriſtian, and his Authority as a King, ſo invite to good, and reſtrain from evil, that he may not onely releaſe our temporall, but our ſpiritual bondage, ſuppreſs thoſe foul and ſcandalous vices which have ſo long captivated us, and by ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our inward, provide for the perpetuating our outward peace. Lord, eſtabliſh thou his throne in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103954:88"/>
righteouſneſſe, make him a ſignall inſtrument of thy glory and our happineſſe, and let him reap the fruits of it in comfort here, and in bliſſe hereafter; that ſo his earthly Crown may ſerve to enhanſe and enrich his heavenly. Grant this, O King of Kings, for the ſake and interceſſion of our Bleſſed Mediator, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
