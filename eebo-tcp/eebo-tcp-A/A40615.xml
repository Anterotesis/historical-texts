            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>The King.</speaker>
                  <p>I would be ſatisfied by what power I am called hither? It is not long ſince that I was in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> How I came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſtory is longer than I I conceive fitting, in this place to declare; But I there entred upon a Treaty with both Houſes of Parliament, with as much publick faith, as it is poſſible to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any people in the World. I there treated with a number of Honourable Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and I treated honeſtly and faithfully with them; I cannot ſay, but they dealt very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with me; and we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo farr, that the Treaty was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven concluded. Now I would underſtand by what Authority, (I mean lawfull) I am brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There are many unlawfull Authorities in the world, as Thieves and Plunderers in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53423:9"/>
high-wayes. I would know by what Authority I was taken from thence, and carried from place to place, I know not where? When I have underſtood the lawfulneſs of the Authority, I will make my Anſwer: In the mean time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I am your King, your lawfull King; and weigh well with your ſelves, what ſins you heap on your own heads, and the anger and judgments of God which you will bring upon this land, I ſay ſeriouſly, weigh it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you further do proceed from one ſin to a greater. Therefore declare unto me, by what lawfull Authority I ſit here, and I will not refuſe to Anſwer you. In the mean time I will not betray my truſt. I have a truſt committed to me by God, by an ancient and lawfull ſucceſſion, I will not betray that by anſwering to a new and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53423:9"/>

more for the liberty of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then any of you, who pretend to be my Judges; and therefore I ſay, declare unto me, by what law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Authority I am placed here, and I will anſwer you; otherwiſe, I ſhall make no anſwer at all.</p>

Is this to bring the King to his Parliament? Is this to bring the publick Treaty to an end, by the publick Faith of the world. Either ſhow me your Authority eſtabliſhed by the Scriptures, which are the word of God, or confirmed by the conſtitutions of the Kingdome, and I will anſwer you.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53423:14"/>
in the name of the people, that you ſhould anſwer to your charge, that there ſhould be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thereon, as ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto Juſtice: you were then pleaſed to move ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples concerning the authority of this Court, and you deſired to be ſatisfied in your knowledge, by what authority you were brought hither: you ſeverall times did propound your queſtions, and it was often anſwered to you, that it was by authority of the commons of <hi>England</hi> Aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who did judge it requiſite to call you to an account, for the great and grievous crimes of which you are accuſed. After that the Court did take into their ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration, thoſe things which you objected, and they are fully ſatisfied in their authoritie; and do conceive it requiſite, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53423:14"/>
you ſhould admit it; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require that you give a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and a particular Anſwer to the charge exhibited againſt you: they do expect that you ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confeſſe it or deny it. If you ſhall deny it, it will be proved in the behalf of the Kingdome, the whole World doth approve of their Authority. So that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is ſatisfied, and you ought thereby to be ſatisfied your ſelf; you ought not therefore to waſte time, but to give your poſitive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>

ſomething to the Court; I will declare unto you their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>Sir, you ought not to interrupt, but attend whileſt the Court ſpeaks unto you. This Subject is not to be diſputed by you, neither will the Court per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that you ſhould object againſt the juriſdiction of it, they have conſidered of their juriſdiction, and do approve it.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I ſay, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England</hi> were never a Court of Judicature; and I would fain know, how they came to be made ſo now?</p>

               <p>THe Cryer according to the Cuſtome, having with his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes</hi> commanded ſilence and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the King being ſate, Mr. Atturney Generall turning to the Lord Preſident ſpake in theſe words,</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip: This is now the third time that by the great grace and favour of this High Court, the priſoner hath been brought to the Bar, and yet by reaſon of his refuſall to put in his Anſwer, there is yet no iſſue joyned in the cauſe. My Lord, I did at the firſt exhibit a Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, containing the higheſt practices of Treaſon, that were ever wrought on the Theater of <hi>England.</hi> That a King of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53423:20"/>
truſted to keep the Lawes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and who had taken an Oath ſo to do, and had tribute paid him for that end, ſhould be guilty of ſo wicked a deſign, as to ſubvert our Laws, and introduce an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and tyrannicall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſet up his Standard of Warre againſt his Parliament and his people, and I did humbly pray in the behalf of the people of <hi>England,</hi> that he might ſpeedily be required to make an anſwer to his charge.</p>
               <p>But my Lord, inſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an anſwer, he did then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the Authority of this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and your Lordſhip being pleaſed to give him a further day to put in his anſwer which was yeſterday, I did move again that he might be required to put in a direct and poſitive anſwer, to his charge, either by denying or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53423:20"/>
it, but he was then pleaſed to debate the Jurisdiction of the Court, although he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to give a poſitive anſwer.</p>
               <p>My Lord, by reaſon of this great delay of Juſtice, I ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly move for ſpeedy judgement againſt him. I may preſſe your Lordſhip upon the known Rules of the Laws of the Land, that if a priſoner ſhall ſtand in contempt &amp; not plead guilty or not guilty to the charge given againſt him, it by an implicite confeſſion ought to be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> as I may inſtance in divers who have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more favor than the priſoner at the Bar hath done. But I ſhall preſſe upon the whole fact. The Houſe of Commons, the Supream Authority of the Kingdome have declared, (my Lord) that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious. The matter of the charge is true, and clear as chryſtall, or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53423:21"/>
as the Sun that ſhineth at Noon day, in which my Lord Preſident, if your Lordſhip and the Court be not ſatisfied, I have ſeverall witneſſes on the behalf of the people of <hi>England</hi> to produce, and therefore I do humbly pray, and not ſo much I, as the innocent blood that hath been ſhed, the cry whereof is great for Juſtice and Judgement, that ſpeedy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be pronounced againſt the priſoner at the Bar.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident,</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you have heard what hath been moved by Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> on the behalf of the Kingdome againſt you. Sir, you may well remember, and if you do not, the Court cannot forget the delayes which you have made. You have been pleaſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome Queſtions, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply you have had your reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on them, you have been often
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53423:21"/>
told that the Court did affirm their own Jurisdiction; and that it was not for you nor any other man to diſpute the Jurisdiction of the higheſt Authority of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from which there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, and touching which there muſt be no diſpute; yet you did deport your ſelf in that manner, that you gave no obedience, nor did acknowledge any Authority either in them, or the Supream Court of Parliament, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted this high Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Sir, the Court gives you to underſtand that they are very ſenſible of theſe demurres, and that being thus authoriſed by the High Court of <hi>England,</hi> they ought not to be trifled withall, eſpecially, ſeeing if they pleaſe, they may take advantage of theſe delayes, and according to the rules of Juſtice, proceed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53423:22"/>
Judgement againſt you. Nevertheleſſe they are ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as to give directions to me, and therefore on their behalf I do require you to make a poſitive anſwer to this charge, that hath been read againſt you. Juſtice knows no reſpect of perſons. You are to give your poſitive and final Anſwer in plain Engliſh, whether guilty or not guilty, of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon laid to your charge.</p>
                  <p>The King having meditated a little, did anſwer in theſe words. When I was here yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, I deſired to ſpeak for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people of <hi>England</hi>: I deſire yet to know, whether without interruption, I may ſpeak freely, or not?</p>

                  <p>Sir, on the like Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, you had yeſterday the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this Court; you were told that having a charge of ſo high a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53423:22"/>
nature againſt you, your work was to acknowledge the Jurisdiction of the Court, &amp; to anſwer the charge; after you have done that you ſhall be heard at large to make the defence you can for your ſelf; but Sir the Court commands me to make known unto you, that you are not permitted to run into any other diſcourſes, untill ſuch time that you have returned a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Anſwer to the matter that is charged upon you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King,</speaker>
                  <p>I value not the charge a ruſh: It is the Liberty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> that I ſtand for. For me who am your King, and ſhould be an example to all the Courts in <hi>England,</hi> to uphold Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and maintain the old Laws; for me I ſay, to acknowledge a new Court, that I never heard of before, is a thing that I know not how to do. You did
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53423:23"/>
ſpeak very well on the firſt day I came hither, concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations that I have laid upon me by God, for the maintenance of the Liberties of my people. I do acknowledge that I do ow the ſame obligations to God and my people, to defend as much as in me lies, the ancient Laws of the Kingdom: therefore untill I be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that this is not againſt the fundamentall Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I can put in no particulars to the Charge. If you will give me time, I will ſhew you my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherefore I cannot do it, and <hi>Here being interrupted,</hi> he ſaid. By your favour you ought not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt me. How I came here I do not know. There is no Law to make your King your priſoner. I was in a Treaty upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith of the Kingdome, that was the known —two Houſes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53423:23"/>
of Parliament, that was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the Kingdome, and when I had almoſt made an end of the Treaty; I was hurried away, and brought hither; and therefore I would —</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53423:24"/>
can be known by their actions, you have written your intentions in bloody Characters throughout the whole Kingdome: But Sir, you are to underſtand the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Court—Clerk, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord the Default—. And Gentlemen, you that are a guard to the Priſoner, take him back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

               <p>SIlence being commanded by the Cryer, the Court was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and Serjeant <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> the Lord Preſident, was that day in a ſcarlet Gown. There were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that day, ſixty and eight Members of the Court.</p>
               <p>The King, turning to the Lord <hi>Preſident,</hi> ſaid; I ſhall deſire to be heard ſome few words, and I hope I ſhall give no occaſion of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>

                  <p>If it pleaſe you Sir, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be heard; and I ſhall not give any occaſion of interruption, and it is onely in a word. A ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Judgment—</p>

                  <p>Sir, you ſhall be heard (as I have told you) in due time, but you muſt hear the Court firſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>What I am to ſpeak will be in order, as I conceive, to what I believe the Court will ſay, and therefore Sir, I deſire to be heard, A haſty judgement is not ſo ſoon recalled.</p>

                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you ſhall be heard before Judgment be given, and in the mean time, you ought to forbear.</p>

                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Well Sir, I ſhall be heard before the Judgment be given.</p>

                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Gentlemen, It is well known to all, or the greateſt part of you here preſent, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonner at the Bar hath been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times convented, and brought before this Court, to make anſwer to a charge of Treaſon, and other high crimes, exhibited againſt him, in the Name of the People
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53423:26"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> to which charge being oftentimes commanded to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; he hath been ſo far from ſubmitting to the Court, as he hath undertook to object again, and diſpute the Authority of this Court, and of the High Court of parliament, who conſtituted this Court to Try and Judge him; but being over-ruled in that, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make anſwer; he was ſtill pleaſed to perſevere in his contumacy, and refuſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to anſwer; whereupon the Court that they may not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to themſelves, and to the truſt repoſed in them; nor that any mans wilfulneſſe ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the courſe of Juſtice; have conſidered of the contempt, and of that conſequence which in law doth ariſe on that contempt. They have likewiſe conſidered of the notoriouſneſſe of the Fact
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53423:27"/>
charged upon the priſoner, and upon the whole matter are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and have agreed upon a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be now pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but in regard he hath deſired to be heard before Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be read and pronounced, the Court is reſolved to hear him: yet Sir, thus much I muſt tell you before hand, of which alſo you have been minded at the other Courts, that if what you are to propoſe ſhall tend to diſpute the juriſdiction of the Court, you are not to be heard therein: you have offered it formerly, and you have indeed ſtruck at the root, which is the power and ſupream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> of which this Court will admit no debate; and indeed it would be an unreaſonable thing in them ſo to do, being a Court which doth act upon that Authority, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53423:27"/>
they have received from them; they will not preſume to judge upon their Superiours, from whom there is no appeal. But Sir, If you have any thing to ſay in defence of your ſelf, concerning the matter with which you are charged; the Court hath given me command to let you know, they will hear you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Since I perceive, you will not heare any thing of Debate concerning that which I confeſſe, I thought moſt materiall for the peace of the Kingdome, and the Liberty of the Subject; I ſhall wave it, and ſpeak nothing of it, onely I muſt tell you, that theſe many dayes all things have been taken from me, but that which I call more deer unto me, than my life, which is my Conſcience and my Honour; and if I had reſpect to my life more than to the peace
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53423:28"/>
of the kingdome &amp; the liberty of the Subject; I ſhould certainly have made a particular defence for my ſelf, for by that at leaſt I might have deferred an ugly Sentence, which I expect to paſſe upon me. Therefore undoubtedly; Sir, as a man that hath ſome underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome knowledge of the world if that my true zeal to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, had not over born the care of my own preſervation, I ſhould have gone another way to work then now I have done. Now, Sir, I conceive that a haſty Sentence once paſſed may ſooner be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then revoked; and truly the ſame fervent deſire I have for the peace of the Kingdome, and the liberty of the Subject, more then my own particulars, doth make me now at laſt move that, having ſomthing to ſay concerning both, I may be heard before my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53423:28"/>
be pronounced, before the Lords and Commons in the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chamber. This delay cannot be prejudiciall to you whatſoever I ſhall utter. If I ſpeak not reaſon thoſe that hear me, muſt be my Judges; but if it be Reaſon, and really for the welfare of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; I am ſure of it, it will be well worth the hearing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conjure you, as you love that which you pretend (I hope it is reall) the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject &amp; the peace of the kingdom, that you will grant me the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Sentence be paſt. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire this, that you will take this into your conſideration. It may be you have not heard of it before hand. If you think well of it, I will retire, and you may think of it; but if I cannot get this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; I do here proteſt, that ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53423:29"/>
fair ſhews of liberty and peace are but pure ſhews and no otherwiſe, if in this you will not hear your King?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you have now ſpoken?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>And this which you have ſpoken, is but a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of the Juriſdiction of this Court, which is the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you were limited before.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray excuſe me Sir, for my interruption, becauſe you do miſtake me. It is not a declining of it, you do judge me before you hear me ſpeak; I ſay, I will not, I do not decline it; although I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acknowledge the juriſdiction of it. In this, give me leave, to ſay that though I would not, though I did not acknowledge it in this; yet I proteſt, this is not to decline it, ſince I ſay, If that which I ſhall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53423:29"/>
propound be not for the peace of the Kingdome and the Liberty of the Subject, then the ſhame is mine. Now I deſire that you will take this into your conſideration; if you will, I will withdraw.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, This is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new, that you have offered unto us, I ſay, it is not altogether new unto us, although it be the firſt time, that in perſon you have offered it to the Court. Sir, you ſay, you do not decline the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Court.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Not in this that I have ſaid.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>I underſtand you well enough Sir, Nevertheleſſe, that which you have propounded ſeems to be contrary to what you have ſaid, for the Court are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to proceed to Sentence: It is not (as you ſay) that they will not hear their King: For they have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53423:30"/>
been ready to hear you, they have patiently waited your pleaſure for three Court dayes together to hear what you would anſwer to the peoples charge againſt you; to which you have not vouchſafed to give any anſwer at all. Sir: this doth tend to a further delay, and truly Sir, Such delays as theſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may the kingdom nor Juſtice admit: You have had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of three ſeveral dayes to have offered in this kinde, what you were pleaſed to have propounded to the Lords and Commons. This Court is founded upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in whom reſteth the Suprem Juriſdiction: That which you now tender to the Court, is to be tryed by another juriſdiction, a co-ordinate juriſdiction, I know very well, how you have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your ſelf, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53423:30"/>
what you would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, yet nevertheleſs, you would proceed on here; I did hear you ſay ſo: but Sir, That which you would offer there, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, muſt needs be in delay of Juſtice here; ſo as if this Court be reſolved and prepared for the Sentence, they are bound in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice not to grant that which you ſo much deſire; but Sir, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your deſire, and becauſe you ſhall know the full pleaſure of the Court upon that, whileſt you have moved, the Court ſhall withdraw for a time.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Shall I withdraw?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you ſhall know the pleaſure of the Court preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Court withdraws for half an hour into the Court of Wards. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Arms, the Court gives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53423:31"/>
that the priſoner withdraw, and that about half an hour hence the priſonner be returned again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The time being expired, the Court returned, and the Lord</hi> Preſident <hi>commanded the Serjeant at Arms to ſend for his priſonner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King being come attended with his Guard, The Lord <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> ſaid unto him, Sir, you were pleaſed to make a motion here to the Court, concerning the deſire you had to propound ſomething to the Lords and Commons in the Painted Chamber, for the peace of the Kingdome. Sir, you did in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect receive an Anſwer before the Court adjourned. Truly Sir, their adjournment and withdrawing was <hi>pro formâ tantum,</hi> for it did not ſeem to them, that there was any difficulty in the thing; they have conſidered of what you mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and have conſidered of their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53423:31"/>
own Authority, which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as it hath been often ſaid, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſupream Authority of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> aſſembled in Parliament. The Court doth act according to their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Sir, I have received an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Order from the Court, to acquaint you, that they have been too much delaied by you already, and that this which you have now offered, hath occaſioned ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further delay; they are Judges appointed by the higheſt Judges, and Judges are no more to delay than they are to deny juſtice; they are good words in the old Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>England, Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus, nulli deferremus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitium</hi>; There muſt be no delay, but Sir, the Truth is, and ſo every man here obſerves it. That you have much delayed them by your contempt and default; for which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53423:32"/>
they might long ſince have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to judgment againſt you; therefore notwithſtanding, what you have offered, they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to proceed to puniſhment &amp; to judgment; and this is their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animous reſolution.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I ſee it is in vain for me to diſpute, I am no Sceptick to doubt, or to deny the power that you have: I do know that you have power enough. Sir, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I do believe it would have been advantagious to the peace of the Kingdome, if you would have been pleaſed to take the pains to ſhow the lawfulneſſe of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. As for this delay, which I have deſired, I do confeſſe, it is a delay, but it is a delay that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant for the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: It is not my perſon, that I look on alone: It is the welfare of the Kingdome, the peace of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53423:32"/>
kingdome. It is an old ſaying, that we ſhould think on long, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form great matters ſuddainly. Therefore, Sir, I do ſay again, I do put at your doores, all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of a haſty Sentence. I have been here now a full week, this day eight daies, was the day in which I made in this place, my firſt appearance; The ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite but of a day or two longer, may give peace unto the Nation; whereas an haſty judgement may bring ſuch a perpetual trouble &amp; inconvenience upon it, that is, the childe unborn may repent it. And therefore once more, out of the duty I ow to God, and to my Country, I do deſire that I may be heard by the Lords and Commons in the painted Chamber, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place that you will appoint me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you have been
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53423:33"/>
already anſwered to what you have moved, it being the ſame motion which you made before, for which you have had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and the judgment of the Court in it; and the Court would now be ſatisfied from you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have any more to ſay for your ſelf than you have yet ſaid, before they proceed to Sentence?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay this Sir, that if you will but hear me, and give me this delay, I doubt not, but I ſhall give ſome ſatisfaction to all that are preſent, and to my people that are abſent; and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you, as you will anſwer it at the dreadfull day of judgement, that you will, once again take it into your conſideration.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I have received Inſtructions from the Court.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Well Sir,</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>If this muſt be rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53423:33"/>
or any thing of this nature, your anſwer muſt be the ſame, as it was before, and they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Sentence if you have no more to ſay?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I have nothing more to ſay, onely I deſire that this may be entered what I have ſaid.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>The Court Sir, then hath ſomething elſe to ſay to you, which although I know will be very unwelcome; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they are reſolved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their duty.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you have ſpoken very well of a pretious thing, that you call a peace; and it were much to be wiſhed that God had put it into your hart, that you had as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally endeavoured, and ſtudied the peace of the kingdom, as in words you ſeem to pretend; but as the other day, it was repreſented to you, that actions muſt expound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53423:34"/>
Your actions have been clean contrary, and truly ſir, it doth appear very plainly to the Court, that you have gone upon very erronious principles. The kingdome hath felt it to their ſmart, and it will be no comfort to you, to think of it; for ſir, you have been heard to let fall ſuch language, as if you had not been ſubject to the law, or that the law had not been your ſuperiour. The Court is very ſenſible of it: I hope, ſo are all the underſtanding people of <hi>England.</hi> That the law is your ſuperiour: you ought to have ruled according to the law, you ought to have done ſo, and your pretence hath been, that you have done ſo: But ſir, the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, who ſhall be the expoſitors of the law, whether you and your party out of the Courts of Juſtice ſhall take upon you to expound
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53423:34"/>
the law? Or whither the Courts of Juſtice ſhall be the expounders themſelves? nay this ſoveraign and high Court of Juſtice, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England,</hi> who may be well be obliged to be the higheſt expounders of the law, ſince they are the ſole makers of it. Sir, for you to ſet your ſelf with your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle judgment, or for thoſe who adhear unto you, to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the higheſt Court of Juſtice, there is no law for it? Sir, as the law is your ſuperior, ſo tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is ſomething that is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the law, which is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or Author of the law, and that is the people of <hi>England</hi>: For as they are thoſe who at firſt (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries have done) did choſe unto themſelves this form of Government, that juſtice might be adminiſtred and the peace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: ſo they gave laws unto
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53423:35"/>
their Governours, according to which they were to govern; and if thoſe laws ſhould have proved inconvenient or prejudiciall to the publick, they had a power in them reſerved to themſelves to alter, as they ſhould finde cauſe.</p>
                  <p>It is very true, what ſome of your ſide have alledged; <hi>Rex non habet parem in regno.</hi> This Court will affirm the ſame in ſome ſenſe, that whileſt King, you have not your peer; for you are <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor ſingulis,</hi> but they will aver again, that you are <hi>minor uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſis</hi>; and the ſame Author tells you that <hi>in exhibitione juris,</hi> you have no power, but they are <hi>quaſi minimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This we know to be law, <hi>Rex habet ſuperiorem Deum &amp; legem, etiam &amp; Curiam,</hi> and ſo ſayes the ſame Author; and he makes bold to proceed further; <hi>Debent ei frae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53423:35"/>
ponere,</hi> they ought to bridle him. We know very well the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of old: we cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe wars that were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Barons wars, when the Nobility of the land did ſtand out for the liberty and the propriety of the ſubject, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Kings that did invade their liberties to play the tyrants, but did call them to an account for it, and did <hi>fraenum ponere.</hi> But ſir, If the Nobility of the land, do forbear to do their duty now, and are not ſo mindfull of their own honour and the kingdoms good, as the Barons of <hi>England</hi> of old have been; certainly, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England</hi> will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of what is requiſite for their preſervation and their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Juſtitiae fruendi cauſa Reges conſtituti ſunt.</hi> By this we learn that the end of having Kings or
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53423:36"/>
Governours, is for their enjoying of juſtice, that is the end. Now ſir, If the King will go contrary to that end, or if any governour will go contrary to the end of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he muſt underſtand, that he is but an Officer in truſt, and that he ought to diſcharge that truſt, and order is to be taken for the animadverſion and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch an offending Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>Sir, This is not a law of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (ſince the time of the diviſion betwixt you and the Parliament) but it is a law of old; And we know very well both the Authors and the Authorities that acquaint us what the law was in that point on the election of Kings, when they took their Oath to be true unto the people; and if they did not obſerve it, there were thoſe remedies inſtituted which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53423:36"/>
Parliaments. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were they that were to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge (the very words of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, the plaineneſſe and wrongs done by the King and Queen, or by their children; ſuch wrongs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when the people could have no where elſe a remedy. Sir, this is the Caſe of the people of <hi>England,</hi> they could not have their remedy elſe where but in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Sir, Parliaments were inſtituted for that intent, it was their main end, that the grievances of the people might be redreſſed, and truly, if the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had been rightly mindfull of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they were never more in Majeſty or State, than in the time of the Parliament: but how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull ſome have been, Hiſtories have informed us; and we our ſelves have a miſerable, a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53423:37"/>
and a ſad experience of it.</p>
                  <p>Sir, by the old Laws of <hi>England</hi> (I ſpeak theſe things the rather to you, becauſe you were pleaſed to affirm the other day, that you thought you had as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the law as moſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>England.</hi> It is very well, Sir; and truly ſir, it is very fit for the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the laws, under which they muſt live, and by which they muſt be governed; And then Sir, the ſcripture ſaies, they that know their Maſters will and do it not; you know what follows, the law is your Maſter, the acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) the Parliaments were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to be kept twice in the year, as we finde in our old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that the Subject upon any occaſion might have a remedy and a redreſſe for his grievance. Afterwards by ſeveral acts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53423:37"/>
in the dayes of your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor <hi>Edward</hi> the third; they were to be but once a year. What the Intermiſſion of parliaments in your times hath produced, is very well known, and the ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it; as alſo what in the interim inſtead of parliaments, there hath been by you, by a high and arbitrary hand introduced upon the people. But when God by his providence had ſo farre brought it about, that you could no longer decline the calling of a parliament, a parliament was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, where it may appear what your ends were againſt your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and native Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but this parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> not ſerving your turn againſt them, you were pleaſed to diſſolve it. Not long after, another great neceſſity occaſioned the calling of this parliament, and what your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53423:38"/>
Deſigns and Indeavours all along have been for the cruſhing and confounding of it, hath been moſt notorious to the whol kingdom. And truly Sir, in that you did ſtrike at all, It had been a ſure way to have brought about that which this <hi>Charge</hi> doth lay upon you; your intention to ſubvert the fundamental laws of the land, for the great Bulwarks of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples liberty, is the parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and to ſubvert and root up that, which your aim hath been to do, would certainly at one blow, have confounded the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the properties of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, It makes me to call to minde (I cannot forbear to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it) for ſir, we muſt deale plainly with you according to the merits of your Cauſe, for ſo is our Commiſſion, It makes me, I ſay, to call to mind what I have read of a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53423:38"/>
great Roman Emperor, a great Roman Tyrant, I may call him, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi> by name, who wiſhed that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had but one neck, that at one blow he might cut it off: Your proceedings have been ſomething like to this, the people of <hi>England</hi> have been and are no where elſe to be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but in parliament; and could you have but confounded that, you had at one blow cut off the neck of <hi>England</hi>: But God hath reſerved better things for us, and hath been pleaſed to break your forces and to overthrow your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and to bring your perſon into cuſtody, that you might be anſwerable unto juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Sir, we know very well, that it is a queſtion which hath been much preſſed by your ſide, <hi>By what preſidents we ſhall proceed.</hi> Truly ſir, for preſidents, I ſhall
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53423:39"/>
not at this preſent make any long diſcourſe on that ſubject; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, I ſhall acquaint them that it is no new thing to cite preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents all moſt out of all Nations, where the people (when power hath been in their hands) have not ſticked to call their Kings to an account, and where a change of Government hath enſued upon the occaſion of the Tyranny and miſgovernment of thoſe that have been placed over the people. I will not waſte time, to mention <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> or any other country; Volumnes may be written of it: But truly ſir, that preſident of the kingdom of <hi>Arragon</hi> hath by ſome of us been thought upon. The ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of <hi>Arragon,</hi> is as a man <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in medio poſitus,</hi> it is placed between the people of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and the king of <hi>Spain</hi>; ſo that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53423:39"/>
if wrong be done by the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the juſtice of <hi>Arragon</hi> hath power to reform that wrong and he is acknowledged, the Kings ſuperiour; and bring the grand priſoner of the priviledges, and liberties of the people; he hath proſecuted againſt the Kings for their miſgovernment.</p>
                  <p>Sir, What the Tribunes were heretofore to <hi>Rome,</hi> and what the <hi>Ephori</hi> were to the State of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> we ſufficiently know, they were as the parliament of <hi>England</hi> to the Engliſh State: and though <hi>Rome</hi> ſeemed to have loſt her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty when once the Emperours were conſtituted; yet you ſhall finde ſome exemplar Acts of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice even done by the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> on the great Tyrant of his time <hi>Nero,</hi> who was by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and adjudged unto death. But why Sir, ſhould I make
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53423:40"/>
mention of theſe Forreign Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Examples unto you. If we ſhall look but over the <hi>Tweede,</hi> we ſhall finde examples enough in your native Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> If we look on your firſt king <hi>Forguſius,</hi> he was an elective King, he died and left two ſons, both in their minority: The elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afterwards giving ſmall hopes to the people, that he would govern them well; ſo becauſe he endeavoured to have ſupplant his Uncle, who was choſen by the people, to govern them in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority; he was rejected by the people for it, and the younger brother was choſen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, I will not take upon me to expreſſe what your Hiſtories do at large declare; you know very well that you are the hundred and nineth King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the Kings, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53423:40"/>
of that kingdome, according to their power and priviledge, have made bold to deale withall, either to baniſh, impriſon, or put to death, would be too long a ſtory for this time and place. <hi>Reges</hi> (ſay your own Authors) we cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Kings, at firſt, <hi>Leges, &amp;c.</hi> we impoſed Laws upon them, and as they were choſen by the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the people at the firſt, ſo upon the ſame occaſion, by the ſame Suffrages they may be taken down again; and of this, I may be bold to ſay, that no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the world hath yielded a more plentifull experience, than your native Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> on the depoſition and the puniſhment of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing Kings.</p>
                  <p>I need not go far for an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, your Grandmother was ſet aſide, and your father an Infant
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53423:41"/>
crown'd. This State hath done the like in <hi>England.</hi> The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and people of <hi>England,</hi> have made bold to call their King to an account therein, frequent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, the time before the Conqueſt, and ſince the Conqueſt, there have not wanted ſome preſidents: King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, were ſo dealt with by the Parliament, and were both depoſed, and deprived, and truly Sir, whoſoever ſhall look into their ſtories, ſhall not find the Articles that are charged upon them to come near to the height, and the Capitalneſſe of the crimes that are laid to your charge, nothing near.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you were pleaſed the other day to alledge your Deſcent, and I did not contradict it, but take all together, if you go higher than
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53423:41"/>
the Conqueſt, you ſhall find that for almoſt a thouſand years theſe things have been, and if you come down ſince the Conqueſt, you are the four and twentieth King from <hi>William</hi> called the Conquerour, and you ſhall find one half of them to come meerely from the State, and not meerely upon the point of Deſcent. This were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be inſtanced. The time muſt not be loſt that way. I ſhall onely repreſent what a grave and learned Judge ſaid in his time, who was well known unto you, the words are ſince printed for poſterity: That although there were ſuch a thing as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent many times, yet the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ever held the greateſt aſſurance of their Titles, when it was declared by Parliament. And Sir, your Oath, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of your Coronation, doth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53423:42"/>
planly ſhew, that the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> although its true by the Law, the next perſon in bloud is deſigned, yet if there were a juſt cauſe to refuſe him, the people of <hi>England</hi> might do it. For there is a Contract and a bargain made betwixt the King and his people, and your Oath is taken, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Sir, the Bond is reciprocall, for as you are Liege Lord, ſo are they Liege Subjects, and we know very well that <hi>Legantis eſt duplex,</hi> the one is a Bond of perfection, that is due from the Soveraign, the other is a Bond of Subjection which is due from the Subject, for if this Bond be once broken, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Soveraignty, <hi>Subjectio trahit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things may not be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for I ſpeak it the rather (and I pray God it may work upon your heart) that you may be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53423:42"/>
of your miſcarriages, for whether you have been as you ought to be, a Protector of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or a deſtroyer of <hi>England,</hi> let all <hi>England</hi> judge, or all the world that hath beheld it; and though Sir, you have it by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, in the way that is ſpoken of, yet it cannot be denyed, but your Office is an Office of Truſt, and indeed an Office of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Truſt that can be lodged in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſingle perſon. For as you were the grand Adminiſtrator of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and others were but as your delegates, to ſee it executed through your Dominions. If your great Office were to do Juſtice, &amp; preſerve your people from wrong, if inſtead of executing Juſtice, you will be the grand and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick diſturber of the peace, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is contrary to your Office and your Truſt. Now Sir, if it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53423:43"/>
be an office of inheritance (as you ſpeak of your Title by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent) let all men underſtand, that great Offices are ſeizable, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitable, as if you had it but for a year, or for your life. It will therefore much concern you to take into your ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your great miſcarriages in this nature.</p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, I ſhall not in this place undertake to give you the particulars of the many miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of your Reign, whatſoever they have been, they are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known. It had been happy for the Kingdome, and for your ſelf alſo, if they had not been ſo much known, and ſo much felt, as they are every where complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on, and reported.</p>
                  <p>Sir, that we are now upon by the command of the higheſt Court, hath been and is to bring
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53423:43"/>
you to your Triall, and to judge you for theſe great offences of yours: Sir, the Charge hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you Tyrant, a Traytor, a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, and a publick enemy to the Common wealth; Sir, it had been well, if theſe terms might rightly and juſtly have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; nay, if any one of them all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King,</speaker>
                  <p>Ha!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident,</speaker>
                  <p>Truly, we have been told, <hi>Rex eſt, qui bene regit, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus qui populum opprimit,</hi> and if that be the definition of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, then ſee if you come ſhort of it in your Actions, and whether not the higheſt Tyrant by that way of arbitrary Government, which you ſought to introduce, and were putting upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Examine with your ſelf, if that were not as high an act of Tyranny, as any of your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53423:44"/>
were guilty of, yea many degrees beyond it.</p>
                  <p>Sir, the Term Traytor cannot be ſpared, we ſhall eaſily conclude that it doth enforce and denote a breach of Truſt, and it muſt be ſuppoſed to be done by a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and therefore as the people of <hi>England,</hi> might have encurred that term, if they had been truly guilty of it, as to the definition of the Law; ſo on the other ſide when you did break your Truſt to the Kingdome, you did break your Truſt to your ſuperior; For the Kingdome is that for which you were truſted; And therefore when you are called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for this breach of truſt, you are called to account by your ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior. <hi>Minimus Majorem in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium vocat</hi>: And Sir the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> cannot be ſo want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves, (whom God
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53423:44"/>
hath dealt ſo miraculouſly and gloriouſly for) they having both power and their great enemy in their hand, but they muſt proceed to Juſtice to themſelves and to you; For Sir, the Court could heartily deſire that you would lay your hand upon your heart, and conſider, what you have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, and that you would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make your peace with God. Truly Sir, Theſe are too high Crimes, Tyranny and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. There is a third, if thoſe two had not been, and that is murther, which is laid to your charge alſo. All the bloody murders that have been committed ſince the Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt you and your people, muſt be laid to your charge. Sir, It is a hainous and a crying ſinne, and truly Sir, If any man will ask us what puniſhment is due unto a murtherer, let Gods law, let mans
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53423:45"/>
ſpeak. I will preſume you are ſo well read in the holy Scripture as that you know what God himſelf hath ſaid concerning the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of mans blood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. will tell you what the puniſhment is, and this Court in the behalf of the Kingdom are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of that innocent blood, that hath been ſhed, &amp; the land indeed ſtands ſtill defiled with that bloud and as the Text hath it; <hi>It can no way be cleanſed, but by the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the blood of him who ſhed that blood.</hi> Sir, We know no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from this blood in the Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther,</hi> we do not know but that it extends to Kings as well as to the meaneſt peaſants, the meaneſt of the people, the Command is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall. Sir, Gods law forbids it, mans law forbids it; nor do we know that there is any manner of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53423:45"/>
execution, not even in mans laws, for the puniſhment of Murther in you. Tis true, that in the Caſe of Kings, every private hand, is not to put forth its ſelf to this work, for their reformatian or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the people repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted having power in their hands (were there but one willfull Act of murder by you committed) have power to convent you, and to puniſh you for it.</p>
                  <p>The weight Sir, then lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you in all theſe reſpects, that have been ſpoken, for your Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, Treaſon, Breach of Truſt, and the murders that have been committed, ſurely it ſhould drive you into a ſad conſideration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your eternall eſtate. I know it cannot be acceptable to you, to hear any ſuch things as theſe mentioned from this Court, for ſo do we call our ſelves, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53423:46"/>
juſtifie our ſelves to be a Court, and a High Court of Juſtice, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the higheſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemneſt Court of the Kingdome, as hath been often already ſaid. And although you have indeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what lay in you to diſcourt us; yet we do take knowledge of our ſelves to be ſuch a Court, as can adminiſter juſtice to you, as we are bound in duty to it.</p>
                  <p>Sir, All I ſhall ſay, before the reading of the Sentence, is but this. The Court doth heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that you will ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thoſe Evils, that you ſtand guilty of. You ſaid well the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, you wiſhed us to have God before our eyes. Truly Sir, I hope all of us have ſo, that God whom we acknowledge to be King of Kings and Lord of Lords, that God with whom there is no reſpect of perſons; that God who
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53423:46"/>
is the avenger of Innocent blood; that God have we before our eys, that God who beſtows a Curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, who in the caſe of guilty malefactors that deſerve death, do withhold their hands from ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood: Sir, That God we have before our eyes, and were it not that the Conſcience of our duty hath called us into this place and this imployment, you ſhould have had no appearance of a Court here. But ſir, we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our reſpect unto God and to the Kingdome, above any reſpect whatſoever; and although at this preſent, many of us, if not all of us are ſeverely threatned by ſome of your party, what they intend to do; yet we do here declare, that we ſhall not decline or forbear the doing of our Duty in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice, even to your ſelf; and that according to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53423:47"/>
the merit of your offence; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God ſhould permit thoſe men to effect all their bloody de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes in hand againſt us. Sir, we will ſay, and we will declare it as thoſe Children in the fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, who refuſed to worſhip the Golden Image, that <hi>Nebuchadona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> had ſet up. That their God was able to deliver them from the danger they were neer unto; but if he did not deliver them, yet they would not fall down and worſhip the golden Image. We ſhall make this application of it. That though we ſhould not be delivered from thoſe bloody hands and hearts, who conſpire the overthrow of the Kingdome in generall, and of our ſelves in particular, for being actors in this great work of Juſtice; though I ſay, we ſhould periſh in the work, yet by the grace &amp; in the ſtrength
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53423:47"/>
of God, we are reſolved to go on with it. And thoſe are the intire reſolutions of us all.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I ſay, for your ſelf, that we do heartily wiſh and deſire that God would be pleaſed to give you a ſenſe of your ſins, that you may ſee wherin you have done amiſſe, and that you may cry unto him, that God would deliver you from blood guiltineſſe. A good King, <hi>David</hi> by Name, was once guilty of that particular guilt; he was otherwiſe upright, ſaving in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> Truly Sir, the Hiſtory doth repreſent unto us, that he was a repentant King, and and he had died for his ſinne, but that God was pleaſed to be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to him, and to grant him his pardon, <hi>Thou ſhalt not die</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>but the childe ſhall dye; Thou haſt given cauſe to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God to blaſpheme.</hi>

                  <p>I would onely deſire to be heard, but one word, before you give ſentence, and it is that (to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the world when I am dead) you would but hear me concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe great Imputations which you have laid unto my charge.</p>

                  <p>You diſavow us as a Court, and therefore for you to addreſſe yourſelf to us, whom you do not acknowledge to be a Court for us (I ſay) to judge what you ſhall ſpeak is not to be permitted; and the truth is all along from the very firſt, you have been pleaſed to diſavow and diſown us; The Court needed not to have heard you one word; for unleſſe they be acknowledged a Court and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, it is not proper for you to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Sir, We have given you too large an indulgence of time
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53423:49"/>
already, and admitted ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, that we may not admit of any more. If it were proper for us, we ſhould heare you very freely, not decline to hear the moſt that you could ſpeak to the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for your ſelf, whether it were totally, or but in part excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe great &amp; hainous char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which are laid upon you. But I ſhall trouble you no longer, your ſins are of ſo large a dimention, that if you do but ſeriouſly think of them, they will drive you into a ſad conſideration; and we wiſh that they may improve in you a ſad and ſerious repentance. And it is the deſire of the Court, that you may be ſo penitent for what you have done a miſſe, that God may at leaſt, have mercy on your better part. As for the other, it is our part and duties, to doe that which the law preſcribeth, we
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53423:49"/>
are not now here <hi>jus dare,</hi> but <hi>jus dicere</hi>; we cannot be unm<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndfull of what the word of God tels us. To acquit the guilty, is of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual abomination, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Innocent; we may not acquit the guilty, what ſentence the law pronounceth to a traytor, a tyrant, a murtherer, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like enemy to the Country, that ſentence you are now to hear read unto you, and that is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Lord <hi>Preſident</hi> commanded the Sentence to be read; Whereupon M. <hi>King,</hi> who was Cryer of the Court, having commanded ſilence by his <hi>Oyes,</hi> the Clerk read the ſentence, which was drawn up in Parchment, and did run in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereas the Commons of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>in Parliament, had appointed them an high Court of Juſtice for the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53423:50"/>
tryall of</hi> Charls Stuart <hi>King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>before whom he had been three times convented, and at the firſt time, a Charge of High Treaſon and other Crimes and Miſdemeanors was read in the behalf of the Kingdome of</hi> England; which Charge fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in theſe words:</p>
                  <p>This Charge being read (ſaid the Clerk) <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to give his anſwer, which he refuſed to do, but expreſſed theſe paſſages, and many more ſuch as theſe are, in refuſing to anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The Clerk (having repeated many paſſages, during the time of his triall, in which the King ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an averſeneſſe to acknowledge the Court) did proceed to read the Sentence, which was in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For all which Treaſons and Crimes, this Court doth adjudge,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53423:50"/>
That the ſaid</hi> Charls Stuart <hi>as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murtherer, and a publick Enemy, ſhall be put to death, by ſevering his Head from his Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Sentence being read, the Lord Preſident ſaid; This Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence now read and publiſhed, is the Act, Sentence, Judgement, and reſolution of the whole Court.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, the Court ſtood up, as aſſenting to what the Preſident ſaid.</p>

                  <p>I may ſpeak after the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence — By your favour Sir, I may ſpeak after Sentence ever. The Guard drawing to him, he

                  <head>His Majeſties Reaſons. Againſt the pretended Juriſdiction of the High Court of Juſtice, which he had intended to have given there on <hi>Monday</hi>
                     <date>Jan. 22. 1649.</date>
Faithfully tranſcribed from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Copy of the King.</head>
                  <p>SInce I have already made my Proteſtation, not onely againſt the illegality of this pretended Court, but that no power on earth, can juſtly call me (who am your King) into queſtion as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent. I would no longer have opened my mouth on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but have referred my ſelf to thoſe things which I then ſpoke, if this onely concerned my own particular; But the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which I ow to God, to preſerve the true liberty of my people
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53423:53"/>
doth not permit me at this time, I ſhould be ſilent; for how can any free born Subject of <hi>England</hi> call his life or any thing he doth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs his own, if power without law can daily make new, and abrogate the old and Fundamental Laws of this Land, which I judge to be the preſent caſe? Wherefore when I was brought hither, I expected that you would have ſtudied to ſatisfy me in theſe Fundamentalls which do hinder me from putting in my Anſwer to the pretended charge, but ſince I do obſerve, that nothing which I can alledge can perſwade you to it (although negatives are not ſo naturally proved, as affirmatives) yet I have thought good to declare unto you the Reaſons for which I am confident, you are not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to judge me, nor the vileſt man in <hi>England,</hi> for without
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53423:53"/>
ſhowing my Reaſons, I will not (as you) be ſo unreaſonably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, as to exact either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or obedience from my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>Here was I reſtrained, and not ſuffered to ſpeak any more of Reaſons, there is no juſt proceſſe againſt any man, which deriveth not its authority, either from the Law of God, or from the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Laws of the Land.</p>
                  <p>Now I am moſt ſure, that the Proceſſe at this day made againſt me, cannot be confirmed by the law of God; for on the contrary the neceſſity of obedience is clearly confirmed, and ſtreightly commanded in the old and new Teſtament; which if it be denyed, I am prepared preſently to prove it; and as for the queſtion now in agitation, it is ſaid there, <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53423:54"/>
and who can ſay unto him, what doeſt thou?</hi> Eccles. 8. v. 4. Then as to the laws of the land, I am as confident that no learned law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer will affirm, that any charge can be brought againſt the King, ſince they all go forth under his name, and it is one of their axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms, that the King can not do an injury. Moreover the law on which you do ground your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, is either old or new, if it be old, ſhew that law unto me, if it be new, tell me what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity eſtabliſhed by the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall laws of this land did give it birth and when? but how the Houſe of Commons can erect a Tribunall of Juſtice, which was never one it ſelf (as all lawyers will confeſſe with me) I leave it to God and to the world to judge; and it will ſeem moſt ſtrange to any who ever have
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53423:54"/>
heard of the laws of <hi>England,</hi> how they can pretend to make laws without either the King, or the Houſe of Peeres.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe it be admitted, but not granted, that a commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the people of <hi>England,</hi> is able to confirm your pretended power, yet I ſee nothing that you can ſhow for it for I am confident that you never asked that queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> man in the kingdom; &amp; in this method you do a moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent injury, even to the pooreſt ploughman, if you ask not his conſent, neither can you pretend any colour to this your pretended Commiſſion, if you have not the concurring voyces of at leaſt the greateſt part of this Nation, of every degree and quality, which you are ſo far from obtaining, that I am confident you never ſo much as ſought it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:53423:55"/>You ſee then, that I do not onely ſpeak for my own Right, as I am your King, but alſo for the true liberty of all my ſubjects, which conſiſteth not in dividing the power of Government, but in living under ſuch laws, and ſuch a Government, as may grant them the beſt ſecurity of their lives, and the propriety of their goods. In this I ought not to be forgetfull, neither do I forget the priviledges of both Houſes of parliament, which theſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings do not onely violate, but give an occaſion of the greateſt breaking of the publick faith; and ſuch (I believe) as the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of before, with which I will not at all, charge both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for the pretended crimes which they impoſe upon me, are far before the Treaty at <hi>Newport,</hi> in which when I aſſented to, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53423:55"/>
did conclude as much as poſſibly lay in my power, and did juſtly expect the aſſent of both Houſes, I was ſuddenly taken from thence and carried away as a priſoner, and againſt my will, I was hurried hither; and ſince I came to this court, I cannot with all my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, defend the ancient laws and liberties of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, together with my juſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and as much as I can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſcern the upper Houſe, which is the Houſe of Lords, is totally excluded.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, it is too much known, that the greater part of them are either impriſoned, or affrighted from ſitting, ſo that if I had no other Cauſe, this was ſufficient enough to make me to proteſt againſt the authority of your pretended tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall. Beſides all theſe things,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53423:56"/>
the peace of the Kingdome, is not the leaſt part of my cares, and what hope can there be of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing it, as long as power reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without the Rule of the Law, changing the whole frame of the Government under which this Kingdome hath flouriſhed theſe many ages; neither will I ſpeak what is likely to follow, if theſe unlawfull proceedings ſhall yet continue againſt me; for I believe the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> will give you no thanks for this change, eſpecially, when they ſhall call into their minds, how happily they heretofore have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and of the King my Father, and in my own Reign before the beginning of theſe unhappy tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults; and they will have a juſt cauſe to doubt, if they ſhall be ſo happy in any new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:53423:56"/>In that time it will moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear that I onely took up Arms to defend the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Laws of this Kingdome againſt thoſe who oppoſed my power, and totally would have ſubverted the ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Having ſo briefly declared my Reaſons to you, for which I could not ſubmit to your pretended Authority, without violation of the Truſt which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me for the ſafety and liberty of my people. I expect from you either clearer Reaſons to convince my Judgement, by demonſtrating to me that I am in an Error, (and then ſurely, I ſhall be ready to give you an Anſwer) or elſe, that you ſuſpend your preſent proceedings.</p>
                  <p>This I had determined to have ſpoken in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall on

                     <hi>I</hi> Shall be very little heard by any of the people, I ſhall therefore ſpeak a word or two to you who are here. Indeed I could hold my peace very well, if I did not think that my ſilence would make ſome men think, that I did ſubmit to the guilt, as well as to the puniſhment; but <hi>I</hi> conceive it is my duty, Firſt unto
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53423:59"/>
God, and afterwards to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to vindicate my ſelf, as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, a good King, and a good Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin firſt with my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; Introth I think it not very needfull for me to inſiſt long upon this, for all the world knows that I never did begin Warre with the two Houſes of Parliament, and I call God to witneſſe, to whom I must ſhortly make my account, that I never did intend to incroach upon their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: they began with me, It was the Militia they began upon, they confeſſed that the Militia was mine, but they thought it fit to have it from me, and to be ſhort if any man will look to the Dates of Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of their Commiſſions ormine; and likewiſe to the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will finde clearly, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thoſe unhappy troubles, not I; ſo that as for the guilt of theſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53423:59"/>
crimes, which are laid upon me, I hope in God, that God will clear me of them.</p>
                  <p>I am in charity, I will not, and God forbid that I ſhould lay it upon the two-Houſes of Parliament, there is no neceſſity of either; I hope they are free from the Guilt, for I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that evill inſtruments between them and me have been the chief cauſe of all this bloodſhed, ſo that by way of ſpeaking, as I find my ſelf clear of this, I hope, and I pray God, that they may too; yet for all this, God forbid, that I ſhould be ſo ill a Chriſtian, as not to ſay that Gods judgements are juſt upon me. Many times he does inflict Juſtice by an unjuſt Sentence; this is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; I will onely ſay, that an unjuſt Sentence, <note n="*" place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>
                     </note> That I ſuffered to take effect, is puniſhed now by an unjuſt Sentence upon my ſelf. This is to ſhew you, (as I have ſaid) how far I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53423:60"/>
am an innocent man.</p>
                  <p>Now for to ſhow you, that I am a good Chriſtian, I hope there is a good man<note n="*" place="margin">Pointing at Doctour <hi>Juxon.</hi>
                     </note>, who will bear witneſſe with me, that I have forgiven all the world, and even thoſe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, who have been the chief cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of my Death; who they are, God knows. I do not deſire to know, I pray God forgive them: But this is not all, my Charity muſt go further, I wiſh that they may repent; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they have committed a great ſin in that particular; I pray God with Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> that this be not laid to their charge; nay, not onely ſo, but that they may take the right way to the peace of the Kingdome; for my charity commands me, not onely to forgive particular men, but my charity commands me to inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the laſt gaſp the peace of the Kingdome. This Sirs, I do wiſh with all my Soul, and I do hope,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53423:60"/>
(there are ſome <note n="*" place="margin">Turning to ſome Gentlemen who took his Speech in ſhort writing.</note> who will carry it further) that they may indeavour the peace of the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Now Sirs, I muſt ſhow you both how you are out of the way, and I will put you into a way: Firſt, you are out of the way; for certainly, all the way in which as yet you have gone, as I could ever find out by any thing, is in the way of conqueſt; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is an ill way, for conqueſt Sirs, in my opinion, is never juſt, except there be a good, juſt cauſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for matter of wrong, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a juſt Title, and if in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the quarrell, you ſhall go beyond this, it will make that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt at the end, which was just at the beginning. But if it be onely matter of conqueſt, therein it is a great robbery, as a pirate ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was a great rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and that he himſelf was but a petty robber: and thus Sirs, <hi>I</hi> do
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53423:61"/>
think, that the way you are in, is much out of the way; Now Sirs, for to put you in the way, believe it, you will never do right, nor will God ever proſper you, untill you give God his due, and the King his due, that is, in their courſe of time, my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and untill you give the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their due; I am as much for them as any of you are. You must give God his due, by regulating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right his Church according to his Scripture; your church is now out of order, for to ſet you particularly in a way now, I cannot, but onely by a Synod of the whole Nation, who being freely called, and freely deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting amongſt themſelves, may by Gods bleſſing ſettle the Ghurch, when every opinion is freely and clearly diſcuſſed.</p>
                  <p>For the King indeed, I will not much inſiſt—<hi>Then turning to a Gentleman whoſe cloak he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53423:61"/>
to touch the edge of the Ax, he ſaid unto him,</hi> Hurt not the Ax, <hi>meaning by blunting the the edge thereof,</hi> for that he ſaid might hurt him. <hi>Having made this ſhort digreſſion, he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi> For the King, the laws of the land will clearly inſtruct you, what you have to do; but becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my own particular, I onely do give you but a touch of it.</p>
                  <p>As for the People, truly I deſire their liberty and freedome, as much as any whoſoever; but I must tell you, that their liberty and freedome conſists in having of government by thoſe laws, by which their lives, and their goods may be moſt their own. It is not for them to have a ſhare in Government, that is nothing Sirs, appertaining unto them. A Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and a Sovereign are clean diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things; and therefore untill that be done, I mean, untill the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53423:62"/>
be put into that liberty, which I ſpeak of; certainly they will never enjoy themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Sirs, It was for this that now I am come here; If I would have given way to an arbitrary power to have all laws changed according to the power of the ſword; I needed not to have come hither, and therefore I tell you, and I pray God that it be not laid to your charge, <hi>that I am the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In troth Sirs, I ſhall not hold you much longer, I ſhal onely ſay this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that in truth, I could have deſired ſome little longer time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had a deſire to put this, that I have ſaid into a little more order, and to have a little better digeſted it than I have now done; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I hope you will excuſe me.</p>
                  <p>I have delivered my conſcience, I pray God that you do take thoſe courſes, that are moſt for the good of

            <p>And now the Earl believes all his own, and the people dream of nothing but Peace, but alas the warre was not begun till now:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53423:74"/>
For when the torn remainder of the loyall army that eſcaped at <hi>Lewes,</hi> now keeping Gariſon in <hi>Briſtow,</hi> and other noble ſpirits ſaw how inſolently the Earl dealt with his and their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, in barring him of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They ſoon raiſed a conſiderable power under the command of <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi>: unto whom many flockt out of <hi>Shropſhire, Cheſhire Herefordſhire,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> that were well affected to the King.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Queen (who was a <hi>French</hi> woman) got over beyond Sea, to try her friends for their aſiſtance to reſtore her husband to his former liberty and authority, <hi>Quod ad laudem &amp; magnificentiam Aelionorae An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum Reginae libet intexere</hi> (ſaith one of that age) <hi>quod Domino ſuo, &amp; Edvardo filio tam ſtrenuè

            </p>
            <p>But before theſe Forces were well united, the Rebels Forces were as well divided: for debate ariſing, (as is uſuall in all confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, where all parties muſt be pleaſed, or elſe the knot will diſſolve) between his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> becauſe his Excellency, minding his own private, more than the publick good of his fellow Rebels (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect had to his adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants) ingroſſes all to himſelf, diſpoſes of the royall priſoners at his own pleaſure, ſeiſed on the revenues of the Crown, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of dilinquents for his own uſe, (whereas they had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately agreed before, <hi>Ea omnia aequâ ſorte inter eos dividenda fore</hi>)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53423:75"/>
In brief, he ſhared all places of power and profit between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his ſonnes and his allies. Whereat <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> (as good a man as he) ſtomackt and fell off with his followers to the Prince, who by this time (<hi>diſponente Domino clavigero carcerum,</hi> every thing working for the King) had made his eſcape out of priſon at <hi>Hereford</hi>: (for being allowed by his keepers to aire himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on horſe back in the town Meadow, after he had tyred two or three, at length he mounts a ſpeciall flight Nag, and putting ſpurs <hi>Cuſtodibus valedixit</hi>) and came ſafe to <hi>Wigmore</hi> Caſtle, where the Lord <hi>Mortimer</hi> lay with his Forces raiſed for the King, ſo marcht on with a great prwer, taking in (as they went) ſome ſtrong Gariſons of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, plundered their houſes,

            </p>
            <p>Here the war grew hot, each ſide fortifying towns, plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and driving all round about to ſtore the Gariſons: Mens hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (which were wont to be their own Caſtles) were now made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but the owners were leaſt maſters; all left to the mercy of the rude ſouldier, the poor Countreymans dwelling houſe, pillaged every where and ſearcht, <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>When the Prince, the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> with the reliques of the Royall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53423:76"/>
were united and well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they reſolved to give his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency (the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>) battel: At <hi>Eveſham</hi> in <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> by a ſpeedy and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed march they came upon him. The Earl ſeeing himſelf engaged to fight, gave order that his own coat-armour ſhould be put upon the King, who was then a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the Army, and that the King for the ſafety of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon forſooth) ſhould be placed in the front of the battel, that ſo if the battel went againſt him, the King might be aimed at as Generall, and his Excellency thereby make his eſcape. But the King at the firſt Charge called out to the loyall Army, that he was their King, and ſo was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; yet not without the loſſe of ſome of his own, (being wounded by a javelin) as well as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53423:76"/>
his ſubjects blood: the battel was very violent, and went ſore againſt the Rebels; at length the Earl himſelf (the head of this Rebellion) was cut off; at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of whoſe death there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch extraordinary light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and thick darkneſſe, that it ſtruck a generall horrour and amazement into the hearts of the Rebels, as if the King of Kings would now at laſt viſibly revenge the Kings quarrell, or as if they had ſeen Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand againſt them, as once againſt <hi>Corah,</hi> and the 250 Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly men, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 35. for the like rebellious practiſes.</p>
            <p>In this ſignall Battel were ſlain (beſides the Earl and his ſon) ſixteen Lords and Knights, and about ten thouſand more of the Rebells part.</p>
            <p>The Earls Corps was ſtrangely

(though not undeſervedly) han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the people, who were ſo inraged againſt him, the chief actour and authour of their ſo much miſchief and miſery, that (in diſpight of him) they lopt off his head, hands, feet, and privy members, and ſent them (in ſcorn) for tokens to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places; his body was buried in <hi>Eveſham</hi> Church. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, there were many ignorant people (who had been by ſpecious pretences abuſed, and ſeduced to that ſide) that were of opinion for a long time after, that he dyed a Martyr, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was in defence of their holy (as they thought, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed impious) Covenant &amp; Oath.</p>
            <p>Two of the Earls ſons were at the ſame fight taken priſones: not long after they made an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape out of Priſon, but cold not

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53423:80"/>Daily ſuit was made unto his Majeſty for his Pardon and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but in vain: then they petition the King to know his gracious pleaſure, what Fine he would demand of the whole City, for their offences againſt him. The King at length ſignified unto them that the ſumme of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Marks ſhould be their Fine. Whereto the <hi>Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> return this humble anſwer. They had been of late by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy War, ſo exceeding impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, that a ſumme ſo great, (as it was in thoſe times) could not poſſibly be raiſed amongſt them; wherfore they humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched his Princely compaſſion might be ſo far extended towards them, as to require and accept ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilities. At length, after much ſuit and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and a Fine of twenty
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53423:81"/>
thouſand Marks, the King recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to mercy, and ſent them under his great Seal a generall Pardon (thoſe onely excepted, whoſe Eſtates were already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed) granting and allowing, that their former Charter &amp; anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Priviledges ſhould be reſtored unto them, <hi>notwithſtanding all the tranſgreſſions</hi> (they are the words of the Pardon) <hi>and Treſpaſſes done to us, to our Queen, to our noble brother</hi> Richard <hi>King of</hi> Almain, <hi>and the Prince our firſt begotten ſonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here was the firſt pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the King and the <hi>Londoners,</hi> for whom we ſay thus much, <hi>That their foul Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt their Soveraigne, was not more deteſtable, than their humble ſubmiſſion to their Soveraign was commendable.</hi> And therefore in the Ordinance,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53423:81"/>
called <hi>Dictum de Kenelworth,</hi> made for the ſettling of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, we find them (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, all their diſloyalty) commended, as ſhall be ſeen in the enſuing Story.</p>
            <p>After the proud ſtomack of this City was brought down, and all tumultuous ſpirits quelled, the King calls his Parliament (<hi>in feſto ſancti Edvardi Regis</hi>) to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> wherein thoſe that aided and aſſiſted the Earl, were all (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Londoners</hi>) attainted, and that all their Lands and Goods were forfeited.</p>
            <p>But this ſentence (though it was leſſe than they deſerved) yet was more than they would endure, and therefore the fire (that was not yet quencht, but ſmothered) breaks forth again. Some flie into the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and fortifie that. Some into the Iſle of <hi>Axholm in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53423:82"/>
Lincolnſhire.</hi> Another party poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe themſelves of <hi>Killingworth</hi> Caſtle. Another under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lord <hi>Ferrers</hi> in the Northern parts. And amongſt others, one <hi>Adam Gurdon</hi> lived as an Outlaw <hi>in Hampſhire</hi> (<note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>To reduce theſe to obedience, the King undertakes <hi>Killingworth</hi> Caſtle.

Law of Arms, contrary to natural civility, cut off the Meſſengers hand, and ſent him back with an uncivil anſwer.

            </p>
            <p>Thus endeth that famous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53423:93"/>
called to this day, <hi>Dictum de Kenelworth</hi>; wherein are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the wiſeſt rules that the wiſeſt men of thoſe times could poſſibly deviſe, to uphold, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and recover a tottering di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, dying Kingdome.</p>
            <p>About two Moneths after the publication of this Ordinance, <hi>viz.</hi> upon Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> Eve, the Caſtle was delivered up, upon conditions (too good for thoſe that had ſo barbarouſly uſed the Kings Meſſenger,<note place="margin">The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of Cinque Ports ſeeing the King proſper, made their peace with the King.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the King, and impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the Countrey) to march away with their goods, &amp; to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo no Fine for taking up arms.</p>
            <p>This Caſtle had the K. beſtowed upon the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in frank marriage with his ſiſter <hi>Aelionor</hi>; but when the Earl by his Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had forfeited, and the King had now won it, he gave it to his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53423:93"/>
own ſon <hi>Edmund</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who by this time had reduced the Iſle of <hi>Axholm,</hi> and all thoſe rude ignorant people, that flockt thither, pillaging and plundering the Kings friends round about.</p>
            <p>The Prince alſo met with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Gurdon,</hi> a famous ſturdy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell that lay lurking in <hi>Aulton</hi> Wood in <hi>Hamſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Riſhanger.</hi>
               </note> robbing and ſpoiling the adjacent parts, <hi>praeoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puè terras eorum qui parti Regiae ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerebant</hi>; the Prince upon his approach, hearing of his valour, ſent him a challenge for a ſingle Combate. <hi>Gurdon</hi> accepts it, and performed it ſo Gallantly, that the Prince aſſured him of his life and eſtate, if he would ſubmit: which he did, and was received into great favour with the Prince; but divers of his men were there executed.</p>
            <p>But now the Iſle of <hi>Ely</hi> was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53423:94"/>
ſtrongly fortified by a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude got together, that refuſed to ſubmit to the Ordinance of <hi>Kenelworth.</hi> Upon the naturall ſtrength of this Iſle, and the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all proviſion therein, ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rebels have often preſumed, and from hence have moleſted more Kings than one, as they did now the neighbouring Counties, robbing and pillaging <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and carrying away the richeſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, made them redeem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: at length a Meſſage was ſent unto them requiring them to ſubmit to the Ordinance of <hi>Killingworth,</hi> to leave off robbing their fellow Subjects, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their allegeance: Hereto they return this inſolent anſwer, that <hi>they had taken up arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the good of Church and State,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53423:94"/>
and therefore ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their lands without paying any Fine.</hi> In brief they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Hoſtages into the Iſland, and that they might hold it five years peaceably, till they ſaw how the King would perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, (perfidious Subjects ever ſuſpect their Princes fidelity) which high inſolency of theirs (unheard of till our times) ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperates the King, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to try the utmoſt, to reduce them to their obedience; for that purpoſe marches with a mighty army againſt them, the Prince alſo joyns with a conſiderable power; after many aſſaults, at length (after they had held it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two years) by the help of new made bridges and boats, they ſtormed it on every ſide, that they were forced to yield.</p>
            <p>And now men thought that the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53423:95"/>
fire was quite out. But there were yet ſome live embers (which the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> upon ſome diſtaſt blowing) ſuddenly flamed out again in <hi>London,</hi> where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the City forgetting their late puniſhment, and as men (ſaith mine authour) without dread of God or the King,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fabian</hi>
               </note> drew up in arms again, flock to the Earl of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> plundered the well affected to the King, ſequeſtered their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, brake the priſons, choſe a new Mayor and Sheriffes, made Bulwarks and Barbicans, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the City wonderouſly, and were ſo confident of their ſtrength and cauſe, that they durſt bid the King battel, appointing <hi>Hounſloe-heath</hi> for the field.</p>
            <p>The King by a ſpeedy march came to the place at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; but they inſtead of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majeſty, ran about the city
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53423:95"/>
in a tumultuous manner. Some to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there plundered the Kings Palace, <hi>feneſtras &amp; oſtia fregerunt,</hi> (ſaith M. <hi>Weſton) vix manus à combuſtione totius Palatii cohibentes</hi>; brake the doores and windows, hardly forbearing to ſet it all on fire.</p>
            <p>Then the King removed his Camp to the other ſide of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had his head-quarters at <hi>Strafford,</hi> three miles off the City, the reſt of the Army lay at <hi>Ham,</hi> a village hard by. The wiſer Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens foreſeeing the danger that hung over them, deſired a Treaty with the King, whereunto, (though they were unworthy of ſo much clemency) His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, and upon theſe eaſie terms, they were again received to mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Imprimis, Salvo in omnibus dicto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53423:96"/>
Killingworthi,</hi> That the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>Killingworth,</hi> ſhould be razed, and the Trenches filled up; laſtly, that one thouſand marks dammages ſhould be paid down to the Kings brother, for his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Iſleworth,</hi> fired by them long before.</p>
            <p>Alſo his Majeſty for ſome years following choſe the Mayor and Sheriffes himſelf: but toward the latter end of his Reign being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciled, he reſtored them their (often forfeited) <note n="*" place="margin">Then did the King command, that peace ſhould be proclaimed all the Kingdome over, which was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with joyfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.</note> privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
            <p>Thus after the Almighty (whoſe judgements are unſearchable) had ſuffered crafty ſeditious ſpirits, to ſeduce a whole Nation, to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon his Anointed, and to tread his Honour in the very duſt for a time, yet at length all his enemies are cloathed with ſhame, and upon himſelf his Crown flouriſheth again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:53423:96"/>And now after this furious dreadfull Tempeſt, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtorms and ſhowres of blood, began a joyfull long-expected Calm, which that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy without any intervening of more ſtorms, and for the better ſetling and quieting the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the King gives expreſſe command for the razing of divers in-land Caſtles; as <hi>Farnham, &amp;c.</hi> That ſo if another Rebellion ſhould be begotten, it might no where find a nurſe, and then it could not be long lived.</p>
            <p>Alſo for the more quiet and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure travelling of his Subjects, he appoints a Captain in every County, who with a Troop of Horſe ſhould alway aſſiſt the Sheriffe, for the taking and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing all ſtragling reliques of the late Armies, and high-way robbers, wherewith the Kingdom
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53423:97"/>
did abound at that time, no place free from them. In ſome places alſo, <hi>Ruricolae</hi> (ſaith <hi>Riſhanger,</hi> the Countrey people would ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally riſe againſt them (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Wolves or Bears;) and at one time, they took and kill'd fifty of them, that were got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether near St. <hi>Albans</hi> in <hi>Hartford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the King <hi>Proclamari fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit contra pacem Regni diſturbantes</hi> ſet forth a Proclamation againſt all ſuch as ſhould any way diſturb the quiet of the Realm, by plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering or ſtealing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that if any man ſhould preſume to ſteal but a Cow or a Sheep, <hi>vel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid aliud</hi> (ſaith mine Authour) he ſhould be ſurely put to death.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the petty deviſes of that age, to pump and drain the huge ſink of the Kingdome: but the Staple policy was, by a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53423:97"/>
Forreign expedition (like a wide ſluce) to let out all the filth at once: for which purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (among others) it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon, that a great Army ſhould be raiſed under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Prince, for a voyage to <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> And by this courſe eſpecially did his Majeſty ſoon ſpend the inſolencies of his own,<note place="margin">So at a late Dyet or Parliament in <hi>Germany</hi> (after they had unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtrived with the Emperour; and waſted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) it was concluded that all ſhould be reduced to the ſame ſtate as it was in the year 1618.</note> and the Rebels Souldiers, made Lawleſſe by the late unavoidable Liberty of civil Arms.</p>
            <p>And here was an end of this waſting, groundles, unnatural war wherein the ſubject having ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and wreſtled with Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till they had waſted the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and wearied themſelves, at laſt are content to ſit down by the loſſe, to let the King have his own Rights again, and ſome of theirs according to the uſuall event and iſſue of ſuch imbroylments.</p>
