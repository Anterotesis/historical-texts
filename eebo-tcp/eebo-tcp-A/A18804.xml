            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And I, aſſone as euer I entred into mans ſtate, was in ſuch ſort by my father put to <hi>Scaeuola,</hi> that as nere as I might or coulde, I ſhould not one whit ſteppe aſide from the olde mans ſleeue. And therefore I diligently noted and committed to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morye many reaſons, wiſely by him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, and many thinges brieflye and aptly by him ſpoken, and ſought by hys wiſdome to become the better learned.

                  <p>Wherefore I thincke it beſte for you to <note place="margin">Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dship to be eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more then all vvorldlye thinges.</note> ſeeke thoſe pointes which may be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Frendſhip, at their handes which profeſſe theſe things.

                  <p>But firſt and formoſt this do I think, that Frendſhippe cannot be but in good men.

                  <p>Wherfore me thinkes Frendſhip had <note place="margin">Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dshyp natural.</note> his firſt beginning rather of nature the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of imbecillitye: &amp; of caſtinge ones phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie towards another, with a certaine fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Loue, rather then by conſidering how much profit might eniue therupon.

                  <p>Secondarilye, when as there is a like feelinge of Loue againe: as when wee haue found one with whoſe Manners and Nature wee well agree: (becauſe to oure owne thinckinge) wee eſpye in him (as it were) a certeine Lighte of Honeſtie and vertue. For nothinge is <note place="margin">Vertue.</note> more louelye and amiable then Vertue, nothinge that more allureth men to loue one another: Inſomuche that for Vertue and honeſtie we doe after a ſort, loue euen them whom wee neuer ſaw.

                  <p>Nowe, if the force of Honeſtye bee ſo greate, that wee loue the ſame, yea, in thoſe, whom wee neuer ſawe, and (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is more) euen in oure Enemies: what meruayle is it, if mennes hartes bee mooued, when they ſeeme to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and ſee Vertue, and goodneſſe in them, with whom they maye bee ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in acquaintaunce and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation.

his beginning from needines and want. Which thing if it were ſo: then, as euery man felt himſelfe of ſmalleſt abilitie, ſo ſhould he bee moſt fitteſt for Frendſhip: which thing is farre otherwiſe. For as euery man truſteth moſte to himſelfe: &amp; as euerye man is with vertue and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſo ſingulerlye furniſhed, that hee ſtandeth not in neede of anye other, and thincketh that al which is his, reſteth in himſelfe: ſo in ſeeking and mainteining Frendſhip doth he eſpecially ſurmount. For what? Had <hi>Aphricanus</hi> any neede of me? Neuer a whit ſurely. And I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him. But I throughe a certeine <note place="margin">Scipio &amp; Laelius, ij perfecte frendes.</note> admiration that I had of his vertue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him: and againe, he, for ſome opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perchaunce, that hee conceiued of my maners phanſied mee: and our dayly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſation together, encreaſed our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willes. But although many and greate commodities enſued thereof, yet did not the cauſes of our loue one to the other iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue from any hope of ſuche thinges. For as wee bee bountifull and liberal, not of purpoſe to get thanckes therefore (for wee do not lay out our benefites to vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8322:18"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wee farre diſagree in opinion from them whiche after the manner of bruite Beaſtes doe referre al thinges to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure &amp; Senſualitie. And no meruayle. For why? They that haue abaſed &amp; caſte al their cogitations vpon a thing ſo vile and contemptible, cannot haue anye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to any high, noble, and heauenly thinge. Wherefore let vs ſet aſide ſuche maner of perſons from this talke: and let vs vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the feelinge of Loue and perfecte goodwill is engendred by Nature, with hauinge ſome ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or proofe of honeſtye.

                  <p>Neyther are they to be geeuen eare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whiche holde opinion that Vertue is hard, &amp; as it were pronlike: which ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye is in many things els, but eſpecially in Frendſhip, tender, &amp; tractable: in ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weale of his frend, it ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth itſelfe abroade, and at his miſhaps ſhrinketh in again.

For there is nothinge more delectable, then is the requitall of good will: nothing more pleaſaunt then is the mutual entrecourſe of Freendli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and curteſies.

Nature.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore this in my iudgement is a <note place="margin">One ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loueth an other.</note> plaine caſe <hi>(Fannius</hi> and <hi>Scaeuola,</hi> that it cannot chooſe, but there muſt needes be amonge good men, one towardes an other, a freendly and hartie well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge: whiche is the Wellſpringe of Freendſhippe, appointed by Nature.</p>
                  <p>But this ſame goodneſſe apperteyneth <note place="margin">Vertue diſdaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no man.</note> alſo to the common ſort.

For the profit gayned by a freende doeth not ſo muche delice, as doth the very loue of a freend. And then is that which commeth from a mans freende, pleaſaunt, if it proceede of an hartie loue, and good will. And ſo farre of is it, that Freendſhippe ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:8322:27"/>
bee deſired for needineſſe, that they whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch beinge endued with wealth &amp; Riches and ſpeciallye with Vertue (wherein is moſt ayd) &amp; not ſtanding in neede of any other, are men moſt liberal &amp; bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull.</p>
                  <p>And I know not, whether it be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and meete that frendes ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">A frend is beſt kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vven in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſity.</note> want any thing at all.

                  <p>And therfore commonly they are puffed

vp with diſdaynfulneſſe and ſelfe will: and there is nothinge ſo weariſome as a wealthye man, beeing fooliſhe.</p>

                  <p>But what fooliſher thinge is there, then for a man (to thende he maye beare greate Porte and Swaye throughe hys wealth, rycheſſe, and reuenues) to get <note place="margin">Frendes the beſte treaſure.</note> other things that are ſought for, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, Horſes, Seruauntes, Apparayle, Worſhippe and coſtlye Plate: and not to gette freendes being the beſt and (as I may ſay) the goodlyeſt furniture that can bee in this lyfe?

theſe other thinges ſhould continue, whiche are but as it were the Giftes of Fortune, yet a clowniſh life, deuoide of freendes cannot be pleaſaunte. But of theſe matters hytherto.</p>
                  <p>Now muſt we ſet down the Bounds that are in Frendſhippe, &amp; (as it were) <note place="margin">Bounds of Frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship. Three o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pinions of Frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shippe.</note> the Lymites, or Buttinges of Loue: whereof I doe ſee three opinions: of the which, I do allow neuer a one.</p>
                  <p>One is, that wee ſhoulde in the very ſame ſort be affected towardes our fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as wee be towardes our ſelues. <note place="margin">1</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>An other is, that oure goodwyll to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our frendes, be likewiſe equally <note place="margin">2</note> correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to their good wil towards vs.</p>
                  <p>The thirde, that ſo much as euerye man ſetteth by himſelfe, ſo much hee <note place="margin">3</note> ſhould be ſet by, of his frendes.</p>
                  <p>To none at al of theſe three opinions do I agree. For the firſte is not true: that as euery man is towardes himſelfe, ſo alſo ſhoulde hee bee affected towardes his freende. For how many thinges do wee for oure Freendes ſake, which wee woulde neuer doe for our owne cause?
<pb facs="tcp:8322:29"/>
As to crouche &amp; ſue in oure freendes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe to an vnworthye man: to bee ſore bent againſt any body, and to rattle him vp very ſharpely: which things to do in caſes of oure owne, ſtandeth not well w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> honeſtye: but in our frendes behalfe, are moſt honeſt &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable. And manye things there be, wherein honeſt men do abridge themſelues ſomewhat of theire owne gaines, and are well contented y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould ſo be, that their frendes rather then themſelues might enioy them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond opinion is it, which defineth Frendeſhip w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> equal Curteſies, &amp; wills: but truly this were too ſtrict deali<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to cal Frendſhippe to accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; reckning, how many pleaſures haue bene done, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo many may again be receiued. Me thinkes, that true Frendſhippe is a greate deaſe richer and ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifuller, and doth not ſo ſtrictly ſee to his recknings, that he graunt no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he receiued. For there is no ſuch feare to bee taken, leaſt there be any thinge loſt, or leaſte it <note place="margin">We ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not do to mut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch in fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyp.</note> ſhould be ſpilt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or leaſt we heap vp too much meaſure in Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8322:29"/>
The third Bound or End is worſt of al: whiche is, that howe much euerye man ſetteth by himſelfe, ſo much hee ſhoulde be ſet by of his frends. In ſome there is manye times eyther a quayled courage, or a comfortles hope of amending their eſtate. Therefore it is not a freendes parte, to be ſuche vnto him, as hee is to <note place="margin">Comfort &amp; chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Frendes.</note> himſelfe: but hee ought rather to ſtudy and deuiſe which way hee maye recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte the appalied mynde of his freende, and to put him in good hope of a better amendement.</p>
                  <p>Wee muſt therfore preſcribe an other kind of true Frendſhip: but firſt I wyl tel you, what thing it was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> was wont moſt to find fault withal. He ſayd that there coulde not bee deuiſed anye worde more directlye againſte Freend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe: <note place="margin">A ſaying repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp.</note> then his was, which ſayde that a man oughte ſo to loue, as thoughe hee ſhould one day againe hate. And that hee could not bee perſwaded to thincke that this was euer ſpoken (as it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed) by <hi>Bias,</hi> who was accoumpted one of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vii. wiſe Sages: but rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it
<pb facs="tcp:8322:30"/>
was the opinion of ſome lewde and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious perſon, or of one that would rule al thinges by his owne power and auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as he luſt himſelfe. For how can anie man be frend to him, whoſe enemie hee thincketh that hee ſhall one day bee?</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, nedes muſt he deſire &amp; wiſh, that his freende might very often offend, to the end hee may thereby haue (as it were) the moe occaſions to finde fault with him. Againe, he muſt needes frette, ſorow, and ſpighte at his frendes wel doinges and commodities.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore this note (whoſe ſo euer it is) is ynough to take Frendſhip quighte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. This Rule rather ſhoulde haue bene preſcribed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee ſhoulde employe ſuch diligence in the gettinge of freen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, that wee ſhould not at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to loue him, whom at anye time wee might after hate. Yea, beſides, if we haue not had good happe in the chooſing of our frendes: yet <hi>Scipio</hi> thought, that men ſhould beare w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that miſchance, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to ſeeke occaſion to quarell, &amp; fall out.</p>
                  <p>Theſe bounds therfore I thincke are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8322:30"/>
beſt to be vſed, that when the maners of freendes bee well qualefied and honeſt, there ſhould bee among them, a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al their gooddes <note place="margin">Among honeſte frendes al thinges should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> purpoſes and willes withoute anye exception. As if the caſe were ſo, that ſome dealinges of our freendes, beinge not verye honeſte, were to bee holpen: which concerned either theire lyfe and death, or their fame and credite: wee <note place="margin">Novv and then vvee muſt not ſticke to ſtep a lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle aſide to ſaue our fren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des life or credite.</note> muſt ſtraine oure ſelues a little to ſteppe awrye, out of the waye, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vtter ſhame and diſhoneſtye enſue not therupon. For there is a ſtint, howe farre Frendſhippe may be pardonable. Neither muſt we ſlightly neglect our fame. We muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thincke, that the good wil of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is no ſmal furtheraunce to that chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge <note place="margin">Good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vvil of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple.</note> of any dealinges: which with gla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueringe &amp; flatterye to get, is ſhameful &amp; diſhoneſt. Therfore Vertue hauing har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty loue folowing it, is not to be deſpiſed. But he, oftentimes (for now I returne to <hi>Scipio,</hi> whoſe whoole talke was of Frendſhippe) complayned, that men were in al other thinges more diligent: as, that euery man could tel how many
<pb facs="tcp:8322:31"/>
Goates and Sheepe hee had, but that bee coulde not recken howe manye fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des hee had: and that in compaſſinge and ſtoaring himſelfe with the one, he beſtowed greate care: but in the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge of his frendes he was verye negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente and rechleſſe: neither that they had anye Tokens or Markes whereby to iudge what perſons were fitteſte for Freendſhyppe.</p>
                  <p>Wee muſte therefore chooſe ſuch as bee Sure, Stedfaſte, and Conſtante: of which ſorte there is greate ſcarſity: and an harde matter is it to iudge of them without tryall.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt in Freendſhyppe make tryall: for ſo Freendſhyppe precedeth oure iudgement, and taketh away the power of Tryall.</p>
                  <p>It is therfore a Wiſemans parte, ſo to ſtaye the vehement earneſtneſſe of his good wyll, euen as bee woulde ſtay his <note place="margin">Tryal of Frendes.</note> race in runninge: to the intent we may ſo vſe oure Frendſhippes, as men vſe to aſſaye their horſes: makinge ſomewhat a tryall of the manners of our frendes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:8322:31"/>
Some manye times in a ſmall paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringe monye matter, are perceyued, <note place="margin">Money.</note> howe diſcreditable and vnconſtant they bee. Some againe, whom a ſmall portion coulde not tempt, are in a great Summe knowen what they are.

For mannes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is frayle &amp; weake to refuſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the which if they maye attaigne vnto, (although without hauing any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde at all of Frendſhippe) they thinke themſelues to be excuſable: becauſe thei neglected and deſpiſed Frendſhippe not without cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Therfore true Frendſhippe is verye harde and rare to be found among them <note place="margin">True fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship hard to befou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d amonge great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> whych are placed in Honour, and beare rule in the Common weale.</p>
                  <p>

For where ſhal a man finde one, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and ſetteth more by the honoure of his freend, then he doth by his owne?</p>
                  <p>What?

and ſuch an one, as wil be mooued wyth the ſelfe ſame thinges that wee bee: all whiche thinges pertaine vnto faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

                  <p>Hereunto muſt be added, that a freende muſt neither delight in accuſing, nor be leeue any accuſations, beinge broughte vnto him: which thinges do belonge to that Conſtancie, wherof I ere while en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.

                  <p>For it is the part of a goodman (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo we may tearme a Wiſe man) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue <note place="margin">Good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>There muſt alſo (beſides this) bee a certaine pleaſauntnes of talke and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <note place="margin">Pleaſaunt talke.

                  </p>
                  <p>Certes it hath in it a certayn grauitie, but Freendſhippe ought to bee more at large, more at libertie, pleaſaunter and to all curteſie and gentleneſſe more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>

                  <p>A doubt (doubtleſſe) vnſemely for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtand vpon. For there ought not to be ſaciety of frendſhip, as there is of other thinges. The oldeſt (like olde Wynes) ought to be pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teſt: &amp; true is the old

                  <p>And as touchinge the Horſe (wherof I ſpake erewhile) if there bee no cauſe of lette to the contrary: there is no man but had leyfer occupie him whom hee hath beene vſed vnto, then one that is ſtraunge to hym, and vntamed.</p>

                  <p>But this is a very high pointe in Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp, that the Superiour is equal with <note place="margin">A chiefe point in fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dshipp</note> the Inferiour.

                  <p>And firſt, a man muſt doe aſmuche for his frend as he is poſſibly able: &amp; next, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> party who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loueth &amp; would further, is able to diſcharge.

                  <p>Truth is gallinge and greuous, for oute of it proceedeth Hatred, which is vnto Frendſhippe a rancke poyſon: but Soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge <note place="margin">Truth.</note> or Flattery is a great deale more gallinge, which by wincking at his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>But in ſoothinge (becauſe I delight to vſe <hi>Terence</hi> his worde) let there be <note place="margin">Flattrye is to bee eſchued.</note> a curteous gentilneſſe vſed withall, and let al flattery (the egger on of vices) bee ſet aparte, which (in deede) is vnmeett not onely for a freende, but alſo for anye honeſt man.</p>

                  <p>Although this flattery be pernicious and hurtfull, yet can it hurt no man but him, that liſteneth to it, and is delighted with it. And ſo it commeth to paſſe that he moſt openeth his eares to flatterers, who ſelfely flattereth himſelfe, &amp; moſte delighteth in himſelfe.</p>

as the one wil not heare the Truth, and the other is ready to lye: neither would the glauering flattery of theſe Paraſits and Trencher Freendes in Comedies, be any whyt pleaſaunt or mery, if there were not ſome glorious Souldiers.</p>

alwayes hadde the dayly feelinge of it, but alſo vnto all oure poſterity, ſhall it bee noble and notable.</p>
                  <p>No man ſhall euer enterpriſe anye worthye attemptes, eyther in courage or hope, which deemeth not the memory or image of this noble perſonage, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye to be ſet before him for a Paterne. <note place="margin">A true frend is the ſureſt poſſeſſion</note> I truly among al the thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Fortune or Nature hath beſtowed vpon me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue nothing comparable vnto <hi>Scipio</hi> his Frendeſhippe.

the Oldeage of a valiaunt &amp; Victorious borſe. For the nynthe yeare after hys Death, theſe twaine, <hi>T. Flaminius,</hi> &amp; <hi>M. Attilius</hi> were created Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuls, &amp; hee himſelfe died whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>For as far as I do remember I finde Four principal cauſes, why Oldage ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth wretched and miſerable.

Wee muſt reſiſt Oldage (O <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelie)</hi> and the faultes that bee in it, muſt by diligence be recompenced.

                  <p>Now if youthful Age, delight &amp; enioy theſe foreſayd Pleaſures, the reaſon is, firſt becauſe it is more wylling to enſue ſmall matters, &amp; of light importaunce,

                  <p>But what a ſinguler commoditye is this, that the Mind being as it were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and worne oute of the ſeruice &amp; thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Senſualitie, Ambition, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Quarrelling, and all filthy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, kepeth itſelfe within his bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>What faulte of Oldeage is this, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens you ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to You<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g age?

                  <p>For admitte and graunt, that wee lyue euen tyll the vttermoſte of oure Age. Let vs hope to lyue as longe as euer <note place="margin">Arganto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nius liued 120. yeres</note> did the Kynge of the <hi>Tarteſsians.</hi> For there was (as I fynde in Hyſtories) one <hi>Argantonius</hi> Prince of the Iſles called <hi>Gades,</hi> who reigned Foureſcore yeeres, and lyued an hundred and twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>But to mee, there ſeemeth nothinge longe. wherein is anye Extreeme, or Ende. For when that Ende is once come, then is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is paſſed, quight gone: and nothing remayneth but only that, which a man hath by his Vertues and good deedes atchieued.</p>

                  <p>For a ſhort tyme of Age is longe y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to lyue well and honeſtlye. But if you continue yet longer, you muſte no more be diſcontented thereat, then Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen be, after the pleaſauntneſſe of the Spring ſeaſon once paſſed, to haue <note place="margin">Spring</note> Sommer &amp; Autumne to ſucceede.

                  <p>Now, the fruit of Oldage is (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue often ſayde) the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance and ſtoare of Goods, before tyme got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

And what is ſo agreable to Nature, as for Oldmen to dye? which thinge hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto Youngemen, euen Maugre Natures Goodwill.</p>
                  <p>Therfore Youngmen ſeeme vnto me ſo to dye, as when a raging flame of fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">Yongme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter payne in dyinge then Old<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men.</note> is with the great quantitye of water que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched.

And as Apples when they bee greene and vnrype, are plucked from the Tree with violence: but being rype and mellowe, they fall downe from the Tree: euen ſo, violent force and painfull ſtrugglinge, taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye lyfe from Youngmen: but from Oldmen, a rypeneſſe and maturity.</p>
                  <p>Which is to mee ſo pleaſaunt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, that the neerer I drawe to Death, the ſooner mee thinckes I doe (as it were) ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> land, &amp; ſhall at length after a long Nauigation, arriue at the Hauen.</p>
                  <p>Of al other Ages, the certein terme is appointed how long ech laſteth: but of

Oldage there is no certeine terme limi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted: <note place="margin">Oldage hath no certen nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Whereupon it hapneth that Oldage is endued with greater Courage and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſitie, then Adoleſcency and Youth is. <note place="margin">Oldage ſtout and ful of cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage.</note> And this is it that was aunſwered by <hi>Solon,</hi> vnto <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> the Tyraunte, demaundinge of him, vppon what hope <note place="margin">Solons an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſvvere to Piſiſtr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus the Ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raunt.</note> and confidence, he durſte bee ſo bolde &amp; preſumptuous, ſo deſperatelye to wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and diſobey his proceedinges? <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon the hope</hi> (quoth he) <hi>of mine Oldage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the beſt Ende of lyuing is this: when as (the mynde beinge whole and perfect, and all the wyttes and Senſes ſounde &amp; vnappayred) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame Nature w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> compacted and framed the worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth lykewiſe diſſolue and lewſe the ſame.

                  <p>There is a notable ſaying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man <hi>Solon,</hi> wherein he proteſteth, that he would not haue his Death to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bewayled, and vnlamented of his Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. <note place="margin">Solon vvished to haue his death bevvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> His meaninge (I thincke) is, that he would bee entierly deare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Frendes.

            <p>And what ſkilleth it to be talked of &amp; remembred by them, which ſhalbe born hereafter, ſithens there was no reporte made by them which were borne before: who (doubtleſſe) were neyther fewer in number, and certes, were better Men a great deale?

Therfore knowe this, that thou art a God, if (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoth) a God be that, which lyueth, which <note place="margin">The mind ruleth and directeth the bodye</note> feeleth, which remembreth, which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth, which doth ſo wel rule, gouerne &amp; moue that Bodye ouer whom it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Ruler, as that moſt high prince God, doth this Worlde.</p>
            <p>And as God beinge himſelfe eternal, doth moue this World, beinge in ſome parte mortall: ſo likewiſe the Mynde being ſempiternall, doth moue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bodie being frayle and tranſitorie: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is euer moued, is eternall. But that which bringeth motion to another, and which ſelfe ſame, is mooued from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, when it hath an end of mouinge, nedes muſt it haue an end of liuing alſo.</p>
            <p>Therfore that only which moueth it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, becauſe it is neuer forſaken nor left of itſelfe, neuer (trulye) ceaſeth it not to

be moued. Moreouer, this is the fountain and beginninge of mouinge to all other things that are mooued. And the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath no originall: For all thinges proceede and ſpring from a Beginning, but itſelfe can be made of nothinge.</p>
            <p>For that which ſhould haue genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion elſwhere, could not be a beginning.</p>
            <p>So therfore if it neuer ſpring and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne, neyther doth it euer dye. For the Beginning being extinct, neyther ſhall itſelfe euer grow again out of an other, neither ſhal it create any other of itſelfe. For al thinges muſt nedes ſpring from a Beginning. And ſo it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the beginning of mouing is, becauſe it is mooued of itſelfe, and it can neither breede nor dye: or els the whole Heauen would fal down, and al Nature would of neceſſitie ſtand at a ſtaye, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne anye force and power wherebye to bee mooued with his firſt impulſe and motion. Sithens therfore it playnly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that what ſoeuer is moued of it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, is eternall: who is he that dareth to denye this Nature to bee geeuen to
<pb facs="tcp:8322:136"/>
Myndes for that is without lyfe, which is moued wyth externall force and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but that which is a Soule, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with internall &amp; proper mouing: for this is the nature and power that is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier to a Soule. Which if it bee one &amp; the alone thing of al, which moueth it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, certes it was neyther borne, &amp; is al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo eternall. This ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou exerciſe in the beſt thinges.</p>
            <p>And the beſt cares that a man can ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, are ſuch as tend to the auayle &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite <note place="margin">Beſt cares that aman can nexte after God employe his minde vnto.</note> of our Country.

            <p>For the Minds of them that haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled &amp; geuen themſelues to bodylye Pleaſures, and haue made theymſelues (as it were) the Bondſlaues &amp; miniſters
