            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

these sweatie distillations of my fatigated

out into three Bottles or Gallipots, and
for orders sake (because I am to speake of an
Order) haue thus ranked and collocated. In
the first shall bee put the Etymologie of the
most famigerated and farre decantated word
of <hi>Garter;</hi> In the second, the memorable
foundation of this magnificent Order; In the
third, the resplendent dignitie of the illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Knights and companions of it. For
the Etymologie, I may fetch it out of the
French or out of the Greeke. In the French
(as those that are intelligent in the language
haue informed me) it may seeme to bee fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
from the word <hi>Garroter,</hi> which is, to
fetter or manacle, emblematically implying
that it fettereth, chaineth, and linketh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the associates of it in loue amongst
themselues, and in loyaltie to their Prince.
In my second Etymologie borrowed from the
Greeke idiome, I may call it <hi>Garter, quasi
Carter,</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifying the head, and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:9178:22"/>
to preserue; because that as an ordinarie
garter bound about the head of any plebeian
when he would giue his members repose, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigateth
the ach of the head, and maketh
him sleepe in case and quiet; So this Regall
<hi>Garter</hi> making as it were a circle in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

And thus haue I euacuated the first Bottle
of my distillation. In my second infusion I
promised the first institution and primarie
foundation of this nobilitated Societie, and
that was at the famous Citie of Burdeaux in
France by that most renowned King <hi>ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VVARD</hi>
the third, who hauing first tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vpon the French <hi>Floure de Luces</hi> with
the English Lyons, hath made euer since

that it may for venerable antiquitie hold his
ranke aboue all the Orders of Christendome,
aboue that of the Annunciada of Sauoy, of
the Golden Fleece of Burgundie, of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantares
or Calatrauaes of Spaine, or of that
of Saint Michael, or of the Holy Ghost in
France: And for that of Saint Michael
the reason is most euident and eminent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
French Saint Michael doeth but on
foote like a Pedant trample vpon his Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.
But English Saint George doeth on
Horse-backe like a Caualier pessundate a
Dragon no lesse direfull then the other. And
this is the liquor of my second Bottle. For
my last infusion, it shall not neede any curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sublimation or extraction, to make the
persume odoriferous. The whole Europaean
Territorie is abundantly possessed with the
renowne and <hi>Splendor</hi> of this Princely Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
What Prince is so illustrious, what
<pb facs="tcp:9178:23"/>
Potentate so potent, what Monarch so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crested,
that doeth not esteeme his Celsitude
conspicuously signified, his Maiestie Royally
dignified, and his Sublimitie gloriously mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by being condignely qualified with the
resplendent honour of the English <hi>Garter</hi>?
To be silent of the rest of the Heroical No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
of this our Iland that either haue bene
aunciently possessed, or bee now recently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested
into it (betwixt whose persons and
their Order there is a reciprocall contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of honour and dignitie, they nobilitating
their Order, and their Order them) if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else were added to make it transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
Noble, it had enough of this that
your Graces Princely Legge is inringed in
the <hi>Garter,</hi> your Honoured shoulders inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
with the Collar, and your Noble
breast condecorated with the rich Image of
worthy Saint <hi>George</hi> on Horsebacke. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Legges being kept to their vocation
with Garters of an other kind, and my bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Collars of a different matter; yet haue I this
day shewed my dewe affection to doe seruice
to that Noble societie, and principally to
your thrise-noble Grace, as a beggarly Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymist,
a fragrant Apothecarie, or an honest
Yeoman of the Bottles; all which Bottles

<hi>Starre</hi> is not afraid lest hee should make
such an end, that is, die such a death as
they do whose example in lying he imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth.
He coaceruateth and conglome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
a meere farrago of lyes. Also hee
traduceth me about the smalnesse and
commonnesse of my Voyage, as hauing
beene out of England but fiue moneths.
Can he iustly call this a smaland co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
Voyage to passe almost two thousand
miles by land? to expose ones body to
such a world of iminent dangers both by
Sea and Land as I did? to passe those
stupendious mountaines of the snowie
Alpes? to dispatch my iourney with such
a compendious celeritie? to performe it

Linnen Draper? to walke aboue
the clouds ouer hils that are at least seuen
miles high? For indeede so high is the
mountaine Senys I passed ouer, which
disterminateth Sauoy and Piemont: the
danger whereof is such, that if in some
places the traueller should but trip aside
in certaine narrow wayes that are scarce
a yard broad, he is precipitated into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Stygian <hi>Barathrum</hi> or Tartarean lake
sixe times deeper then Pauls tower is

the Alpine cutthroates called the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits?</hi>
Being entred into Italy, to passe

<hi>Phalaris</hi> his brasen <hi>Bull,</hi> or the exquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

wont to inflict vpon offendors? These
dangers and many more I was exposed
vnto, and like to bee circumcised in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice
amongst the Iewes for maintaining
<pb facs="tcp:9178:27"/>
the cause of my Sauiour and Redeemer
against their refractarie obstinacie, as

Knight Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> our

being as desirous to see my natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

England before the fire of Italy, I walked
alone asoote with one onely paire of

            <head>AN INTRODVCTION
TO THE ORATIONS ENSV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING,
VVHEREIN IS DECLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the occasion of the first making
of the said Orations.</head>
            <p>IT hapned in the yeare 1606. that the
Church stocke of my natalitiall Parish
of <hi>Odcombe</hi> being exhausted &amp; spent
sauing sixteene shillings, some of my
friends of the Parish, amongst the rest
the Church wardens sollicited me to set abroach my wits,
and inuent some conceited and plausible matter, to the
end to draw some great company of good fellowes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the benefit of our Church of <hi>Odcombe,</hi> seeing
they knew that I was well acquainted in the countrye.
Hereupon I resolued to muster vp out of the Parish one
hundred choise and ablemen, as were fit to beare armes
in the field, and by a time limited, euen the VVhitson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
following about sixe of the clocke in the morning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them to meete me at <hi>Odcombe</hi> Crosse. VVhich
<pb facs="tcp:9178:29"/>
they did according to my appointment, being furnished
with conuenient munition for a kinde of warfare. For
some of them had muskets, others Caliuers, some Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans,
some Halberts, with diuersity of other weapons.
Likewise we had good Martiall Musicke and military
officers. I my selfe being their Captaine, was mounted
vpon a goodly milk-white steed, vnto whom that verse
of <hi>Virgil</hi> which he made vpon Queene <hi>Didoes</hi> horse,
might be well applied.
<q>Stat Sonipes, ac frae na ferox Spumantia mandit.</q>
And hauing put my whole centurie into a conuenient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
marched forward with them towards the towne of
Euill three miles distant from <hi>Odcombe,</hi> being met by
the way by the Oppidanes of <hi>Euill,</hi> that consisted of two
cohorts, one Masculine &amp; another Faeminine, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
vs like a company of Amazones, &amp; aftert here
had bene some two or three volleyes of shot discharged
on both sides with a prettie kinde of velitation or light
skirmish, we descended a hill called Henford,
and entred the towne. In the market place whereof nere
to the Crosse, wee had one skirmish more, but vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braticall
and imaginarie. Then I ascended an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and conspicious place about the Crosse, where
was erected a kind of Canopy, vnder the which I aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my selfe alone, and after the warlike Musicke was
ended, hauing two or three times brandished my naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sword,
I spake this Oration following to the <hi>Euillians,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9178:29"/>
and at the least two thousand people more, that then
flocked together to the towne of <hi>Euill</hi> from many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes

ye haue borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

manner, according to the forme of martiall
discipline before the face of your whole towne,
and your fraternities: I will alledge two causes
why ye ought to pardon our boldnesse in this
behalfe. First, because I that am chosen to be their
Generall Captaine, haue euer from mine infancy
borne that loue to your towne, that I thought
good at this present to make an apparant demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
thereof by some extraordinary action;
being also the principall animator of my whole
band of soldiers to ioyne their hands, their hearts
and their purses with me for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this my resolued proiect. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
although we are come vnto you with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
<pb facs="tcp:9178:30"/>
instruments, yet not with a martiall resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to inuade the precincts of your incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by force of armes, to brandish our glittering
and refulgent swords after a terrible and warlike
sort against you, to bereaue you of your ancient
priuiledges and immunities, to ransacke your
houses and your goods, to subuert your whole
estates, to lade our selues with the rich spoyles of
conquered enemies, to put some as obstinate and
stiffe-necked rebels to the furious and irrelenting
di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of our swords, to embrace others with the
ar...es of mercy that shall humbly submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into our hands, and after to carry them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
into most lamentable captiuity. These mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(deare Consederates) we neuer as much as
harboured in our thoughts; much lesse intended
to put any such hostility in execution. But veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we are come vnto you for a contrary purpose,
namely, to offer our selues euen of our owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
vnto you in a league of friendship, yea such
a league, the like whereof made betwixt vs <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combians</hi>
and you <hi>Euillians,</hi> neither antiquity hath
recorded, nor the time wherein wee liue hath
seene, nor succeeding ages could haue hoped for,
had not we <hi>Odcombians</hi> at this present out of the
sincere affection we beare you, sued vnto you for
this confederacy. Moreouer we are come vnto
you for another cause, which is very honest and
<pb facs="tcp:9178:30"/>
religious: for we determine to spend our money
with you for the benefit of your Church, hoping
yea most earnestly crauing to receiue the like cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
againe at your hands for our Church of <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe.</hi>
But before I vse any further speeches vnto
you concerning the confirming of this foresaid
league of friendship, I resolue, by way of preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or preoccupation, to communicate my slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
opinion into you concerning the lawfull
vse of that, for the which we are now assembled,
I meane Church ales; least any captious and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
wits should deem that we haue intruded our
selues into your liberties, as a very disorderly and
confused crew, rather to giue some cause of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
then to benefit your Church. Therefore
to the end I may illustrate this present matter by
relating examples of solemnities vsed in ancient
ages, vnto some whereof our Church-ales may
(in my opinion) be very fitly compared, I will
exemplyfie some few. The ancients celebrated so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
meetings at certaine times of the yeare for
their pastimes and recreations, as the Romanes

feasts of charity, which they called in Greek<note n="f" place="margin">Epist.tude. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pustult.Tertull.in Apolog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
because they were the verie meanes to confirme
mutuall amitie, and Christian charity betwixt
friends and friends. I humbly craue pardon for
mine errour (if at the least l erre) in saying that
these Church ales which we vse now in England
are very like to those <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the ancient Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
if they are rightly and religiously vsed, as they
ought to be without any outragious enoimities.
Truly I thinke they are: my reason is, because
these are feasts of charity, as those were, and they
were instituted by our ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t progenitors for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred years ago for these two causes of especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
First for the breeding of loue betwixt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
&amp; secondly for the raising of a stocke for the
supporting and maintenance of our Church, &amp;
the Church affairs: so that I do most confidently
beleeue that the good &amp; religious vse of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ales
<pb facs="tcp:9178:31"/>
may be well retained, if the abuses thereof be
vtterly banished, and exterminated out of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Commonwealth, as drunkennesse, glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
swearing, lasciuiousnesse, with many more,
which indeed I must needs confesse seeme to be
the inseparable accidents, and indiuiduall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts
of Church-ales. But ought the vse of
Church-ales, which were first destinated for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
intent, to be absolutely exti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pated, because
now and then some few abuses creepe into ciuill
and sober societies, by the meanes of some disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
rusticall, and ill-nurtured pessants? Surely
no. Neither ought they which doe so greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the lawfull vse of Church-ales soberly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
for the benefit of a stocke-spent Church,
incurre lesse reprehension, then that furious king
of Thrace<note n="g" place="margin">Hom.Ilia.6.</note>
                  <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who because many of his
subiects were often times drunke with the wine
that came from plentifull vineyards of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in his angrie passion, caused all the vines of
Thrace to be rooted vp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> an action verily most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
and inconsiderate. For it behooued him
rather to haue rooted away the abuse, I meane the
drunkennesse of his subiects, then to abolish
both the vse and the abuse cleane together. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs, at this our present meeting, (fellow
souldiers) imitate the feasts of those ancient and
religious Christians, not those of the prophane
<pb facs="tcp:9178:32"/>
and irreligious Gentiles, wherein were exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many lasciuious spectacles, that as certain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
hookes yeelded alluring baites to draw the
spectators to diuers vanities, and most inciuill
outrage: but we Christians ought at our solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to expresse a very patterne of modesty, and
temperance, yet so intermingled and seasoned <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticis
leporibus,</hi> that is, with the sauory salt of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
conceits, well beseeming both the time, the
place, and the persons, that they may neither sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of a rude scurrility on the one side, nor of a
too Cynicall austeritie on the other side, but keepe
the golden meane, which vertue betwixt both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes

Now for as much as this sociable &amp; neighborly
meeting, which doth tend to the aduancement
of our Churches wealth, cannot be performed
without some expences of mony, giue me leaue I
pray you to make some short digression from my

your money for so laudable a purpose. Be not I
beseech you slaues to your money, which is but
a base excrement digged out of the very bowels
of the earth. Worship not so dumbe an image,

mutuall obliuion of all iniuries whatsoeuer, euen
from the beginning of the world till this present

tyrants (who had most grieuously dilaniated
the whole State with very horrible massacres)
was abrogated and defaced out of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of Athens. Secondly, friendly, louing,
and harmelesse societie, ioyned with ciuill and
discreet merriments fit for this flourishing time
of the yeare. Thirdly, a cheerfull spending of
your mony without any base whinching or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
for the emolument of your Church. The
things that I prohibite you are these. Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

forbid you to commit any enormous outrage,
whereby we should scandalize our credit, and
make our selues infamous in our country. For

affirmeth in his third booke of Histories,
where he treateth of a league that was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
betwixt the Romans and the Carthaginians,
that there was another rite. For he saith thus. As
soone as the conditions of the league were agreed
on betwixt the parties, a certaine herauld of arms
<pb facs="tcp:9178:34"/>
took a stone in his hand, and vttered these words:
If I make this league without any guile or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
I pray the goddes to giue mee most happie
successe in my affaires. But if I doe, or as
much as thinke otherwise then according to
the couenants of the league, I wish that all the
rest being saued, I onely may perish, euen as
this stone shall by and by fall out of my handes:
and there withall hee presently flung away the
stone. As for the<note n="m" place="margin">Polydorios Virgilius lib.3. ca.15.de rerum inuentoribus.</note> Arabians, whensoeuer they

stone the palmes of the handes of them that
were to make the league, euen about their greater
fingers, &amp; incontinently taking a peece of flocks
out of the garments of both the Ambassadors,
annoynted seuen stones that were put in the

of their hands; and all the while they were occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
about this ceremonie, they inuocated <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi>

that contracted friendship and familiaritie

making leagues there were heretofore amongest

any iust comparison betwixt the glorious ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Miletus</hi> and our little parish, being
but as it were an handfull in respect thereof)
ought to be much the better regarded, by reason
of so worthy an helpe that it ministreth to couer
mans nakednesse. The third is the conspicuous
eminencie of our Church, being erected vpon so
loftie a place, that it ouerprieth and ouertop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth

And truly this our Church deserueth commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in consideration both of the nobility of
<pb facs="tcp:9178:37"/>
the founder, being one <hi>Moritonius</hi> an Earle of
Normandie, that came into this land (as I haue
heard) with <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror; and also of
the antiquitie. For it is at the least fiue hundred
yeares agoe since the first foundation thereof was
laid. The fourth is the varietie of our sweet and
wholsome springs, distributed by the prouident
artifice of nature into sundrie conuenient places
of our parish, as well for the delight as the vtility
of our inhabitants, and endued with that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and Cristalline cleerenesse, together with the
singular effects most inseparably therunto adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that we may presume to compare them with
whatsoeuer fountains are reputed the excellentest
in our whole countrey. The fift and last is
that which shall (I hope) encourage you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuere
most constantly in your league, namely,
our vnity &amp; perfect loue amongst our selues; for
we all from the verie highest to the lowest are
most firmly knit togither in an indissoluble knot
of friendship. It fareth not with vs as it dothof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
with citizens and townsmen. For they
are eftsoones so inraged and inflamed with the
burning 7 eale of ambition, that they foster many
turbulent factions, and oppose themselues in
such virulent and hostile manner against each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that now and then there fall out most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
broyles and mutinies betwixt them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:9178:38"/>
the strength of their societies is the sooner
weakened and dissolued: but wee <hi>Odcombians</hi>
conioyne our selues together in one, euen as the
members in mans bodie without any emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or repining at each others prosperous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and dispose our affections as a well-tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
harmonie, that they neuer suffer any iat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
discord. So that by this sympathie of our
neighbourly loue wee waxe the stronger, and
become euen inexpugnable to our enemies, if
at the least wee haue any. Heerein wee follow

commaunding them to breake those
arrowes as they were so bound; they tried, but
were not able to doe it. Whereupon hee tooke
the sheafe againe into his owne handes, and
hauing loosed the bond, hee easily brake all
those shaftes being sundred one from another,
which hee could not doe, when they were
bound together. By which token hee intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them that they should bee strong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible,
as long as they perseuered in the
bond of vnitie, but should quickly come to
vtter ruine and destruction, if by their priuate

in this our vnitie, so that not onely yee
your selues may cherish and embrace mutuall

sinceritie of friendshippe, by reason of this late
league confirmed betwixt vs, that wee may

towards you, as yee oppidanes are plentifully

that the defect of your entertainment shall bee
most abundantly supplied with the integrity of

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>AT the conclusion and vpshot of this
Booke, let mee a little aduertise
thee (gentle Reader) of a Booke
lately Printed in huggermugger, intituled
<hi>The Odcombian banquet.</hi> And I am the
rather induced to make mention of it, because
it doth not a litle concerne my credit to cleere
my selfe of two very scandalous imputation
laide vpon me by that virulent and ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
pessant, some base lurking pedanticall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebricous
<hi>Lucifuga</hi> that set forth the booke.
Wherof the first is the Motto in the first leafe
of the booke. <hi>A sinus portans mysteria.</hi> The
other in the end of the booke, euen in his <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerint
vniuersi,</hi> viz. That one that inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to epitomize it, affirmed hee could not
<pb facs="tcp:9178:41"/>
melt out of the whole lumpe of my Volume so
much matter worthy the reading as would fil
foure pages. For the first I will tell thee the
originall wherehence it sprang. It hapned
that after I had presented my Booke at Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston
to the King, and returned backe to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for Bookes to present to Noblemen of
the Court, I did determine for conceite sake,
and to minister occasion of merriment to the
King, to get me an Asse to carie my Bookes,
with this Latine inscription in faire Capitall
Romane Letters vpon that which should
haue contained them, <hi>Asinus portans my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steria;</hi>
being indeede taken out of Alciats
Emblemes, and spoken of an Asse that cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Image of the goddesse <hi>Isis.</hi> But heere
the diuulger of the foresaid <hi>Odcombian
Banquet</hi> most sinisterly and malignantly
applied it (as all the Readers doe interprete
it) to my selfe, and thereby very peruersly
wrested it from that allusion which I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
As for the second imputation contained
in his <hi>Nouerint vniuersi,</hi> it farre exceeded
<pb facs="tcp:9178:41"/>
the first in spite full bitternesse. For whereas
he writeth that hee could not melt out of the
whole lumpe of my Booke so much matter
worthy the reading as would fill foure pages,
I will boldly affirme for the better iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my Obseruations, and by way of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the malicious censure of that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percriticall
Momus, that of the sixe hundred
fiftie and foure pages (for indeede so many
are in the booke) he shall find at the least fiue
hundred worthy the reading, especially in my
descriptions of these Cities, Paris, Lyons,
Milan, Padua, Venice, Verona, Brixia,
Bergomo, Zurich, both the `Badens, Basil,
Strasbourg, Heidelberg, Spira, Wormes,
Mentz, Franckeford, Colen, &amp;c. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
I will further say for the confirmation of
the sufficiencie of my historicall notes, (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are so seuerely chastised by the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious
rod of this maleuolent traducer, that
biteth my worke with his Theonine teeth)
and yet without any vaine glorious ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
that let him or any other whatsoeuer in
<pb facs="tcp:9178:42"/>
our whole Kingdome of Great Brittaine,
shew both larger Annotations for quantitie,
and better for qualitie <hi>(absic dicto inuidia)</hi>
gathered in fiue moneths Trauels by any
English man since the incarnation of Christ, I
will be rather contented to consecrate all the
Bookes that remaine now in my hands ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to god <hi>Vulcan</hi> or goddesse <hi>Thetis,</hi> then
to present one more to any Gentleman that
fauours wit and learning. Therefore let
this <hi>Coryatomastix Zoilus</hi> barke at mee
as long as he list, swell with enuie as bigge as
the AEsopical Toade, and shoote all his darts
of malignitie against me; I oppose this double
thield stronger then the seuen fold Target
of Aiax in Ouid, for my securitie and defence
against him, first that it hath pleased the best
of the Kingdome euen from the Kings owne
person with all those sacred members of the
Royall family, and many Noble persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the best note of our land, as well as the
Lords of the Priuie Counsell, as other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
spirits of great eminencie, not onely to
<pb facs="tcp:9178:42"/>
affoord gracious entertainment to my booke,
but also with their courteous approbation and
candid censure to thinke well of my labours.
Secondly, that my vnparalled friend, that
voluble linguist &amp; sound Scholler M. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
Whitaker,</hi> who (I thinke) doth as
farre excell in learning my antagonist the
Author of the <hi>Nouerinti vniuersi,</hi> as a
rose doth a nettle in sweetnesse, or a Pearle
a Pebble-stone in price, hath vouchsafed to
confirme the authoritie of my booke (hauing
yeelded me that fauourable and patient at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to heare me reade ouer the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came to the Presse) with his no lesse
learning then elegant Elogie that preceedeth
my owne Obseruations. But to conclude this
matter of my malicious enemie, against the
violent stroake of whose base wrongs my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie
and integritie will like a brasen wal
defend me, I wish the same of them that an
ancient Poet did of the bitter Poet Archi
lochus;
