            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

on your Curtesies: hoping to finde you (as I
haue done hertofore) friendly. Being determined to
write of somthing, &amp; yet not resolued of any thing, I
considered with my selfe, if one should write of Loue (they will
say) why, euery one writes of Loue: if of Vertue, why, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
Vertue? To be short, I could thinke of nothing, but either
it was common, or not at all in request, At length I bethought
my selfe of a Subiect, both new (as hauing neuer beene written vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before) and pleasing (as I thought) because Mans Nature (com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monly)
loues to heare that praised, with whose pressence, hee is

            <p>
               <hi>Erasmus</hi> (the glory of <hi>Netherland,</hi> and the refiner of the Latin

excellent a Scholler, writ in praise of Vanity, why may not I write
in praise of that which is profitable? There are no two Countreys
where Gold is esteemed, lesse than in <hi>India,</hi> and more then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
the reason is, because the <hi>Indians</hi> are barbarous and our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>I haue giuen <hi>Pecunia</hi> the title of a Woman Both for the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

men. The brauest Voyages in the World, haue beene made for
Gold: for it, men haue venterd (by Sea) to the furthest part of the

two, of the first I writ this:

                  <l>The Waters were his Winding sheete, the Sea was made his Toome;</l>
                  <l>Yet for his fame the Ocean Sea, was not sufficient roome.</l>
               </q>
Of the latter this:

                     <hi>England</hi> his hart; his Corps the Waters haue:</l>

great estimation and account, this Lady <hi>Pecunia,</hi> both hath beene
in the Worlde, and is at this present, I leaue to your Iudgement.

her feete vpon <hi>Parnassus</hi> forked toppe, whose springing
Lawrels gaue shade, &amp; shelter to her wearinesse. This was
the fruitfull place where she plotted her flowrie garlands,
to crown the temples of vertuous followers, and wreathes
of renowme to illustrate vndaunted courages. Here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

businesse of importance, had such a care to effect it, as
that she would not be ouercome with pleasure, nor yeeld to
ease, (though in reason her laborious trauell did require
rest) but painfully passing vp and downe, was not moued
with the one, nor maistred with the other. At last as her
busie eye pried euery way, she espied a path of Uiolets,
whose tops were pressed downe with the steps of such as
had lately passed that way: by this she coniectured the
Nymphes were not farre off, and therefore following the
tract their f√©ete had made vpon the flowers, she was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

their seuerall exercises, whom when they saw (hauing salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

charge she would giue, or what shee would commaund to
be registred. To whome <hi>Fame,</hi> to the intent they might

towardnesse of their well qualified mindes, aduaunced not
with loftie titles, but praysed for the triall of their heroycal
truthes: of these must you indite, who though their states
were but meane, yet dooth their worthie prowesse match
superiours, and therefore haue I named them <hi>Worthies.</hi>
Nine were they in number, their Countrie <hi>England,</hi> the
Citie they liued in famous <hi>London,</hi> famous in deede for
such men, and yet forgetfull to celebrate the remembrance
of their names, and negligent, (I may say) in performing
the like attempts, hauing for imitation such goodly presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
as these to supplie them that want, with wisedome,
and with better instruction. I am determined to discourse
againe what I haue often bruted, thereby to stirre vp
sluggards, and to giue secure worldlings to vnderstande
(who extends no further then for wealth, and whose hearts
suppose a heape of coine the greatest happines) that the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of honour ought to increase, when as by substance they
arise to authoritie, and none so abiect but may be made a
subiect of glorie and magnanimitie, if so thereunto they
will bend their endeuours.</p>
            <p>For performance hereof, I knowe my theame so large,
and copious, as all your wits might ingenerall be imployed
to dilate and expresse the same, yet onely <hi>Clio</hi> shall be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
whome alone I make choise off, the rather because
it chiefly concernes hir, and so beckning towards her with
her head, made an end of her speach.</p>
            <p>She had no sooner sayd, but all the rest as satisfied in
that they desired to know, presently cast down their lookes,
<pb facs="tcp:21806:9"/>
that were before stedfastly fixed vpon the browes of <hi>Fame,</hi>
and began to turne to their labours, which all this while by
reason of her talke they had intermitted, onely <hi>Clio</hi> clasping
vp her booke of famous hystories, and taking her golden pen
in hand, rose from the seate where she sate, and leauing her
sisters with due reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, was readie to folow <hi>Fame</hi> where
so euer she would conduct her.</p>
            <p>At the doore of the enterance into the Arbour, there stoode
a siluer chariot drawne by the force of <hi>Pegasus,</hi> which <hi>Fame</hi>
of purpose had prouided, because <hi>Clio</hi> therein might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
keepe wing with her. Into the which she was no sooner
mounted, but straightway as swift as the burning dartes
of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> they made their passage through the subtle ayre,
vntill they soared ouer the hollow vault, through which the
way leadeth down to the rule of vnder earth: there <hi>Clio</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
her rayne, and with a headlong fall (according to her
guides direction) neuer staied vntill the st√©ely house of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasus</hi>
did beate against the gates of <hi>Tartara,</hi> where being
receyued in, they left the crooked thornie way smoking with
sulpher, and neuer ceasing contagious vapours, and kept
directly on the other side, which delighted their eyes with so
many glorious sights, that before they knew it, they were
arriued vnder the <hi>Elesian</hi> shades: where when the Goddes
had remained a while, discoursing with her companion the
seuerall habitations, as that of louers in sw√©ete groues of
muske she spide at last the place where <hi>Electrum</hi> growes,
sw√©etned continually with burning baulme boughes, with
which braue souldiours, and warlike cauilliers cured their
ranck scatres. There did shee shake her bright immortall
wings, and with the melodious noyse, and with the sweet
breath was fanned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> those <hi>Phoenix</hi> feathers she awaked

            <p>This, quoth she is the farthest end of our iourney, here
must we take our stations for a while, and those whom thou
seest eleuating their bodies from the ground, from whose
<pb facs="tcp:21806:9"/>

worthy Champions I told you of, whom, as by my power
I haue awaked: so will I cause to speake and declare their

as snow, vpon his backe a scarlet robe, his temples bound
about with baulme, and in his hand a bright shining blade:

               <p>WOrthily had this father of his Countrie the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
place in this discourse, whose valerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
may be a light to all ensuing ages, to
lead them in the darkenesse of all troublesome times, to the
resurrection of such a constant affection as will not faulter
or refuse any perill to profite his Countrey and purchase
honour. Such was his desert, as euen then when good
men dispaired of their safetie, and the verie pillars of the
common wealth tottered: his courage red√©emed the one,
and vnderpropped the other: <hi>Martialists</hi> and patrones of
magnanimitie, trembled at that which he beyond all expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
aduentured. Let enuie therefore retract the malice of
her blistring tongue, which heretofore (and now not a litle)
striueth by her contentious and ripening nature to obscure
the brightnesse of their praise, and scoffe at their ingenious
dispositions, whose education promiseth small: But yet
when occasion hath required, haue performed more then
they whose brags haue vapord to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clouds. I wish the like
mind, and the like loyaltie in all those that make the Citie
the Nurse of their liues, and subiect of their fortunes, that
<hi>London</hi> may continue stil that credite to be called the great
chamber of her kings, and the key of her Countreys blisse.
But to proc√©ede, <hi>Fame</hi> hauing marked the grauitie, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb facs="tcp:21806:12"/>
and orator-like gesture of this good knight during
the continuance of his talke, was so well pleased as shee
vowed to erect his stature, where in spight of al contrarious
and maleuolent blasts of vertues carpers, it should stande
immoueable: and <hi>Clio</hi> that had pend his speach, grieued she
had not leysure (as she desired, and he deserued) to set down
his actions in better and more ample maner: for alreadie
another of the knightly crew stood vp readie to delate what
<hi>Fame</hi> expected: therefore she was forced to let it somewhat
rawly passe, hoping that the excellency of the matter, would
excuse the rudensse of the rime.</p>
               <p>The next being a man whom nature had likewise bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with the colour and badge of wisedome and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
as one on whom a greater power then <hi>Fortunes</hi> faig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
deitie had bestowed, the fulnesse of worldly treasure,
and heauens perfection, beganne accordingly to frame
his tale.</p>

BY that time this famous man had thus innobled his
name by telling his nature, the pitifull and louely
<hi>Muse</hi> had delated at large his eternall honour, hauing
in no part b√©ene nigardly of his prodigall prayse: but <hi>Fame</hi>
dismissing him to his former rest, hard by a still siluer
streame that beate warbling <hi>Ecchoes</hi> into the vaultie
bankes, whereas deceassed <hi>Sea-nymphes</hi> vse to sport, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his manlike paulme vpon the ground, hee bent his
comely bodie to the earth: where not as possessed with
heauinesse, but with Paradice-like ioy he safely and sw√©ett<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
reposed his comely limbes: like as the woonted <hi>Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>
of former memorie were accustomed to doe, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
from hot encountred broyles, they vnbuckled
their steeld enclosures to enioy the fresh and delightsome

therefore vpon a bush of <hi>Iuniper</hi> brambles where <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie</hi>

with siluer wings: then from this sw√©ete sauouring thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
rowsed the tripping Deare, and after them the nimble
footed Fawne, wrestling together, once ouertaken with
pleasing and delectable sport, rubbing their horned
browes vpon their sweete twined bowers, this did they do
in fauour of his birth, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mitted to their gouernments
before his mothers milke had made him blithe.</p>
               <p>This pastime put the famous <hi>Seuenoake</hi> in minde of his

miserie, and ended it in miracles, not arguing herein her
vnconstant kinde, but her prouident foresight to withstand
the mischiefe of all misfortunes: and whilest <hi>Fame</hi> with
her admiring <hi>Muse</hi> was busied in posing the rest, this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious

not to be starke for want of courage. Therefore it shall not
be vncomly or preposterous when the yonger knights shall
speake after those that bare the honour of the Maioraltie.</p>
               <p>This excuse wel contented the labouring <hi>Muse,</hi> who fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

                  <hi>CLio</hi> with the straungenesse of this report, was wrapt so
much into admiration (both in respect of his feature,
fortune and faire tongue) as she s√©emed cast into a traunce,
neuer remoouing her eyes from of his youthfull face, till
<hi>Fame</hi> perceyuing her d√©epe cogitations, put herforth of
her dumps, by asking her why she pawsed so long, her chast
eyes (it appeared) hauing all this while s√©ene no other but
such, whose countenance resembled winters frosts, began
now with the chearefull heate of this flowring spring, to
<pb facs="tcp:21806:20"/>
waxe warme with secrete working of some amorous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to excuse with suspition (for it stoode with her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
not to b√©e faultie in any such idle toy) shee answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it was not the inticement of any misbeseeming phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie
that allured her to that sodaine silence, but onelie a
kinde of conceyte shee fostered, howe it coulde be possible
that the Turke being a man of nature barbarous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
and especially towardes Christians) should nowe bee
so much mollifyed, and brought from his wonted fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to fauour and honour one, whome by by nature hee
loathed and detested. For what though <hi>Bonhams</hi> valour
had gotten that aduantage, as by reason and law of armes
he might inforce the Turke confesse, the safegarde of his
life depended on his clemeneie, yet since the brutishnesse
of that nature esteemeth of vertue but to serue their owne
lust and profite, I s√©e no argument of likelihoode, why
the Turke hauing his aduersarie in his Court, that a
little before had made him bowe, not with gentle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
bue with downe-right strokes, should not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
b√©e incensed to cutte off his head, then doe him the
least good in the world: so seuere is the regarde of honour,
as rather then it will be vpbrayded with disgrace (though
that disgrace were cause of many incomparable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures)
no hatefull, vnnaturall, or vngratefull practise shall
be attempted, til the eyesore of their grudging heart be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued,
and Princes if they cannot heare words, much lesse
will put vp wounds, and that was it (quoth she) that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
my serious <hi>Muse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As these wordes <hi>Fame</hi> began to frowne, her pacience
was prouoked, that one so well instructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of such matters as sh√©e was (her whole studie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of nothing else but of ciuill discipline) should make
a doubt in so slender a contrarietie, yet to cutte off fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
protraction of time, shee replyed her this resolution:
that shee was sure sh√©e could not be ignoraunt, howe that
it was the affect of vertue that wrought such an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Turke, which, as it is diuine, descended from
<pb facs="tcp:21806:20"/>
the Goddes: so it worketh beyonde the expectation of
men. And for proofe thereof, alreadie sundrie authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were alledged, as that of <hi>Dyonisius</hi> whose murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
minde coulde not but reuerence <hi>Plato,</hi> although hee
continually inueighed bitterly agaynst his tyrannie, and
that of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who loued <hi>Darius</hi> for his fortitude,
although hee was his enemie. Therefore it ought not
seeme miraculous vnto her, when vsually such accidents,
as those followe <hi>Vertues</hi> fauourites: But (quoth she) I
rather thinke you were amazed to heare such rare exploits
proc√©ede from a Prentice, and one of no more experience:
but let not that seeme straunge, hee spake no more then
truth, nor all that might be sayd concerning his ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

endeuours: the other foure whom you see on his left hand,
will (if you seeme incredulous) confirme a possibilitie in
his speaches: they are of the like condition and qualitie as
he was, prentices that purchased estimation by the sworde.
<hi>Clio</hi> blushed that shee had beene so inquisitiue: but as it
may be coniectured, it was not so much for her owne satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
as to take away hereafter all controuersie, and
n√©edlesse cauillation as might concurre by the curious view
of such as shoulde fortune to haue the reading of her
lines. By this sir <hi>Iohn Bonham</hi> had coucht himselfe againe
in the bedde of his secure rest, when another gay knight,
sterne in his lookes, and strong set in his limmes, carying
in his browes the picture of <hi>Mars,</hi> and in his maners the

for his Countrey, as the custome of the ancient and famous

honour of their d√©edes to their Countrey. If this were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition

Therefore the Goddesse was faine to antimate him

he was and full of humanitie, insomuch that hee might
haue wunne all the powers of that place to admire the
basenesse of his profession being a weauer. But they that
haue honour harbouring in their breasts, cannot but giue
him the right of his due, except the traine of enuie see vpon

My passed prayse commaunds my soule remaine,</l>
                  <l>Wheerin these rosie bowers, with sweet dew fed:</l>
                  <l>Though I was valiant, yet my guiltlesse blood,</l>
                  <l>In crueltie of warre I neuer stood.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>THus this aduenturous Martialist hauing exprest the
zeale of his conscience towards his Countrey, the toyle
and labour hee sustained to better the tredite of his first cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and the perils he waded through to patronage the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
name of Citizens, he reposed himselfe againe downe
by the sides of his noble warre-fellowes.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Clio</hi> (the one hauing marked his amiable
partes and knightly gesture, the other delineated with her
pen the eloquence of his oratour-like Oration) questioning
togither some fewe poynts, concerning the force of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
&amp; the vertuous inclination of many obscure persons,
that although they like sepultured (as it were) without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,
yet if oportunitie fitte them to reuiue their courage,
will (like the Diamond racked out of clay) excell, or at least
compare with the brightnesse of glories. Rarest iewels
concluded that there was no pernition but by vertue, no
climbing to honour but by <hi>Fortitude,</hi> and none base, abiect
and ignoble but the vicious slouthfull, &amp; faintharted milke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops.
They were not wearyed, nor s√©emed these former
knights tales tedious vnto them, although many would
thinke it a paine to bee tied to the hearing of so large a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
and verie few but would exclaime it were plaine
slauerie to write such and so many seuerall conceytes from
the mouthes of the speakers. Yet such was their desire to
publish these mens deserts, and the delight they tooke to s√©e
the increase spring of the seedes of vertue, for they would
not take the finallest recreation, till euery one of the nine
had fully finished their discourses, and therefore they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
when the last would breath the secrets of his breast.</p>
               <p>This was a Printice as the rest, and a Grocer, sometime
dwelling in <hi>Cornehill,</hi> his face was not effeminate, or his
parts of a slender or weake constitution, but by his lookes
<pb facs="tcp:21806:25"/>
be seemed couragious, and in the height, strength<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and faire
proportion of his body, victorious. Thus being in al points
armed like a champion, the verie aspect of his outwarde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,
made semblance both of manhood and curtesie, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and valour, knit in such a simpathie of opmyeration, that
be s√©emed as much to bee loued for peace, as praysed for
prowes: and thus with a voyce neyther too meane like a
child, nor too big like a gyant, but indifferent betwixt both,
he spake as followeth.</p>
