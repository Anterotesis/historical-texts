            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That your ſelf came a worthy perſon into the World, your paternal Dignity will avouch; and that you are one who not onely love your Nation, but the Religion of it, I ſhall onely in proportion to the Synagogue ſay, You have lately at your own Coſt beautiſied the better part of the Houſe of God, not doubting but Beauty in Place, as well as in a Perſon, may be a great attractive; endeavouring to woe the People to worſhip their God in the Beauty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Having thus done, and hearing the following Sermon, you did more than deſire that it might be made publique; and merely therefore, becauſe it had for ſubject onely the Worſhip of God; which as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Service, hath not been in your hearing ſo plainly explicated, as you candidly concéived it is. Now, [honoured Sir] to gratifie you, and at your inſtigation to promote the Worſhip of God, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of ſuch who are not ſinely learned, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

my Endeavours, and your Deſires to the world. My Intention is good, the Acceptance dubious: but ſhall I pleaſe God and pleaſe you in ſo doing, I have my end.</p>
                  <p>There is annexed to the Sermon; [what many years hath lain in the poſture it now appears] which for the Brevity, Eaſineſs, and Time it was writ in, was much importuned. Thouſands [ſince the Glory of our Worſhip brake forth that diſmal Cloud, which many years it ſtood eclipſed in] I ſay, thouſands have now courted it as the riſing Sun; but by their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and mangling, and neglect of it, declare they receive it onely as an expedient to hold a Living: Whereas when that was writ, a Living was loſt for the uſing of it, and the Author ſuſpended by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Beggar <hi>[Tam ab Officio quam à Beneficio]</hi> for reading the Common-prayer without Book. The ſum is, that to worſhip God by a ſet Form, is the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and moſt certain advance of his Glory; and the ſecuring of the holy Duty from all impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. A Diſcourſe not unfit to accompany and wait upon a Sermon preciſely about Worſhip; which ſhall ſuffice at this time to trouble both your honourable Self, and the willing Reader.</p>

                  <p>Nor doth worſhipping <hi>in ſpirit and truth</hi> in the leaſt oppoſe this: For, if worſhipping in ſpirit and in truth were an oppoſition to <hi>material places,</hi> then we might not pray in our <hi>Cloſets,</hi> nor in our <hi>Chambers,</hi> nor in our <hi>Houſes,</hi> nor in <hi>Groves,</hi> nor in <hi>Fields,</hi> nor indeed upon <hi>God's Earth;</hi> for theſe are all <hi>material</hi> as well as Churches.

                  <p>By <hi>Worſhipping then in ſpirit and truth,</hi> there is no <hi>rejection</hi> of material places; no, neither of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> nor <hi>Geraſin,</hi> in order to <hi>Evangelical</hi> worſhip: For where Story telleth us, <hi>Eruptions of Fire</hi> would not permit the <hi>re-edifying</hi> of a <hi>Temple,</hi> even there at this day the Chriſtians have a <hi>Temple,</hi> and do worſhip.</p>

                  <p>And is it not proportionably ſo, even at this day?

                  <p>Nor is this extravagant, or beſide the Text: for, the Jews, whilſt yet they had but <hi>one God,</hi> had but <hi>one Temple;</hi> and in that Temple an <hi>

                  <p>The ſcruple then here propounded, as it is not about <hi>ſervice,</hi> ſo neither is it about <hi>private</hi> or <hi>inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> but it is about the outward, and about the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickworſhip</hi> of God; that is, <hi>where</hi> Sacrifice was to be made; <hi>where</hi> his <hi>publick Homage</hi> was to be paid; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Geraſin</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the <hi>place</hi> of publick worſhip.

he telleth the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> that hereafter the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of God would be in a clear <hi>other mode,</hi> neither confined to place, nor expreſt by Sacrifice; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Evangelical worſhip</hi> is the proper ſubject here to be enquired on, to wit,</p>
                  <p>What is <hi>that publick Worſhip</hi> which the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers ſhould uſe under the ſtate and condition of the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> which from the legal, I ſhall ſhew you, differs both in the <hi>Object,</hi> and in the <hi>Expreſſion:</hi> for, <hi>Veri Adoratores,</hi> the true Worſhippers they ſhall worſhip the <hi>Father,</hi> and him they ſhall worſhip in <hi>ſpirit and in truth.</hi>

The <hi>hour</hi> is coming, and now is, when the <hi>Law</hi> ſhall give way to the <hi>Goſpel; Moſes</hi> to Chriſt; the <hi>Jewiſh worſhip,</hi> which was then by <hi>Bullocks,</hi> Goats, and Lambs, to a <hi>ſpiritual worſhip,</hi> which ſhall require no ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, no ſuch Oblations.

                  <p>Hugely then are they miſtaken, who conceit, to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in ſpirit</hi> is a diſcharge to <hi>bodily</hi> or outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; when the oppoſition and the diſcharge it onely is againſt <hi>Moſaick and Samaritan,</hi> againſt Legal and againſt <hi>Idolatrous</hi> worſhip.

                  <p>By <hi>worſhip then in Spirit and Truth,</hi> we muſt here underſtand a compleat Worſhip; that is, the worſhip of the <hi>whole Man;</hi> Spirit and Truth, that is <hi>both.</hi> For, as the outward without the inward, is <hi>meer Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;</hi> even ſo the <hi>Spirit</hi> without <hi>Truth,</hi> the Minde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Members,</hi> will make but an halting and an <hi>halving Sacrifice.</hi> Yea, in <hi>publique,</hi> to worſhip in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit without <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of that Spirit, it is both a <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and an incredible worſhip: For, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably believe that man is <hi>ſober in ſpirit,</hi> whoſe

                     </q>
There is no real Nobility which hath not more of Virtue than Blood in it. And this ſeems patroniz'd by a great Fountain of Honour, even our bleſſed Lord and Maſter, who allowed the <hi>Jews</hi> to be the Seed, but not the Sons of <hi>Abraham:</hi> for he plainly tells them, it was Works and Imitation, not a Line or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, that made Children unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The witty Atheiſt who in his Dialogues brings in <hi>Galatea</hi> and <hi>Doris</hi> diſcourſing of the love of <hi>Polyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> tells her, ſhe ſhould not look upon his Deformity,
<pb facs="tcp:65858:20"/>
or minde his having but one Eye, and that in his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; for he was the Son of <hi>Neptune.</hi> But the nice Nymph replied ſmartly, <hi>An verò credis genus illi quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam profuturum ad formam?</hi> Thinkeſt thou that a Deſcent can make beautiful? or becauſe begot by a God, deformities are comely? Now truely as deſcent cannot make that lovely and amiable that is not ſo; ſo neither can deſcent make that honourable that is not ſo: For though I perfectly abhor to think that <note place="margin">Hoc propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum, quod Rebus crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pro ſuo jure utun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Beza</hi> in <hi>Hebr. 2. p. 8.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Dominium fundatur in Gratiâ,</hi> That Right or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety is founded in Grace, of that onely Saints have right to their Goods, or onely the godly party a juſt title to Riches and ſecular Dominion; yet may I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between real and ſecular Honour. I conceive ſuch to empty themſelves of all real Repute, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt themſelves of all due Honour, who by doing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy things make themſelves vile, unclean, and that which ſtands in direct oppoſition to what is truely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable: So that a man may as well argue, deformed and ugly <hi>Polyphemus</hi> was therefore beautiful, becauſe <hi>Neptune</hi> was his Father; as a Vitious perſon therefore truely and really honourable, becauſe a perſon of true honour got him.</p>
                  <p>To you [my honourable Neighbour] I therefore make my Addreſs, becauſe you have Honour of your own, Intrinſecal Honour, ſuch which you merit to be honoured and regarded for, Religion, Sobriety, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and the rare Grace of theſe times, Conjugal Chaſtity; no man rejoycing more with the Wife of his Youth, and [as the holy Pen expreſſeth it] ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed always with her love.</p>
                  <p>To you [worthy Sir] I have made bold to give the Patronage of what here followeth; which being a brief Aſſertion of a neceſſity of publickly worſhipping God by a ſet Form, I therefore make yours, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:65858:20"/>
beſide that perſonal Piety which your God alone is witneſs to, your prudence in your Family hath wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen conſtantly to uſe onely that Form which we rightly call Common-prayer. And indeed many, very many reaſons may be given to confirm your choice, and perſwade your imitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the Law of the Land <hi>Open Prayer,</hi> ſuch which is for others to come to hear, is onely the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church, our Common-prayer: So that if Law be a rule, and the regular man be the laudible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; he is moſt ſo who conforms to Law, and regulates himſelf and Family by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> An unknown Worſhip, it is a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble folly to an unknown God: For, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Athenians</hi> it was ſuperſtitious and unlawful for them to worſhip they knew not what, [though that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known was thought to be the true God:] Even ſo as unlawful it may ſeem [or elſe let Latine Prayers paſs] to worſhip a known God we know not how; which he who joyns iſſue in a conceived or unknown Prayer muſt needs do: For the Worſhip muſt be over, before he can judge of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To offer the Blinde, Lame, or Sick to God for Sacrifice, God himſelf hath declared Evil. But whoſoever ſhall bare his Head, fall upon his Knees, and be ready to joyn in the Oblation of he knows not what; he is in a preſent diſpoſition to offer up to his God [for ought he knows] the Blinde, the Lame, the Sick, that is, ſuch crude and unhallowed, both Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Expreſſions, as are unworthy the Almighty; yea, unfit to be preſented to a Governour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To offer that to our God which would not pleaſe our Governour, God abhors. Now what man amongſt us will be content that a Petition be drawn and proffered in his Name to a man of Power, and he
<pb facs="tcp:65858:21"/>
never ſee it, nor hear it read, till 'tis read and offered to the Governour? And ſhall we think it meet with leſs conſideration to offer up our Prayers to God, than Petitions to one like unto our ſelves?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Every conſidering man will finde, to the compleating of a publick Prayer, there muſt be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of theſe ſix Acts. 1. Hearing. 2. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. 3. Conſideration. 4. Judgement. 5. Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And Laſtly, Devotion. Now, whether theſe can be better managed when a man knoweth what to pray, or where a man muſt warily liſten what [through diſtance, or for not acquaintance with the Voice] he oft cannot underſtand, or underſtanding cannot ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly conſider and judge of, as to deem it a meet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for his God: Whether, I ſay, theſe acts can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be diſcharged [and <hi>Praeſtantiſſima quaeque Deo]</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a tranſient than a ſet Form, let every man ſo judge, as he will anſwer it to his God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Men of different Principles can never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably joyn in conceived or conceited Prayer. For, he who holds Original Sin in Infants, as ſuch, no bar to Salvation, he cannot abide that men in Prayer ſhould ſay they are damned before born, and came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world Brands of Hell-fire! Or ſuch who hold Sacraments have no effect but in the Elect onely, theſe cannot joyn in a preparative Prayer; but either they muſt have a Congregation of Elect onely, or they muſt raſhly ſay they know not what, and pray for ſuch grace for ſome preſent, which they pretend to know God will never give. And indeed, upon what but upon this, are built all the ſorry Objections againſt the Liturgy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Conceived Prayer, or, as they call it, praying by the Spirit, is for the moſt part a great cheat, being the main Product of a ready Tongue and a
<pb facs="tcp:65858:21"/>
ſtrong Memory, in which is treaſured up for all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions Scripture-Phraſes, Collections, Notes, and ſuch Expreſſions as are moſt taking and popular. For, that the Holy Spirit will put words into the mouth of any man, as he did once into <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs, ſuddainly and irreſiſtibly; or that by the Spirit of Prayer is meant a capacity to ſpeak in the Vocative Caſe an Hour or two, is not yet proved to a ſerious and a ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
                  <p>

Indeed they ſay the houſe of <hi>David</hi> typically repreſents the Church of Chriſt and the Children of God. But then by the Spirit of Grace and Supplications, they by no means mean the gift of Prayer, or a power of a ſudden to ſay what they liſt in the Vocative Caſe. For by the ſpirit of Grace, they onely mean an help from God to make Prayer in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers holy and acceptable, and that is far from long and indigeſted Rapſodies. And as for that upon which Fanaticks lay the great ſtreſs, the Spirit of Supplications; The Comment declines it wholly, and rather ſides with thoſe who render the Original by Compaſſion or Lamentation. So that this is a pitiful Bottom to cozen and cheat the people on, with, or to an expectation of ſuch a ſurprize of Spirit as ſhall make them pray what they liſt, and as long. And indeed both the learned in the Hebrew Tongue, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
<pb facs="tcp:65858:22"/>
bear againſt it: for albeit ſome conceive, as the vulgar Latine renders it, Prayer or Supplications may; yet as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> [whom I therefore quote, becauſe he hath prepared the Collection for me] upon the place obſerves, the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnine,</hi> the <hi>Tigurine</hi> Verſion, and <hi>Hierom</hi> [by what ſome Humoriſts call the Spirit of Prayer] they rather render Compaſſion, Commiſeration; a Minde tender and propenſe to pity and compaſſion. And indeed if we conſider the very next words, and by them mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the prime end of this promiſe, we ſhall finde the genuine and proper meaning of the Text muſt needs be thus:</p>
                  <p>I will pour upon the houſe of <hi>David</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Spirit ſo tempered with Grace and Tenderneſs, that they ſhall be ſenſibly touched and affected when they ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and ſhall mourn for him, as one who mourneth for his onely Son.

Bible,</hi> Geneva.</note> and elder Engliſh Verſions it is read thus, The Spirit of Grace and Compaſſion; and perchance had been ſo ſtill, had not this pretended gift of praying ſprung out not many years before the laſt Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>But ſince men have had an itch to magnifie their own gifts, and, as did the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> by long prayer to get into and deceive the people, ſet Forms of Prayer hath been mightily depreſt; as if thoſe Prayers were unworthy a Parlour, that did decore a Church. But,</p>
                  <p>If we ſhall look back to the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:65858:22"/>
ſixth, and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> we ſhall finde both at home and abroad, both in private and in publick, the Church-Prayers were venerable and of great uſe.</p>
                  <p>In the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, one <hi>Thomas Cotteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> put out the Church-prayers in the Singular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they might be fitted for a Cloſet and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Devotion, and accommodated to every day of the Week Morning and Evening: And he was held a very good man in his days, and [as I have been told] of the Puritan way.</p>
                  <p>In the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Hadleigh</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> [as in his Life appears] when his Wife came in an Evening to viſit him, his Evening-prayer was the Letany; and whilſt he lay in Priſon, his daily Prayers were the Service-book of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; and that Book he gave to his Wife as a pious Legacy. So that it was then no ſtrange thing to uſe the Common-prayer in a private houſe; nor was that arrogancy of Spirit in holy Breaſts, as to think no Prayer comparable to thoſe of their own conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>I may take God to witneſs [honourable Sir] I can ſay with a perfect Heart as <hi>Moſes</hi> once did <hi>[Numb.</hi> 11. 26.] <hi>Would God all the Lords people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them.</hi> But to hear ignorant, raſh, cunning and catching peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, calling their own, God's Spirit, and their crafty effuſions, the Breath of God and his Dictates; This my ſoul abhors; an indignation to this, was a great motive to the following Letter. I conceived a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity upon me then to aſſert a ſet Form, when an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of what was then called Prayer, ſavoured more of Diurnals, Deſignes, News, and Villanies, than of godlineſs, or purity of the Goſpel. Yea, the Spirits of too too many of my own calling are not yet
<pb facs="tcp:65858:23"/>
to be truſted to ſpeak what they liſt in Prayer, ſome yet taking occaſion rather to inſtil their preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, than to promote a ſincere and pure Devotion.</p>
                  <p>Now being it is ſo, that men of different Principles can never conſcionably joyn in a controverted Prayer, there ſeems to me even hence, a great neceſſity that Prayer ſhould be ſet and known; that Prayer ſhould be with ſuch prudence and care compoſed; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be in any of publick cognizance which hath any thing of private Intereſt and Deſigne in it.</p>
                  <p>In the Offices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Prayers, we ſee and hear too much of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon</hi> Aſh-wedneſday <hi>thus prayeth the</hi> Roman <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Omnipotent and eternal God, ſpare the Penitent, and be propitious to the Supplicant</hi>—Et mittere dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris Sanctum Angelum tuum de Coelis, qui Benedicat &amp; Sanctificet hos Cineres—<hi>And vouchſafe to ſend down thine holy Angel from Heaven, that he may bleſs and ſanctifie theſe Aſhes. Will you ſee to what end? It followeth</hi>—<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſint Remedium ſalutare Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Nomen Sanctum tuum implorantibus, &amp; ſemet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſos pro Conſcientia Delictorum ſuorum accuſantibus, ante Conſpectum Divinae Clementiae facinora deploran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, vel ſereniſſimam pietatem tuam ſuppliciter obnix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eque flagitantibus—</p>
                  <p>That they may be an wholſom Remedy to all who humbly call upon thy holy Name; and out of conſcience of their own demerits accuſe themſelves, deploring their heinous ſins in the ſight of thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Clemency, or humbly and earneſtly begging thy moſt ſerene Piety.</p>
                  <p>Et praeſta per invocationem ſanctiſſimi Nominis tui, ut quicumque eos ſuper ſe aſperſerint pro Redemptione peccatorum ſuorum, Corporis ſanitatem, &amp; Animae tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telam percipiant, per Chriſtum Dominum noſtrum.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65858:23"/>
And grant that by the invocation of thy moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name, whoſoever ſhall ſprinkle theſe upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the Redemption of their ſins, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the health of Body, and protection of Soul, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now this Collect having that in it which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Church allow not; for as much as we are wholly ignorant of any capacity in Aſhes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bleſſed and ſanctified; or of any promiſe made, that upon prayer for ſuch a Sanctification God will ſend an Angel from Heaven on ſuch an errand; we not believing that Aſhes are ordained to be an wholeſom remedy to all who humbly call upon God's holy Name, or that in order to remiſſion of ſin we may ſprinkle them upon our Heads; or if we ſhould, that thence ſhould iſſue (no not upon Chriſts account) health to our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or protection to our Souls: we [I ſay] disbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all this, cannot joyn in ſuch Petitions, neither give our preſence or <hi>Amen</hi> to ſuch a Prayer. And many, very many ſuch extravagances are in the <hi>Roman</hi> Breviary and Miſſal.</p>
                  <p>Now if Proteſtants generally opine it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful knowingly to be preſent when Petitions againſt their Judgement and Conſcience are to be offered up in Prayer and prefer'd to God; certainly then, it is at leaſt very dangerous for any Chriſtian to frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and unknown Prayers: For as bad, or worſe than any is in the <hi>Roman</hi> Liturgie, have done, and may come from men ſo praying. And this probably was a main reaſon that the Independants dropt off from the Presbyterians, and the Quakers both; for neither having common principles, neither could conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly endure to pray together. And indeed to an unknown Prayer a diſcreet man may very well ſay, he therefore will not be preſent at it. I profeſs, it is a
<pb facs="tcp:65858:24"/>
grand deſire of my Heart, that as there is but one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, ſo there might be one Fold. I ſhould rejoyce at nothing more, than an univerſal Communion, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Peace among Chriſtians; and perchance wiſe men will finde no one better expedient, than an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Worſhip, by ſuch a Form of Prayer, to which all ſincere and ſober Chriſtians might ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now a Form nigher to ſuch an one, wiſer than my ſelf have not ſeen any, than our preſent Liturgie: For let all the Exceptions to which the <hi>Roman</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary and Miſſal are lyable; and [could they be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred] let all the inſipid Excurſions, Vagaries, Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinences, and Follies of Extemporary and conceived Prayer be reckoned up; The Liturgie of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not in any proportion [for Exceptions] to be compared with either; our Compilers aiming as Chriſtians more at Unity, than at any diſcernable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>But the Porch begins to be too big for the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: and therefore, my moſt honourable Neighbour, I thus contract.</p>
                  <p>In Privacies, as Cloſets, let the devout proceed a Gods Name, to pour out their Souls by ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as may beſt heat Devotion, and beſt fix the Spirit: For words that moſt affect the Heart, and beſt ſute to private grievances and perſonal wantings, are the beſt expedients there: For indeed onely the Spirit of man knoweth what the Spirit would.</p>
                  <p>But when the religious Maſter in his Parlour ſhall call in his Family to publick Duty, then the Prayer, be it what it may, it would be ſet; and that were it onely therefore, that the weak and more ignorant might ſurely learn it, it being a very laudable and good thing, to miniſter Words as well as Grace unto the hearer; and alſo for this reaſon further to ſecure the
<pb facs="tcp:65858:24"/>
ſtranger, who upon this account can make but one hazard of his diſcretion; for then he ſhall be able to diſcern whether or no it be meet for him any more to joyn in ſuch a Form. But if any worthy and devout perſon would that all who lodge under his Roof, or come ordinarily to his Table ſhould joyn with him at his hours of Prayer [without ſome treſpaſs upon pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and civility] he can neither deſire nor require it; unleſs he ſhall uſe a known and a publick Form, and to chuſe the Common-prayer. For then, ſhall the Strangers be, Children of one and the ſame Mother the Church of <hi>England;</hi> it would be an unhandſome refuſal in them, not to joyn in prayer for a bleſſing from God the Father in the words of our Catholick and holy Mother.

                     <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THis Addreſs may ſeem very ſtrange; and yet if you ſhall conſider the occaſion, it will appear that I could not prudently do other; for you being accounted a Light in that very Houſe in which I ſtand eclipſed, I could not imagine by any other mean than your ſplendour, how to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the diſſipation of this Cloud.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſo it is, that that worſhipful and worthy Knight Sir <hi>John Trever</hi> is one to whom I owe very much; for it was his Letter and his Influence that firſt guided and planted me to and in the School of the Prophets: It was reſpect to him that gained me a Tutor; and it is now my reſpect to him, which gains you this trouble.</p>
                  <p>For, when about the beginning of <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-term I was at <hi>London,</hi> meeting him in the <hi>Palace-yard,</hi> I thanked him for a late courteſie: his reply was, I had diſabled my ſelf from the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a courteſie. I took leave to anſwer, it was my Conſcience and the tenderneſs thereof that hath thus ſtreightned me. He told me again in words (as I conceive) to theſe equivalent, that I was more byaſſed by <hi>Conceit</hi> than <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and guided rather by <hi>Will</hi> than <hi>Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſo little left, that I can demonſtrate to the world I have not made gain my godlineſs; and I ſhall now deſire to make it as evident unto you, that 'tis not <hi>Fancy,</hi> but <hi>Scruple,</hi> and <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> onely, for which my ſelf, and in me a Wife and five Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren very deeply ſuffer; ſo that I here with all reſpect implore your aſſiſtance, either to ſatisfie my weakneſs and ſet me right, or (which perchance may be the ſhorter work) be pleaſed to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65858:30"/>
him whom I do ſo highly honour, that you conceive my grounds and reaſons are ſuch as may conclude me a rational and conſcientious, though weak Brother.</p>
                  <p>The miſdemeanours (for ſo they are called) for which my conviction (bearing date <hi>May</hi> 5, 1646.) teſtifieth I am ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, they are theſe: 1. Adoration or worſhipping God by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Body Eaſtward, or towards the holy Table. 2. For the exteriour acknowledgement of the Deity of my Saviour, when ſummoned to it by his bleſſed Name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> 3. For deſerting my Cure two whole years. 4. For officiating by the Common-prayer-book, with refuſal of the Directory: To which is added a general ſurmiſe of Malignancy againſt the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as of leaſt concernment, I ſhall give you this brief account of the third charge, to which I negatively anſwer: I never at all did deſert my Cure: For, being, as <hi>Juſtinian, derélictum dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quod Dominus eâ mente abjecit, ut id in numero rerum ſuarum eſſe nolit,</hi> that onely is deſerted which is thrown off with a minde to be no more poſſeſt; I cannot poſſibly be ſaid to have deſerted my Cure, when by Petition upon Petition, by Letter upon Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all the ways I could imagine, I implor'd my quiet at home, or to have leave to know why; and our Committee never would or did give way to either: ſo that what is here called de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, is no more than what thoſe words of Scripture will well warrant, <hi>When you are perſecuted in one City, fly unto another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Every abſenting more than two years, in theſe days of trial, hath not been accounted ſequeſtrable; and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour I ſuppoſe, though this by way of cumulation is put in, this is not the <hi>gravamen;</hi> for there is not in the Conviction any charge for flying to, or being in any forbidden Quarters.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I was ſo far from deſerting my Cure, that I kept at my proper coſt (though ſequeſtred) a Curate all my abſence; one who kept my people freer from diſtractions and averſions from the ways of the <hi>Church of</hi> England, than ſince they have been. But <hi>haec obiter;</hi> that which my conviction declares me to ſuffer for, it is a pretence of ſuperſtition, expreſt by bowing to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to the <hi>Altar,</hi> and at the <hi>Name of Jeſus.</hi> 2. For not laying aſide and relinquiſhing the <hi>Liturgy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I beſeech you with patience peruſe this my Defence, in which I ſhall endeavour to clear firſt my acts of commiſſion from being ſuperſtitious: And then 2, give my reaſons why I take it to be a ſin of omiſſion to renounce the Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65858:30"/>
Firſt, bowing to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and to the <hi>Altar,</hi> are not onely falſe accuſations, but falſe in ſuch a degree, that (without my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) are impoſſible to be proved: for being the intention onely can ſpecificate the term, it is not in the power of any man living to ſay to what I bow, or to what I kneel; for I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent your ſelf bends your Knees toward many a thing to which you abhor to do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bow at his Foot-ſtool;</hi> that is, at the Ark and Mercy-ſeat; for there he hath made a promiſe of his preſence. The words ſay not, <hi>Bow to the Ark, but to God at the Ark.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Perkins;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Reformed Catholick <hi>707.</hi>
                     </note> and thus and no otherwiſe did your Chriſtian-brother bow either toward the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or toward the <hi>holy Table.</hi> Now as the Jews (in Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> charitable Divinity) did not bow to the Ark, but to God at the Ark; even ſo, when occaſionally your Chriſtian brother bowed at the holy Table, it was not to the Table or to the Altar, but to his God he made his Adoration, and that for the ſame reaſon which Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> uſeth; for there he hath <hi>made a promiſe of his preſence:</hi> There hath he enabled us <hi>(vi promiſſi)</hi> to ſay, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that it is an act of ſuperſtition to worſhip God by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Body, is a ſcruple in which I cannot be ſatisfied: For, as Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> ſo think I—<hi>The Worſhip of the Body is called</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 855. Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Adoration, which ſtands in bowing of the Knee, bending or proſtrating of the Body, the lifting up of the Hands of Eyes</hi>—A duty which the ſame reverend Author proveth to be, as himſelf ſpeaketh, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary,</hi> and that for three irrefragable reaſons. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Love muſt not be conceived in the minde onely, but alſo teſtified in the actions of the body. 2. Chriſt redeemed both, and therefore muſt be glorified with both. And laſtly, Chriſt being an head to the whole man, for this cauſe not onely Soul, but Body alſo muſt ſtand in ſubjection to Chriſt. Many others might be added, but it ſeems to me vain to adde a Beam unto the Sun. Now if to worſhip by bowing of the Knee, proſtrating the Body, and lifting up of Hands or Eyes be a duty lawful, yea altogether neceſſary, no matter which way ſoever it be done, ſtill it is, as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> fully, an act, not of Superſtition, but Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as it was no ſuperſtition in the Jew to worſhip God by bowing before the <hi>Ark</hi> or <hi>Weſtward;</hi> ſo ſuperſtition it is not to worſhip God by bowing before his <hi>holy Table;</hi> that is, in the phraſe of antiquity, <hi>Eaſtward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65858:31"/>
And here, for their ſakes who are weak, but willing to be wiſe, I ſhall make a not impertinent digreſſion, to ſhew how it is a pure popular errour, to ſay that mere poſition can make an Altar; or that ranging a Table at the Eaſt-end turns it to an Altar.</p>
                  <p>Scripture will furniſh us with Altars in open Fields, nigh no <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 32.</note> Wall. The old Altar repaired by <hi>Elijah</hi> was ſo far from leaning to a Wall, that it was circumvironed with Water, ſurrounded with a Ditch or Trench. In the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> an Altar may be found ſtanding [as the contentious would have it] <hi>in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio,</hi> in the middle. And ſure I am, the moſt conſiderable Altar that the world ever ſaw, the Croſs! upon which was crucified the pretious Subſtance of all Types, it had no ſuch Dimenſions as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Chriſtians have wrangled about: For it ſtood without the Gate; yea, a Croſs it ſtood, and yet was a moſt real Altar. So that it is not Poſture, but the Oblation; not the Scituation, but the Sacrifice which makes an Altar. I read, the very Altar on which [the ſupreme Lord of Superſtitions] the Pope in perſon ſayeth Maſs, it ſtands <hi>in medio,</hi> in the Body of the Quire. And doubtleſs, might popiſh Prieſts have liberty to ſay Maſs, they would not ſtand upon a poſition North or South. So that Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hath more of ſcare, than any real fear in it.</p>
                  <p>As for bowing to the Eaſt, or to the Altar, I am able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Letter writ by me five or ſix years ago, <hi>ex Diametro</hi> againſt it, and am ſtill ready to ratifie that Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond act of Superſtition, it is <hi>bowing at the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> and to clear that, I ſhall thus argue. No act directly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and intended for the advance of the glory of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> can be ſuperſtitious; but to bow at the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the ſence of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is an act both tending and intended for the advance of his glory, and therefore cannot be ſuperſtitious. For the proof of the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition, I appeal to the 18 Canon of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where the end and intention of that geſture is clearly thus.</p>
                  <p>When in time of Divine Service the Lord Jeſus ſhall be mentioned, due and lowly Reverence ſhall be done by all perſons preſent, as it hath been accuſtomed; teſtifying by theſe outward Ceremonies and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures <hi>[obſerve what]</hi> their inward humility, Chriſtian reſolution, and due acknowledgement, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the true and eternal Son of God, is the onely Saviour of the world.</p>
                  <p>

Now upon this ground I thus argue: For as much as both Words and Geſtures have their individuation and ſpecification meerly by uſe, Law or Cuſtome; what this geſture of bowing at the Name of Jeſus is to ſignifie and import in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> this the Repreſentative part thereof having clearely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, we are to take it in that ſence and in that ſignification, in which and for which it cometh from them propoſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us.</p>
                  <p>For as in Languages we receive and uſe words in and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that power and meaning which the firſt Authors and contrivers delivered them unto poſterity; even ſo, that I might ever avoid the being contentious, look what ſpiritual and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duties my Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi> profeſſed to expreſs and ſignifie by ſuch and ſuch exterior geſtures, ſuch I conceived they did import, and in ſuch ſence and ſignification I did uſe and communicate them unto others.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then (as the Canon clearly) the due and lowly Reverence exacted at the Name of Jeſus, is onely to teſtifie our <hi>inward humility, Chriſtian reſolution,</hi> and due <hi>acknowledgement, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the true and eternal Son of God;</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the known and declared end and meaning of this Geſture, bowing at the Name of Jeſus can no more in my weak appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion be accounted Superſtition, than is inward humility, Chriſtian reſolution, or the due acknowledgement of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be the true and eternal Son of God: for being <hi>Actus exterior &amp; interior eandem conſtituunt virtutem;</hi> being the outward expreſſion and the inward meaning do make but one compleat act; if the inward be vertuous, the outward cannot be vicious; if the inward be religious, the outward cannot be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious: So that ſince bowing at the Name of Jeſus is by the Church and uſe of <hi>England</hi> determined to ſignifie an expreſſion of inward humility, Chriſtian reſolution, and a due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Deity of the Son of God; I cannot yet imagine how, to him who ſo underſtandeth and ſo uſeth it, bowing at the Name of Jeſus can be counted ſuperſtitious.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth onely the Canon of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Canon of holy Scripture warrant me ſufficiently that ſuperſtitious it cannot be; for <hi>Dato ſed non conceſſo,</hi> ſuppoſe it no duty of that known Text, yet there is congruity enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Superſtition of it: for if by thoſe Knees the Apoſtle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65858:32"/>
the ſpiritual and inward Knees of the Heart, then, as he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thought of Superſtition, expreſſed that inward duty by bodily incurvation, why may not I or any other (by his example) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my inward profeſſion of the Deity, as he, by a corporal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, by bowing at his Name? But my intention is not to write a Volume, or indeed to ſay ought more than may conclude my deſigne mentioned, to prove that I have not been, nor yet am ſcrupulous without cauſe, nor a ſufferer without reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Now my firſt ſcruple is, whether a Miniſter may with a good Conſcience renounce or leave off any Act, Rite, or Geſture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the brand and notion of Superſtitious, which he believes is not ſo?</p>
                  <p>I dare not do it, for theſe Reaſons:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhould bely mine own Soul, in calling good evil, and evil good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhould confirm a ſcandal laid upon many godly Orthodox Divines, that they in thus doing have been ſuperſtitious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſhould do an irreparable violation to thoſe holy Geſtures which I do verily believe are advancers of God's glory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I dare not omit that as ſuperſtitious, which I believe not to be ſo, for fear in ſo doing, to this undetermined notion, I might adde ſuch Latitude, that under the colour of Superſtition, even Religion it ſelf may be violated. In a word, for my particular, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I look upon Adoration in <hi>abſtracto,</hi> as the meer expreſſion of that ſubjection and diſtance which Duſt and Aſhes oweth to his Maker; or whether I look upon it in <hi>concreto,</hi> as joyn'd with ſome other duty, as ſaying our Prayers, receiving the Sacrament, or profeſſion of our Saviour's Deity; in neither reſpect (it ſeemeth to me) more guilty of Superſtition, or troubling the Waters, than was the Lamb in the Fable when the Wolf charged him: So that if by ſome greater Light, or Latitude of underſtanding, your clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer judgement ſhall diſcern otherwiſe, I ſhall with all reſpect and thanks yield up my Soul to further illumination; which till it ſhall pleaſe God to give me, I dare not in cool blood call an honeſt woman Whore; or what I conceive religious ſuperſtitious, for more than yet I am, or hope for to be worth. And this may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the firſt ſcruple, <hi>viz.</hi> That my judgement concluding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I dare not acknowledge or relinquiſh Adoration under the notion of ſuperſtitious innovation.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing I have to do, is to give my reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65858:32"/>
I conceived it a ſin of omiſſion to lay aſide, much more to renounce the Liturgy: And that I may do it methodically,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall give my Reaſons why I dare not countenance the worſhipping of God without a Form. Secondly, why I dare not <hi>in ſpecie</hi> omit this Form.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I dare not countenance the worſhipping of God without a Form: for, being the Scripture chargeth not onely to hold the Faith, but to hold faſt the <hi>very form of ſound words,</hi> I conceive a ſet Form of Prayer a neceſſary expedient to this end: for being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience both ancient and modern hath taught us this ſad truth, that Errours, Hereſies, and Innovations in Doctrine are inſtilled and infuſed by the conceived Prayers of ſuch who are either Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors or Abettors of ſuch Opinions, therefore (and eſpecially in theſe times) I dare not but endeavour a ſet Form: A ſet Form ſeeming now as neceſſary, as an Antidote in time of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to worſhip without a prepared and ſet Form (it ſeems to me) to ſerve the living God with leſs care than Pagans did their Idols. For witneſs <hi>Plato,</hi> a Law there was, whatever <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>7.</hi> de leg.</note> Prayers or Hymns the Poets compoſed to the gods, they ſhould firſt ſhew them their <hi>Prieſts.</hi> And <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>and let not thine heart be haſty.</hi> An Argument to me, that even an Heart may be over-haſty; and therefore my weakneſs deſires a ſet Form.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſerving and worſhipping God by a ſet Form ſeems to be approved by God in all ages, before the Law, under the Law, under the Goſpel. Before the Law we read thus: <hi>Then</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. <hi>4. 26.</hi> Ioan. Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficilioribus Geneſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>began men to call upon the Name of the Lord, Eo tempore ritus certos colendi Deum inſtitutos fuiſſe quos obſervarent filii Dei.</hi> From that time forward, ſay Expoſitors, certain Rites or ſet Forms were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up for the publick worſhip of God; yea, <hi>forſitan propter Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latriam inſurgentem,</hi> perchance for the prevention of incroaching <note place="margin">

But whether <hi>Enoch</hi> were or no, ſure we are God Almighty under the Law, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Idolatry, had his ſet Rites; and in particular to the point in hand, a preſcribed and ſet Form of Prayer: <hi>On this wiſe ſhall ye</hi>

                     <hi>bleſs the children of Iſrael, ſaying,</hi> (as it followeth) <hi>The Lord bleſs thee and keep thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Under the Goſpel both St. <hi>John</hi> the fore-runner, and our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Maſter the ſubſtance, both we know taught to pray; and it is ſtrange teaching without a Form; as the corner and firſt Stone in the building, the Lord left us a Prayer; and this Prayer proved the baſis and fundamental of all future Liturgies: This, through the devotion and piety of the Church, increaſed and grew into a Form; and in this I ſuppoſe M. <hi>Beza</hi> may be my advocate, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>ver. ultim.</hi>
                     </note> who tells me and all the world, <hi>Quae ad ordinem ſpectant, ut pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum formulae diſpoſuit Apoſtolus:</hi> Thoſe things which appertain to order, as do forms of Prayer, the Apoſtle himſelf appointed and diſpoſed. So that ſet Forms in the judgement of M. <hi>Beza</hi> are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical. The Engliſh Tranſlation reads it thus: Such things as appertain to Order and Form of Prayers, and other ſuch like, the Apoſtle took order for, in the Congregation, according to the conſideration of times, places, perſons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 39.</p>
                  <p>Yea, after the great Reformer <hi>Martin Luther</hi> had a while tried what it was to want a ſet Form, himſelf profeſſeth <hi>(lib. de For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula Miſſae) coactus ſum,</hi> I am conſtrained, obſerve by what, and to what; conſtrained he was <hi>alios Canones, aliamque Miſſandi Formulam preſcribere,</hi> to preſcribe freſh Canons, and another form of Maſs: And if you pleaſe to obſerve by what he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his words are, <hi>Propter leves &amp; faſtidioſos ſpiritus qui ſola No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate gaudent, atque ſtatim ut Novitas deſiit, nauſeantes.</hi> By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of light and humorous ſpirits, who onely delight in Novelty, nauſeating what themſelves liked when it ceaſeth to be new. A humour which the firſt Zeal of our times did not digeſt; and therefore, whether I appeal to <hi>Beza,</hi> or the more eminent <hi>Luther,</hi> ſtill a ſet Form. A ſet Form, according to <hi>Beza</hi>'s note, becauſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical. A ſet Form, according to <hi>Luther,</hi> becauſe woful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavagant experience demonſtrated the neceſſity of it. No curb for faſtidious and rambling ſpirits, but a ſet Form.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The want of ſet Form prevents that which I am bound for to endeavour, the <hi>converſion and communion</hi> of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party: for either I muſt perſwade them to worſhip God according to my diſcretion, and rely upon the implicite faith of my prudence, or elſe I muſt produce a <hi>Form</hi> in which I deſire their communion, and to which I muſt endeavour their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Now I believe all thoſe who renounce an implicite faith
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65858:33"/>
in the whole Church, or in the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of it; all ſuch (I ſay) at leaſt will abhor ſo far to reſigne themſelves unto a private Miniſter, as to worſhip God all days of their lives according to his mutable dictate. I am ſure the Papiſts will ſay this is worſe than what we call Popiſh ſervitude: for they are bound onely to believe and ſerve God as the Church orders; but where all is left to the will of the Miniſter, people are bound to worſhip and ſerve God as his private ſpirit leads them; and I wiſh I could not feelingly ſay (even from follies vented in my own Pulpit) what an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> that is.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To avoid prolixity, for my own particular, ſhould I renounce a ſet Form, I muſt needs profeſs my ſelf guilty either of <hi>Superſtitious Innovation,</hi> or (which <hi>in materia Religionis</hi> is bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) popular <hi>inſinuation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That to worſhip God without a Form is <hi>Innovation,</hi> this the whole Chriſtian world will atteſt unto me; the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, <hi>Wittemberg</hi> where <hi>Luther, Geneva</hi> where <hi>Calvin, Scotland</hi> where <hi>Knox</hi> flouriſhed; and to innovate and act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Catholick Cuſtom of Chriſtendom, of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, may breed a ſcruple in a wiſe, much more in a weak Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As Innovation, ſo it would ſeem to me unavoidable ſuperſtition, and that whether Superſtition be <hi>poſitively</hi> or <hi>negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> conſidered: for Superſtition being poſitively conſidered, being the iſſue of <hi>miſgrounded Zeal,</hi> this ſuperſtition is active in the production of ſuperſtitious performances, whereof this is one, <hi>to conceive that God will be pleaſed with no prayer from me, unleſs of my own conception,</hi> nor no devotion unleſs it be of our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention: this, I ſay, is the ſuperſtitious iſſue of a miſguided zeal. Again, as miſguided zeal is the Mother of ſuperſtitious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, even ſo <hi>ignorant fear</hi> is the motive and cauſe of <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious forbearances,</hi> as when one vainly fears, and in that fear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frains ſuch an act, as diſpleaſing, which indeed is rather pleaſing to Almighty God: <hi>Touch not, taſte not, bandle not,</hi> theſe are nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſuperſtitions, iſſues of ignorant fear: And ſo far as I can conceive, ſcrupulouſly to reject or lay aſide ſet Forms as <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,</hi> is out of ignorant fear really and actually to commit (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the phraſe) a negative ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Again, ſhould I not ſuperſtitiouſly (which as drawing nigher Religion, is more honeſt of the two) lay aſide a ſet Form,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65858:34"/>
I cannot imagine any other principle but <hi>popular inſinuation</hi> to move me to it; and to make that a motive in Religion, ſcarce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me religious. <hi>Omnia ponenda poſt Religionem noſtra Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas duxit.</hi> If the Pagans had ſo much Divinity as to ſay, it was a <note place="margin">Val. Max. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. de Religio.</note> Law in their City, that all things whatſoever muſt give way unto Religion, certainly it behoveth me, who am a Chriſtian, in matter and point of Religion, to look upon nothing through a carnal or ſecular Perſpective. Now to me (and with me runs the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Antiquity) ſet Forms of Prayer and Worſhip, they are the moſt religious and aſſured means either to preſerve or advance Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The ſcruple then is, whether any of my judgement and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion may for any popular or ſecular end in the world (and for that end merely) lay aſide a better, and aſſume in God's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a worſe way? whether this be not having <hi>a Male in my Flock, to offer unto God a Female,</hi> judge you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Printed</hi> 1628.</note> That bleſſed ſpeech of Sir <hi>Benj. Ruddierd</hi> to Mr. <hi>Rym; He that thinks to ſave any thing by his Religion but his Soul, will be a terrible loſer in the end,</hi> It is worthy to be written in letters of gold, yea worthy to be engraven in the Heart of every Parliament-man that ſits: it is indeed a ſaying that hath ſo far prevailed on me, that I begin extremely to queſtion the truth of that vulgar opinion, that the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the Church of Chriſt are ſo left as to be accommodated to the proportionable <hi>exigences</hi> of States and Kingdoms. For my particular, I conceive, the glory of God atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, municipal Laws ought rather to ſtoop, than they to ſtrain; for Religion is ſo tender a Virgin, that ſhe may not admit the leaſt proſtitution; and I am ſure a conſcientious breaſt feareth to rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple her very ornaments.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then to worſhip God without a ſet Form ſeems to me deſtructive of the form of ſound words, which charily muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, a worſhip more careleſs than what Pagans uſed, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation which takes away the very ground and baſis of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and communion with an adverſe party; whereas it would be in me either Superſtition or Popularity to deſert a ſet Form; I muſt crave leave to follow theſe Dictates till I have better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes given me, from which I may conclude otherwiſe. And ſo I ſhall deſire your patience to accompany me to my laſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which is to ſhew, that I cannot with a good conſcience renounce, or as yet lay aſide this our individual Liturgy, and that for theſe reaſons:</p>
                  <p n="1">

1. It maketh our Religion to be ill ſpoken of by the greateſt part of Chriſtendom, and ſo preventeth the converſion of Papiſts, who accuſe us of unſetledneſs and changes; yea, it furniſheth them with an unanſwerable exception, <hi>viz.</hi> That we have theſe many years convicted, puniſhed, and impriſoned them for what our ſelves now ſo far diſtaſte, that at Seſſions we give a charge againſt it, traduce it under the brand of the old <hi>Mumpſimus,</hi> and indict it, and puniſh one another for it; this I profeſs my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot ſatisfie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If better it were a Milſtone were hanged about my Neck, than that I ſhould be a ſcandal to my weak Brother, the omiſſion of the Liturgy being at this time a ſcandal not onely to the weak, but to the ſtrong, being the cries and tears of both require it; how ſhould I dare to look my God in the Face, when I ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully become <hi>ſcandalous</hi> both to the learned and unlearned, both to the ſtrong and to the weak Chriſtian? yea, of this, ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath made me very confident, ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. What by Oath and Subſcription I am bound unto, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relaxation from the ſame authority to whom I ſware, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I ſubſcribed, I may not relinquiſh. But I have ſworn to my Dioceſan, and ſubſcribed to maintain the ſervice of God, not onely in <hi>genere,</hi> but in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> according to the particular form and way of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And therefore, to ſay no more, as an honeſt man, I am bound to make that good which I have ſworn, ſubſcribed, and negatively promiſed to maintain.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is againſt my Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> to acknowledge a power Eccleſiaſtical Independent upon the onely Supreme; and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (in my apprehenſion) be avoided, if the King forbidding I receive the Directory, and the King commanding to uſe it, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Liturgy.</p>

Pariſhes are of humane inſtitution, founded and endowed by the piety and liberality of devout Patrons, look what they condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for, (ſo far as juſt and pious) that I conceive I am bound unto.

                  <p>All Ages will argue for a diurnal and daily Devotion: The Jews had daily their Morning and their Evening Sacrifices; and to ſhame us to the doing of it, I ſhall onely adde what <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> borroweth from <hi>Plato,</hi> Lib. 10, <hi>de legibus,</hi> thus: <hi>Graecos omnes aequè ac Barbaros, Sole tam Oriente quam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Occidente adorare Deum—&amp; ideircò Clemens ſecundo Libro Conſtitutionum,</hi> cap. 24. <hi>acriter redarguit Chriſtianos tardius Templa adeuntes, cum Gentiles &amp; Judaei ſuas Synagogas dilucul'o frequentant.</hi> For whereas the Angel of the Lord ſaid unto the Diſciples newly out of Priſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Go, ſtand and' ſpeak in the temple to the people all the words of this life;</hi> The reaſon is thus given—<hi>Scientes Judaeos de More dilucul'o ad Orationem venturos in Templum.</hi> Knowing that the Jews did cuſtomarily repair early to prayers in the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is very conſiderable to me, whether thoſe words in my Proteſtation <hi>(The true reformed Proteſtant Religion expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>againſt all Popery and popiſh Innovations)</hi> do not binde me, ſo far as lawfully I may, with life, power, and eſtate, to maintain either this, or ſome other ſet Form, and that for theſe reaſons:</p>

For as he that is bound to maintain a <hi>Houſe,</hi> muſt preſerve the Thatch as well as the <hi>Grunſel;</hi> and as he who is bound to maintain a Cloſe, muſt have a care of the Hedge (though it be but a dead one) as well as the Crop: even ſo, when I did promiſe, vow, and proteſt to defend and maintain the true Religion, in which I was baptized and bred, I know not how I could hope to make good this, unleſs the neceſſary muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof the <hi>Liturgie</hi> is a main one, were preſerved in it. And that in this I was not ſingular, I may appeal unto a <hi>Vote</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward annexed to the Proteſtation, in which it is declared, <hi>that ſeveral perſons had raiſed the ſame doubt;</hi> an Argument that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction was very obvious, and very natural. Now foraſmuch as I had vowed before I ſaw the limitation, after the Vow I durſt not enquire; a Vow and an Oath (as I conceive) in this diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: an Oath, it muſt be taken in the ſence of the giver; a Vow, becauſe voluntary, in the ſence of the taker onely: ſo I took it, and the obligation is ſtill upon me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas Religion in the Proteſtation hath this reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive difference, <hi>Reformed;</hi> and not onely ſo, but ſo <hi>reformed</hi> as in the <hi>Church of</hi> England, <hi>againſt all Popery and popiſh Innovations;</hi> I cannot ſee how I could proteſt to maintain a Religion ſo refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but that I muſt neceſſarily imply that <hi>ſervice</hi> which the firſt Reformers, and all ſucceeding Parliaments have made the <hi>Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical</hi> note, and formal difference betwixt us and them; and this (we all know) hath been the <hi>Liturgie:</hi> for from his denying <hi>Communion</hi> in this, the <hi>Papiſt</hi> was called <hi>Recuſant,</hi> and by his joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us in this, he was ſaid and held as reconciled to our <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In caſe the Proteſtation had run thus: I promiſe, vow, and proteſt to maintain the <hi>true Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>againſt</hi> (as they call them) <hi>heretical Innovations;</hi> would any man believe the Miſſal were here excluded, which is the very <hi>formality</hi> of their profeſſions? Or in caſe it had run thus: I promiſe, vow, and proteſt, to maintain that reformed Religion, whoſe character and <hi>diſtinctive formality</hi> is the <hi>Directory;</hi> would any doubt I vowed to maintain the Directory? and can hope to perform my Vow, can I hope to maintain the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and lay aſide that which is the practical character of my profeſſion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65858:36"/>
Fourthly, If this notion, <hi>Reformed Religion of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, includes not <hi>Liturgie,</hi> then they are not ſufferers for the <hi>true Reformed Religion of</hi> England, who ſuffer meerly for the <hi>Liturgie;</hi> but they who ſo ſuffer, cannot imagine elſe what they ſuffer for.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is very probable to me, the compilers and chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers of this Proteſtation, by Religion mainly meant the <hi>Form</hi> of God's Worſhip: for in the firſt nineteen humble Propoſitions, the <hi>eighth</hi> runs thus: <hi>That your Majeſty will be pleaſed to conſent, that ſuch a Reformation be made of the Church-government and Liturgie, as both Houſes of Parliament ſhall adviſe</hi>—To the people in the ſame year, the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> declare thus, <hi>April</hi> 9, 1642. they intend a due and <hi>neceſſary Reformation of the Government and Liturgie of the Church.</hi> A plain and evident demonſtration to my capacity, that both Lords and Commons did then declare, this notion or term Religion, it includes both <hi>Church-government</hi> and <hi>Liturgie;</hi> otherwiſe what ever is of late attempted or done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe, cannot be ſaid to be a religious, but a politick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, How could I promiſe, vow, and proteſt to defend and maintain a Religion which is ſaid to be true, and <hi>actually refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> unleſs there be ſome Form actually in being, which my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and my Conſcience muſt look upon? for to ſwear the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a Religion or Worſhip, or Diſcipline not fixed, and digeſted into a Form, ſeems to me like that formidable <hi>et caetera,</hi> to ſwear and vow to maintain I know not what; and upon this ground thouſands there are who have ſtumbled at the very Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of the Covenant, not daring to ſwear to defend a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, where they cannot come to ſee the Form.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this new, or without example, and that from ſuch as profeſs themſelves of the Reformed Party: For the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> profeſſing themſelves to tread in the ſteps of their Reverend Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <hi>John Huſs,</hi> diſavow for ever Communion with the <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> and that for two Reaſons; whereof (if my Author deceive me not) the firſt is, <hi>Quod Nulla publica extare voluerint Doctrinae &amp; Fidei ſuae Teſtimonia;</hi> becauſe they had no publick Form or Teſtimony to declare what their Faith and Doctrine was: <hi>vid. quintum E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium,</hi> pag. 42. praef. Bohemi <hi>ad Confeſſionem</hi> Wittemberg 1578.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then beſide Statute-ſubſcription, and thoſe many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations contracted under Epiſcopacy, I conceive even by the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65858:36"/>
                     <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and from the very ſenſe of the Houſe that made it, <hi>Liturgie</hi> is a very conſiderable ingredient in the compound of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and this preſent <hi>Liturgie</hi> in this the <hi>reformed Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> As then in Muſick, though there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rare and exquiſite <hi>voluntaries,</hi> yet ſolemn and ſet Muſick is not therefore to be rejected: even ſo though there are and may be in the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſuch, who can expreſs as readily as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and conceive as devoutly as can be imagined; yet for all that, this is no <hi>Superſedeas</hi> or bar againſt ſtudy'd, penn'd, and ſet Forms of Prayer. And more than this, as I read, was heard, and ordered to be printed by the honourable Houſe of Commons in a Sermon called, <hi>Babylon's downfal,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Curſed ſhall he be that removeth the antient Land-mark,</hi> &amp;c. What is the antient Land-mark of <hi>England,</hi> but our Laws and Religion? (which contains as well <hi>facienda</hi> as <hi>credenda,</hi> and hath as well the <hi>Liturgie</hi> as the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Homilies</hi> for her boundaries) and therefore if any man ſhall remove this Land-mark, curſed ſhall he be of the Lord, and let all the people ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> Certainly they who ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to this imprecation, and thoſe who ordered there ſhould be an impreſſion of it, they were then no viſible Enemies to Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, no not this Liturgie. All then that I ſhall now trouble you withal, ſhall be a ſlight propoſal of this one ſcruple.</p>
                  <p>Whether a Miniſter is not as much bound to ſuffer in defence of the ſpiritual Muniments of Religion, as any Subject for the temporal Muniments and Priviledges of State or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>For Chriſtian Religion, or the Muniments thereof, I am apt to think with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Sword is no good advocate, <hi>Lex nova non</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>As</hi> Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <hi>cites him</hi> de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re belli.</note> 
                     <hi>ſe vindicat ultore gladio;</hi> the fooliſhneſs of preaching, not the arm of fleſh, muſt and did eſtabliſh theſe: And therefore I propoſe the ſcruple onely in point of <hi>ſuffering;</hi> for if we look unto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finiſher of our Faith, I conceive with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that by his example we are called upon to ſuffer, and in this caſe to ſuffer onely.</p>
                  <p>Now in theſe times of loſs and ſuffering, I have oft conſidered with my ſelf for what, either as Subject, or as Chriſtian, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Chriſtian Miniſter, I ſtand bound to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Now whilſt I look upon my ſelf as a Subject, having nothing at all before me but ſome ſecular or temporal advantage; my next conſideration is, what ſecular or temporal commodity is deareſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65858:37"/>
to me: for I ſuppoſe no man will loſe Gold to ſave Chaff, nor expoſe his Darling to preſerve his Vaſſal. Now foraſmuch as all temporal or ſecular goods are reducible to theſe three heads, <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum, utile, honeſtum,</hi> either pleaſant, profitable, or honeſt; that which of theſe three is deareſt, that which of theſe is abſolutely the beſt, that (I conceive, though I ſuffer the loſs of the other two) I am bound to preſerve.</p>
                  <p>Job 2. <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life,</hi> Though the Devil ſpake it, both God and man approve it. Skin for Skin, whatever is pleaſant, or whatever is profitable, a man will rather ſuffer in, than in his life; for of all things plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant or profitable, Life is the deareſt. Now albeit among things pleaſant or profitable, Life is the Jewel; yet <hi>bonum honeſtum,</hi> that good which doth conſiſt in honour or honeſty, this, it is oft even dearer than life it ſelf: So that for defence of reputation and a good name, for the advance and benefit of poſterity, for the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a friend, for the preſervation of a truſt; for theſe and ſuch like, there is many an one who will dare to die: but meerly for what is pleaſant or what is profitable, I think no man living: So that indeed 'tis onely <hi>bonum honeſtum,</hi> it is onely for what is honeſt, or what is honourable, a man as a man, a man as rational, is bound to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be ſo, that honour and honeſty hath ſo ſtrong an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon a reaſonable ſoul, that Reaſon will pérſwade even the natural man to prefer <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>honeſty</hi> before life; if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, liberty, and the Laws of the Land are ſo dear to Subjects, that even for them thouſands have laid down their lives; my great and grand ſcruple is, whether <hi>bonum religioſum,</hi> whether a religious good, whether that which I verily believe tends to the good of Religion, ought not to me, a Chriſtian, and a Miniſter, to be full as dear as any <hi>bonum honeſtum,</hi> as any honeſt or mere ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good to me, or any ſubject in the world: And (I profeſs to you upon the faith of a Chriſtian) be it ſound, or be it weak, this is the principal ground and motive of all my loſſes; and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me I have theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>1 Cor. 9. <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi> Between ſpiritual and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things the Apoſtle ſeems to make ſo deſpicable a difference, that the one is not to be compared with the other: carnal things, ſecular and worldly intereſts, they are not conſiderable, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65858:37"/>
with things ſpiritual. A clear argument to me, that no ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or religious performance ought to give way to any carnal end. And ſuch I conceive are all the muniments of Chriſtian Religion, ſuch in particular a blameleſs Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>According to this rule, the Royal Maſter and glorious Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher over ſavage cruelties, imputes all his ſufferings to the ſcore of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>I ſhall be more than Conquerour through Chriſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Illis Med. upon death.</note> 
                     <hi>enabling me, for whom I have hitherto ſuffered, as he is the Author of Truth, Order, and Peace, for all which I have been forced to contend againſt Errour, Faction, and Confuſion.</hi> A plain evidence that Chriſt may be ſuffered for in the preſervation of Order, as well as in the vindication of Truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a rule amongſt Caſuiſts: That man that ſuffers either for doing this, or forbearing that in relation unto Chriſt and his glory, that perſon is a ſufferer in the cauſe of Chriſt; as he that will not lie, upon this ground, becauſe diſhonourable to the Chriſtian Profeſſion, if he ſhould be perſecuted becauſe he will not lie, ſuch an one, though not <hi>in materia fidei,</hi> yet becauſe his reſtraint is for Chriſt and his glory, he were perſecuted for Chriſt his ſake.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then in my poor judgement I am convinced there is no means generally more expedient for the advance of the glory of Chriſt and the preſervation of the Faith, than a well-compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſet Form of Liturgy; whatever I ſhall ſuffer for not reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting this, I ſhall confidently lay upon the ſcore of my Saviour: foraſmuch as I therefore onely by ſuffering endeavour the defence of this, becauſe I do verily believe Liturgy is the advance of his glory: So that if a temporal good (whoſe reward and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be but temporal) can move a man to ſuffer, much more a ſpiritual, whoſe reward (through the mercy of a gracious accepter) may prove eternal. For he who will not ſee a Cup of cold Water given for his ſake loſt, neither will he forget the leaſt of ſufferings which relate to his glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In ſuffering for ſpiritual muniments, and for that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which relates to Chriſt only, and his glory, there is no intereſt but God Almighty's conſidered or concerned: But in ſuffering for temporal, though publick good, we have private ends and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal advantages of our own; ſo that it muſt be much more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God Almighty to ſuffer for ſpiritual, that is, <hi>his intereſt,</hi> than for ſecular, that is, our own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65858:38"/>
Fourthly, If that Citizen be held an unworthy member, who will not ſpend his Purſe and pains for the priviledge of his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration: And if that Country-clown be held no good Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who will not ſtiffly maintain the <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of his Town; certainly then that Miniſter hath a very low and poor eſtimate of that Liturgy which he ſubſcribed unto, a very unworthy eſteem of the Catholick cuſtom of the reformed Church of Chriſt, that will, without ſuffering, betray his truſt; making leſs account of what Martyrs ſealed with their Blood, than will a Citizen or a Countryman of a trifling Priviledge or Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſidering and enquiring after the elder times, when ſuch was the purity of intention, that nothing but Chriſt's glory was attended; I cannot finde that any thing in Religion was moulded unto State-ends.</p>
                  <p>Si Eccleſiaſticum negotium ſit, nullam Communionem habento civiles Magiſtratus cum eâ diſceptatione, ſed Religioſiſſimi Epiſcopi ſecundum ſacros Canones negotio fine imponentem, in Authentica Can. <hi>123.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to the civil Magiſtrate, but to the religious Biſhops, <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> (no leſs than an Emperour) attributes and decrees the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and determination of Eccleſiaſtical affairs. And certainly if there be any Eccleſiaſtical Government, as the Law ſpeaks—<hi>Cui juriſdictio data eſt, ea quoque conceſſa eſſe intelliguntur ſine quibus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictio expleri non poluit.</hi> To whom juriſdiction is committed, all that muſt be granted, without which he cannot exerciſe juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that muſt needs be a directive and a coactive power.</p>
                  <p>Now impoſſible (it ſeems to me) that thoſe who have, (be they Prelates, be they Presbyters, or be they of what name or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſoever our next <hi>new light</hi> ſhall call them) I ſay, it ſeems to me impoſſible, that thoſe who have this ſpiritual power ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcharge their truſt unleſs they reſolve to ſuffer, and to ſuffer preciſely for the muniments and defence of the Church of Chriſt, and the power of him committed to them; for the impartial and thorough executing of this charge cannot but diſpleaſe great ones; and Fleſh and Bloud is a bitter adverſary: ſo that indeed it will evidently appear, the decay of <hi>Diſcipline, Liturgie,</hi> and all the <hi>Muniments</hi> of the Church, they have therefore ſuffered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who ſhould have ſuffered for them would not. And I beſeech God this ſin be not laid to our charge: for my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I beſeech God give me grace to ſay heartily as did
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65858:38"/>
ſome of the Martyrs, <hi>Though I cannot diſpute, I can ſuffer for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, For me to omit any act, geſture, or form of Worſhip, which I believe or feel to be an advance to Piety, merely from ſecular or private Intereſt; this, in my judgement, is to prefer a <hi>carnal</hi> thing before a <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and to endeavour rather to pleaſe man than my God. And indeed I could here with a great deal of truth and ſadneſs relate unto you, the ſerious and ſharp com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of ſuch Miniſters, who profeſs their Souls long after the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, grieved at Heart, and (as they pretend) troubled at Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they dare not uſe what they conceive much the better way. A lamentable condition is the Church in, when Miniſters worſhip God with reluctancy, and, onely to ſave their ſtakes, comply and do as the State would have them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Foraſmuch as the muniments of Religion are preſervers of the deareſt thing imaginable, Gods glory, and our Souls wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, I do not know what I ſhould ſuffer in defence of, if not of theſe.</p>
                  <p>I lately reading (as it fell proper to the day) the fifth of <hi>Eſay,</hi> when I came to thoſe dreadful words: <hi>I will take away thy hedge, and it ſhall be eaten up, break down the wall, and it ſhall be trodden down,</hi> it made my Heart even ake to think how applicable this methodical deſtruction is to our ungrateful Vineyard; <hi>I will take away the hedge, I will break down the wall.</hi> Take the Hedge and the Wall away, cut up the Fence, and the Vineyard will ſoon be waſte; the Government, the Diſcipline, the Liturgy, which as a Hedge or a Wall ever ſince our Reformation preſerved the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; ſince I ſee it hath pleaſed God to ſuffer <hi>this Hedge</hi> and the Wall to be trodden down, I can but fear confuſion and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the ſequel. For ſince the worldly wiſe man verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, where the Fence is wanting, ſpoil and waſte inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; and therefore his main care is to tend it: Even ſo, where the muniments of any Profeſſion or Religion are ſlighted and taken away; where Liturgy, (this thirteen hundred years without controverſie held the Hedge and mound of Faith, and God's Worſhip in a national Church) where (I ſay) this is pull'd down and taken away, there is imminent and evident fear, a gap is opened to let in whatever will come; be it the beaſt of the field, be it the little Foxes, be it the wilde Boar of the Foreſt, come what will, there is no muniment, no proviſion, no fence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65858:39"/>
it; ſo that in my poor conceptions, the Hedge, the Fence, the Muniment of the Church, they are matters of ſuch neceſſary conſequence, that Miniſters, I conceive, had better lay themſelves and all their Fortunes in the Gap, than for want of fence to ſuffer the deſtroyer to come in.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I have been told by ſome who wiſh very well unto me, that <hi>humane inventions,</hi> and things merely <hi>circumſtantial,</hi> ought not to be thus ſtood upon: I thank them heartily for their affection, and bleſs them for their good will; but our judgements yet muſt differ. For if no ſuffering for humane invention, if life it ſelf may not be expoſed to hazard in defence of humane conſtitutions, certainly then no fighting for the Laws of the Land, nor no taking up arms for Priviledge of Parliament, for theſe ſure are humane and political inſtitutions; and as theſe are neceſſary for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a State, even ſome ſuch are alſo neceſſary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a Church; and of ſuch, <hi>Church-men</hi> cannot be too cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas Liturgy <hi>in genere,</hi> or ours <hi>in ſpecie</hi> is counted but a circumſtantial buſineſs, I believe I may finde out ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials in a Chriſtian Church, as will hazard the whole if they periſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chron. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi>
                     </note> In the tenth Perſecution under the Tyranny of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> a Decree paſs'd, <hi>ut Templa &amp; libri delerentur;</hi> that Chriſtians ſhould deliver up their Books, and deſtroy (or at leaſt permit the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of) their Churches. Books and Churches, I conceive, are but circumſtantials to Religion; for the world was more than 2400 years old before there was any <hi>Scripture</hi> in it; yea, the Chriſtian Church it was from the birth of Chriſt more than 90 years before the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was compleated; yea, after the <note place="margin">

                  <p>Suppoſe now the Pope and Popery ſhould ſo far prevail, as to have power, under the notion of Books heretical, (for ſo they will not ſtick to call our Bibles) to call in, and under pain of death to deliver up our Bibles even to the <hi>fire,</hi> could any conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65858:39"/>
Proteſtant ſatisfie his Soul with this poor evaſion, Alas the Bible is but circumſtantial, the Doctrine and Religion of it I can preſerve though the Bible be gone! Without all peradventure it is moſt true, a learned and well-grounded Chriſtian, he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the faith, he may deliver and hold faſt the form of ſound words, though among <hi>Turks,</hi> where a Bible is not to be looked upon: and yet for my particular I ſhould ſcarce look upon that man as a Chriſtian, who to ſave his Purſe, yea his Body, ſhould deliver up his Bible to the fire.</p>
                  <p>In the Roman Martyrology there is a commemoration made of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ian.</hi> 2.</note> many holy Martyrs, who deſpiſing the ſacrilegious Edict of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi> 7. <hi>[Quo tradi ſacros codices jubebantur, potiùs corpora carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficibus quàm ſancta dare canibus maluerint]</hi> choſe rather to deliver their Bodies to the Executioner, than holy things to Dogs, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Books unto the fire. And truely I ſhould rather honour theſe as Martyrs, than thoſe for good Chriſtians, who under pretence of things circumſtantial, ſhould deliver thoſe to ſave themſelves; ſo highly (I conceive) God would be diſhonoured in the betraying of ſo great a preſerver and muniment of his honour.</p>
                  <p>Again, as Books, even ſo (to ſome much more clearly) <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Oratories, Temples,</hi> they are mere circumſtantials. Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Independent</hi> and Congregational Brother-hood ſhould ſo far overpower, as to command the demolition (as they call them) of our <hi>Steeple-houſes,</hi> the deſtruction and levelling of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I would very fain know whether in point of conſcience I were not rather bound to ſuffer, than in any meaſure to appear willing to ſo high a Sacriledge? I who am Fleſh and Blood as well as other men, could finde <hi>pretty</hi> evaſions and gloſſes to fool my Soul withal: I could ſay (as I hear) is not a Sermon as well in a <hi>Parlour</hi> as in a <hi>Church?</hi> Did not Chriſt preach in a <hi>Ship, Paul</hi> pray upon the Sands, and ſhall I ſuffer in defence of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary a trifle as an heap of Stones, a popiſh <hi>Relique,</hi> a ſorry Meeting-houſe? For my particular, I am afraid many things are daily called circumſtantial, not with conſideration whether ſo or no; but becauſe theſe are the things in queſtion, theſe the points which I muſt either diſſemble, deſert, or ſuffer for, I pray let me, as a cloſe to this, preſent you with the example of one, who though a Biſhop, was ever reverenced as a Saint, and a good man; I mean that great Doctor St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who being once tempted <note place="margin">

the Emperour, to deliver up his Church, though it pleaſed the Emperour in a fair way to ſend Earls and Tribunes to him, <hi>ut Baſilicae fieret matura traditio,</hi> that there might be a ſeaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of that Royal Palace, (for ſo his piety terms the Church) yet you ſhall finde this reverend Paſtor ſo far from deeming this a circumſtantial trifle, that he offers his Goods, his Body, his Life, in lieu of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ea quae Divina Imperatoriae poteſtati non ſubjecta;</hi> The things of God are not ſubject to Imperial power, was the peremptory poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Biſhop; and then proceeds—<hi>Si patrimonium petitur, invadite; ſi corpus, occurram: vultis in vincula rapere, vultis in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem? voluptati eſt mihi.</hi> If you, who are ſent, demand my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, invade it, take it! if my Body, here it is; if to bonds or death you deſire to carry me, it ſhall be a pleaſure to me; <hi>pro altaribus gratiùs immolabor,</hi> I will gladly be a Sacrifice to preſerve my Altar. He would rather die the death, than ſuffer an <hi>Arrian</hi> Miniſter to officiate in his Church: yea, as it is in the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, <hi>cum propoſitum eſſet ut Eccleſiae vaſa jam traderemus</hi>—when the Emperour's Officers demanded a preſent delivery of the Church-Veſſels, the conſcientious Biſhop was ſo far from holding theſe ſuch circumſtantials as not to be ſtood upon, that he plainly tells the Emperour, it was neither lawful for him to deliver, or the Emperour to demand them.</p>

                  <p>In theſe ſad times of trial, I conceive one main end of God's Judgements (eſpecially upon his Clergy) is to diſcern who thoſe are who have hitherto merely related to him for <hi>their Bellies,</hi> and who for his <hi>glory</hi> mainly; who have been <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and who <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> profeſſors of the Miniſtry: For thoſe who ſerved him chiefly for their Bellies and carnal ends, to them the invaſion of nothing is conſiderable, in which their intereſt and their ends are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved; but ſuch who with purity of intention have mainly

ſtudied and ſought the advance of God's Service, to them, as to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the muniments of Religion, the abridgement or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of any thing that was adjuvant to this end, is more conſiderable than all <hi>their ſecular</hi> intereſt, or perſonal advantages of this world; inſomuch as I can knowingly ſay it for ſome, Threeſcore pound a year, and our old way, will be preferr'd before 300 in a worſe Model. It is to me a conſideration not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy my Pen, to ſee how the judgement of God hath followed ſuch who have meaſured and ſtuck to his intereſts, merely as they moved with their own. In the 21 year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in a <note place="margin">P. 118. <hi>in Bridewel.</hi>
                     </note> Parliament which began the third of <hi>November,</hi> the Commons ſent up to the Houſe of Lords a Bill againſt the exaction of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable Mortuaries; to which Bill it is obſerved the ſpiritual Lords made a <hi>fair Face,</hi> and were well content a reaſonable Order ſhould paſs againſt them: But this was (ſaith my Author) <hi>becauſe it touched them little;</hi> for when within two days after a Bill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Probates of Teſtaments (in which there had been incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible extortion) was ſent up to the Lords, then the Biſhops in general (ſaith the Hiſtorian) frowned and grunted, <hi>for that touched their profit:</hi> then ſaid the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> Now with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is nothing but down with the Church. When the Biſhops perſonal profits were toucht upon, then (as if the very Church were falling) <hi>Fiſher</hi> crieth out, The Commons lack faith, the Commons think of nothing but down with the Church. Yea, in the progreſs of this Reformation, are not Biſhops found conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and abetting the demoliſhing of religious Houſes? and was not this probably with an eye to the preſervation of their own? as if they ſaid, Let Monaſteries go, ſo long as Biſhopricks be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Well, they are dead and gone; but hath not vengeance followed upon Epiſcopacy? Are there not now amongſt us who cry, Down with Biſhops, ſell their Lands, and think this no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, provided that <hi>Parſonages</hi> may be augmented, and Tythes ſupported? Well, Biſhops are preached down, and their honours laid in the duſt; but doth not vengeance haſten after the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it? Do not the Presbyters finde that there are who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they have leſs right to Tythes than Biſhops to their Lands? Are there not who are as induſtrious to deprive them, as they have been (for their own ends) to deprive their God? An evident argument, that <hi>Juſt and righteous art thou O God in all thy ways.</hi> An argument that makes me verily believe, thoſe who for <hi>private</hi>

                     <hi>intereſt,</hi> and merely either for praiſe or profit, throw off the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, forbear their duties, and betray the muniments of Religion and the Church of Chriſt; God will in his due time reward ſuch into their own Boſomes, blaſting that private Intereſt for which they have betrayed his.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then I muſt profeſs before God and the world, I can apprehend no motive or inducement ſo prevalent as to perſwade me that the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is any way a <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi> of God's holy Worſhip, or an <hi>obſtacle</hi> to the ſolid and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient miniſtration of the Word; but on the contrary, conſonant to God's holy Word, agreeable to Orthodox antiquity, and an approved promoter of God's glory in the Church I live in: being (I ſay) to conſent to the abolition of Liturgy, I finde in my Soul no moving motive, but either the hope of more, or the holding of what I have: I dare not (finding within me nothing but carnal intereſt) put a <hi>ſpecious</hi> ſhew of Religion upon it, and tell the world that I lay aſide the truely divine Service of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Prelates over-valued it, the ignorant doted of it, the Papiſts nos'd with it, and an idle and unedifying Miniſtry maintained by it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, I profeſs, to me are neither true nor weighty conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for if I ſhould now (as I am) forbear or lay it aſide, it is not any, or all theſe, but onely in mine own defence, onely for mine own ends I ſhould do it: Now whether any man may <hi>ſalvâ conſcientiâ</hi> prefer what he conceives in God's ſervice a worſe way, merely for the boot of private Intereſt, I leave it to your prudent conſideration; concluding with that of <hi>Chryſoſt.

                  <p>And here I had thought to have put a period both to your trouble and my own; but I muſt needs crave leave that you would thus far be an advocate both for me, and all in my condition, as to procure a belief that ſuch who are conſtant to their Faith and Principles, according to the eſtabliſhed and old way of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> may be held, if weak, yet <hi>conſcientious Chriſtians;</hi> for it is none of the leaſt preſſures of the Croſs upon us, that we of all men are thought to have no foundation; whereas we in our

                  <p>All that my ſoul longeth after, is but to obtain the ſame liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which all different parties (but ſuch as hold to their rule and Conformity) daily have, a free exerciſe of my Conſcience in that way of Worſhip, in which both Church and State viſibly held and profeſs'd communion till very lately; a way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the days of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> juſtified againſt the Papiſt; a way of <note place="margin">See the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the men of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suff.</hi> in the Book of Martyrs <hi>728.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg, <hi>pag. 413.</hi>

                  <p>Now, reverend Sir, till ſome better judgement ſhall unfold the myſtery, it muſt be my wonder, that that very Form which this very Parliament paſs'd under the notion of <hi>Divine Service,</hi> ſhould on a ſudden become ſuch an abomination, that any way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but it, is permitted; any <hi>body</hi> of Profeſſors conſcientious, but ſuch as uſe this; all other Ways being held, if not religious, yet tolerable.

                  <p>And here I cannot forbear with honour to remember Learned and Civil Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Whittaker,</hi> to whom when I addreſs'd my ſelf upon the ſame ſcruple, I had of him in his houſe a very kinde reception: and when in diſcourſe I told him how I had <hi>negatively</hi> ſubſcribed to uſe in publick Adminiſtrations the Common-prayer, and <hi>no other,</hi> He told me I was ſurely deceived, and deſired me to meet him at the <hi>Dean of</hi> Weſtminſter's (where the Aſſembly then ſat) next Morning; which I did, and brought with me a <hi>Book of Canons;</hi> but the good man anticipated the ſhewing of them; telling me, that indeed the <hi>Subſcription was as I ſaid;</hi> and <hi>that I had called to his remembrance a ſin, which but for me he ſhould never have asked pardon for!</hi> A fitter man to deal with a tender Conſcience than Mr. <hi>Marſhall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He did <hi>go look</hi> indeed; but it was into his <hi>own Breaſt,</hi> and there he found he had ſinned againſt his <hi>Subſcription;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Confeſſion I wiſh may do him more honour than a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument.</hi>

It was partly ſaid by the Poet, <hi>Profit makes Gods: Temples, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf, were no further valued than <hi>men got by them.</hi> Trucly, I do heartily wiſh, that even among us, none did drive on Religion as a <hi>Trade,</hi> ſubſcribing and avowing the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy with as <hi>changeable Conſciences</hi> as they did the <hi>Covenant</hi> and the <hi>Engagement,</hi> valuing nor one or other, but as a <hi>preſent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient;</hi> which truely makes me call to minde what a Reverend' Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> obſerved here in <hi>England,</hi> viz. The greateſt danger that ever the Common-prayer-book had, was the indifferency and the indevotion of them that uſed it but as a common Bleſſing; and they who thought it fit for the meaneſt of the Clergy to read Prayers, and for themſelves onely to preach. This doubtleſs did, and ever will depreſs the honour of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; for <hi>mobile Vulgus,</hi> ſhe moving people can never value what they ſee is by the Prieſt but ſuperficially profeſt.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> were at variance, there is a known Story of a poor man, who not being able to prognoſticate which ſhould return the Conquerour, made <hi>two Crowes</hi> equally ready: one could ſay, <hi>Ave</hi> Caeſar <hi>victor Imperator;</hi> and the other, <hi>Ave victor Imperator</hi> Antoni: One prepared to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the other <hi>Anthony.</hi> All a matter to the poor man who was <hi>chief,</hi> ſo he got by it. Now as Crowes, even ſo <hi>Oracles,</hi> they have been taught to ſpeak for <hi>advantage,</hi> many of them being like unto Wind-inſtruments, which ſound no longer than they are puffed up. Now of my <hi>Crow-like Oracle,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Hiſtory of Independency thus: Mr. <hi>Marſhall when he ſaw Independency prevail, ſecretly turned his Coat the wrong ſide outward</hi>—could not tell whether <hi>C.</hi> ſhould import <hi>Charles</hi> or <hi>Cromwel!</hi> And this my unlucky Letter bears date that very year; ſo that my Oracle, being at a loſs ſhall be pardoned, and have no more ſaid either to him or of him for this ſo dobious and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Anſwer in a caſe of Conſcience:
