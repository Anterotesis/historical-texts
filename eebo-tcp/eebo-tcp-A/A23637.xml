            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the Chapter you have, firſt the Hyſtory of a glorious Miracle Chriſt
wrought in healing an impotent man, from the firſt, to the tenth verſe.
2. The Jews quarrelling at it, deſigning the ruine of him that healed
him, from the tenth, to the nineteenth verſe. 3. Chriſts Apology for
himſelf in defence of the work he had done, to the end of the Chapter.
In the firſt verſe, and ſo on, you have the Miracle, and therein, firſt the
time of it, it was at the Feaſt of the Paſsover. 2. The place, and that
was <hi>Betheſda,</hi> where was a Pool for healing any diſeaſe, to the perſon that firſt
ſtepped in, after an Angel had troubled the waters. 2. You have the perſon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
deſcribed. 1. By his Impotency, left of all in the time, none helped him into
the water. 2. By the long time he had been under this diſtemper, which was
38 years. 3. You have the manner of his cure, it was by Chriſts word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
in obedience to his command, he was to take up his bed and walk, as a ſign
that he was healed. Then in the ſecond part of the Chapter you have the Jews
quarrelling; and before they knew the Author of this healing, they charge the
poor man with breach of the Sabbath, by carrying his bed, and his Apology being,
that he was ſo commanded by him that healed him, and upon their Enquiry who
it was, he replyed he did not know; Then you have Chriſt manifeſting himſelf
to the healed man, by whom the Jews underſtanding the perſon, they deſign his
death. But you ſee Chriſt finding this perſon gives him heavenly Counſel how
to carry it, that <hi>the benefit</hi> received may be for good to him, <hi>goe and ſin no more,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the words are two things, 1. Chriſt finding this impotent man he had heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
2. The excellent counſel Chriſt gives him, 1. By way of direction, <hi>Behold thou
art healed,</hi> 2. By way of caution, <hi>ſin no more, leſt,</hi> &amp;c. In Chriſts finding this
man, two things obſervable, 1. The time of it, it was <hi>afterward,</hi> after his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Chriſt carrying his bed, which the Iews charged him with, and Chriſt
manifeſting himſelf to him in a glorious manner; and from thence we may draw
this Obſervation.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That they who meet with moſt difficulty in the way of their obedience to Chriſt,
may expect to meet with a reward in having more of Chriſts preſence.</hi> So that whether
it be Duty in the way of our general courſe, or any particular duty we are doing
for Chriſt, no difficulty ſhould diſcourage us therein; the Lord Jeſus knows how
to make a Recompence and compenſation to us. As you ſhould conſider, 1. The
time when, ſo 2. The place where Chriſt found him, it was in the Temple,
where he was offering his Thank-offering, and he was early at the Temple, for
you find Chriſt did not ſtay for his coming, but found him there, ſo that he was
early in returning Thanks; thence obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45082:4"/>
Doct. <hi>That it is a good fruit of healing mercy from God thank fully to acknowledge
the ſame in our diligent attendance upon his Inſtituted Worſhip;</hi> We have here, 1. Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts
own Example he leavs us, to be early in ſeeking God in the Temple, thither
Chriſt comes, and 2. this healed mans Example alſo, there Chriſt finds him: he
finds him not in a Tavern, or in his own houſe neglecting the means and publick
worſhip, but in Gods houſe; And he is not there as one loth to come, or weary
of that Service, but was early there, when Chriſt comes he finds him there; and
from hence further we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That it is a great advantage to any that are able, to attend upon the Inſtituted
Worſhip,</hi> yea, to be diligent in attending thereon, for there it is you will meet
with the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, there you will find that knowledge of him, and
acquaintance with him, that you meet not with elſewhere, there Chriſt found
him waiting upon God, to acknowledge his healing mercy, and there he meets
with Chriſt. And further you may obſerve,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>They that do what they can in the acknowledgement of God, in their duty, ſo far
as they know they ſhall therein be acquainted with more of their duty.</hi> God will give
greater and clearer diſcoveries of his mind to him in that way; and you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
God is not a debtor to us by any thing we pay him, but we are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to him for thoſe communications of his to us, <hi>Pſal. 50. 23. They that glorifie
me to them I will ſhew the Salvation of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the latter part of the verſe is that I would chiefly ſpeak unto, the counſel
Chriſt gives this healed man. Chriſt is a gracious Phyſitian, and comes now to
heal his Soul as well as his body, that he may be kept in ſuch a meaſure of health
as may be for his comfort, and in order to it he gives him this counſel.</p>
            <p>1. By way of direction, <hi>Behold thou art made whole;</hi> That which Chriſt herein
calls him unto, it is a diligent obſervance of the mercy God had beſtowed, he
would have him take more notice in a fuller view of this mercy, <hi>thou art made
whole,</hi> Adding, <hi>Behold,</hi> healing mercy is that which ſhould not paſs you more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conſideration, where God gives it.</p>
            <p>2. The caution Chriſt gives him, <hi>Sin no more leſt a worſe thing come unto thee,</hi> he
gives him a ſpecial Caution againſt ſin, ſpecially that fin God had been puniſhing
him for; And he backs this caution with an inforcing Argument: <hi>leſt a worſe thing</hi>
then <hi>thirty eight</hi> years ſickneſs by ſuch a diſtemper <hi>come to thee.</hi> And when Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>Behold thou art made whole,</hi> he doth not ſay, I have healed thee, thereby teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us humility (for he did not underſtand Chriſt to be God) but would mind him
of the chief Author, conſider thou art healed; So from the words we may take
theſe three obſervations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the duty of thoſe that have received healing and delivering mercy from
the Lord to take ſpecial notice of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Thoſe that are healed or delivered are to take very good heed that they ſin no
more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. That ſins after great and eminent Salvations, Deliverances, &amp; mercies, they
pull down greater Judgements.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. Thoſe that are under ſaving and healing mercy from God they ſhould
take ſpecial notice of it, Beold thou art he aled. You muſt not take a tranſient
view but take ſerious notice of Gods mercies; It is one of the moſt pretious and
pleaſant works of a Chriſtian to take notice of, and obſerve Gods Providences to
himſelf, <hi>Pſal 111. The works of the Lord are great ſought out of all thoſe that have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45082:4"/>
therein.</hi> For the Explication of the Doctrine, we may Conſider,</p>
            <p>1. What is this beholding and taking notice of delivering and healing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>2. How we ſhould take this notice of them. and 3. Why we ſhould do ſo.</p>
            <p>1. What is that notice Chriſt would have every one delivered and ſaved to
take of the mercy vouchſafed. I Anſwer, this beholding is variouſly taken,</p>
            <p>1. For a beholding with our bodily Eyes, as God ſaid to Moſes, Deut. 3. 27.
<hi>get thee up into the Top of Piſgah, and lift up thine Eyes Weſt-ward and Eaſt-ward, and
North-ward, and South-ward, and behold with thine Eyes the Land,</hi> &amp;c. he was to ſee
the Land of Canaan with his outward bodily Eye.</p>
            <p>2. There is a beholding with the underſtanding, a conſidering of it, a looking
upon it with the Eye of the Soul, Rom. 11. 32. <hi>Behold therefore the goodneſs and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of God;</hi> if you would ſee the goodneſs and Severity of God in his Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
you muſt behold it with your underſtanding Eye, you muſt conſider it, and
that conſideration fixed to behold it, which imports two things.</p>
            <p>1. Taking a full view of it in the latitude of the mercy, a looking it all over, it
is a through and diligent obſervation, taking notice of every Argument in it that
doth advance the mercy for your better acknowledgement of it: Not to take it
by the lump, but obſerving every Circumſtance that may heighten it to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
to behold it ſo that you may ſee matter of wonderment, to behold eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mercy with admiration:</p>
            <p>2. It beſpeaks the intention of the act, <hi>Behold,</hi> you muſt look intenſly upon it,
you muſt keep your eye fixed upon it, it muſt not go out of your view, you muſt
look wiſhly all round about it, and into every part of it with intenſeneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>2. But how ſhould we thus take notice and look upon the mercy that we may
rightly behold it, and conſider it; I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. In every Deliverance and work of Providence look into all the particular
paſſages of Providence you find in it; We ſhould take the mercy in pieces, and
look into every part, and ſee what ſpecial Circumſtances there are for our notice
and obſervation. I ſhall mention ſome of thoſe things in delivering mercyes
that are worthy your obſervation.</p>
            <p>1. Take notice of the time and ſeaſonableneſs of the mercy; at what a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
time God ſent ſuch a mercy; God then delivered you, and if it had not been
then, what had become of you? Mercy coming in that needful Seaſon puts a beauty
upon it, as Eccleſ. 3. <hi>Every thing is beautiful in its Seaſon,</hi> it is then a mercy ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This poor man who had lain <hi>thirty eight</hi> years at the Pool, and none helped
him, it is probable, his Faith and Patience was worn out, and now in this nick of
time Chriſt comes, according to that in <hi>Iſai. 41. 18, 19. When the poor and needy ſeek
water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, I
the God of Iſrael will not forſake them.</hi> That is a Seaſon of mercy when the heart is
ready to ſail, and mercy comes in; Abraham takes notice of his mercy and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of his Son in the nick of time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12. At that time when he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the knife to ſlay his Son, and calls the Name <hi>Jehovah Jeirith,</hi> there, and then,
<hi>in the Mount the Lord was ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Obſerve and conſider the care of Gods Providence in beſtowing the mercy,
his ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing care in preſerving you, when others dye, you are
ſingled out for deliverance, when others are not ſpared: Chriſt ſpeaks <hi>Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45082:5"/>
here to the man, thou art he God hath healed, when ſo many lay ſick, there at
the Pool beſides: to have a healing mercy in a killing time it heightens the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in a ſpecial manner, In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26, 20. God puts a ſpecial Remark upon this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
they muſt enter into their Chambers; God hath a Chamber of ſafety and
preſervation for ſuch, in ſingular and diſtinguiſhing favour to them.</p>
            <p>3. Obſerve and conſider how leading this mercy is unto other mercyes. Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Deliverances and healing mercyes do not come alone, but are attended with
many other mercyes; Now you muſt obſerve all the Concomitants of mercy that
do attend it, as you find <hi>Hezekiah</hi> doth, <hi>Iſai. 38. 17. Behold for peace I had great
bitterneſs. But thou in love to my Soul haſt delivered me from the Pit of Corruption, for
thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy back.</hi> He takes notice of his healing mercy, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from the pit of outward deſtruction, by that killing diſeaſe, and ſpecially,
of the mercy attending of it, that God did it in love to his Soul, and that it was a
Teſtimony of Gods favour in pardoning all his ſin alſo, one mercy goes not alone,
to the People of God.</p>
            <p>4. Another thing obſervable in a healing mercy is, the Inſtrument God makes
uſe of, or the way he doth it in, ſometimes it is in an unknown way, a way we did
not expect ſuch a mercy in, the poor man waited for healing at the Pool, but
little thought Chriſt ſhould heal him by his Word. It is ſometimes a ſtrange
way that God ſends in a mercy to his People, ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 33. a ſtranger paſſed
that way and he took up the poor wounded man, and healed him, ſo it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a ſtrange way God heals in, the impotent man had none to put him into
the Pool, now to be healed in a ſtrange way unexpected, this doth greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance
the mercy of God.</p>
            <p>5. Obſerve and take notice of the deſigne and end of mercy and deliverance,
what Errand it comes upon; what work, and what gracious effect it hath, all
believers are under that general Promiſe, Rom. 8. <hi>that all things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for good to them,</hi> &amp;c. afflictions ſhall, and mercyes ſhall, every thing ſhall;
now to ſee them thus working for our good, this heightens the mercy. The poor
man goes into the Temple, and there acknowledgeth it; it is to further duty when
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is done in mercy, caring not only to be healed, but to be Thankful.</p>
            <p>6. Obſerve the reſpect mercy hath to the Prayers and deſires of your Souls,
and to the things you beg: there is a wonderful value upon mercyes, when they
are in Anſwer to our Prayers, when you in diſtreſs have cryed to God, and called
others it may be to cry to God for you, and the Lord hath heard, as Pſal. 34. <hi>This
poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and delivered,</hi> &amp;c. he had Anſwer of Prayer,
ſo that you ſhould have ſuch Intereſt in Heaven, and that God hears the cryes of
his poor ones, this exceedingly endears the mercy to us, as Pſal. 40. 1, 2. <hi>I waited
patiently for the Lord, and he inclined to me, and heard my cry, he brought me up alſo out
of the horrible pit, out of the myery clay, and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> my feet upon a Rock, and eſtabliſhed my
goings.</hi> That is the firſt thing to be obſerved in our healing and delivering mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,
the Circumſtances in it that heighten the mercy, being looked upon with a
conſiderate fixed Eye, and an intelligent heart, to further our acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>2. Obſerve and behold every mercy and deliverance how it doth fulfil the word
of God to you; there is never a Providence of God but it is a fulfilling of Gods
word, as it is ſaid, Pſal. 148. 8. <hi>Stormy winds fulfilling his Word,</hi> ſo doth every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and deliverance to his People. Now you ſhould look on the work of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
together with the Word of God, and ſee what particular word of God is
<pb facs="tcp:45082:5"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:45082:6"/>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45082:6"/>
made good to you by his Providence, for that is encouragement from experience
to truſt in the word of God another time: God ſaith, <hi>call upon me in the day of
trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. 50. 15. Now ſuch a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
is an Anſwer to ſuch a Word and Promiſe ſued out by Prayer, for therein
God hath fulfilled a Promiſe to you. So 1 Cor. 10. 13. the Lord tells you that
with every Temptation he will work a way for your eſcape, and that you ſhall be
able to bear it, and in ſuch a deliverance God hath fulfilled that Word to you, this
adds Beauty unto, and honours Gods word, in ſeeing God fulfilling it in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Providences, ſo in <hi>Joh. 19. 36. not a bone of Chriſt was broken, this was
done that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In all Deliverances and healing mercyes, that you ſhould obſerve and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in them who is the author of them, we are not only to look to the work done,
that this perſon is healed, but whence it is. The Effect is a manifeſtation of the
cauſe, we muſt labour to underſtand the cauſe, our underſtanding muſt look
through things done to the cauſe, every one ſhould ſee the hand of God which
healeth him, for there is the Name of God written upon the mercy, and eſpecially
upon a gracious and eminent delivering Providence. And conſider what you are
to ſee of God therein.</p>
            <p>1. You are to ſee the care God hath of you as your heavenly Father, ſo we are
told in Scripture, God as your Father cares for you, he knows what you need,
<hi>Math.</hi> 6. 26, 27. if for inanimate Creatures, much more for rational, eſpecially,
thoſe among them that are alſo ſpiritual, and in every delivering mercy manifeſts
that care of you; We are commanded that we ſhould be found in our duty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are under afflicting Providences, or any other: Truſting in, and leaving
the Iſſue with the care of our heavenly Father, who careth for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7.
therefore we are bid to <hi>caſt our care upon him,</hi> and ſo every godly man rowls that
care as to the Iſſue and Event upon the Lord, and then in the Deliverance the
Lord manifeſts his care, ſo that in conſidering the mercy, you may read and ſee,
that God doth take a fatherly care of you under whatſoever diſpenſation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
you are.</p>
            <p>2. You may ſee the wiſdome of God in healing and reſtoring you, eſpecially,
being eminent Deliverances; when it may be you were paſt hope, and had no
means left for encouragement, the wiſdome of God found out a way, provided
means, and gave the bleſſing to a good Iſſue, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 9. The Lord knows how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the godly out of Temptation,</hi> &amp;c. he hath many wayes he doth not make known
till the time of Deliverance, ſo that here alſo you may read this in the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
the wiſdome of God.</p>
            <p>3. Obſerve in what way God doth convey his mercy, that is a great and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
thing, to behold the way in which God conveys every mercy to you; The
way is Chriſt Jeſus. No mercy comes to you but through the blood of Jeſus
Chriſt, Remember thou art he whoſe ſins brought diſtreſs upon Chriſts Soul, how
comes any Remedy for, or deliverance from the wounds, ſickneſſes, evils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
ſin hath brought thee into, but only by Jeſus Chriſt. That Pool of <hi>Betheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt: who can make any thing healing, and Sovereign
for recovery; A curſe came by the fall upon every means uſed, only Jeſus Chriſt
hath reſtored the bleſſing upon the means; and that ſhould heighten our thoughts
of the mercy that it comes from and by Chriſt, no mercy comes otherwiſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
never look on any mercy, but in the view of it, remember and think of Jeſus
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45082:7"/>
Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 22 23. all is yours,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>life, death,</hi> every thing, but
how? only as <hi>you are Chriſts?</hi> We came to have a right to every mercy by Jeſus
Chriſts, and only by him, and that ſhould be a moſt beautiful Contemplation to
us here upon Earth, which will be ſo glorious to our Eye in Heaven, where this
diſcovery will be made fully, how all our mercyes flow to us by and through
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4. You may read the grace of God in every ſuch mercy. It is great love and
kindneſs of God manifeſted in every mercy, for every ſinner is unworthy of the
leaſt mercy, as Jacob acknowledgeth, <hi>I am leſs then the leaſt of all thy mercyes,</hi> ſo it
muſt be grace that brings mercy to you, and if you are made whole, know that
healing mercy is of grace, yea, there are riches of mercy in every outward favour
the Lord beſtows; and this you ſhould behold; <hi>Behold,</hi> the free and undeſerved fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God in all.</p>
            <p>5. See the wonderful condeſcendency of God; every mercy ſhews wonderful
Condeſcendency in God to a poor Creature, conſidering, though the Lord be high,
yet he hath reſpect to things below, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. and thoſe that are ſo very low as we
have made our ſelves by our ſins, Oh what a ſtoop is it in the divine Majeſty to
take ſuch care of vile ſinners, that God ſhould have any reſpect to your prayers,
if God hath heard you in ſuch a day, it heightens the Condeſcendency of God.</p>
            <p>6. Laſtly, obſerve and conſider the end that God aims at in your Deliverance,
God is a rational Agent aiming at a ſpetial mark in the Deliverances he gives.
Now what is the aim and deſigne of God, what is Gods language to you by the
mercy, is not the deſigne of it to further your Repentance, and your returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Gods favour? that is the general end; theſe mercyes are the great Arguments
God would prevail with ſinners to return to him by true Repentance; That is
their encouragement in <hi>Hoſ. 6. 1, he hath wounded, and he will heal,</hi> but you may
be much more encouraged, if you can ſay, God that hath wounded us, hath heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us, therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. he tells us this is the language of every mercy, and
of all Gods goodneſs, to beſpeak our hearts for Repentance, <hi>the goodneſs of God
leadeth thee to Repentance:</hi> as one mercy is leading to many other mercyes from
God to you, ſo the deſigne of them all is to lead you to God, to ſerve him with
chearfulneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 48. Conſider therefore what God calls for, that you may
comply with God, and that is what Chriſt here minds the poor man of, <hi>Behold thou
art healed,</hi> thou haſt attained that thou haſt long waited for, and God hath given
it, now it is not enough to bring a thank offering to bleſs God before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
but that you ſin no more, it is walking thankfully and obediently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord all your dayes, and ſo you ſhall ſerve the end and deſigne of God
herein.</p>
            <p>2. As you ſhould contemplate thus the mercyes God gives, ſo you ſhould take
a full and through view of them, with a fixed mind upon them, and that is in two
things.</p>
            <p>1. So look on every mercy that your heart may be affected; a ſerious fixed
Eye will affect the heart, as we ſhould look on tranſgreſſors breaking Gods Laws,
ſo as to be grieved at them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 158. I <hi>beheld the Tranſgreſſors and was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe they kept not thy Word;</hi> ſo you ſhould behold the mercyes of God and be
affected, ſo as to rejoyce, and have your heart engaged to God; as the Pſalmiſt,
Pſal. 116. 1. <hi>I will love the Lord becauſe he hath heard my voice,</hi> &amp;c. There ſhould be
a drawing out of our affections to God from the beholding the mercyes of God to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45082:7"/>
us; and as you ſhould love, ſo admire God, ſo behold as to wonder at ſuch a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as he <hi>Pſal. 31. 19. how great is thy goodneſs which thou haſt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ought for them that
truſt in thee before the Sons of men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We ſhould be ſo fixed in our contemplation of the works of Gods mercyes
that we ſhould never forget them, obſerve them ſo as to be alwayes minding
them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. he will cauſe his works to be remembred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It muſt not be
ſuch a view as (Jam. 1. 21.) a Man looking his natural face in a glaſs, and going
away forgets what manner of perſon he was, you muſt not look ſo on your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,
but keep up the Remembrance of them, that they may never be forgotten.
We are prone to forget, though highly taken and wonderfully affected with them
for the preſent; be it the eſcaping of death, when the deliverance is over, as with
Iſrael, Pſal. 196. 13. <hi>they ſang his praiſe, but ſoon forgat his works;</hi> David therefore
ingageth, Pſal. 103. 3, 4. <hi>to praiſe the Lord with all his Soul,</hi> and chargeth his Soul
never to forget the mercyes of God; therefore you ſhould charge your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
to be a Treaſury of the mercyes of God, there may be erected a monument
of them in your hearts. That is the ſecond thing how you ſhould take notice of
Gods delivering mercy, we ſhould take a through view of them, obſerving how
the Lord manages all our afflictions, by mercifull providences leading us on to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal:
For as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, Pſal. 107. 43. By obſerving theſe things, we
may underſtand much of the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="sermon">
            <head>SERM. II.</head>
            <p>IT is the latter part of the verſe we are ſpeaking unto, the counſel Chriſt
gives to the impotent man whom he had miraculouſly healed, how he might
preſerve that mercy and improve it. There are two Directions given him,
1. That he ſhould take ſpecial notice of his Deliverance, <hi>Behold thou art made
whole.</hi> 2. A Caution againſt ſin, <hi>goe and ſin no more leſt a worſe thing befall thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the firſt, we obſerved, <hi>That it is the duty of thoſe that are under ſaving
mercy, to take ſpecial notice of it.</hi> I ſhewed you what was the notice we ſhould
take of ſuch a delivering and ſaving providence, we ſhould look upon it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
upon all the circumſtances that doe endear that mercy to us, that tender care
of God, that reſpect it hath to our Prayers: we ſhould look it all over: We
ſhould doe it with intention, ſo as to be affected with it, that it may abide with
us, that we may remember it, that it may be a mercy never forgotten.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you only a few Reaſons, briefly, becauſe I would paſs to the other,
which I mainly intended in the choice of theſe words.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>You ought to conſider your mercyes becauſe God commandeth it.</hi> It is a
duty that God commandeth, and that God expecteth, and therefore hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
put that affix upon a ſpecial mercy, <hi>Behold it.</hi> So Chriſt ſaith to this man
<hi>Behold</hi> this mercy, look upon it with wonder, that a Sinner, a provoking ſinner
ſhould be ſaved and delivered: wonder that God hath wrought ſo great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
before men: That was a matter of the Pſalmiſts wonder, Pſal. 31. 19. And
in <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 28. Chriſt ſaith there to his Diſciples, <hi>Why take ye thought for raiment?
conſider the lillies of the field how they grow:</hi> Look on the care of Gods providence
to other creatures. If we muſt obſerve Gods care of inanimate creatures, or
thoſe only animate, much more ſhould we look on his care of our ſelves, &amp; the
ſpecial mercyes he beſtowes on us: God would not have you ſo to look abroad,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45082:8"/>
that you ſhould not look at home, but the more to admire Gods mercy and care
toward your ſelves.</p>
            <p>2. Reaſ. <hi>The non-obſervance of Gods mercy God doth ſeverely reprove.</hi> We find
it ſmartly reproved by God, when his People do not conſider their deliverance.
Pſal. 106. 13. <hi>They ſoon forgat his mercy.</hi> It is put as a ſpecial aggravation of their
ſin, in their murmuring againſt God, <hi>They ſoon forgat his mercy.</hi> Why did they
ſo ſoon forget it? Becauſe they did not conſider Gods mercy, did not charge
their Souls with the remembrance of it, that they ſhould forget none of Gods
benefits.</p>
            <p>3. Reaſ. <hi>We cannot have the benefit of mercy, unleſs we take a ſerious view of it.</hi>
There are two ſpecial deſigns of God in every delivering mercy, one is to further
our obedience: the other is to ſtrengthen our Faith againſt another time. It is
to further our obedience, to make us ſerve God the more chearfully. Every
mercy ſhould be alwayes in our eye, to ſpur us to our duty. Deut. 28. 47. <hi>They did
not ſerve me with chearfulneſs:</hi> it is a great ſin, under great mercyes, not to ſerve
God with a great deal more cheerfulneſs; that we cannot doe, without we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his mercies. Then it is to ſtrengthen our Faith in the expectation of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
another time, 2 Cor. 1. 10. <hi>God hath delivered us, and he will.</hi> God then heard
your cry and delivered you. Abraham makes it a ſtanding Proverb, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to Faith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12. He puts a remark on that mercy, a name on the
place, there God beheld me, and took that care of me, and prevented that ruine
to my Son, <hi>in the Mount God will be ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Reaſ. <hi>It is a great contempt of God not to obſerve his mercy.</hi> God in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
doth come near to us, and it is a marvellous inobſervance not to take
notice of him when he is near, Pſal. 106. 4. <hi>Remember me O Lord with the favour
thou haſt to thy People, viſit me with thy Salvation.</hi> When God comes with Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he comes to give a viſit to us; now we ſhould take notice of it. We cannot
ſee God, but only in the effects, God is made viſible to us in his works; we ſhould
obſerve and ſee God there, what of the name of God is written upon it, what of
the mercy, grace, goodneſs of God, elſe you carry it with diſreſpect to God.</p>
            <p>5. Reaſ. <hi>We cannot carry it ſuitably to God in our duty to him, without obſervation
of his works and mercyes towards us.</hi> The various providences of God, call for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of duty in us, we cannot be in the exerciſe of our proper duty, unleſs we
obſerve that mercy. What is the duty under delivering mercy? It is to praiſe
God, and that not for a day, but alwayes, to live Gods praiſes: and therefore we
ſhould live in the view of thoſe mercies, that are the matter and occaſion of our
praiſe, Pſal. 107, 19. 20. <hi>They cry to the Lord in their trouble, be ſaveth them out of
their diſtreſſes: He ſends his word and healeth them.</hi> What was the duty God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
<hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord for his wonderfull works!</hi> You cannot give
God praiſe for deliverance, unleſs you obſerve the full of that mercy, and your
hearts be ſuitably affected by the Conſideration of it:</p>
            <p>But by way of Improvement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE. I. A word of Reproof to thoſe that are inobſervant of Gods Mercyes.</hi> Men that only
take a ſenſitive notice of mercyes, will be thankful, &amp; praiſe God as long as they
feel the benefit, but how ſoon is it forgotten: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 13. they carry no more a
remembrance, then a beaſt &amp; ſenſitive creature: this is not the remembrance of a
rational Creature which God expects from every one. The reaſon why you ſo
ſoon forget it, mercies are ſo ſoon loſt, and your affection and love to them, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45082:8"/>
To God for them, is becauſe you doe not conſider the mercy and kindneſs God
beſtoweth</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE. II. It ſhould put us upon this duty, that we would take ſpecial notice of every
ſaving mercy:</hi> Look through it, ſee what ſpecial Arguments of Thankfulneſs to
God there are in every mercy: there is not any deliverance that comes alone, not
any mercy that comes alone; we ſhould by conſideration look into every thing
of the mercy, yea and what doth attend it, that which may further that notice
that you may take of thoſe mercies. There ſhould be never a ſpecial deliverance
and mercy God vouchſafeth you, but you ſhould keep a Record of that mercy,
that it might be alwayes to be overlooked by you, and all the circumſtances of
it. You find in the old Teſtament frequently, it was the practice of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to erect Monuments of praiſe for ſignal Mercies. Jacob <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 12. erecteth
a Pillar on the place where God appeared to him. And Abraham called the name
of the place <hi>Jehooah jireth,</hi> there God beheld me, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. So <hi>Gen. 16. Hagar,</hi>
when God, in ſpecial diſtreſs delivered lier, and ſhewed her a Well, where ſhe
might be relieved, ſhe called the name of the well, <hi>The Lord that hath ſeen me,</hi>
though I did not look after him: So we ſhould take notice of the mercy God
vouchſafeth: a Chriſtian ſhould keep his Diary, and ſpecial Remembrance of
Gods goodneſs.</p>
            <p>But to paſs to that I mainly intend, and that is the caution Chriſt gives to this
healed man, <hi>goe &amp; ſin no more,</hi> Chriſt here dealeth with him as a gracious Saviour,
that ſhews he had not only care of his outward Deliverance, but of his Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
and that that mercy might not be loſt by his ſin, that God had in his
mercy beſtowed on him, and therefore Chriſt preſcribeth him a dyet, how he
ſhould behave himſelf, that he might preſerve that health, and continue that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
you muſt take heed of your old dyet, that there be no pleaſant morſel of ſin
that you ſhould delight in, but as the Pſalmiſt prayes, Pſal. 141. 4. <hi>Incline not my
heart to any evil thing, to practiſe wicked works with them that work iniquity, and let me
not eat of their dainties;</hi> this the Lord Jeſus give him charge about, <hi>do not eat of
their dainties,</hi> it will prove a ſurfet, there will be a relapſe, that will be a more
dangerous diſeaſe if you do not take heed of ſin.</p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That thoſe that are under ſaving mercy ought to be very careful that they
ſin no more.</hi> For the clearing this Truth, I ſhall 1. Shew you what this duty is to
ſin no more, what it is that God doth expect of thoſe he hath prevented miſery
unto, or delivered out of it, that have been under it, for it is the ſame, that God
doth expect if you have not been ſick, but have been preſerved from it, your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
engageth you to this duty; If you have been preſerved, and God hath
delivered you from it, this is your duty, that you ſin no more. 2. The Reaſons
why it is the duty and ſhould be the ſpecial care of them under ſaving mercy.</p>
            <p>1. What this duty is?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. Negatively, It is not meant a Legal obedience, Chriſt doth not
call any to impoſſibilities, to perform duty without the leaſt ſtain of ſin, that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to fallen man, yea, to man reſtored, ſince his fall in this world, it is not a
Doctrine of Legal perfection Chriſt here commendeth, it is a great Truth, <hi>Eccl. 7.
20. There is no man that liveth and ſinneth not,</hi> 1 King. 8. 46. ſaith Solomon, <hi>If they
ſin, and come and confeſs it, for there is no man that liveth and doth not ſin,</hi> Joh. 1. 8.
<hi>he that ſaith he hath no ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e denyeth the Truth,</hi> the Truth is not in him, that is his
greateſt ſin, a very great ſin, and diſcovers him to be in a ſtate of ſin, to ſay he
lives and doth not ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45082:9"/>
2. But it is an Evangelical obedience, and Perfection Chriſt calls for, &amp; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
you may take up the meaning of it under theſe three conſiderations &amp; heads.</p>
            <p>1. Goe and ſin no more, that is, labour to be in ſuch an Eſtate, that thou mayſt
be in a Goſpel Senſe in a ſinleſs Eſtate, you are now healed, you have bodily h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
let that be your care now that your Soul may be healed. It is ſaid of the
Children of God, thoſe that are truly converted, 1 Joh. 3. 9. <hi>He that is born of God
doth not commit ſin, for his Seed remains in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of
God,</hi> that is that Chriſt now directs you to, to labour to be in ſuch a State, in which
thou canſt not ſin, that you may not be under the dominion and reign of ſin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the domineering Ruling power of ſin, nor under the damning power of ſin!
your great buſineſs is to labour to have a real, ſaving Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt;
thereby Chriſt doth manifeſt his great care of this poor man, that he would have
his Soul healed, he would have him in a ſaving State, for Eternity. Now let it be
your main care to improve your health and ſtrength renewed and ſpared to you,
to get a right to eternal life, that you may be a child of God, and though being
ſuch will not ſecure you from outward chaſtiſement and affliction in the World,
yet it will ſecure them from you as being the puniſhment of ſin, and the effect of
Gods wrath. You are thereby perfectly healed in this reſpect, that there ſhall
never be an affliction in Gods anger, but only the fruit of his love; you find the
ſame Counſel given by Jeſus Chriſt, Joh. 8. 10, 11. when Jeſus ſaw the woman
brought before him, and accuſed of Adultery, that he ſhould condemn her, and
all her accuſers were gone; he ſaid unto her, doth no man accuſe thee, ſhe ſaid,
no man Lord, Jeſus ſaid unto her, neither do I condemn thee, <hi>goe and ſin no
more,</hi> as if the Lord Jeſus ſhould ſay, I came not now into the world to be a
Judge, &amp; to condemn ſinners: indeed there is a time when Chriſt will be the Judge,
but now I Judge no man, therefore let that be your care that you <hi>ſin no more,</hi> you
get a pardon of your ſin, and intereſt in a Saviour, that your heart be ſanctified
for your future walking with God. In this command of Jeſus Chriſt he doth not
only expreſs, what is his will, what is approving to God, and his own will,
but Jeſus Chriſt was actually the Saviour of this man by this command, he did
hereby heal his Soul by this command as well as his body, by bidding him take up
his bed and walk, and he doth thereby ſhow his readineſs, when that is our care
that we may not ſin again, that we may truly be the Children of God: you ſhall
find God manifeſteth this in his mercy, that he is much more willing to ſave your
Souls, then he hath been to deliver your bodies; this is the great thing God would
have you goe to him for, that your Souls may be healed as well as your bodies,
that is the firſt thing, that you labour to be in ſuch a State, that no affliction may
ever come upon you in way of Judgement, or in Gods wrath.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Goe and ſin no more,</hi> it doth import thus much, that it ſhould be the diligent
care and endeavour of them that are under ſaving mercy, that they do not allow
themſelves in any known ſin, take heed of ſin as of a poiſon, that will do you a great
deal more miſchief now then ever before; that you do not allow any ſin either in
thoughts or actions, nor live in any known ſin, 1 Joh. 2. 1. ſaith the Apoſtle there,
<hi>My little Children theſe things write I unto you that you ſin not, but if any man ſin we have
an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> all the writings of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
(that is the meaning of it) it is not to encourage you to ſin, but to caution you
againſt ſin. What ſinning? that is, ſee you do not allow it, but if ſin be too hard
for you, and in a conflict carry you captive, then make your confeſſion to Chriſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45082:9"/>
and labour to get pardon and power againſt it, Rom. 7. 18, 24, 25. as Paul did, he
acknowledged there he did ſin, but it was againſt his will, <hi>the ſin that I would not
do, I do it,</hi> and how doth it appear to be againſt his will, by the ſad moans he made
to Jeſus Chriſt, by his earneſt cry for deliverance, and by his acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that great mercy of God, that had found out ſuch a deliverer for him, ſo
you muſt go and do likewiſe. Do not allow your ſelf in any ſin, but ſhew you
diſallow
it, confeſs it: there is your encouragement, you have an Advocate with
the Father, Jeſus Chriſt therighteous, there is great liberty for you to goe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Covenant mercy; pardon and power againſt ſin are great Covenant mercyes.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Goe and ſin no more,</hi> that is, be ſure you take heed you do not commit that
ſin again, for which God hath eſpecially afflicted you, or hath threatned you for,
that ſin God hath in eſpecial manner been dealing with you for, chaſtiſing you for,
goe and ſin no more, commit that ſin no more, ſo he ſaith to that woman, Joh. 8.
<hi>Goe ſin no more,</hi> take heed of Adultery as long as you live, you muſt remember
that ordinarily the chaſtiſements and afflictions God brings on his people, are for
their ſins, and there are ſome ſpecial ſins of the people of God that are the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of ſpecial chaſtiſements, when God doth not caſt you into hell for them, but
doth deliver you and ſave you, then that is your great duty, that you ſhould live
with a fear of that ſin all your dayes, and take heed of that, Pſal. 89. 33. <hi>If thy
Sons break my Statutes I will chaſtiſe them with the Rods of men.</hi> We ought to look
on every Chaſtiſement as coming to us for ſin, and to find out thoſe ſpecial ſins, and
there ſhould be the great care of a Chriſtian, that he ſhould forſake them, not to
meddle with them any more, that that hath pulled down ſo great a Judgement,
Oh take heed you ſin that ſin no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, how ſhall we know, what is that ſin that God doth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
chaſtiſe us for, that we may be warned and take heed ever of committing
that ſin any more?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Obſerve and take ſpecial notice what evil God doth threaten with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and Chaſtiſement on his people, for what ſins God doth eſpecially threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to puniſh his people for all afflictions, are the accompliſhment of Gods word,
they are the fulfilling of Gods Threatnings, therefore in the Threatning you may
read what the ſin is that God puniſheth, that that he ſaith, Pſal. 89. <hi>when they break
my Laws, I will chaſtiſe them with Rods.</hi> Eſpecially God doth threaten to puniſh
with his immediate hand, afflictions that come from God more immediately, are
to puniſh thoſe ſins that men cannot ſee, that doe not lye under the obſervation
of men, that men cannot reach, ſins committed in fecret, Hebr. 13. 4. <hi>whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Adulterers God will judge,</hi> God himſelf will judge them, they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that ſin ſecretly, out of the view of men, but God himſelf undertaketh to
judge that. So 1 Theſ. 4. 6. <hi>Let no man goe beyond and defraud his Brother in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
becauſe that the Lord is the Avenger of all ſuch,</hi> if there be any ſecret hidden way of
unrighteouſneſs, and Oppreſſion, that men cannot find out, the Lord himſelf is the
Avenger of ſuch.</p>
            <p>2. Obſerve for what ſins God hath inflicted puniſhment on his profeſſing
people of old, for they are written for our example, there we ſhall read the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
of God againſt ſin, and the ordinary way of his diſpenſations againſt
them, when they are ſins of a profeſſing people. 1 Cor. 10. 6. The Apoſtle gives a
Catalogue of thoſe ſins for which God did inflict variety of Judgements on his
peopel Iſrael in the wilderneſs, as that he would doe in the ſame way, or in a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45082:10"/>
greater, among Profeſſors in goſpel times: theſe things were our example, to the
intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted, neither be ye Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
as ſome of them were, neither commit fornication, as ſome of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
nor tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them tempted, nor murmure, as ſome of
them murmured: Theſe are the ſins that provoke God to thoſe variety of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
There was Idolatry, ſuperſtition, worſhipping God in a falſe way, &amp; Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that ſin of uncleanneſs, and the tempting of Chriſt: How did they tempt
him? By deſpiſing his own way of providing for them, having low common
thoughts of that Manna from Heaven; preferring the ſatiſfying their own luſts,
before the counſel and will of God to lead them to eternal life. There was a
murmuring ſpirit againſt God, and againſt thoſe God ſet up, for theſe things God
did puniſh, 1 Cor. 11. 30. <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſick among you, and many
fallen aſleep.</hi> What cauſe? Their ſlightneſs at the Sacrament, want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for it, and being in the ſpirit of it, for this cauſe many are ſick and
fallen aſleep.</p>
            <p>3. If you would know what ſin God doth chaſtiſe and puniſh you for, take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
notice of what ſin God doth repreſent the guilt of before you in the time of
your ſickneſs; or in the time of the viſitation of his people, God doth many times
carry a diſcovery of the ſin in the puniſhment, it carryes a great deal of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with it, may be many times you have heard many a Sermon that hath convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
you of that very ſin, that you have taken no notice of: but God hath ſet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you in the time of affliction, and diſtreſs, it may be that hath been the thing,
for which you have prayed God to deliver you and ſpare you now, and you would
mend that courſe. How many on their ſick beds have confeſſed and bewailed
their contempt of the word of God, of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the goſpel, and their
Sabbath breaking, God hath laid the weight of it on them in the time of their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and they have promiſed amendment: uſually, that is the ſpecial provocation
God hath, which he makes mens Conſciences to ſmite them for, at ſuch a time,
that though it may be Conſcience hath told thee many a time, and checkt thee,
but now awakeneth thee in another manner, therefore it is ſaid, you find God
doth many times repreſent the guilt of ſin (that hath long time before been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted)
in the time of affliction, and thereby tells you it was laid up among his
Treaſures, hence, Pſal. 25. 7. <hi>Lord remember not the ſins of my Youth.</hi> It was in a
time of affliction God brought to remembrance, and brought into his view the
guilt of ſome youthful ſins,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Job. 13, 26. <hi>Thou haſt made me to poſſeſs all the ſins of my
youth;</hi> that is, God had repreſented them to him in the horror, terror and guilt of
them: ſo God ſuffers many times even ſins that have been pardoned in his own,
to be repreſented to them as if they had never been pardoned, in the time of
affliction, that they might be the more humbled for them, and might eſteem the
manifeſtation of a pardon in reſpect of thoſe ſins: So 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 18. Saith that
woman to Eliſha, when God had ſlain her ſon, <hi>Doſt thou come to bring my ſins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance?</hi>
Afflictions bring ſins to remembrance, thoſe that it may be we have
forgotten, they are as if they were newly committed, thoſe ſins that were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
to God: obſerve in the time of diſtreſs, what are thoſe ſins God doth
load your Conſciences with, that you would be glad to be unburthened of, that
you make many vows and promiſes to God of amendment, that is your great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when God hath anſwered your cry, that you ſin no more; take heed you doe
not lick up thoſe vomits you have vomitted out in time of diſtreſs, and break
<pb facs="tcp:45082:10"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:45082:11"/>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45082:11"/>
your promiſe and vow to God. By a diligent obſervance of theſe things you may
ſee what is the quarrel God hath perſonally with you, and therefore to take heed
that you doe not provoke him anew.</p>
            <p>2. The Reaſons of it. There are two heads of reaſons: I ſhall take up
only thoſe given in the Text, expreſly or implyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Is drawn from God, why you ſhould take ſuch care that you do not
ſin again, doe not abide in an unconverted eſtate, and doe not allow your ſelf in
any evill. Doe not abide in any ſin God hath puniſhed you for: there are two
Arguments, 1. From the mercy and goodneſs of God to you; thou art healed
and reſtored to means of ſalvation, therefore doe not ſin any more, doe not live
in ſuch a ſtate, mercy beſpeaks thee. 2. From the Juſtice of God that ſlandeth
ready to avenge abuſed mercyes: if you doe, be ſure you muſt look for great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
evills then any you have had, a worſe thing then thirty eight years ſickneſs, or
any plague.</p>
            <p>2. The Arguments drawn from our ſelves, ſhould engage us not to ſin any
more, 1. Our own engagements and promiſes to God not to ſin any more:
Have you not made many vows and promiſes at ſuch a time that you would not?
Now God expecteth that you ſhould pay your vows. 2. From the nature of
this duty of thankfullneſs to God: You will all owne that you owe God Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs
for healing mercy, the truth of it appears in this, that you doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
God again, it is elſe but to mock God, if you be not reſolved to ſin no
more. But,</p>
            <p>1. From God, from the mercy of God, that is a great Argument why you
ſin no more, becauſe God hath healed you; if you look upon this healing mercy,
how can you kick againſt that bowels, love and kindneſs that hath healed you?
The great deſign of mercy is to lead you to Repentance, Rom. 2. 4. <hi>The goodneſs
of God that leadeth thee to Repentance,</hi> that is the errand that every mercy comes on
to you, its the voice and language of every mercy and deliverance, that you ſhould
<hi>Sin no more,</hi> ſhould not abuſe this mercy, by ſinning againſt the God of your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
You are healed: Who healed you, whence was it you were healed? Was
it not wonderfull mercy of God, that you ſhould be on this ſide the bottomleſs
pit? Were not many of you unprepared to dye, when you were looking into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity?
it was dreadfull to think into what eternity you were going: would
you not have given the world for a day more, and for the ſtriving of Gods Spirit?
Now God hath healed you; the mercy and kindneſs of God are ſaid to be Cords
to draw us, Hoſ. 11. 3. <hi>I drew them with the Cords of a man:</hi> They are not draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as you draw Beaſts, but as men are drawn: How is that? It is by arguments
ſuitable to reaſon; There is ſo much goodneſs and truth appears in every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, that nothing can carry greater perſwaſion to draw you to God, and
to prevent your ſin. O the Rhetorick there is in mercy, if you could but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Language of it, wonderfull ſweetneſs there is in every mercy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you not to ſin; and there is not only Rhetorick in it, but Logick, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
reaſon to take hold of the rational part of man, if thou haſt any thing of a man,
and of the rational being God hath made.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have ſhewed you here, and given you ſome hints of thoſe Arguments,
mighty Arguments, that lye in a delivering mercy, the language it ſpeaks to
them that are delivered, to caution them againſt ſin, and againſt any provocation
to God. There are three Arguments, a threefold Cord, that might draw and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45082:12"/>
perſwade men to this duty, that when they are delivered and ſaved by God, they
ſhould take heed they do not ſin any more, they do not deſpiſe and contemn this
mercy of God, for every abuſe of it is the higheſt contempt of mercy, <hi>deſpiſeſt thou
the riches of his goodneſs?</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="sermon">
            <head>SERM. III.</head>
            <p>WE are now upon the ſecond Doctrine, <hi>viz. That they that are under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
and ſaving mercy ought to be very careful that they ſin no more,</hi>
that is, 1. Not to abide in any ſtate of ſin, you that God hath ſpared
longer in this world, you ſhould not live without Chriſt and converſion one day
more. 2. Not to ſin any ſin willingly or wilfully, to live in any known ſin, or to
approve of ſin. 3. Eſpecially be careful you return not to ſuch evils that God
hath been puniſhing of you for. And you may know them thus. Thoſe that
God hath awakened your Conſciences to charge upon your Souls at ſuch a time:
and thoſe God hath helped you to make many promiſes never to commit them,
take heed of ſuch ſins eſpecially. Methinks the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth in a moſt
compaſſionate way plead with poor Souls, and with every ſinner, that they ſhould
ſin no more: And by theſe three Arguments, 1. From the kindneſs and mercy
that they have received from the Lord, thou art healed, therefore ſin no more.
And there are theſe two main Arguments in it, 1. It is great ingratitude to God
to ſin again after healing mercy, would you carry it ſo to any man that was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of your healing. A Phyſitian whoſe endeavours God hath bleſſed,
would you therefore do him the greateſt miſchief? Thus you do when you ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, who is the Author of all your deliverances. What is ſin, but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
as much as the ſinner can, to deſtroy the very Being of him that hath given
and preſerved your Beings. This is an ill requital, Deut. 32. 5. <hi>Do you thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
the Lord,</hi> is this all the thanks that you will give to a healing God, to ſpit in
the face of Chriſt, and do him all the deſpight you can? methinks it is a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking
expreſſion, 2 Sam. 15. 17 <hi>Is this thy kindneſs to thy Friend;</hi> to ſuch a friend
as David was, that you will goe into the Camp of his Enemies. So by every ſin
you goe aſide from God. Hath God ſaved thee from Hell, and delivered thee
out of the pit, and is this all thy requital? That that goes neareſt to God are ſins
againſt love, Pſal. 55. 12. <hi>Had it been an Enemy I could have born it, but it was thou
my friend, and my familiar.</hi> So ſaith God to every ſaved ſinner, thou whom I ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from going down to the pit, and ſhewed ſuch kindneſs to: Ingratitude is an
evil that is abhorring among mankind, and the greateſt of all evils. Our Lord
Ieſus tels us Math. 5. 45. <hi>To do good unto them that do good unto us, ſinners will do the
ſame,</hi> and one man to another. Indeed, it is to act like God, and to be a good
Chriſtian, to do good againſt evil, but it is to act the part of the Devil to do evil
againſt goodneſs, they are the vileſt of all ſinners. Therefore that ſhould be a
great Argument with them that are healed, hath God healed you? Do not the
greateſt wrong and injury againſt God. 2. It is not only ingratitude to God, but it
is a great injury to our ſelves; and if that be not a great Argument to prevail, If
thou art ſo vile and ſinful that the kindneſs of God will not prevent your ſin, yet
methinks your own miſchief thereby might perſwade you, as Pſal. 85. 8. <hi>I will
hearken what God the Lord will ſay, for he will ſpeak peace to his People, and to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
but let them not return again to folly.</hi> For it is the greateſt folly in the world
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45082:12"/>
For a mun to ſin after God hath ſpoken peace, and after he hath healed him, Deut
32. 6. <hi>Do you thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and unwiſe.</hi> It is the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
you can do your ſelves; if you conſider, 1. The folly that is in it, by this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God you may ſee where your true happineſs lyes, and where your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
miſery lyes. The miſſing of it in a mans chiefeſt end, is the greateſt folly,
now this is a miſſing of it in your chief end to ſin again. The mercy &amp; kindneſs of
God in healing of you doth manifeſt what kindneſs there is in this God, and what
reſt you may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd in returning to him, Pſ. 116. 7. <hi>Return unto thy reſt O my Soul, for the
Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.</hi> You find no reſt in the way of ſin, no Soul reſt
but in God. And thou haſt no reaſon to doubt but that there are Arms of mercy
ready to receive thee, that hath reached out ſo much love unto thee when thou
wert in the way of thy ſin. 2. It ſhows thee the way to greater mercy, as the
contrary is the way to thy greater miſery. A confeſſing and forſaking of ſin is
the way to find mercy. The Lord doth beſpeak in every healing mercy, that is
not all, I would do for thee, but do not hinder, nor forſake your own mercyes.
You have now experienced that you have to do with a God of mercy: and he that
hath ſhewed mercy to you through Chriſt, you may eaſily think how rich and
bountiful you may find him if you would cloſe with him. But if you turn aſide to
lying vanityes, you forſake your own mercyes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 8. 3. It is a great folly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
healing mercy gives ſpace for Repentance, and neglecting this is a deſpiſing
of the mercy; why are you reſtored but that you might have opportunity to make
your peace with God? It is a ſpace to repent, but ſinning is an abuſing this pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in miſpending the preſent time, that God hath given you to make ſure of a
good eſtate. What ſerious thoughts have you had, if you had time again how
you would improve it. 5. Take heed how you ſpend the time now you have it,
Rom. 2. 4. loſing a ſeaſon for Salvation, and it may be the laſt you may have
you would think it folly in other matters, for a vain companion or trifle, to loſe
the opportunity of getting a great bargain, here you do ſo for worſe then naught.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is a great injury and folly to your ſelves to ſin again after you have
been healed, for it is an acting againſt a mans own experience. God hath made
you to taſte the bitterneſs of your ſins, and yet he tels you in your deliverance,
how unwilling and loth he was to puniſh you; ſin brought all your evils, it was
free mercy that delivered you. Have you ſurfeited with the dainties of ſin, and
will you deſire them again? Thus David prayes, <hi>let me not eat of their dainties.</hi>
And the burnt child dreads the fire. Now mercy tels you, you have eſcaped, do
not run into ſin again; this will appear to be greater folly.</p>
            <p>But that is the firſt Argument from the goodneſs of God towards you; will
you hear then the language that your healing mercy ſpeaks. Oh the Oratory it
hath in the Ears and hearts of men, if we be men, O that it would beſpeak our
Souls now, and caution us againſt ſin.</p>
            <p>2. Another argument Jeſus Chriſt uſeth, and that is an argument uſed by
mercy: it doth not only put you in mind of the good you receive, but it gives
you warning of future miſery. If it were Juſtice that ſhould come to treat with
the ſinner, it would not be by warning, but by ſmiting: but mercy tells you how
the Juſtice of God ſtands engaged to avenge the abuſe of it. You muſt not be
pleaſed with your condition, and think the bitterneſs of death is over: No, a
worſe thing may befall you. Mercy is now willing to imbrace you, but if that
will not doe, Mercy will at length deliver you into the hands of Juſtice; and woe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45082:13"/>
to the Sinner that is ſo delivered by the hands of mercy! Methinks it is ſuch a
language as God ſpake to Balaam, Numb. 22. 31. when an Angel with a flaming
ſword ſtood in the way of his Rebellion: He was ſtriving to goe, though he found
difficulty in his way: So the Lord Jeſus tells you, there is a flaming ſword in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſinners way after deliverance, you run upon your own perill and uttermoſt
hazzard; the Judgements of God will be bitter, &amp; you will feel the ſmart of them.
And by theſe three Arguments, the Lord gives warning of Judgement to come
upon the Sinner that continues in ſin.</p>
            <p>1. Conſider that all the afflictions and troubles that you had, were a fruit of
your own doing: He puts you in mind to remember your former wayes and evill
doings. You were in the hands of Juſtice, and mercy hath delivered you; but it is
not a compleat and total deliverance, if you continue in ſin: it is but a Reprieve,
if you ſin again. There is a preſent reſpite of Judgement, it is not a conſuming
and deſolating Judgement: you are reprieved, but if you ſin, remember you are in
the hands of Juſtice ſtill, and thoſe afflictions you have ſuffered, are but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of thoſe ſorrows which God will bring upon you for your Sins.</p>
            <p>2. Remember that God hath greater ſtrokes, and can lay on heavier then any
yet: Dont you think that God hath ſpent all his arrows, or hath done his worſt,
No, He can doe yet a great deal more: God can heat the ſurnace ſeven times hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then ever yet: Lev. 26. 14. <hi>But if ye will not hearken unto me, to doe all theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
&amp;c. I will even puniſh you ſeven times more for your iniquityes.</hi> God hath
other arrows that are more poiſoned deadly arrows.</p>
            <p>3. Continuance in ſin will provoke God (after deliverance) to inflict greater
ſtrokes. As God can puniſh you more, ſo he will certainly puniſh an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
people, when Judgements and mercyes will not change them, Ezra. 9. 14.
<hi>Should we break again thy Commandments, wilt thou not be angry with us till thou haſt
conſumed us?</hi> That this holy man was afraid of after deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Why you ſhould take heed that you ſin no more; From the prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that is in mans nature to return again to ſin; more prone after deliverance,
eſpecially, thoſe that are in a ſtate of unregeneracy; when corrupt nature hath
been only under a chain of reſtraint, with what eagerneſs do they return to ſin
again. Yea, we find a proneneſs in Gods own Children, as Hezekiah after great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
his heart was lifted up, &amp; he did not render unto the Lord according
to the benefits received: How much more thoſe that are in a ſtate of ſin, you will
meet with the ſame Temptations, &amp; the Devil will be more buſie, and your own
heart more careleſs, if you be not exceeding cautious.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſider the engagements that lye upon healed ſinners, not to ſin any
more. And they are,</p>
            <p>1. From God, what a mighty engagement is that, when God ſaith, <hi>Oh do not
this abominable thing my Soul bates.</hi> That when you have had the love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God manifeſted to you, you ſhould carry it ſo to God.</p>
            <p>2. The engagement of your own vows. When God hath made ſin bitter to
you, O how ready were you to vow and engage to ſin no more! This, then, is a
forfeiting of your Bond and Obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> I. For <hi>Information: Hence learn; and you may ſee that our Thank fulneſs to God
(the main of it) doth not lye in our expreſſions only, but in our Spirits &amp; Converſations</hi> This
was a man that Jeſus Chriſt found forward in the Temple bringing his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering
to God, and he was early there: Chriſt finds him there diligently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45082:13"/>
upon the means, (very few are thus amongſt us, many are willing to be laſt at
the houſe of God, and the firſt that may go out) but now you will throw all that
you have done after your Thank-offering, if you go and ſin again. It is not
whole burnt-offering and Sacrifices, but a loving and ſerving God with all the
heart and Soul, that is acceptable to him. Therefore you muſt not think you
have made amends to God for healing mercy, becauſe you have given a verbal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement:
no, this is the language of mercy, and if you would be true to
God, <hi>goe and ſin no more,</hi> Pſal. 50. ult. <hi>Who ſo offereth praiſe glorifieth me, and to him
that ordereth his eonverſation aright, will I ſhow the Salvation of God.</hi> They go both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
to ſuch a one God will ſhow his Salvation. Indeed all our acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
elſe are but mockery. For to ſay <hi>God we thank thee,</hi> or to bring a publick
acknowledgement of praiſe to God, and yet for the ſinner to do all he can againſt
God, it is a horrid piece of mockery: you had better ſay nothing at all: As ſhe ſaid
to Sampſon, Judg. 16. <hi>Thou haſt mocked me, and haſt not told me all thine heart;</hi> ſo
may God ſay to many a ſinner. This muſt needs be a great ſin when inſtead of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
God, you come to provoke him; and to put the higheſt affront
upon the divine Majeſty, Pſal. 78, 36. <hi>They remembred that God was their Rock, and
the high God their Redeemer, nevertheleſs they flattered him with their mouth, and lyed to
him with their Tongue: for their heart was not upright with him, neither were they ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
in his Covenant.</hi> To think to flatter and ſpeak God fair, it is the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
a ſinner can put upon the great God, he that is able to diſcern all your
flatteryes, and what your hearts ſay, it is to put a great affront upon the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Majeſty, and inſtead of giving him the praiſe, it is a curſing and blaſpheming of
him to his face.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE II. It is of Reproof unto thoſe that are ſo far from taking heed that they ſin no
more after great and eminent Deliverances, when God hath unbound them and ſet them a
liberty, that they do ſin a great deal more;</hi> that inſtead of being reformed, and carrying
it better to God, they carry it a great deal worſe. This did ſtigmatize Ahaz,
2 Chron. 28. 22. <hi>This is that Abas,</hi> after his affliction, and Gods deliverance he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
more and more.</p>
            <p>And that the Lord charges upon Iſrael, Judg. 10. 11, 12. I delivered you from
ſuch and ſuch a miſery and affliction when you cryed, yet notwithſtanding, you
have forſaken me, therefore I will deliver you no more. In Jer. 1. 6. it is ſaid,
<hi>the Lord hearkened and heard, &amp; no man ſpake aright, no man repented him of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs,
ſaying, what have I done?</hi> like wild Creatures that have been chained up a
while they are the more fierce; They turned more fiercely after their wicked
wayes, and were more bold and daring in them: this is a great provocation.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE. III. It is of Exhortation to preſs this holy and ſuitable Counſel of Jeſus
Chriſt on them that have been under Deliverance:</hi> Have you been delivered from the
ſword of a cruel enemy, or the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> that killing diſeaſe? Have your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

of your Souls, what ſhall I doe for God? I cannot give you Counſel in better
words then Chriſt gives here, <hi>Goe and ſin no more,</hi> that is, take heed t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at you doe
not goe on in thoſe evills that God hath convinced any of in themſelves or others
in the time of their diſtreſs. As,</p>
            <p>1. In ſins of Omiſſion, God hath been puniſhing for theſe things: and how
many in bitterneſs of ſoul have expreſſed how God hath charged theſe home upon
their Conſciences, when they have been near unto death? as neglect of a right
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45082:14"/>
improvement of the precious ſeaſons of grace: when any of you live under ſoul-ſaving
means, under the offer and tender of Chriſt, and yet have not improved
it: Conſider that the neglect of Chriſt is the greateſt ſin, and it will be charged
by Chriſt at the day of Judgement among the greateſt of evils, even ſins of Omi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. latter end. This you did not to me. This neglect of Chriſt will be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
heavy at that day upon you, that doe not make it your great, main and daily
buſineſs to be turned and truly changed, to be fitted to die; when God hath put
you in fear of death and eternity, what evills have been your trouble and fear then
but your unfitneſs for that change? Will it not be your great ſin, that another
ſickneſs or danger ſhould find you as unprepared as you were? How bitterly
have I heard this lamented by ſome that they have not given up themſelves to be
in Covenant with the people of God as well as to the Lord; that they have been
negligent of Church Communion with Gods people. How many dying ones
have with bitterneſs of Soul bewailed this, that there own ſad and diſcouraging
thoughts of themſelves, or rather their own pride hath hindred from that which
is ſuch a Covenant-engaging duty. How many in a time of diſtreſs have made
theſe vows, that after ſuch a ſickneſs they would give themſelves up to God. Do
you look upon theſe as great things of Chriſt, and of his Intereſt; Hath not God
made the ſpecial promiſe of a bleſſing to a thouſand generations? That that doth
perpetuate there enjoyment of God to future Ages, is this joyning our ſelves to
the people of God. Therefore to live in the neglect of that is a great ſin, and if
God hath convinced you of it, take heed that you forfeit not your deliverance by
ſuch ſins.</p>
            <p>Again, negligence under the means of grace: This hath alſo been ſorrowfully
bewailed; either in not coming to hear, that they have neglected any Seaſon:
and when hearing, they have caſt Gods word behind them.</p>
            <p>2. As ſins of Omiſſion, ſo alſo of Commiſſion: when God hath convinced of
theſe ſins, take heed of them again. Hath God told you of Senſuality, or of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,
or unrighteouſneſs, take heed that theſe ſins do not live &amp; revive in you
after healing mercy: Let not God find you at theſe practices again. The Lord
ſaith to us, you ſhall have your life upon condition you will ſin no more, and you
accept it, and look upon it as a great favour: Now the Lord when he comes to
condemn you, will do it out of your own mouths, and this ſin, eſpecially, your ſin
after deliverance haſtens thy Judgement, 1 King. 2. 42. As Solomon ſaid to Shimei,
ſo here it may be ſaid to ſuch a ſinner.</p>

         <div n="4" type="sermon">
            <head>SERM. IV.</head>
            <p>THe Doctrine we are ſpeaking to is, <hi>That it is the duty of healed and ſaved ones
to be very careful they ſin no more.</hi> We ſhewed what it is to ſin no more,
and why ſuch as are under healing and ſaving mercyes ſhould ſin no
more. We are upon the improvement hereof by way of Exhortation, that I
may ſet home this Counſel of Jeſus Chriſt on all your hearts, and upon my own,
that we take good heed that we ſin no more. There are five or ſix Motives or
conſiderations to further our acceptance and improvement of this Counſel. If it
were no more then that it is the Counſel of Chriſt from his own bleſſed mouth,
who is a true lover of mens Souls, that were enough to further any that have
love to Jeſus Chriſt, and to their own Souls, to be careful to attend to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
Chriſt never adviſed any to their own hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:45082:14"/>
Suppoſe you had been hearing Chriſt himſelf, and that he had ſpoken in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to you, do not you think his words would have been of weight to you? why,
this is Chriſts advice, and not to that man only, but to all in like caſe, therefore
for your furtherance, Conſider,</p>
            <p>1. That ſinning again will diſappoint you of the good of your deliverance, I
ſay it will eat out the good and ſweet of it. The outward mercy of healing, or
whatever the Salvation of God is to you, it is not a mercy alone. Such is mans
miſery ſince the fall, that there is no outward mercy or diſpenſation of God to
him, but if it comes alone, it comes under the curſe, and it proves a greater miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
then a mercy; and where you enjoy any mercy from God, if it do not deliver
you from ſin, it is not in favour, but comes under the influence of the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
1 Tim. 4. 4, 5. As the Apoſtle ſaith of every Creature of God it is good, if it
be received with Thanksgiving, for it is ſanctified by the word of God and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) if it be received with a heart truly Thankful, it is ſanctified, without
this you have no good in any Creature enjoyment, becauſe it is unſanctified: as
whatever the ſinner doth is defiled, becauſe himſelf is defiled, ſo whatever he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
is defiled, he himſelf being unſanctified. Then mercy and outward delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
carries a great deal of good in it, when it fits you for Gods ſervice, then it
tends to the end of its firſt Inſtitution, to further the Service of God, but ſinning
again deſtroys this end of it. If a mercy makes you better, then it is a choice mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
but if it do not better you in your Souls, it is far from being good to you, I
may ſay of ſuch mercies as of Jonahs goard, Jon. 4. 5, 6. When he was in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
and the Sun beat upon him, and greatly afflicted him, and the Lord made
a goard to come up over Jonah, to be a ſhadow over his head, to deliver him
from his grief, and Jonah was exceeding glad of the goard. But Jonah was not
ſanctified hereby in his heart, by obedience to God, therefore there was a worm
that ſmote the Goard that it withered.</p>
            <p>You may be glad of your deliverances, but if ſin remain, it will be as a worm in
them to deſtroy the ſhadow &amp; the comforts of them; therefore take heed that
you ſin no more, for that will ſpoyle you of the beſt good of your mercyes, the
flower and ſweetneſs of a mercy will be eaten out thereby, that is the firſt Motive.</p>
            <p>2. Conſider, that ſinning after deliverance, will hinder you from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of other mercyes which God intends you together with your deliverance;
for that is not all God intends in ſhewing poor ſinners a common bounty, Chriſt
ſeems to tell this healed man here, this is not all my meaning in coming to heal
thee, I have Soul healing to beſtow upon thee, but ſin ſtops and prevents this, as
the Lord ſaid to David, <hi>If that had been too little I would have done ſo and ſo for thee,</hi>
2 Sam. 12. 8. the outward mercy is the leaſt, God is inclined to do more, but as
Jer. 5. 25. <hi>Your iniquities have turned away his Ear from you, and your ſins have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
good things from you.</hi> Are you not made better by mercyes, are you not changed
&amp; renewed by repentance under mercyes, what is the matter? why, your ſins have
hindred, your iniquityes have kept good things from you. As it is ſaid, God
makes a way for his anger, ſo ſometimes he doth for his mercy; in removing a
preſent Judgement: but Impenitency, unreformedneſs, that ſtands in the way
God had made for his mercy; as it is ſaid of Chriſt at Capernaum, <hi>he could do no
great works there becauſe of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> So to ſpeak with reverence, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
proceed in mercy when ſin is renewed. Chriſt tells them, Luk. 16 11. <hi>If you
have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your truſt the true
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45082:15"/>
Riches?</hi> if you carry it not well to God in a common mercy, do you think that
God will beſtow and betruſt you with more and better mercyes?</p>
            <p>3. Conſider, that ſinning after deliverance it is a greater ſin then your ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you received the mercy, you cannot ſin now at ſo eaſy a Rate as before; you
ſin with a higher hand. Your mercy puts an aggravation upon your ſin, <hi>for to him
that knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> Iam. 4. <hi>ult.</hi> that is, he ſinneth
at a higher Rate then another, becauſe he ſinneth againſt light, yea, and againſt
love, (Gods love) therefore his ſin is of a deeper dye then the ſins of others are.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Conſider, they that ſin after Deliverance, they are a greater provocation to
God; God is more angry with ſuch, for ſuch ſins then others, 2 Sam. 12. 8. the
Lord by the Prophet reckons up great things to David he did for him.</hi> I anointed
thee King over Iſrael, I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul, I gave thee thy Maſters
houſe, and thy Maſters wives into thy boſome, and I gave thee the houſe of Iſrael and of
Judah, and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given thee ſuch and ſuch
things, wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord? <hi>for it is ſaid, Chap.</hi>
11. ver. <hi>ult.</hi> The thing that David had done diſpleaſed the Lord, ſo that the Sword ſhould
not depart from his houſe, <hi>&amp;c. Sins after Deliverances, and great Mercyes are a
great provocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Conſider, ſins after deliverance they are ſins againſt your ſpecial engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Covenants; I doubt not but many of you in time of diſtreſs have made
that prayer which David did, Pſal. 119. 175. <hi>Let my Soul live, and it ſhall praiſe thee,</hi>
have not many of your prayers and cryes in ſickneſs been, that you might live to
praiſe God to be better in Gods Service; Now to live in ſin to Gods diſhonour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deliverance, how contrary is this to your Ingagements, to reproach and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
his holy Name afterward.</p>
            <p>6. Conſider, the great advantage of not ſinning any more; this is preſerving
Diet of an healed ſinner, Chriſt as a wiſe and faithful Phiſitian preſcribes this as
health preſerving Diet. This is the way to preſerve and continue the mercyes
you have received and do enjoy, as you will, if you continue a holy man, &amp;c. take
heed to ſin no more, Iſai. 48. 18. <hi>O that thou hadſt hearkened unto my Commandments,
then had thy peace been as a River, and thy Righteouſneſs as the waves of the Sea;</hi> it would
have born down all before it, all ſhould have given way, no Enemy ſhould have
diſturbed that peace given you by the favour of God upon his Reconciliation with
you. But by way of Direction.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould ſay now, but what is that that we muſt do that we may not ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more: Here are but a few words, but there is a great deal couched in them as
the ſenſe of them; A little to ſpread before you what is contained therein, <hi>Goe
and ſin no more.</hi> that is,</p>
            <p>1. Let this be your ſpecial care to improve the time you have by this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and your ſaving mercyes to the ſaving of your Souls: That is, labour now
to get into a ſaved Eſtate, take heed you do not again nor any longer neglect
the offers and tenders of Salvation made to you, and if you ſay this is to put a man
upon impoſſibilities, ſuch as man cannot do, and it is as much as to ſay, to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
man eat no more, &amp; to a thirſtyman drink no more, ſo is it to ſay ſin no more,
Job. 15. 16. my meaning therefore is, labour to be in ſuch a Caſe &amp; Eſtate, that
you may ſo ſin no more as formerly, or as others do that is, labour to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that lyes in two things.</p>
            <p>1. To make that your great buſineſs to get a clear knowledge and through
ſenſe of the evil of ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:45082:15"/>
That you heartily cloſe with Ieſus Chriſt, that is the way to ſin no more.</p>
            <p>1. Get a clear knowledge and deep ſenſe of your ſin. Man is a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and is alwayes acting and moving for an end, and that which is his greateſt
encouragement in his motion toward ſuch an end, is the apprehenſion or good,
that draws the affections of man, either real good, or the appearance of it: and
nothing will deter a man from the practice of evill, but the underſtanding it to be
evill: the underſtanding is the guide of the will, the will hath the command of
every other faculty, what the underſtanding repreſents as evill, the will avoids it,
refuſes it, and commands the whole man ſo to carry to it, and now the will of man
will follow the ultimate ſentence of the Judgement, when the ſinner is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
and can repreſent the evill to be an evil indeed to the Judgement. Now
when is that? The meer knowledge of good or evill, will not perſwade to the
embracing the one, or avoiding the other, to fallen man, it will (I ſay) be no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
as it would to man in the ſtate of innocency: Now there muſt be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the knowledge of good and evil, but the experience of both: and by the ſame
way that man was brought in love with ſin, muſt he be brought out of love with
it. How came man at firſt to be in love with ſin, but by experience? The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
tempted him, telling him that by eating the forbidden fruit he ſhould know
both good and evill. And by the loſs of good, he loſt the inclination of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
unto good, and thereby came to taſt nothing but ſweetneſs in the creature.
Now there muſt not only be in the recovery of man, a diſcovery that ſin is evil,
but an experience of it that it is ſo. He muſt be cut off from evill by finding the
bitterneſs that is in ſin, Jer. 2. 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt know that it is an evil and a bitter thing.</hi>
A ſpeculative knowledge of the evill of it will not doe, but you muſt know it to be
bitter alſo: and indeed this is the laſt concluſion of the ſanctified judgement that
it repreſents to the will that ſin is a moſt bitter thing: Therefore ſaith Job,
<hi>the Lord hath made me to poſſeſs the ſins of my youth, by writing bitter things againſt me.</hi>
He came to have an enjoyment of the fruits of his ſin, thoſe fruits of his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Now what pleaſure, what profit have you in things that God hath made
ſo bitter? You could not have believed it; but now God hath made you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it. Hence the Lord promiſes Covenant good to thoſe that doe reform their
evill wayes. Lev. 26. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>If their uncircumciſed hearts be humbled</hi> &amp;c. When a man
is brought not to ſin, and to diſlike ſin, when his ſoul is humbled in the ſence of
the evill of ſin. Therefore as you would not ſin, O beg of the Lord and make
it part of your daily prayer that God would give you an humbling ſenſe of ſin, that
it may be more evill to look over it, then ever it was pleaſure to commit it. When
the arrows, thoſe poiſoned arrows come to drink up a mans ſpirits, when he
hath been in the fire of Gods anger, this will make him pray. Then labour to
get an humbling ſenſe of ſin: whatever we talk of future judgements of God for
ſin, it ſeems nothing till we are throughly humbled, till God makes us feel what
and how grievous it is to have an hell in our Conſciences: this will make ſin
terrible.</p>
            <p>2. As you muſt feel the evill of ſin, ſo you muſt heartily cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt.
You will never be taken off from what you thought to be a good, untill you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ſin to be ſuch an evill, and Chriſt the beſt good. When you come to
obtain pardoning mercy from God, and ſanctifying, your will is then carried out
with a greater pleaſure in the wayes of Chriſt, then it took in the wayes of ſin.
And this counſel Chriſt gives to the blind man caſt out by the Jews, Joh. 9. 35.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45082:16"/>
When he had found him, he ſaid to him, doſt thou believe on the Son of God: As
if he ſhould ſay, this is your great buſineſs: And if ever you would be engaged
againſt ſin, you muſt cloſe heartily with Jeſus Chriſt, this is the whole work of
true Converſion: Now the Seed of God is ſown in ſtead of the Seed of the Devil,
and he is brought under another power, 1 Joh. 5. 3. it is ſaid of ſuch, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments

born of God cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God,</hi> neither fully, nor finally, not with
the full conſent of his will: It would be contrary to his renewed principle and
ſanctified Reaſon, that a man ſhould chuſe miſery in ſtead of good, when he

believing. This is the man that takes the counſel of Chriſt, to ſin no more: The
Lord hereby did repreſent himſelf to him as the Phyſitian of his Soul, and minds
him of a greater good then the meer healing of his body. Oh that this were the

and a through ſenſe of the bitterneſs of that ſin for which God hath been chaſtiſing
of you. Though you may loſe the ſenſe of your affliction, never loſe the ſenſe
of your ſin: the dreadful and terrible thoughts you had of ſin, when you were
looking into Eternity. You ſhould labour to remember thoſe things when you
are well, and delivered, that ſo your Soul may be kept in an humbled frame: thus
the Church, Lam. 3. 19; 20. <hi>Remembring mine affliction, and my miſery, the wormwood,
and the gall, my Soul hath them ſtill in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</hi> This ſhould
be the care of every Chriſtian, remembring the terrors of God, and the terrors of
ſin, how bitter God hath made it to you in your affliction, and this you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
continually. And as we ſoon forget the ſenſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſo we ſoon loſe the
humbling ſenſe of affliction, this is our miſery; we ſhould labour to keep up the
ſenſe of both upon our Souls to humble and encourage us. If ſo be your Souls
were in the ſame Agony, if you could put them in the ſame Caſe as they were,
when the Terrors of God were upon you, and you were within the ſight of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
you dare not commit thoſe ſins as you did before.</p>
            <p>3. If you would ſin no more, then take heed of the Temptations to ſin, avoid
all occaſions of ſinning. It is a meer pretence for a man to ſay, he doth what he
can to avoid any evil while he runs into the Temptation to it, <hi>Jude</hi> Epiſt. <hi>v.</hi> 22.
Hating the very garments ſpotted with the fleſh: would you not be defiled with
ſin, take heed of coming near the garment ſpotted with the fleſh. You cannot
goe upon hot coals and not be ſcorched, nor touch pitch and not be defiled. Thoſe
ſins that are greateſt Temptations, you muſt eſpecially take heed of them, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very appearance of evil, that you may be ſure to avoid that which is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evil. Take heed of that which appears to be ſo, ſtand at the greateſt diſtance
from it. Our Lord Jeſus taught us to make this our dayly prayer, Math. 6. <hi>Lead
us not into Temptation,</hi> we ſhould be ſo much afraid of it. I grant, when ever God
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45082:16"/>
doth lead us into Temptation, we have a greater encouragement to pray, that
God would lead us out of it; But you ſhould beware that you do not lead and
thruſt your ſelves thereinto: That you do not tempt the Devil. You have no
encouragement to truſt God to preſerve you from the evil that you run into. The
Lord will ſay, who bid you goe upon the Devils ground, when ſnares and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
watch for you, God never ſent you. It is ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, Math. 4.
though he was without ſin, and had no perſonal evil, yet when he went into the
place of Temptation, he did not goe of himſelf, it is ſaid, the Spirit led him into
the Wilderneſs. Doſt thou think thou canſt withſtand a Temptation better
then Chriſt himſelf. Temptation is the Seed of the Devil, and our hearts are
the natural ground: would you not think him a mad man that ſows bryars and
Thorns in his ground: they will come up faſt enough. So will you run to the
Devil to fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ten his Temptations. They that would avoid ſin ſhould ſtand at a
great diſtance from every Temptation, avoiding thoſe places and Companyes
that are too hard for them: ſtand at a great diſtance if ever you would be kept.
Adam in Innocency, though he had no ſin, the Devil made way to enter in, that
crooked, winding Serpent. It was going into the Temptation that loſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
therefore we ſhould fly from it.</p>
            <p>4. If you would not ſin after Deliverance, then labour to get through know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and make a full repreſentation to your Souls of the evil effects and fruits of
every ſin. Do not look upon ſin as it is the Temptation, and comes in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of good, but look what will be the Iſſue of it. This the Lord Jeſus
minds him of: Remember worſe things will befal you, Deut. 32. 29. <hi>O that my
People were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would comſider their latter end.</hi> It
is a part of your greateſt wiſdome to conſider what will be the end of your ſinful
practices. A rational man ſhould act for an end, and all that means ſhould be
commended to him that ſuits his beſt end. It is a great Truth, the meaſures of
good and evil are as they ſtand related to Eternity. As he ſaid to Joab, 2 Sam. 2
26. <hi>will it not be bitterneſs in the latter end:</hi> ſo would I ſay to every Soul, Conſider
what will be afterward, that you ſhould labour to poſſeſs your Souls with: that
will diſcover the Hook that lyes under the bait. All theſe pleaſures and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are but to catch your Souls, and bring you into everlaſting miſery.</p>
            <p>5. If you would ſin no more, That which is wrapt up in his heavenly Counſel,
it is, that you would ſeriouſly weigh the advantage you ſhall have by not ſinning.
If you would not ſee ſorrow any more, you muſt not ſin any more, 1 Pet. 3. 10. <hi>He
that loveth life, and would ſee good dayes, let him refrain his Tongue from evil, and his
lips that they ſpeak no guile:</hi> Would you ſee merry and proſperous dayes, then you
muſt ſin no more in heart, Tongue, or Converſation. It is true, that the moſt
holy man in the world that walks moſt cloſely with God, cannot expect to be free
from outward trouble and affliction, but they ſhall not be evils to him. He may
dye in youth and ſtrength, but he ſhall fill up his time, as much as he that lives
one hundred years. That man that walks with God ſhall never ſee any evil
dayes, for his very afflictions ſhall further his everlaſting good. It is a Truth,
that walking cloſe with God, and free from ſin, is the beſt way even to outward
proſperity. Though there may be afflictions and ſorrows to particular believers
for the exerciſe of their grace, yet walking with God will give laſting peace and
proſperity to them that ſo walk cloſely with him, when a people do ſo, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace to Believers. Would you loſe all your ſweet enjoy ments, would you

ſin again, but if you would avoid theſe, it is by labouring to be in a way of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>6. If you would ſin no more, be in the uſe of all means that God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to preſerve you from ſin, with earneſt prayer, for his Spirit to help you to
mortifie ſin, and be found in the way of obedience, that you may be aſſiſted by his
Spirit in the doing of it. All means &amp; endeavours that any man can uſe himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of Gods Spirit will not do, Rom. 8. 13. <hi>mortifie the deeds of the body by
the Spirit.</hi> You may refrain a while, but you will never deſtroy one ſin without
the Spirit, and this Spirit is to be obtained by prayer, Luk. 11. 13. the Lord will
give his Spirit to them that ask him: O be earneſt with the Lord to lead you by the
hand of his Spirit that ſhall guide and aſſiſt you in a holy courſe.</p>
            <p>7. And Laſtly, Reſolve not in your own, but in Chriſts ſtrength that you will not
ſin any more, Job. 34. 31. 32. I know reſolutions and engagements in a mans own
ſtrength, they will fail him, Peter is a ſad Inſtance, Luk. 22. He was as reſolved
as any could be, <hi>though I dye with thee, I will never deny thee.</hi> That is the Reaſon
why they come to no better Effect, the Vows and Reſolutions of men, becauſe
they think they can do it of themſelves; Therefore (ſaith David) <hi>I ſaid I would
take heed to my wayes that I ſin not with my Tongue,</hi> Pſal. 143. But he begs that God
would keep the door of his lips, &amp; eſtabliſh his ſaying, I ſaid, through the grace of
God that I would do my duty, &amp; be waiting upon God for his help, Pſal. 119. 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>I will run the wayes of thy Commandments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart. Teach me
O Lord the way of thy Statutes and I will keep them unto the end.</hi> Thus we ſhould take

But labour to walk more cloſely with God for time to come.</p>

I remember I have heard of one in <hi>England</hi> near <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> that had ſuch expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions
upon a great affliction; that God had now done his worſt, but God made her
a living monument of his ſorer Judgements, &amp; that for many years. It is a great
deal of boldneſs for any ſinners to limit God in his Juſtice, as well as in his mercy,
for any to ſay of God in his mercy, <hi>can God provide for us?</hi> it is a tempting God;
ſo for any to ſay, Can God bring a greater Judgement? yea, there may be a great
deal worſe: Chriſt tels this man (you do not read what his ſickneſs was, but you
find by the Effects it was very diſtreſſing, he was unable to help himſelf, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a friend to help him, and had lain under this infirmity thirty eight years, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45082:17"/>
yet the Lord Jeſus tells him) if he doth not carry it better, worſe things ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
him, and the Lord tells us of the laſt times in which we live, Dan. 12. 1. There
ſhall be a time of trouble ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation; there are
troubles God will bring upon a profeſſing people, ſuch as never was worſe on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nation, ſo there are thoſe God can bring upon a perſon ſuch as never were
worſe on any perſon. But more particularly, 1. There are worſe Judgements
in this world, that God can inflict, then ever have been inflicted on any. 2. There
are worſe Judgements God hath to inflict in another world.</p>
            <p>1. In this world, as 1. Temporal, or outward Judgements, ſuch as reſpect the
outward man, God can bring other manner of outward miſeryes then ever yet he
hath done on any. 2. Spiritual Judgements, ſuch as reſpect the inward man.</p>
            <p>1. For outward Judgements, the Lord hath variety of them, a great variety,
but eſpecially we read of four ſore Judgements of God, Ezek. 14. 21. <hi>For thus ſaith
the Lord, how much more when I ſend my four ſore Judgements on Jeruſalem, the Sword, the
Famine, the noyſome Beaſts, and the Peſtilence; to cut off from is man and Beaſt.</hi> God
hath ſent his Sword among you, but Famine is a ſorer Judgement, and noyſome
Beaſts that is a ſorer Judgement ſtill, and the Peſtilence, but how much ſorer are
theſe, when all theſe are together; when what the Sword leavs the Famine ſhall
devour, and what the Famine leaves, the wild Beaſts ſhal devour, and what theſe
leave, the Peſtilence ſhall devour. When God ſends all his Judgements at once upon a
people, that is a ſore affliction, as there are worſe ſorts of Judgements, ſo there is
never an one of theſe ſorts, but God can make it a worſe Judgement in the degree
of it, he can make every one of theſe Judgements a great deal worſe, as you read,
Ezek 9. 10. <hi>As for me ſaith the Lord, my eye ſhall not ſpare, neither will I have pitty: but
I will recompenſe their wayes on their heads.</hi> When Judgements come in ſuch a
way of Iudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ment, without any mixture of Gods ſparing and pittying mercy, then
it is a ſorer Judgement: when the Errand of them is only to deſtroy, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine,
and purge a People, but to ruine them, and God will have no more mercy on
them, this is a ſore affliction.</p>
            <p>2 There are ſpiritual judgements that God inflicteth in this world, and they
are a great deal worſe then any outward judgement; there are variety of ſpiritual
judgements; but eſpecially there are four main ſorts of ſpiritual judgements, &amp;
the ſoreſt, there is the ſword, that is the word of God, when it is only for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
only for conviction: a wound in the conſcience is more dreadfull then a
wound in the body: when God ſends an arrow into the conſcience, <hi>a wounded
ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18. 14. it is an intollerable unſufferable wound, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when God will provide no balm in Gilead, nor healing medicine for it, when
God ſhall make a man a terror to himſelf, this is a ſorer judgement. The Soul
is the tenderer part, the more ſpiritual part, therefore every ſuch judgement is
far greater, that reacheth the Soul: and ſpiritual Famine, that is a more terrible
judgement, when there ſhall be a famine, not of bread, not of that only, but of
hearing the word of the Lord, <hi>Amos.</hi> 8. 9, 10. That is a threatning of a ſorer
judgement, when you want bread for your ſouls, there ſhall be none to break it to
you. And thoſe ſpiritual wild beaſts, thoſe that will make a prey of mens ſouls;
either thoſe that will perſecute for conſcience ſake, or as Chriſt ſaith of them,
<hi>Math.</hi> 23 13. Such as will not goe to heaven themſelves, nor ſuffer any elſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe;
when the bonds ſhall not be only on your bodies; but on your conſciences;
you ſhall be conſcience bound, and there ſhall be ſnares laid for your conſciences,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45082:18"/>
this is a ſore Judgement, when you ſhall have ſuch, that in ſtead of feeding the
Flock, ſhall devour the Flock, Eccleſ. 34. 4. when there ſhall be none but wolves
that ſhall not ſpare the Flock of Chriſt, or make any profeſſion to be ſo, this is a
ſore Judgement; as it is a far more deſireable mercy then any outward enjoyment,
for a people to ſee their Teachers, they are not driven into corners, Iſai. 30. 12.
So it is a ſorer Judgement then the want of any outward comfort, that in ſtead of
thoſe that lead you to Heaven, ſhould as blind guides lead you to Hell, and both
together fall into the pit. And thoſe Temptations of the Devil, when God lets
looſe Satan with violent oppreſſing Temptations, and God will give up men to
be oppreſſed by the violent and ſubtle Temptations of the Devil: and then this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
plague is the worſt of all plagues, that Peſtilence of a hard ſeared Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that plague of the heart, when God ſhall inflict it as a Judgement, when
God ſhall give up men to their hardneſs, yea, into the hand of their own luſts
Pſal. 81. 11, 12. <hi>So I gave them up to their own hearts luſts,</hi> into the hands of their
hearts luſts. This is the ſoreſt Judgement that God can inflict on a people
in this world, when it is in the higheſt degree of it, a man to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up to his own hearts luſts, when the Lord ſaith to a people, ye will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and ye ſhall not be ſaved, ye will not be reformed, and ye ſhall not, ye will
not be made clean, therefore ye ſhall be filthy ſtill. That very ſin of living in ſin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deliverance, is a greater Judgement then the affliction out of which ye were
delivered: when God inflicteth ſpiritual Judgements in the higheſt degree, as there
are higher degrees of ſpiritual judgements, when temporal and ſpiritual ſhall
be together, that is a great deal worſe, when God ſhall follow you with all his
ſore judgements, both theſe afflictive to the body and the Soul, when there ſhall
be a Famine to the body and the Soul, the Sword of the Enemy, and the Sword of
God, an outward plague, &amp; a ſpiritual plague, theſe are worſe &amp; greater judgements.</p>
            <p>2. God hath worſe to inflict in another world, if you ſhould eſcape in this:
if a ſinner ſhould goe ſcot-free here, every day would aggravate his everlaſting
puniſhment. What will a ſinner be a gainer in the iſſue, when his main work in
ſinning and going on in ſin after deliverance, is but heaping up the meaſure of his
wrath, Rom. 2. 4. <hi>Thou treaſureſt up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the righteous Judgement of God,</hi> Hell puniſhment is greater then any that can
be inflicted in this world, Math. 13. 28. <hi>Fear him that can caſt Soul and body into
Hell,</hi> that is moſt to be feared as being the moſt terrible judgement; and there
are degrees of puniſhment in hell, there is a hell that is ſeven times hotter, they
that continue in ſin after judgement and mercy after deliverance, they will have
a greater degree of Torment, Heb. 10. 29. <hi>How much ſorer Judgement ſhall they be
counted worthy of,</hi> there are ſome are worthy of greater judgement then others
are, and God hath greater: there is the Heathens Hell, there is the hell of them
that live under the Goſpel, there is the hypocrites hell where the fire will be more
intenſe, there will be a thicker darkneſs; more exquiſite Torment, that God will
inflict upon one, then upon another, that is the firſt thing, that there are worſe
judgements may befall you, worſe in this world, and in that that is to come.</p>
            <p>2. what is that continuance in ſin for which God will inflict worſe judgements, that
continuance in ſin after deliverance &amp; mercies? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. it is a continuance in a ſtate
of unregeneracy, a being without a ſaying cloſe with Chriſt, the end of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
and deliverances is to give ſpace for repentance, to give another time, to try
a ſinner whether he will uſe longer time better, in making proviſion for Eternity
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45082:18"/>
Rom. 2. 5. the riches of Gods goodneſs that leadeth to Repentance, 2 Pet. 3. 15.
the end of Gods long ſuffering is your Salvation, that is Gods end, his gracious
end, that that he doth approve, if that be not a ſinners end, and his work that he
may be ſaved, this is a continuance in ſin, that will bring greater judgements, Rev.
2. 22. I gave her ſpace to repent, and ſhe did not repent, therefore God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
he would throw her on a bed of ſickneſs. It may be many of you were afraid
when you were near to death, that that was your great fear of dying, was, of being
unprepared to dye: what Vows, and what promiſes were made then? if you
might have another day of grace, now God tryes you, if that be not ſo improved,
that that is given for your tryal, when it is improved contrary to Gods end, will
pull down worſer and greater judgements on a ſinner: this is that will leave you
without excuſe, when another judgement overtakes you, when God will ſay, he
will take your word no more, when he hath tryed you, and found you falſe to
your Promiſe of improving time better.</p>
            <p>2. Continuance in ſin, in thoſe particular evils, God hath been convincing you
of, as provocations to himſelf, ſome evil courſe and way of life, ſome particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
that God hath burthened Conſcience with in time of ſickneſs, or under the
word of God, ſins that you have Confeſt, that you have in ſome degree bewailed
before God, and promiſed amendment, the continuance in thoſe ſins is a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to greater judgements, as is ſaid of thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 21, 22. I have this day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, for any
thing for which you ſent me to enquire of God: they promiſed and made ſolemn
Vows, they would obey, yet did but diſſemble with God; now therefore know
certainly, that you ſhall dye by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence,
in the place whether you deſire to go: you will diſſemble with God, but God will
not be mocked, if you will not be as good as your promiſe, and your word to
God, God will certainly be as good as his Threatning to you, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44, 25, 26. when
Ieremiah had told them from the Lord, what was the ſin had provoked the Lord
againſt them, therefore if now they would carry it better, God would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on them, but they were reſolved on their way, and would have their luſts:
We will ſurely perform our Vows, we have vowed to pour out drink offerings to
the Queen of Heaven, therefore hear the word of the Lord, behold I have ſworn
by my great Name that my Name ſhall be no more named in the mouth of any
man of Iudah. So what ever is the ſin you have made ſolemn Vows to God in the
time of your diſtreſs againſt, if it have been your Sabbath breaking, contempt of
the Word and Ordinances of God, Covetouſneſs, pride, Senſuality, Contention,
if theſe be not reformed, if you will live in them ſtill, and have your own way,
what ever God ſaith to the contrary, this is to live in thoſe ſins that will pull
down greater judgements.</p>
            <p>3. That greater Judgements will befall ſuch, for God hath threatned it, <hi>Lev</hi>
26. 24, 28. If that doth not doe, ſaith God, I will puniſh you ſeven times more
for your abominations: when one is over, God tryes what that will doe, and if
that doe not doe, and God on trial ſees that you are never the better, then you
muſt expect ſeven times greater judgements. And we find that this hath been
the way of Gods proceeding, both with profane ſinners, and his profeſſing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he hath followed them with worſe judgements, when they have not
been amended with leſſer: ſo God did with Pharaoh, God hath variety of plagues,
when he delivered him from one, and yet he continued hardned againſt the

Lord, then he brought another and worſe plague, till he himſelf at laſt was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
and his people. So it was with a profeſſing people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78 throughout
that Pſalm: God delivered them many times, and they provoked him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
him ſo far, till he gave up his glory into the hand of the enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſin, therefore deſerveth greater puniſhment: for,</p>
               <p>1. It is a ſin againſt a great deal more mercy; there is Gods ſparing mercy,
and the riches of Gods goodneſs, as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Rom. 2. 4. Deſpiſeſt thou
the riches of his goodneſs?</hi> there is a great deal of riches of mercy in every mercy a
ſinner enjoyeth: when God hath a ſinner at ſuch an advantage to deſtroy him, it
is rich mercy now to ſpare him: the going on in ſin, is contempt caſt upon the
riches of Gods mercy, that which Juſtice will not bear, but is ſure to revenge.</p>
               <p>2. It is againſt more light, after more of the knowledge of their Maſters will,
now <hi>he that knows his Maſters will and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi>
Luke 12. 47.</p>
               <p>3. They are ſins againſt vows and engagements to obedience, to ſin after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance:
the praying for deliverance layes the Sinner under a Vow of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and duty to God; beſides the voluntary vows that many have made in their
diſtreſs, unto God: now that is a great ſin, to ſin againſt our voluntary engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
we have made to God, when we have ſaid we will no more tranſgreſs: ſee
how God puts Jacob in mind of it, how angry God was with Jacob when he did
not perform his Vow, Gen. 35. 1. <hi>Goe to Bethel where thou vowedſt to ſerve the
Lord.</hi> The greateſt affliction that ever he had in his Family, was on the neglect
of his vow, that great miſcarriage of his daughter Dinah, and of his Sons, was a
puniſhment of the neglect of his vow. <hi>God doth not delight in fools,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 4.
that when they ſay they will take care of their duty, doe not perform it: when
they are raſh with their mouthes, it is a provocation to God to deſtroy the work
of his hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From the faithfulneſs of God: worſe things muſt needs befall ſuch,
becauſe he will as certainly perform what he hath threatned, as what he hath
promiſed. God will be as good as his word, and he hath threatned every Sinner
that continues in ſin after warning, after mercies, that greater judgements ſhall
befall them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. From the wiſdome of God, the manifeſtation of Gods wiſdome, a
great deal of Gods wiſdome will be manifeſted, as in variety and excellent ways
of delivering his People, ſo in ſpecial judgements on evil doers, 2 Pet. 3. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>God
knows how to deliver the godly, and to reſerve the wicked to the day of Judgement to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi>
It is a part of the wiſdome of God in governing the world, that he knows
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45082:19"/>
how to give out puniſhments to evill doers, that he knows how to reward all the
obedience of his Servants, though he ſeems to forget them for a time, and knows
how to puniſh Sinners, though he ſeems to wink at them for a time.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>I would only lay before you theſe two or three Conſiderations.</head>
               <p>1. Conſider that outward Providences are no argument of Gods love, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be afflictive or mercifull: meerly outward Providences are no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Gods ſpecial love, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 1. You cannot ſee love or hatred by any of theſe
things that are before you.</hi> You cannot ſay God hath more love to you, then he
hath to them he took away by the diſeaſe, becauſe he ſpared you; for theſe in
themſelves are but common mercies.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider that meerly when outward judgement ceaſeth, we cannot thence
conclude Gods anger ceaſeth, or is turned away: We cannot conclude by the
preſent removal of a judgement, that the anger of God is removed; for God may
remove it in anger. There are pardoning mercies, God may be ſaid to pardon,
when he doth only ſpare for a time. <hi>Pſal. 78. 36. So he forgave their iniquity:</hi> How
forgave? Not with a ſpecial ſaving pardoning mercy; for he puniſhed them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
yea unto deſtruction, many of them; but it was a preſent reprieve from
the judgement. God may be as angry with you ſtill as ever, though he hath remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the preſent Judgement: a ſparing mercy may be in wrath, in diſpleaſure to
the perſon that is ſpared; therefore you have no reaſon to be ſecure, nor to be
pleaſed with your preſent condition, while God may be angry with you, while
the anger of God is not appeaſed: you have no reaſon to cry peace to your ſelves
when God doth not ſpeak a word of peace.</p>
               <p>3. Conſider, that when men are delivered from affliction, and not ſaved from
their ſins, it is certain God is angry with them ſtill: when they are delivered
from an outward affliction, and ſin remains, that that is the cauſe and coar of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and evill be not removed, you may certainly conclude it is but a reſervation
to greater judgements. As it is an argument of their happy condition that
are in the very midſt of affliction, when they are taught of God in it, made
more holy, humble &amp; conformable to Gods will: ſo it is an argument of a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and a curſed eſtate, though you are out of affliction, if you have not been
taught of God: if you are out of affliction, but ſtill in ſin, it is a certain argument
of reſervation to greater puniſhment, that worſe things will befall you, unleſs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45082:20"/>
timely Repentance prevent it. There are theſe two ends why God doth puniſh
his people, and God will accompliſh his end in every puniſhment: there is his
work, and his whole work God will doe on mount Sion, Iſa. 10. 22. When God
hath done his whole work, then he burneth the rod, and not till then, it is but
laid by, and Gods intention to bring a greater. What is Gods whole work?
There is in every Judgement, a work of judgement, and a work of mercy; there
is a work of mercy God hath to all his elect and people, to reform and refine them
to purge away their ſin, to make them holy, and to make them better. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27 9.
That is the work to them that are the true children of Sion. But then God hath
a work of judgement, that is on thoſe he never intends ſaving mercy to: every
judgement is but the beginning of their miſery: God judgeth them in way of
ſatisfaction to Juſtice; there is but part of paiment in one judgement that is upon
them, and it is is to enſure them that the remainder is behind, that God will be
ſure to take the full paiment. If none of this work be done, if God hath not refined
his people, there is ſtill ſome work to be done; &amp; if there be thoſe that are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
never to be converted, greater and worſe judgements doe abide; none
ſuch, but ſhall have greater cauſe to curſe the day of their birth, then ever Iob or
Jeremiah, yea, to curſe the day of their preſervation: better you had died of
that ſickneſs, becauſe your judgement is but ſo much increaſed by your living.
Thoſe that ſhall live out their dayes without true repentance of their ſin, every
dayes mercy is but an aggravation of their condemnation. There are many
ſigns of Gods remaining diſpleaſure; methinks the clouds doe ſeem to return af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the rain, God doth not make it cleer day with us, nor cauſe the clouds to break
and ſcatter, but to gather again: There are many Signs, as God's taking away
thoſe that are the prime, and hopefull ones of the next generation, that is a ſad
ſign of worſe judgements. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 13. It was ſad to Jeroboams houſe, and ſo
to all Iſrael, the taking away Jeroboams Son, in whom ſome good thing toward
the Lord was found: it was a judgement to the whole houſe of Iſrael; he was
taken from the evill, and it was a ſign from the Lord of the evill he would bring
on them: ſo the taking away ſo many of Gods faithfull ones, eſpecially in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
place, in Magiſtracy and in Miniſtry, putting out ſo many lights in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks,
and that men, many of them, in their prime, in the flower of their
years, that were very likely to have lived many years, and done much ſervice to
God; that died not in a full old age, and full of days, but in their youth, and in the
flower of their dayes: and, which is a great deal worſe, and makes it look the
ſadder, that there are not any doe riſe, and fill their places: that it is ſo hard a
thing to ſee, and rationally to think, that there are men to fill up the rooms of
thoſe God hath taken from us: When ſtars doe ſet, and there are no others
that riſe, it is a ſign of a very dark uight: when men that ſtood in the gap are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, and none to put in their room, they are ſad ſigns that God hath a
mind to take away the hedge, unleſs ſpeedy repentance and reformation prevent
this ruine. Yet this is the ſaddeſt ſign of all, that theſe things doe befal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

People: had there been broken hearts under a breach, that might have made ſome
amends, and have been a means to prevail with God to pour out his Spirit: but
to be an unhumbled, unreformed people under ſuch diſpenſations of God, this is
one of the ſaddeſt ſigns. though I do verily believe, and have many Arguments to
ſway my thoughts concerning it, that God will not throw up the work he hath
done in New-England, will not utterly root up the plant he hath planted, and that
the Judgement God hath taken out of the hand of an Enemy, he may not eaſily
put it into the hand of another, but that he will take it himſelf, and deal with his
People by his own hand: but yet believe it, if God love you, if you are ſuch that
God hath ſpecial favour for, then God will not ſpoyle you, and if God will not
ſpoyle you then he will not ſpare his Rod, and you may be ſure, if one will not do
another ſhall. The godly &amp; holy ſhall be refined, if one Furnace will not do
it, another ſhall. Thoſe that are Elect, however they are like wild Aſſes Colts,
God will have his Month to find you, God hath other Thorns to ſet in the way of
your lovers, if you will be like Manaſſeh, that muſt be taken in the buſhes, God
will have his time to do it, when you ſhall humble your ſelves and your Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the God of your Fathers; them that God hath deſigned for Converſion, they
ſhall be converted, what every way God hath to do it, it ſeems to be a terrible way?
but if there be ſome God hath no ſuch ſpecial love for, let me tell you, God will
not ſpare you to ſpoyle his end, God is about reforming work, not only his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but things among his people, God is about to have other manner of Churches,
and other manner of Spirits, his People ſhall be refined, but they ſhall be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
it will be a terrible day of the Lord; but ſhall be as refiners fire, and will
purifie the gold, but the droſs ſhall be conſumed in the fire.</p>
               <p>And therefore let me leave this ſolemn advice with you, nay, it is not mine but
Chriſts, and that the Lord himſelf gives you; that you bewail your former, and
take heed of future ſinning, Eccl. 12. 1, 2. <hi>Remember your Creator in the dayes of your
Youth,</hi> the Clouds may not return after the Rain. It is ſpoken to thoſe that are
not only in the beginning of their time, but in their proſperous time. If you ſo
do, you will not only prevent future judgements, but be in the way to better mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,
as well as continue thoſe you have; I may ſay to you from the Lord, you
have ſeen the worſt dayes, the bitterneſs of death is over, the beſt are behind;
and your preſent preſervation is a pledge of your future Salvation, <hi>Pſal, 94. 12.
