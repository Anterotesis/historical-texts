         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Well fodder'd in the Stalls, thy tender Sheep.</l>
               <l>Then spread with Straw, the bedding of thy fold;</l>

               <l>That free from Gouts thou may'st preserve thy Care:</l>
               <l>And clear from Scabs, produc'd by freezing Air.</l>
               <l>Next let thy Goats officiously be nurst;</l>
               <l>And led to living Streams; to quench their thirst.</l>
               <l>Feed 'em with Winter-brouze, and for their lare</l>

Tis true, the Fleece, when drunk with <hi>Tyrian</hi> Juice,</l>

               <l>Attended with their Family they come</l>
               <l>At Night unask'd, and mindful of their home;</l>

               <l>For their own ills, can fit Provision find.</l>
               <l>Then minister the browze, with bounteous hand;</l>
               <l>And open let thy Stacks all Winter stand.</l>

               <l>Then, at the last, produce in open Air</l>
               <l>Both Flocks; and send 'em to their Summer fare.</l>

               <l>But when the day's fourth hour has drawn the Dews,</l>

               <l>In Summer's heat, some bending Valley find,</l>
               <l>Clos'd from the Sun, but open to the Wind:</l>
               <l>Or seek some ancient Oak, whose Arms extend</l>

While Springs are broken, while the <hi>Southern</hi> Air</l>

               <l>He lives on standing Lakes, and trembling Bogs,</l>

               <l>And the chapt Earth is furrow'd o're with chinks;</l>

               <l>A scabby Tetter on their pelts will stick,</l>
               <l>When the raw Rain, has pierc'd 'em to the quick:</l>

               <l>When their defenseless Limbs, the Brambles tear;</l>
               <l>Short of their Wool, and naked from the Sheer.</l>

Good Shepherds after sheering, drench their Sheep,</l>

               <l>They noint their naked Limbs, with mother'd Oyl;</l>
               <l>Or from the founts, where living Sulphurs boyl,</l>
               <l>They mix a Med'cine to foment their Limbs;</l>
               <l>With Scum, that on the molten Silver swims.</l>

               <l>The secret Vice is fed, and gathers ground.</l>

               <l>Deep in their Bones, when Feavers fix their seat,</l>

               <l>The ready Cure to cool the raging pain,</l>

Revenge the Crime; and take the Traytor's head,</l>
               <l>E're in the faultless Flock the dire Contagion spread.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>A Dire Example of this Truth appears;</l>
               <l>When, after such a Length of rowling Years,</l>

               <l>Here from the vicious Air, and sickly Skies,</l>
               <l>A Plague did on the dumb Creation rise:</l>

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54593:29"/>
During th' Autumnal Heats, th' Infefection grew,</l>

               <l>Poys'ning the Standing Lakes; and Pools Impure;</l>
               <l>Nor was the foodful Grass in Fields secure.</l>
               <l>Strange Death! For when the thirsty Fire had drunk</l>
               <l>Their vital Blood, and the dry Nerves were shrunk;</l>
               <l>When the contracted Limbs were cramp'd, ev'n then</l>
               <l>A watrish Humour swell'd and ooz'd again:</l>

               <l>Ordain'd by Nature for a better use.</l>
               <l>The Victim Ox, that was for Altars prest,</l>
               <l>Trim'd with white Ribbons, and with Garlands drest,</l>
               <l>Sunk of himself, without the Gods Command:</l>
               <l>Preventing the slow Sacrificer's Hand.</l>
               <l>Or, by the holy Butcher, if he fell,</l>

Nor, laid on Altars, did pure Flames arise;</l>
               <l>But Clouds of smouldring Smoke, forbad the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</l>
               <l>Scarcely the Knife was redden'd with his Gore,</l>
               <l>Or the Black Poyson stain'd the sandy floor.</l>
               <l>The thriven Calves in Meads their Food forsake</l>

               <l>The fawning Dog runs mad; the wheasing Swine</l>
               <l>With Coughs is choak'd; and labours from the Chine:</l>
               <l>The Victor Horse, forgetful of his Food,</l>

               <l>He paws the Ground, and on his hanging ears</l>
               <l>A doubtful Sweat in clammy drops appears:</l>
               <l>Parch'd is his Hide, and rugged are his Hairs.</l>
               <l>Such are the Symptoms of the young Disease;</l>

He rouls his mournful Eyes, he deeply groans</l>
               <l>With patient sobbing, and with manly Moans.</l>
               <l>He heaves for Breath: which, from his Lungs supply'd,</l>
               <l>And fetch'd from far, distends his lab'ring side.</l>
               <l>To his rough Palat, his dry Tongue succeeds;</l>
               <l>And roapy Gore, he from his Nostrils bleeds.</l>
               <l>A Drench of Wine has with success been us'd;</l>
               <l>And through a Horn, the generous Juice infus'd:</l>
               <l>Which timely taken op'd his closing Jaws;</l>
               <l>But, if too late, the Patient's death did cause.</l>
               <l>For the too vig'rous Dose, too fiercely wrought;</l>
               <l>And added Fury to the Strength it brought.</l>
               <l>Recruited into Rage, he grinds his Teeth</l>
               <l>In his own Flesh, and feeds approaching Death.</l>
               <l>Ye Gods, to better Fate, good Men dispose;</l>

               <l>Of little Creatures wondrous Acts I treat,</l>

A trifling Theam provokes my Humble Lays,</l>
               <l>Trifling the Theam, not so the Poet's Praise:</l>
               <l>If Great <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the Tuneful Nine</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>First, for your Bees a proper Station find,</l>
               <l>That's fenc'd about, and shelter'd from the Wind;</l>
               <l>For Winds divert 'em in their Flight, and drive</l>
               <l>The Swarms, when loaden homeward, from their Hive.</l>
               <l>Nor Sheep, nor Goats, must pasture near their Stores,</l>
               <l>To trample under foot the springing Flowers;</l>
               <l>Nor frisking Heifers bound about the place,</l>
               <l>To spurn the Dew-drops off, and bruise the rising Grass:</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:54593:35"/>
These waste the Swarms, and as they flye along</l>

               <l>Or Palms shoot up, and shade the Streams below;</l>
               <l>That when the Youth, led by their Princes, shun</l>
               <l>The Crowded Hive, and sport it in the Sun,</l>
               <l>Refreshing Springs may tempt 'em from the Heat,</l>

               <l>And suck out clammy Dews from Herbs and Flow'rs,</l>

            </lg>

               <l>Nor Neighb'ring Caves return the dying sound,</l>

When th' under-World is seiz'd with Cold, and Night,</l>

               <l>Wut when on high, you see the Bees repair,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If e're two Rival Kings their Right debate,</l>

At last, when all the Heav'ns are warm and fair,</l>

               <l>As thick as Hail-stones from the Floor rebound,</l>

               <l>No sence of Danger can their Kings Controul,</l>
               <l>Their little Bodies lodge a mighty Soul:</l>

               <l>This hot Dispute, and all this mighty Fray,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when both Kings are settl'd in their Hive,</l>

So let the Royal Insect rule alone,</l>

               <l>The Kings are different; one of better Note</l>

               <l>ONce I beheld the fairest of her Kind;</l>
               <l>(And still the sweet Idea charms my Mind:)</l>
               <l>True she was dumb; for Nature gaz'd so long,</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with her work, that she forgot her Tongue:</l>
               <l>But, smiling, said, She still shall gain the Prize;</l>

               <l>Such are thy Pictures, <hi>Kneller.</hi> Such thy Skill,</l>
               <l>That Nature seems obedient to thy Will:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:54593:49"/>
Comes out, and meets thy Pencil in the draught;</l>
               <l>Lives there, and wants but words to speak he thought.</l>
               <l>At least thy Pictures look a Voice; and we</l>
               <l>Imagine sounds, deceiv'd to that degree,</l>
               <l>We think 'tis somewhat more than just to see.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Shadows are but privations of the Light,</l>
               <l>Yet when we walk, they shoot before the Sight;</l>
               <l>With us approach, retire, arise and fall;</l>
               <l>Nothing themselves, and yet expressing all.</l>
               <l>Such are thy Pieces; imitating Life</l>
               <l>So near, they almost conquer'd in the strife;</l>
               <l>And from their animated Canvass came,</l>
               <l>Demanding Souls; and loosen'd from the Frame.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Prometheus,</hi> were he here, wou'd cast away</l>
               <l>His <hi>Adam,</hi> and refuse a Soul to Clay:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:54593:49"/>
And either wou'd thy Noble Work Inspire;</l>
               <l>Or think it warm enough, without his Fire.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But vulgar Hands, may vulgar Likeness raise,</l>
               <l>This is the least Attendant on thy Praise:</l>
               <l>From hence the Rudiments of Art began;</l>
               <l>A Coal, or Chalk, first imitated Man:</l>
               <l>Perhaps, the Shadow taken on a Wall,</l>
               <l>Gave out-lines to the rude Original:</l>
               <l>E're Canvass yet was strain'd: before the Grace</l>
               <l>Of blended Colours found their use and place:</l>
               <l>Or Cypress Tablets, first receiv'd a Face.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>By slow degrees, the Godlike Art advanc'd;</l>
               <l>As Man grew polish'd, Picture was inhanc'd;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Greece</hi> added posture, shade, and perspective;</l>
               <l>And then the Mimick Piece began to Live.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:54593:50"/>
Yet perspective was lame; no distance true;</l>
               <l>But all came forward in one common view:</l>
               <l>No point of Light was known, no bounds of Art;</l>
               <l>When Light was there, it knew not to depart:</l>
               <l>But glaring on remoter Objects play'd;</l>
               <l>Not langush'd, and insensibly decay'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> rais'd not Art, but barely kept alive;</l>
               <l>And with Old <hi>Greece,</hi> unequally did strive:</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> a rude <hi>Northern</hi> Race,</l>
               <l>Did all the matchless Monuments deface.</l>
               <l>Then all the Muses in one ruine lye;</l>
               <l>And Rhyme began t' enervate Poetry.</l>
               <l>Thus in a stupid Military State,</l>
               <l>The Pen and Pencil find an equal Fate.</l>
               <l>Flat Faces, such as wou'd disgrace a Skreen,</l>
               <l>Such as in <hi>Bantam</hi>'s Embassy were seen,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:54593:50"/>
Unrais'd, unrounded, were the rude delight</l>
               <l>Of Brutal Nations, only born to Fight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Long time the Sister Arts, in Iron sleep,</l>
               <l>A heavy Sabbath did supinely keep;</l>
               <l>At length, in <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Age, at once they rise;</l>
               <l>Stretch all their Limbs, and open all their Eyes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thence rose the <hi>Roman,</hi> and the <hi>Lombard</hi> Line:</l>
               <l>One colour'd best, and one did best design.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Raphael</hi>'s like <hi>Homer</hi>'s, was the Nobler part;</l>
               <l>But <hi>Titian</hi>'s Painting, look'd like <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Art.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thy Genius gives thee both; where true design,</l>
               <l>Postures unforc'd, and lively Colours joyn.</l>
               <l>Likeness is ever there; but still the best,</l>
               <l>Like proper Thoughts in lofty Language drest.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:54593:51"/>
Where Light to Shades descending, plays, not strives;</l>
               <l>Dyes by degrees, and by degrees revives.</l>
               <l>Of various parts a perfect whole is wrought:</l>
               <l>Thy Pictures think, and we Divine their Thought.</l>

               <l>Proud to be less; but of his Godlike Race.</l>
               <l>His Soul Inspires me, while thy Praise I write,</l>

               <l>When most they rail, know then, they envy most.</l>
               <l>In vain they snarl a-loof; a noisy Crow'd,</l>
               <l>Like Womens Anger, impotent and loud.</l>
               <l>

While they their barren Industry deplore,</l>
               <l>Pass on secure; and mind the Goal before:</l>
               <l>Old as she is, my Muse shall march behind;</l>
               <l>Bear off the blast, and intercept the wind.</l>
               <l>Our Arts are Sisters; though not Twins in Birth:</l>
               <l>For Hymns were sung in <hi>Edens</hi> happy Earth,</l>
               <l>By the first Pair; while <hi>Eve</hi> was yet a Saint;</l>
               <l>Before she fell with Pride, and learn'd to paint.</l>
               <l>Forgive th' allusion; 'twas not meant to bite;</l>
               <l>But Satire will have room, where e're I write.</l>
               <l>For oh, the Painter Muse; though last in place,</l>
               <l>Has seiz'd the Blessing first, like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Race.</l>

               <l>Thou hadst thy <hi>Charles</hi> a while, and so had I;</l>
               <l>But pass we that unpleasing Image by.</l>

               <l>Likeness appears in every Lineament;</l>
               <l>But Likeness in thy Work is Eloquent:</l>
               <l>Though Nature, there, her true resemblance bears,</l>
               <l>A nobler Beauty in thy Piece appears.</l>
               <l>So warm thy Work, so glows the gen'rous frame,</l>

               <l>But not creating Beauties at our Will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some other Hand perhaps may reach a Face;</l>
               <l>But none like thee, a finish'd Figure place:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:54593:52"/>
None of this Age; for that's enough for thee,</l>
               <l>The first of these Inferiour Times to be:</l>

               <l>BY this repeated act of Grace, we see</l>
               <l>Wit is again the Care of Majesty;</l>
               <l>And while thus honour'd our proud Stage appears,</l>
               <l>We seem to rival Ancient Theatres.</l>
               <l>Thus flourish'd Wit in our Forefathers Age,</l>
               <l>And thus the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Athenian</hi> Stage.</l>

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:54593:55"/>
               <l>Whose Wit is best, we'll, not presume to tell;</l>
               <l>But this we know, our Audience will excell:</l>
               <l>For never was in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Athens,</hi> seen</l>
               <l>So Fair a Circle, and so bright a Queen.</l>

               <l>Long has the Muses Land been over-cast,</l>
               <l>And many Rough and Stormy Winters past;</l>
               <l>Hid from the World, and thrown in Shades of Night,</l>
               <l>Of Heat depriv'd, and almost void of Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>While Wit, a hardy Plant, of Nature bold,</l>
               <l>Has strugled strongly with the killing Cold:</l>
               <l>So does it still through Opposition grow,</l>
               <l>As if its Root was warmer kept by Snow:</l>
               <l>But when shot forth, then draws the <hi>Danger</hi> near,</l>
               <l>On ev'ry side the gath'ring Winds appear,</l>
               <l>And Blasts destroy that Fruit, which Frosts wou'd spare.</l>

            <lg>

               <l>How Gay wou'd then, this drooping Land appear!</l>
               <l>Then, like the Sun, with Pleasure might she view</l>
               <l>The smiling Earth, cloath'd by her Beams anew.</l>
               <l>O're all the <hi>Meads,</hi> shou'd various Flow'rs be seen,</l>
               <l>Mix'd with the Lawrel's never-fading Green,</l>

            <l>WHY are these Hours, which Heav'n in pity lent</l>
            <l>To longing Love, in fruitless Sorrow spent?</l>
            <l>Why sighs my Fair? why does that Bosom move</l>
            <l>With any Passion stirr'd, but rising Love?</l>
            <l>Can Discontent find place within that Breast,</l>
            <l>On whose soft Pillows ev'n Despair might rest?</l>
            <l>Divide thy Woes, and give me my sad part,</l>
            <l>I am no stranger to an aking Heart;</l>
            <l>Too well I know the force of inward Grief,</l>
            <l>And well can bear it, to give you relief:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:54593:57"/>
All Love's severest Pangs, I can endure;</l>
            <l>I can bear Pain, tho' hopeless of a Cure.</l>
            <l>I know what 'tis to Weep, and Sigh, and Pray,</l>
            <l>To wake all Night, yet dread the breaking Day;</l>
            <l>I know what 'tis to Wish, and Hope, and all in vain,</l>
            <l>And meet, for Humble Love, Unkind Disdain;</l>
            <l>Anger, and Hate, I have been forc'd to bear,</l>
            <l>Nay Jealousy—and I have felt Despair.</l>
            <l>These Pains, for you I have been forc'd to prove,</l>
            <l>For Cruel you, when I began to Love.</l>
            <l>Till warm Compassion took at length my part,</l>
            <l>And melted to my Wish your yielding Heart.</l>
            <l>O the dear Hour, in which you did resign!</l>
            <l>When round my Neck your willing Arms did twine,</l>
            <l>And, in a Kiss, you said your Heart was mine.</l>
            <l>Thro' each returning Year, may that Hour be</l>
            <l>Distinguish'd in the Rounds of all Eternity;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:54593:57"/>
Gay be the Sun, that Hour, in all his Light,</l>
            <l>Let him collect the Day, to be more bright,</l>
            <l>Shine all, that Hour, and all the rest be Night.</l>
            <l>And shall I all this Heav'n of Bliss receive</l>
            <l>From you, yet not Lament to see you grieve!</l>
            <l>Shall I, who nourish'd in my Breast desire,</l>
            <l>When your cold Scorn, and Frowns forbid the Fire;</l>
            <l>Now, when a mutual Flame you have reveal'd,</l>
            <l>And the dear Union of our Souls are seal'd,</l>
            <l>When all my Joys Compleat in you I find,</l>
            <l>Shall I not share the Sorrows of your Mind?</l>
            <l>O tell me, tell me All—Whence does arise</l>
            <l>This floud of Tears? whence are these frequent Sighs?</l>
            <l>Why does that lovely Head, like a fair Flow'r</l>
            <l>Oppress'd with Drops of a hard-falling Show'r,</l>
            <l>Bend with its weight of Grief, and seem to grow</l>
            <l>Downward to Earth, and kiss the Root of Woe?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54593:58"/>
Lean on my Breast, and let me fold thee fast,</l>
            <l>Lock'd in these Arms think all thy Sorrows past;</l>
            <l>Or, what remain, think lighter made by me;</l>
            <l>So I shou'd think, were I so held by thee.</l>
            <l>Murmur thy Plaints, and gently wound my Ears,</l>
            <l>Sigh on my Lips, and let me drink thy Tears;</l>
            <l>Joyn to my Cheek, thy Cold and Dewy Face,</l>
            <l>And let pale Grief to glowing Love give place.</l>
            <l>O speak—for Woe in Silence most appears;</l>
            <l>Speak, e're my Fancy magnifie my Fears.</l>
            <l>Is there a Cause, which Words cannot express!</l>
            <l>Can I not bear a part, nor make it less?</l>
            <l>I know not what to think—Am I in Fault?</l>
            <l>I have not, to my Knowledge, err'd in Thought,</l>
            <l>Nor wander'd from my Love, nor wou'd I be</l>
            <l>Lord of the World, to live depriv'd of thee.</l>
            <l>You weep a-fresh, and at that Word you start!</l>
            <l>Am I to be depriv'd then?—must we part!</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:54593:58"/>
Curse on that Word so ready to be spoke,</l>
            <l>For through my Lips, immeant by me, it broke.</l>
            <l>Oh no, we must not, will not, cannot part,</l>
            <l>And my Tongue talks unprompted by my Heart.</l>
            <l>Yet speak, for my Distraction grows apace,</l>
            <l>And racking Fears, and restless Doubts increase;</l>
            <l>And Fears and Doubts to <hi>Jealousie</hi> will turn,</l>
            <l>The Hottest Hell, in which a Heart can burn.</l>

SALMACIS:
From the Fourth Book of

               <l>Softens the Body, and unnerves the Limbs,</l>
               <l>And what the secret Cause, shall here be shown;</l>
               <l>The Cause is secret, but th' Effect is known.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The <hi>Naids</hi> nurst an Infant heretofore,</l>

               <l>From both th' Illustrious Authors of his Race</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:54593:75"/>
When fifteen years, in <hi>Ida</hi>'s cool Retreat,</l>
               <l>The Boy had told, he left his Native Seat,</l>
               <l>And sought fresh Fountains in a Foreign Soil:</l>
               <l>The Pleasure lessen'd the attending Toil.</l>
               <l>With eager steps the <hi>Lycian</hi> Fields he crost,</l>
               <l>And Fields that border on the <hi>Lycian</hi> Coast;</l>
               <l>A River here he view'd so lovely bright,</l>
               <l>It shew'd the Bottom in a fairer Light,</l>
               <l>Nor kept a Sand conceal'd from Human sight.</l>
               <l>The Stream produc't nor slimy Ooze, nor Weeds,</l>
               <l>Nor miry Rushes, nor the spiky Reeds;</l>
               <l>But dealt enriching Moisture all around,</l>
               <l>The <hi>fruitful Banks</hi> with <hi>chearful Verdure</hi> crown'd,</l>
               <l>And kept the Spring Eternal on the Ground.</l>
               <l>A Nymph presides, nor practis'd in the Chace,</l>
               <l>Nor skilful at the Bow, nor at the Race;</l>
               <l>Of all the Blue-ey'd Daughters of the Main,</l>
               <l>The only Stranger to <hi>Diana</hi>'s Train:</l>

                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:54593:75"/>
Her Sisters often, as 'tis said, wou'd cry</l>
               <l>"Fie <hi>Salmacis,</hi> what always Idle! fie,</l>
               <l>"Or take thy Quiver, or thy Arrows seize,</l>
               <l>"And mix the Toils of Hunting with thy Ease.</l>
               <l>Nor Quiver she nor Arrows e're wou'd seize,</l>
               <l>Nor mix the Toyls of Hunting with her Ease.</l>
               <l>But oft wou'd Bath her in the Chrystal Tide,</l>
               <l>Oft with a Comb her dewy Locks divide;</l>
               <l>Now in the Limpid Streams she views her Face,</l>
               <l>And drest her Image in the Floating Glass:</l>
               <l>On Beds of Leaves she now repos'd her Limbs,</l>
               <l>Now gather'd Flowr's that grew about her Streams,</l>
               <l>And then by chance was gathering, as she stood</l>
               <l>To view the Boy, and Long'd for what she view'd.</l>

               <l>Fain wou'd she meet the Youth with hasty Feet,</l>
               <l>She fain wou'd meet him but refus'd to meet</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:54593:76"/>
Before her looks were set with nicest Care,</l>
               <l>And well deserv'd to be reputed Fair.</l>
               <l>"Bright Youth, she crys, whom all thy Features prove</l>
               <l>"A God, and, if a God, the God of Love;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Boy knew nought of Love, and touche with Shame,</l>
               <l>He strove, and Blusht, but still the Blush became:</l>
               <l>In rising Blushes still fresh Beautys rose;</l>
               <l>The Sunny Side of Fruit such Blushes shows,</l>
               <l>And such the Moon, when all her Silver White</l>
               <l>Turns in Eclipses to a Ruddy Light.</l>

                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:54593:76"/>
The Nymph still begs, if not a nobler Bliss,</l>
               <l>A cold Salute at least, a Sister's Kiss:</l>
               <l>And now prepares to take the lovely Boy</l>
               <l>Between her Arms. He, Innocently Coy,</l>
               <l>Replys, "Or leave me to my self alone,</l>

               <l>"Fair Stranger then, says she, it shall be so;</l>
               <l>And, for she fear'd his Threats, she feign'd to go:</l>
               <l>But hid within a Coverts Neighbouring Green,</l>
               <l>She kept him him still in sight, her self unseen.</l>

               <l>In middle Air with varied Numbers Sings;</l>

But first takes time with Majesty to rise,</l>

               <l>Thus <hi>Mercury</hi> from Heav'n descends,</l>

               <l>Blest with the unknown Beauties of the Fair,</l>

            <head>APOLLO's Grief,
For having Kill'd HYACINTH by Accident.
In Imitation of OVID.</head>
            <byline>By my Ld. R.</byline>
            <l>SWeet <hi>Hyacinth,</hi> my Life! my Joy!</l>
            <l>What have I done! my lovely Boy!</l>
            <l>With Kisses I wou'd stop thy Soul;</l>
            <l>But Oh! the Fates my Bliss controul.</l>
            <l>For thee I Languish, wish to Dye,</l>
            <l>And weary grow of Immortality.</l>
            <l>Yet with my Harp I'll sound thy Praise,</l>
            <l>And to the Stars thy Beauties raise.</l>
            <l>Straight thou shalt rise with Purple Grace,</l>
            <l>And with the same Inviting Face:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:54593:102"/>
Thy Blood shall turn the Lilly Red;</l>
            <l>(Mourning) I'll wear it on my Head.</l>
            <l>The World shall Celebrate thy Fame,</l>
            <l>And Feasts be call'd by thy dear Name;</l>
            <l>With <hi>Hyacinth</hi> Heav'n shall resound,</l>
            <l>While Ecchoes catch the Charming Sound.</l>
            <l>The fatal Loss, thus sad <hi>Apollo</hi> mourn'd,</l>
            <l>Of the fair Boy, for whom so much he burn'd.</l>

            <head>ON THE
Happyness of a Retir'd Life.</head>
            <byline>By Mr. CHARLES DRYDEN. Sent to
his Father from <hi>ITALY.</hi>
            </byline>
            <lg>
               <l>AS in a Shipwrack some poor Sailer tost,</l>
               <l>By the rude Ocean, on a Foreign Coast;</l>
               <l>Vows to the Gods, he never more for Gain</l>
               <l>Will tempt the Danger of the Faithless Main:</l>
               <l>But hugs himself upon the friendly Shoar,</l>
               <l>And loves to hear the raging Billows Roar,</l>
               <l>That spend their Malice, and can hurt no more.</l>
               <l>Just so the Wretch, who can no longer stand</l>
               <l>The Shocks of Fortune, and is wreck'd at Land;</l>
               <l>Lays down the Burthen of his Cares, to find</l>
               <l>A Solitary Place, and Quiet Mind:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:54593:104"/>
Chusing Content with Poverty to meet,</l>
               <l>Before a Fortune, infamously great.</l>
               <l>Thus, in respect of Gold and Silver, Poor,</l>
               <l>But Rich in Soul, and Virtues better Store:</l>
               <l>He Digs in Nature's Mines, and from her Soil</l>
               <l>He Reaps the noble Harvest of his Toil;</l>
               <l>His Thoughts mount upward to their Mother Sky,</l>
               <l>And, purg'd from Dross, exert th' Etherial Energy;</l>
               <l>The dusky prospect of his Life grows Clear,</l>
               <l>And Golden Scenes of Happiness appear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then from the Summer of Philosophy,</l>
               <l>Secure himself, Mankind he may descry,</l>
               <l>Industrious in the search of their own Misery.</l>
               <l>Like moiling Ants, in various paths they run,</l>
               <l>And strive in vain the Rubs of Life of shun.</l>
               <l>To different Ends their Actions they Address,</l>
               <l>Which meet, and center in Unhappiness.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:54593:104"/>
One Toils, and Struggles, in pursuit of Fame,</l>
               <l>And grasps, with greediness, an empty Name:</l>
               <l>Wing'd with Ambition, others soar so high,</l>
               <l>They fall, and cannot bear so thin a Sky:</l>
               <l>This Wretch, like <hi>Croesus,</hi> in the midst of Store</l>
               <l>Sits sadly Pyning, and believes he's Poor.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Wise Man Laughs at all their Pains, secure</l>
               <l>From Lording Passions, which those Fools endure.</l>
               <l>Despair and Hope are banish'd from his Breast;</l>
               <l>Agues, and Feavers that allow no Rest:</l>
               <l>And Lust, and Pride, the Mother of Disdain,</l>
               <l>And Thirst of Honour, with her anxious Train,</l>
               <l>No longer Warring, Peace of Soul deny,</l>
               <l>But Exiles of the Mind their once lov'd Mansions fly.</l>
               <l>Nor Love misplac'd, nor Malice now controul,</l>
               <l>Right Reason's use, the Guardian of the Soul.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:54593:105"/>
His Thoughts unbiass'd, and no longer tost,</l>
               <l>Of Solid Judgment now securely Boast.</l>
               <l>The fierce, unruly Race of Passions dye,</l>
               <l>And the free'd Soul asserts her Liberty.</l>
               <l>Instead of inward War, Sweet Peace of Mind,</l>
               <l>And silent ease, with all their quiet Kind,</l>
               <l>The noble Regions of his Heart regain;</l>
               <l>And with a Calm, and gentle Empire Reign.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Silence</hi> becomes an Amicable Guest,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Peace,</hi> with downy Wings, sits brooding on his Breast:</l>
               <l>Soft Hours pass over, void of Noise, and Strife,</l>
               <l>And gently Waft him to the Verge of Life:</l>
               <l>While in a slow, and regular Decay,</l>
               <l>Death steals, unfelt, upon his setting Day:</l>
               <l>As Mellow Fruits, ungather'd, drop away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Blest Solitude! O harmless, easie State!</l>
               <l>Entrencht in Wisdom, from the Storms of Fate.</l>

Thus on a Bleaky Cliff, the Regal Tree,</l>
               <l>Assail'd by Winds, and Heav'ns Inclemency,</l>

            <head>The Passion
Of BYBLIS.
From the ninth Book of

            <lg>
               <l>LET the sad Fate of wretched <hi>Byblis</hi> prove</l>
               <l>A dismal Warning to Unlawful Love;</l>
               <l>One Birth gave being to the hapless Pair,</l>
               <l>But more was <hi>Caunus</hi> than a Sister's Care;</l>
               <l>Unknown she Lov'd, for yet the gentle Fire</l>
               <l>Rose not in Flames, nor kindled to desire;</l>
               <l>'Twas thought no Sin to wonder at his Charms,</l>
               <l>Hang on his Neck, and Languish in his Arms;</l>
               <l>Thus wing'd with Joy, fled the soft Hours away,</l>
               <l>And all the fatal Guilt on harmless Nature lay.</l>

But Love (too soon from Piety declin'd)</l>
               <l>Insensibly deprav'd her yielding Mind.</l>
               <l>Dress'd she appears, with nicest Art adorn'd,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry Youth, but her lov'd Brother, scorn'd;</l>
               <l>For him alone she labour'd to be Fair,</l>
               <l>And curst all Charms that might with hers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare.</l>
               <l>'Twas she, and only she, must <hi>Caunus</hi> please,</l>
               <l>Sick at her Heart, yet knew not her Disease:</l>
               <l>She call'd him Lord, For Brother was a Name</l>
               <l>Too cold and dull for her aspiring Flame;</l>
               <l>And when he spoke, if Sister, he reply'd,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Byblis</hi> change that frozen Word, she cry'd;</l>
               <l>Yet waking still she watch'd her strugling Breast,</l>
               <l>And Love's Approaches were in vain address'd,</l>
               <l>Till gentle Sleep an easy Conques made,</l>
               <l>And in her Soft embrace the Conquerour was laid;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:54593:108"/>
But oh too soon the pleasing Vision fled,</l>
               <l>And left her Blushing on the conscious Bed,</l>
               <l>Ah me! (she cry'd) how monstrous do I seem?</l>
               <l>Why these wild Thoughts? and this incestuous Dream?</l>
               <l>Envy her self ('tis true) must own his Charms,</l>
               <l>But what is Beauty in a Sister's Arms?</l>
               <l>Oh were I not that despicable she!</l>
               <l>How Blest, how Pleas'd, how Happy shou'd I be!</l>
               <l>But unregarded now must bear my Pain,</l>
               <l>And, but in Dreams, my wishes can obtain:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O Sea-Born Goddess! with thy wanton Boy!</l>

            <lg>
               <l>If the bare Fancy so affects my Mind,</l>

               <l>They draw down Gods from their neglected Heav'n;</l>
               <l>Even <hi>Jove</hi> himself, the Soveraign of the Skies,</l>
               <l>Saw brighter Glories in <hi>Europa</hi>'s Eyes;</l>
               <l>He saw, he lov'd, and look'd with wonder down,</l>
               <l>On Darts of Lightning, keener than his own;</l>

With all his Clouds he could not quench the Fire,</l>
               <l>And thus injoyn'd the God of his desire.</l>

               <l>Already the wing'd Messenger was there,</l>
               <l>And faithfully had laid the fatal Snare:</l>
               <l>That Shoar it was, where oft this Royal Maid</l>
               <l>With <hi>Tyrian</hi> Virgins, her Companions, play'd;</l>
               <l>Secure she play'd, and safe from human Spies,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Jove</hi> watch'd the time, and Love had form'd a Thought</l>

A Bribe she proffer'd of the choicest Flowers,</l>

               <l>Nimbly he frisks and dances in her sight;</l>
               <l>Then gently rowl'd on the soft Golden Sand,</l>
               <l>Yielding his Breast to her officious Hand:</l>
               <l>Fonder she grows, blind to her ruin led,</l>
               <l>And Weaves fresh Garlands to adorn his Head;</l>
               <l>Kneeling he took these Favours from the Fair</l>
               <l>(So humble and so meek expecting Lovers are.)</l>
               <l>Now on his back her busie Hand she laid,</l>

With his Rich burthen, the impatient God</l>

Epistle to Mr. B—</head>
            <byline>By Mr. Fr. Knapp, of Magdalen Colledge in
Oxford.</byline>

               <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <lg>
               <l>I Hear that you, of late, are grown</l>
               <l>One of those squeamish Criticks of the Town,</l>
               <l>That think they have a License to abuse</l>
               <l>Each honest Author, that pretends to Muse.</l>
               <l>But be advis'd; why should you spend your time</l>
               <l>In Heath'nish Satyr, 'cause a Fool will Rhime?</l>
               <l>Poor harmless <hi>W—ly!</hi> let him write again,</l>
               <l>Be pitied in his old Heroic Strain;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:54593:140"/>
Let him in Reams proclaim himself a Dunce,</l>
               <l>And break a dozen Stationers at once.</l>
               <l>What is't to you? Why shou'd you take't amiss</l>
               <l>If <hi>Grubstreet</hi>'s stock'd with Tenants, if the Press</l>
               <l>Is hugely ply'd, and labours to produce</l>
               <l>Some mighty Folio, for the Chandler's use?</l>
               <l>Let <hi>Grubstreet</hi> scribble on, nor need you care</l>
               <l>Tho' ev'ry Garret held a Poet there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You know, that are acquainted with the Town,</l>
               <l>How the poor Tribe are worry'd up and down:</l>
               <l>How pensively the hungry Authors sit,</l>
               <l>And, in their upper Regions, strain for Wit.</l>
               <l>Such a poor tatter'd Small-Beer Herd they're grown,</l>
               <l>That scarce an Author from his Hawker's known:</l>
               <l>No jolly Carbuncle thro' all the Race</l>
               <l>Appears, to justifie a Poet's Face.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:54593:141"/>
This a sufficient Pennance seems to me</l>
               <l>For <hi>H—den</hi>'s Droll, or <hi>S—tle</hi>'s Tragedy.</l>
               <l>Is't not enough to starve for Writing ill,</l>
               <l>That they ne're Dine, but when they Smoak a Meal;</l>
               <l>That their Works only serve to wipe, or twine</l>
               <l>A Candle, or some feeble Bandbox line?</l>
               <l>Consider, and let Charity prevail,</l>
               <l>What Christian Critick can have heart to Rail</l>
               <l>At such poor Rogues as these? Besides you know</l>
               <l>A true stanch Poet can't Reform, what tho'</l>
               <l>His Works have furnish'd a Lampoon or two?</l>
               <l>They that have once in Print proclaim'd their Name,</l>
               <l>Are senseless all of Justice, as of Shame,</l>
               <l>And none but Stationers shou'd Rail at Them.</l>
               <l>Had e're the Lewdest of 'em all the Grace</l>
               <l>Or Conscience, to Repent of making Verse?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:54593:141"/>
For other Sins they feel Remorse sometimes,</l>
               <l>But sure no Poet e're had Qualms for Rhimes;</l>
               <l>Alas! no wholesom Counsel can be us'd</l>
               <l>By a poor harden'd Wretch, when once <hi>Bemus'd:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then don't inhumanly your Pains mis-spend</l>
               <l>On Reprobates, that you can never mend.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Had we a Parliament dispos'd to lay</l>
               <l>A Tax on Metre, or invent some way,</l>
               <l>In Grand Committee call'd, to regulate</l>
               <l>This among other Grievances of State;</l>
               <l>Then you might hope to hear an Act would pass</l>
               <l>To limit all this Hackney jingling Race,</l>
               <l>And order some Commissioners to find</l>
               <l>Which way their Genius chiefly is inclin'd,</l>
               <l>See how it stands affected to a Muse,</l>

               <l>Her bended Bow in haste she takes,</l>

               <l>The more his Wounds, the more his might,</l>

            <byline>By Henry Savil, Esquire. Written soon after the
Duel of the Staggs.</byline>
            <l>IN <hi>Milford-Lane,</hi> near to St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s Steeple,</l>
            <l>There liv'd a Nymph, kind to all Christian People.</l>
            <l>A Nymph she was, whose comely Mean and Feature</l>
            <l>Did Wound the Heart of every Man-like Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</l>
            <l>Under her Beauteous Bosom there did lye</l>
            <l>A Belly smooth as any Ivory.</l>
            <l>Yet Nature, to declare her various Art,</l>
            <l>Had plac'd a Tuft in one convenient part.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:54593:154"/>
No Park, with smoothest <hi>Lawn,</hi> and highest <hi>Wood,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Could e're compare with this admir'd aboad;</l>
            <l>Here all the Youth of <hi>England</hi> did repair,</l>
            <l>To take their Pleasure, and to ease their Care.</l>
            <l>Here the Distressed Lover, that had born</l>
            <l>His haughty Mistress Anger, or her Scorn,</l>
            <l>Came for Relief, and, on this pleasant Shade,</l>
            <l>Forgot the former, and this Lass obey'd.</l>
            <l>But yet what corner of the World is found,</l>
            <l>Where Pain our Pleasure doth not still surround?</l>
            <l>One would have thought that in this shady <hi>Grove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Nought could have dwelt but quiet Peace, and Love;</l>
            <l>But Heaven directed otherwise, for here</l>
            <l>In mid'st of plenty Bloody Wars appear.</l>
            <l>The Gods will frown where-ever they do smile;</l>
            <l>The Crocodile infests the fertile <hi>Nile:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:54593:154"/>
Lyons, and Tygers, in the <hi>Lesbian</hi> Plains,</l>
            <l>Forbid all Pleasures to the fearful Swains.</l>
            <l>Wild Beasts in Forests do the Hunters fright,</l>
            <l>They fear their ruin, mid'st of their delight.</l>
            <l>Thus, in the Shade of this dark silent Bower,</l>
            <l>Strength strives with Strength, and Pow'r does vie with Power.</l>
            <l>Two mighty Monsters did the Wood infest,</l>
            <l>And struck such awe and terrour in the rest;</l>
            <l>That no <hi>Sicilian Tyrant</hi> e're could boast</l>
            <l>He e're with greater vigour rul'd the roast.</l>
            <l>Each had his Empire which he kept in awe,</l>
            <l>Was by his Will obey'd; allow'd no Law.</l>
            <l>Nature so well divided had their States,</l>
            <l>Nought but Ambition could have claim'd their Seats.</l>
            <l>For 'twixt their Empires stood a Briny Lake,</l>
            <l>Deep as the Poet's do the Center make.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:54593:155"/>
But here Ambition will admit no Bounds,</l>
            <l>There are no Limits to aspiring Crowns.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Spanyard,</hi> by his <hi>Europe</hi> Conquests bold,</l>
            <l>Sails o're the Ocean for the <hi>Indian</hi> Gold.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Carthaginian Hero</hi> did not stay</l>
            <l>Because he met vast Mountains in his way.</l>
            <l>He past the <hi>Alps,</hi> like Mole-Hills, such a mind</l>
            <l>As thinks on Conquests will be unconfin'd.</l>
            <l>Both with these haughty Thoughts one course do bend,</l>
            <l>To try if this vast Lake had any end;</l>
            <l>Where finding Countreys yet without a Name,</l>
            <l>They might by Conquest get eternal Fame:</l>
            <l>After long Marches, both their Armies tir'd,</l>
            <l>At length they find the place so much admir'd.</l>
            <l>When, in a little time, each doth descry</l>
            <l>The glimps of an approaching Enemy:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:54593:155"/>
Each at the sight with equal Pleasure move,</l>
            <l>As we should do in well rewarded Love.</l>
            <l>Blood-thirsty Souls, whose only perfect joy</l>
            <l>Consists in what their Fury can destroy.</l>
            <l>And now both Armies do prepare to fight,</l>
            <l>And each the other unto War incite.</l>
            <l>In vain, alas! for all their force and strength</l>
            <l>Was now consumed by their Marches length;</l>
            <l>But the great Chiefs, impatient of delay,</l>
            <l>Resolve by single fight to try the Day.</l>

               <l>IS't True that Souls their Bodies do survive?</l>
               <l>Or does a Flam that timerous World deceive?</l>
               <l>When some dear <hi>Friend</hi> our dying <hi>Eyes</hi> has clos'd,</l>

               <l>Were it not wise the Soul too to Entomb!</l>

Or happier do we dye entire and whole,</l>
               <l>Leave no continuing Relict of a Soul?</l>
               <l>But when the vital Vapour of our Breath</l>
               <l>Gasp'd into Air, is lost in Clouds and Death,</l>
               <l>We're gon, and all that was of us before</l>
               <l>To any thing of Life is then no more?</l>
               <l>Yes, thus we Perish, and thus undergo</l>
               <l>Th' approaching Lot of all things here below.</l>
               <l>Time flies, and all the Sea or Sun goes round</l>
               <l>With sure and quick destruction shall confound.</l>
               <l>Swift as above the Stars, and Moon, and Sun,</l>
               <l>In hurrying Orbs their hasty Courses run;</l>
               <l>We Post to Fate, nor when we disappear</l>
               <l>Are we, or ever shall be, any where.</l>
               <l>As short-liv'd Smoak, ascending from the Flame,</l>
               <l>Hovers, dissolves, and ne're shall be again.</l>
               <l>As gather'd Clouds by scattering Blasts disjoyn'd,</l>

               <l>Let Slaves and Fools their Fears and Hopes give o're,</l>

               <l>A short Account of all the Muse possest;</l>
               <l>That, down <hi>from Chaucer</hi>'s days to <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Times,</l>
               <l>Have spent their Noble Rage in <hi>Brittish Rhimes;</hi>

I'll try to make they're sev'ral Beauties known,</l>
               <l>And show their Verses worth, tho' not my Own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Long had our dull Fore-Fathers slept Supine,</l>
               <l>Nor felt the Raptures of the Tuneful Nine;</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Chaucer</hi> first, a merry <hi>Bard,</hi> arose;</l>
               <l>And many a Story told in Rhime and Prose.</l>
               <l>But Age has Rusted what the <hi>Poet</hi> writ,</l>
               <l>Worn out his Language, and obscur'd his Wit:</l>
               <l>In vain he jests in his unpolish'd strain,</l>
               <l>And tries to make his Readers laugh in vain.</l>

               <l>In Antick Tales amus'd a Barb'rous Age;</l>

Through pathless Fields, and unfrequented Floods,</l>
               <l>To Dens of Dragons, and Enchanted Woods.</l>
               <l>But now the Mystick Tale, that pleas'd of Yore,</l>
               <l>Can Charm an understanding Age no more;</l>
               <l>The long-spun Allegories fulsom grow,</l>
               <l>While the dull Moral lies too plain below.</l>
               <l>We view well-pleas'd at distance all the sights</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Palfries,</hi> Cattel's, Fields and Fights,</l>
               <l>And Damsels in Distress, and Courteous Knights.</l>
               <l>But when we look too near, the Shades decay,</l>
               <l>And all the pleasing Lan-skip fades away.</l>

One glitt'ring Thought no sooner strikes our Eyes</l>
               <l>With silent wonder, but new wonders rise.</l>

               <l>O're-flows the Heav'ns, with one continu'd Light;</l>
