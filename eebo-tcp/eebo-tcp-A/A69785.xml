         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">The beſt Method, and ſpeediest way for Ordering of
Race-Horſes, to fit them for any Match in what
Eſtate ſoever they be.</head>
               <p>AT ſuch time as a Horſe is matched, (or deſigned to
be matched) for a Race, or Courſe, let him, to
whom the Horſe belongs, or whoſoever ſhall have
the ordering of that Affair, be very circumſpect in
obſerving the Condition or Ability of Body in which
the Horſe is at the time of ſuch his being matched, which chiefly
ought to be taken notice of in three ſeveral Rules or Methods, the
which I here ſhall undertake to lay down for the better ſatisfaction
of thoſe whom it hereafter may concern.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt of which is, if your Horſe be Foggy, Groſs, or
over-fat when he has been lately taken from Graſs, or Soil.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond likewiſe to be obſerved is, If he be more than
ordinary Lean, either by reaſon of two hard Riding, or any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
has pulled him down by hindring his feeding.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, If he be in good plight, and has had good keeping,
dealt well by, and moderately rid or exerciſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33499:3"/>
Now in the firſt of theſe you cannot take leſs than two Months,
or ten Weeks, to bring your Horſe into a fit condition for a Match,
which muſt be done by moderately Dieting him and often Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him, which waſts the ſuperfluous greaſe, and makes him long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded,
both which will make him more fit and apt to win the
Wager laid upon his Head.</p>
               <p>As for the Second, If your Horſe be exceeding poor, then about
ſix Weeks ſpace muſt be allowed, with good feeding and moderate
exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Now for the Third and Laſt of the fore-mentioned conditions,
which is a <hi>medium</hi> betwixt both; leſſer time will ſerve to fit him
for the match you do deſign to have him run. About a Month or
five Weeks will be ſufficient, if you obſerve the Dieting of him,
which muſt be indifferently well.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing I have given you an account of the particular Eſtates
or Conditions of Horſes; So now I muſt give you ſome cautions
therein to be obſerved: Firſt then, note if your Horſe be fat and
unwieldy, you muſt have a regard to his Exerciſe, for if he be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free,
and is willing to put out his ſtrength and abilities to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
ſo that his fleſh quickly fall away, you muſt reſtrain him,
and not put him to too hard Exerciſe, for he cannot bear it like
thoſe, who are hardy by nature, and grow fat with any Diet, or
any reaſonable Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Yet farther, if your Horſe be in a poor condition by any hard
or ill uſage or diſorder of Body, yet notwithſtanding any thing in
the like nature, grows quickly into good liking, and ſo continues
for a conſiderable time; you need not, neither ſhall you be ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of him as in the caſe of that juſt before mentioned, nor at all
reſtrain him from his Exerciſe, for if you do, he will ſoon grow unfit
for your purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Thus far have I thought fit to inſtruct ſuch as are unskilful, or
have not the moſt expedient Method, for preparing Horſes for
Races.</p>
               <p>And now I think it moſt convenient to give my Reader a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and ample inſtruction as to the dieting and uſing of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and lay open the ſecrets moſt neceſſary to be obſerved by all
according to truth and the moſt innate Sincerity. And firſt of the
fat Horſe, becauſe in him are comprehended the other two, by
reaſon he may be made lean, or between both, as the Maſter of
him thinks moſt convenient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">The way and manner of dieting or feeding a Horſe to fit him for a
Race, being Fat or Groſs, immediately after his being taken from
Paſture or Soil, as to the first two weeks.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>NOW</hi> if you lay a Wager, or match a fat or unwieldy Horſe,
which has been made ſo, either by being kept at graſs in
long idleneſs; or ſtanding at his Stall, and there over-laviſhly fed;
to bring him to a fit condition to perform your expectation, for
the firſt Fort-night you muſt be up as ſoon as day appears, if not
before, to attend him, and having put on his Bridle, which you
muſt be ſure always to let hang upon the Rack cloſe by him, dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
either in Beer or Ale, which will not only put him in mind
of his being rid, but alſo make him the more familiar with it, and
love it the better when on. This being done, cleanſe the Stable
of the filth, and then fall to dreſſing of him, which according to
the beſt method, is as follows.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Curry him well in every part, but begin with the Head,
then his Neck, Back, and Hinder-parts, after that his Shoulders and
Fore-legs as low as the Knees, that done, uſe your duſting Cloth,
or ſomething in the like nature, and with it duſt him over in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part, then rub him well with your hard bruſh, beginning firſt at
the Head, and omitting no place whatſoever there, as the Temples,
Noſe, Ears, Under-jaws, and Fore-head, then proceed to the
others parts as before, not forgetting his ſhanks, nor ſetting on of
his Hoofs, going backwards by degrees till the whole Body be
well rubbed, after that take your wet hand and ſtroke him over
gradularly, not leaving him rough nor wet in any part. Then
with your wet hands or a ſoft Cloth rub gently his Yard, Teſticles,
Sheath, Ears, between his Thighs, and all other private places
whatſoever: After which, with a Hair-cloth or any other hard
Cloth, if that be wanting, rub him over again, being ſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the rubbing of his Face well, as his Cheeks, between his Jaws,
and on his Fore-head, the riſing of his Neck, and Fetlocks, and
other places as you ſhall ſee occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:33499:4"/>
Which being well done, take a clean woollen cloth ſomething
fine, and cleanſe him with the ſame, beginning at the Head, and
ſo proceeding as you were taught before, leaving no part unrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
Laſtly, with a Curry-comb well wetted, comb out the Main
and Tail very decently; thus much for rubbing and cleanſing;
which is as neceſſary in the ordering of Race-Horſes, as their meat.
The next thing to be obſerved is, to cover his Body with a large
Cloth for that purpoſe, either of thick Kerſy or thin Stuff accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſeaſon of the Year, or as heat or cold ſhall beſt agree
with the nature of the Horſe, upon which put his Saddle, girting the
foremoſt Girth very hard, but the other ſlack; then under it
thruſt two wiſps of clean ſtraw, which may ſtretch it to an equal
ſtraightneſs with the firſt, then putting a thick Breaſt-cloth on
you may mount, but if you pleaſe you may firſt ſpurt ſome Beer
or Ale into his mouth, which will make him champ and feel his
Bit the ſooner, and be ſure that you Stable be made clean before
you bring your Horſe in again, the Dung and foul Litter being
laid at the door, and it well ſtored with freſh; for if the Horſe
ſtand not upon good ſtore of Litter, and have it likewiſe to lie
cry in, he will not thrive well nor ſeem half ſo pleaſant as he will
with it; for which purpoſe of all the ſtraw, Wheat-ſtraw is the
beſt, and muſt be uſed on this occaſion unleſs it cannot be got, and
then the next to it is Oat-ſtraw, for both Rye and Barley-ſtraws do
much annoy your Horſe, by reaſon the one doth cauſe him to be
much troubled with the heart-burn, and the other to looſen him,
and make him ſcour extremely.</p>
               <p>Being thus upon his back, you muſt ride him eaſily for the ſpace
of half an hour, for if you gallop or ſtrain him preſently you
do him much injury, by reaſon that it ſtretches his Sinews too
much on the ſudden, which is apt to ingender cold humours in the
Joints and Nerves, ſo that the Horſe will be ſtiff after it, if not
carefully, if not quickly remedied by bathing his Legs with Oil
of Swallows or Earth-worms; but after by gentle riding they
are made pliable, you may gallop him eaſily, but let it be by any
means upon plain and firm ground, or if you live near any ſteep
Hills, whoſe aſcent is ſmooth and firm, let it be up them, then walk
him down in your hand, a foot pace, or a ſmall amble, that ſo he
may cool by degrees; the beſt time to begin to exerciſe is before
the Sun riſe, or as ſoon as it is riſen at the fartheſt, then after his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33499:4"/>
breathing, when he begins to be cool, lead him to ſome pleaſant
Spring or River, and there let him drink his fill.</p>
               <p>Then gallop him again, but not too hard, when you have done
ſo, for about the ſpace of a quarter of an hour, bring him again to
the Brook or River, and let him drink if he ſo pleaſes, but if not,
then give him a gentle courſe or two to raiſe thirſt in him, the
which no doubt will do it, for take this as a general Rule, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after water, you be ſure to breath him gently.</p>
               <p>After he hath drank three times, and been breathed the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
you may bring him home, and coming to the Stable-door,
where the Dung and the foul Litter is laid, let him ſtand upon it;
after you are alighted from his back for ſome time, and by ſoftly
tapping or hitting his hinder Legs with your ſwitch or whip, make
him ſtretch them as far as he can backwards, and by pleaſant whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
provoke him to Urine, which if he refuſe to do once or twice,
yet at laſt he will do it freely; and thereby you will preſerve your
Stable from filth and noiſomneſs, which otherways would much
offend the Horſe.</p>
               <p>He being come into the Stable, rub his Fore-Legs with wiſps of
clean Straw, putting all your ſtrength thereto, but firſt, be ſure
to tie his Head up cloſe to the Rack in his Bridle, then his Breaſt,
or Fore-cloth being taken off, rub his Head, Breaſt, and Neck.
After that, unlooſe his Body-Cloth, and rub him well in every part,
but eſpecially in the Saddle-place, his Saddle being hung up in his
ſight; and after he hath been well rubbed with dry Cloths, cover
him up again with a linen coverer, and upon that put his wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Cloth, or more if the Weather be cold, if warm, they will
be ſufficient, but be ſure to obſerve they are dry when you put
them on.</p>
               <p>After you have girted them cloſe upon him, ſtop in little wiſps
of light ſtraw quite round him, between the Cloths and the Girts,
let them by no means be knotty or hard, leſt they hinder him of
his ſleep, and make him lie uneaſie by hurting his ſides; when he
is thus cloathed, cleanſe his feet, by pulling out the gravel or earth
that they may have got into them, and with warm Cow-dung ſtop
the ſame up cloſe; after that is done, put about half a ſmall arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Hay, that is very ſweet and good, into his rack, bound up as
hard as poſſibly you can bind it, but firſt let it be cleared from
Duſt or Seeds as well as may be, and take not off his Bridle till he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33499:5"/>
has eat it or moſt of it, for it being bound up hard will make him
pull it with more than ordinary eagerneſs, and then conſequently
he muſt eat it with a good ſtomach, but let him not ſtand above
one hour and a half in his Bridle, but having taken it off rub well
his Face, the ridge of his Neck, and each part of his Head with a
rough Cloth made of Flax or Hemp, but the latter is the beſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if it be new, the ſmell of it is very wholeſome, and being apt
to make him ſneeze, will thereby cleanſe his Head of groſs and
crude humours lodged therein.</p>
               <p>This being done, cleanſe the Manger of all the ſcattered Hay, or
other things offenſive that may be in it, then take about two dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
handfuls of the beſt old Oats that are free from Chaff or Seeds,
be ſure they be the largeſt and fulleſt you can get, for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Oats is known by their weight, ſuch as many do call <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Oats, or ſome more vulgarly cut Oats, for theſe of neceſſity
are wholeſomeſt and beſt; for if you give your Horſe thoſe that
are muſty or wet, they will cauſe ſeveral little riſings in the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Body, or more properly termed ſwellings, and ſuch as be not
old breed little worms in the Belly and cauſe pain; it is very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for to give your Horſe any Oats that are not throughly dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
for they will not only cheat him in his feeding, but make
him ſlight them; nor are black ones to be allowed of, unleſs in
time of neceſſity, and then they are not wholeſom.</p>
               <p>Therefore be ſure when you give him his portion of Oats,
which muſt not exceed a quart at a time, you muſt ſift them ſo,
that all the light Oats and Husks may fall away, and whatſoever
elſe you imagine offenſive, as Duſt or Seeds, Straw or other Grain,
after which put them into the Manger; and obſerve whether he
eat them heartily or not, if he do, you may ſupply him with the
like quantity again, ordering them as the former, ſo depart and
leave him to himſelf till about ten or eleven of the Clock, at which
time you coming again to him rub his Head, Face, and Neck, with
the Hempen Cloth before recited, then give him another like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Oats or ſomewhat more, order them alſo in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
before you give them to him, after which leave him for the
ſpace of two hours, and let him remain during that time in as much
darkneſs as your Stable is capable of, and not only then, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in your abſence; for the more obſcure and dark he is kept,
the better will he eat his meat, and the better will he take his reſt;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33499:5"/>
for note, a Horſe will ſeldom lie down in a Stable that is very
light, unleſs he be much wearied either with ſtanding or Travel;
to cauſe the more darkneſs many are uſed to line their Stables, or
at leaſt the Stall where the Horſe deſigned for Race ſtands, with
Sacking or Canvas; not only to make it dark, but to keep him the
warmer, by ſheltring him from wind and duſt.</p>
               <p>After the end of the ſaid two hours which is about one of the
Clock; you muſt viſit him again, and give him another the like
quantity of Oats ordered as the former, and rub his head, neck,
and face, as before; which done, give him a ſmall bundle of Hay
hard twiſted together, and let him alone to eat that by himſelf,
and ſo let him continue till four of the Clock if the days be long,
but if ſhort, not paſt three.</p>
               <p>Then according to the time come to him again, and the Stable
being well cleanſed, wet the Bit of his Bridle in Beer, and ſo faſten
the Reins of it to the Rack as ſoon as you have put it on, which
being done, take off his cloths and dreſs him according to what
you were taught in the morning; he being well dreſſed, bring
him forth and put his Saddle upon his Cloths as formerly, and
endeavour to make him piſs upon his Dung and old Litter caſt
without the Stable, then as ſoon as you pleaſe you may mount
him, and ride him as in the morning, only let this difference be
generally obſerved, that you ride him not up any hills that are
ſteep in the evening, but upon the plaineſt and firmeſt ground you
can find; or if you will for change, ſometimes in ſmooth, green
Meadows that are dry, or by running waters if they lie conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
or that there be any near you; and let him take all the Air
he can, and often ſuffer him to gaze upon the Stream, but ſuffer
him not to ſtand ſtill, but keep him in a continual motion either
Galloping or ſhort Pacing which many give the term of racking;
if he at any time as you lead him in or out of his Stable, offer to
ſmell to any Horſe-dung though not his own, hinder him not,
for that will cauſe him to evacuate and fit him the better for his
meat.</p>
               <p>When he is well watred and well aired at the cool of the day
(or if it be within night it matters not) bring him home (for
note, there is nothing better to rid him of groſs and foul hmours
than to be abroad with him early and late) and when he is come to
the Stable, obſerve that nothing, according to former ordering of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33499:6"/>
him be omitted, but all done with care and diligence, the which
I hope by this time you have ſo well taken notice of that I need
not to repeat it over again; let his diet be likewiſe the ſame, and
let him ſtand at it by himſelf two hours or more, according to the
Seaſon of the Year, in his cloths; in Winter you may let him ſtand
till nine before he has his Bait for all night, in Summer later if
you pleaſe; then coming to viſit him you muſt give him near
three pints of Oats ſifted, dreſs him in every part, give him a
ſmall bundle of Hay in his Rack, and after having raiſed his Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
leave him till the enſſuing morning.</p>
               <p>When betimes you muſt abroad with him again and uſe him as
you have been taught, ſo that in the ſpace of two weeks you may
bring him to ſuch a paſs, as he will be fit to ride or take any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
heat, but beware how you ſtrain him too much, for it will do
him a great injury; thus having after the exacteſt manner inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you as to the firſt fortnights keeping, I ſhall next proceed to
give you Rules and Methods for giving him Courſes, or as ſome
term them Heats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Orders moſt carefully to be obſerved in the Courſing or Heating your
Horſe.</head>
               <p>TO begin with which, I muſt inform you that you muſt not
give above two Courſes in a Week, for if you do you will
ſpend him too much, although he be never ſo luſtly, and thereby
weaken him and make him unfit for your Race.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be obſerved is, that one of the times muſt
be upon the day you deſign he ſhall run the Match; the two days
muſt be as equally diſtant from each other as you can divide the
Week, therefore you ought to make your Match accordingly;
Mondays and Fridays, or Tueſdays and Saturdays are the fitteſt
if you can ſo model the affair, for thoſe days have the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
between them; if your Match be deſigned on the Monday
let that and Friday be his heating days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:33499:6"/>
But if on <hi>Tueſday</hi> or <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> then <hi>Saturday</hi> muſt be the
other that muſt ſerve to both, becauſe it is unſeemly to do it on
the <hi>Sunday,</hi> and ſo you may obſerve of whatſoever day it ſhall fall
out to be, that you keep as near as you can an equal diſtance of
time between his Courſes or Heats.</p>
               <p>But again, you muſt be ſure to obſerve in what weather you
ride him at ſuch times, for if it be wet, that is, if it either Rain,
Snow, or Hail, you muſt not give him any heat till ſuch time it be
fair, unleſs neceſſity urge it, as when it rains moſt part of the Week
or ſo; and then you muſt chuſe the time when it holds up beſt,
and let him be covered very warm, not only his Body, but his
Head, Neck, Ears, Breaſt and Shoulders; for his Head you
muſt provide a covering made with little bags to put his ears in,
and be ſure you keep him abroad as little time as poſſible, for the
damp raw Air will at ſuch times indanger much his health.</p>
               <p>But to the laſt particular that is to be taken notice of in this
Chapter; be ſure if the weather be fair and ſerene, get him
dreſſed and abroad with him as ſoon as day-light appears, but not
before, by reaſon it is very incommodious in this caſe both to the
Horſe and Man, and thus much concerning his Courſes or Heats,
which is the moſt neceſſary thing to be obſerved in preparing him
for your Match; now to the ſecond order of his Keeping and
Feeding.</p>

               <p>IN this as in the former, you muſt be circumſpect to obſerve the
cleaning of his Stall, giving freſh Litter, and keep it lighted
up that his Bed may be always ſoft, and the old with his Dung
and Stale caſt out at the Stable-door, then when you come to
him in the Morning give him a quart or ſomewhat more of well
dreſſed Oats, dreſſed as you were taught before, e'er you put on his
Bridle, which being eaten, dreſs him in every part with ſuch
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33499:7"/>
cloths, bruſhes, and combs, as you formerly have done, which
being perfected according to the beſt of your skill, ſurſingle on
his cloths, and then ſet his Saddle upon his back and ride him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
galloping and racking him moderately, and between each
time of ſo doing water him, and let his bringing home and Stabling
be in each particular obſerved as in the foregoing fortnight, the
which you have been ſo amply taught that I think there is no need
of repeating it over again, only this take notice of, which is not
yet laid down; when you have brought him into his Stall before
you pull off his Bridle take a wiſp of the beſt hay you can get, and
holding it hard in your hand after it is well duſted, let him eat it
thence, and give him all the occaſion you can to pull hard at it, and
if he devour it with a good Appetite ſupply him with more, and
do ſo three times at leaſt if he will eat it, for by ſo doing you will
bring him to be familiar with you and win much upon his good
nature; when he refuſes to eat or that you think he has eaten
enough, take off his bridle after he has ſtood in it about an hour,
then rub him all over and dreſs him as formerly, which ended, give
his Bait of Oats in quantity and manner as has been often declared,
but by no means forget to ſift them. Then having his diet-bread
by you pretty ſtale, which muſt be about three days old at leaſt, it
being then the wholeſomeſt and moſt commodious for him to eat,
and after having eaten it to digeſt; the manner of making it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the moſt skilful preſcribers is as you ſhall be ſhewed in the

               <head type="sub">The firſt Diet to be given in the ordering your Race-Horſe, and the
way to make it.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, to make this Diet-bread you muſt take half a buſhel of
the beſt Horſe-beans, well ſifted from any Seeds or Husks, or
three pecks, if your Horſe be a great feeder; to the latter you
muſt put one peck of the beſt Wheat you can get, to the former
quantity proportionably; you may grind them, divided if you pleaſe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33499:7"/>
and ſo mingle them afterwards, but in my opinion they will be
beſt ground together, after which dreſs the meal as fine as you can,
ſo that there be few or no husks or bran left in it; then take the
beſt Ale-yeſt you can get, by no means let it be ſour or dirty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three quarts will do, and put to that as much water as will juſt
make the Meal up into Dough, which muſt be kneaded with all
your ſtrength in a Trow, or ſome ſuch like thing for that purpoſe.
If you are not ſtrong enough to knead it with your hands you
may tread it with your feet, being ſure to leave no knobs in it,
when it is throughly kneaded, cover it from the duſt and let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the ſpace of an hour, then knead it again, and after you have
ſo done make your Loaves up about the bigneſs of ſix-penny-loaves
or bigger if you pleaſe, and after you have baked them
exceeding well in an Oven, take them out, ſet them trans-verſe to
cool, that is, with their bottoms upwards.</p>
               <p>When you have kept them three days, which you muſt do e'er
you give any of them to your Horſe for fear of making of him
ſick, which if they do, he will refuſe to eat it for the future.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be obſerved is, that if the bread be moiſt or
clammy, ſo that it ſtick to his mouth and he cannot freely ſwallow
it, or do ſeem not to like it, you muſt cut it into thin ſlices and
dry it in the Sun, or if the Sun ſhine not, in ſome Stove or by the
Fire, but not too hard, then take it and mix it with his portion of
Oats by ſmalling it amongſt them, ſo that then he will eat it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and it will do him no harm, but be ſure to pare away the cruſt,
but note that you muſt never give it him alone, but always being
crumbled and mixed with his Oats, the quantity of Bread you ſo
mix muſt not exceed three or four ſlices at a time.</p>
               <p>You having given him one bait, in the morning, about eleven
or twelve a-clock viſit him again, and after well dreſſing him give
him his bait or portion of diet, as before, both of Bread and Oats.</p>
               <p>About two of the Clock or ſomewhat later if you deſign not to
courſe him the following day, and ſo take the diſtance of time as
has been formerly obſerved in all his diets, only let his motions
be curiouſly obſerved and each action taken notice of, for by that
you may know in what liking or eſtate of body he is, and how he
thrives upon his diet.</p>
               <p>Again obſerve, that if you deſign to heat him the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you muſt not from the time juſt before mentioned give him
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33499:8"/>
any bread with his Oats, but let him eat them by themſelves, and
when he has eat them put him on his Bridle and dreſs him well in
each part, the manner of which I hope we need not now declare;
then his cloth being put on in decent manner, clap on his Saddle
and ride him abroad in the Air, gallop and rack him gently and
let him take his watrings as before, them bringing him home let
him ſtale and dung at the door if you can get him to do it; and
being brought into the Stable, after rubbing down give him his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Oats, but no Hay, for that is not convenient before a heat.</p>
               <p>Now I have given you a moſt exact account concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and dieting your horſe, the next thing neceſſary is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you what Muzzles are moſt convenient for Race-Horſes, and
what is the occaſion of their being put on, and the danger that there
is in ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, Muzzles were made to prevent horſes from biting
and tearing their Racks, Mangers, and Stalls, to keep them from
eating Loume or Mud-walls, their own Litter or the like, which is
very dangerous and hurtful to them, for it is not requiſite they
ſhould eat any thing without your knowledge, or what you give
them.</p>
               <p>But as for theſe Muzzles there are many kinds, ſome cloſe, ſome
broad, others with little round holes in them, theſe are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made of Leather which often proves very annoiable to your
Horſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, any Leather that is alumed is very hurtful to the
head by reaſon of its ſharp ſcent and ſaltneſs, the next is that
which is greaſed or dreſſed with courſe Oil, the ſmell of which
often makes your Horſes head-ake, and cauſes him to leave his meat,
be ſick and hard bound, ſo that he cannot dung kindly.</p>
               <p>Now there are another kind of Muzzles that are very requiſite
which are much in uſe, which are made of pack-thread or whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
Theſe are moſt convenient in the Summer-time and will
not offend the horſe, if you waſh them once in two or three days
or have freſh ones to put on.</p>
               <p>Another ſort there are which are commonly uſed in Winter,
which are made of ſtrong Canvas fit for the head of your Horſe,
ſo far as need requires, and bound with ſtrong filleting, on one ſide
a loop being made, and on the other a ſtring to faſten it round
his Poll, and under his Chaps; ſome for warmth uſe to put
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33499:8"/>
double Canvas, but take notice there muſt be a breathing Place
with net-work juſt againſt his mouth and noſtrils to let the Air in
and out, or elſe if it be hard tied on it will go near to ſtifle
him.</p>
               <p>Thus much as touching Muzzles, now I will return again to
the ordering your Horſe, and give you a farther account of ſeveral
other particulars in the management of him, beyond what has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been diſcourſed upon.</p>
               <p>If in the enſuing morning, you coming to viſit your horſe find him
laid, raiſe him not, but let him reſt, but if he be upon his Legs take
a quart of Oats and waſh them well in Beer or Ale, then dry them
indifferently well and give him them to eat; and when he has ſo
eaten them, put on his Bridle and rub him down exceeding well,
after that put on all his cloths and then for Saddling of him;
after which, hold up his head as high as you can reach, and
into his mouth break a new-laid Egg and oblige him to ſwallow it,
after which ſpurt ſome Beer into his mouth and carry him abroad
to Air, obſerving at the door as formerly. Being mounted, ride
him gently, and by degrees increaſe his pace till it come to a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
and if he be ſo enclined let him ſmell to any Horſe's dung he
meets with upon the Road.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall give you another inſtruction worth obſerving; that
is, the day you are deſigned to run the Race when you come within
a mile or leſs of the ſtarting goal or poſt for that purpoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned;
take off his cloths, which being done clap your Saddle
upon his back, ſending ſome perſon with his cloths to the end of
the Race intended, and ride him on gently till you come to the
weighing or ſtarting poſt; ſhew him the poſt and make him as far
as he is capable, ſenſible of what he is deſigned for to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
               <p>The Signal for the ſtart being given put him on at near three
quarters ſpeed, or if his ſtrength will allow it, more, but be ſure
you put him not to more than he is able to perform, hold the Reins
pretty ſtreight in your hand, but by no means check him in his
Courſe, but let him run on chearfully, and give him all the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
you can, and ſo let him run the whole Race through.</p>
               <p>If you, during the Courſe find his ſtrength to fail him, or that
he begin to yield, give him what eaſe you can, and do not force him
to too great a ſwiftneſs, but uſe him ſo that he may be at all times
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33499:9"/>
well pleaſed with his courſes and free to run, and ſo in a ſhort time
you bring him to perfection, but if he be any way diſcouraged at
firſt, he will never perform according to your Expectation.</p>
               <p>Now the next thing material to be obſerved is upon what
ground you run, and then conſider which ground your horſe takes
moſt delight to run upon, for this may turn to your great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
the which you may beſt take notice of in his Heats or in his
firſt Race, whether it be ſmooth, rough, dry, wet, or a little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that he moſt eagerly covets, and for the future chuſe it if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in all your Races.</p>
               <p>When the Race is ended, wherein if he have been exceeding hard
put to it, by no means let him ſtand ſtill but gallop him mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
about ſome green Field, the better to let him take breath by
degrees and cool accordingly, the which when you find he has
pretty well done, have him into ſome dry gravel-pit or other
deep place out of the wind, or if there be none convenient, then
to the thickeſt Buſhes or Trees you can meet with, and there having
his cloths ready, with a large blunt knife or ſome old piece of
Iron or Wood flat like a Ruler, yet having a blunt edge, ſcrape the
ſweat off from his Body, laying the ſtrength of both your hands
to the ſame till none appear in any part, and between whiles give
your horſe a turn or two, and then ſcrape him again till he has
done ſweating, at which time pull off his Saddle and ſcrape the place
on which it was; likewiſe then with dry cloths, rub him in all parts,
not omitting any place, exceeding well, put on his cloths and girt
his Saddle on upon them, immediately after which you muſt gallop
him gently for a conſiderable ſpace, then rub him ſlightly not taking
off his cloths, eſpecially from his head and neck; then you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and walk him in your hand about the Heath or Field, but be ſure
you ſuffer him not to graze if he ſhould offer it, and when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him cool and dry, ride him home gently; you may gallop him
ſoftly if you pleaſe; when you come home to the Stable-door en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make him piſs and dung, but beware you put him not
into the Stable till he be quite dry and very cool, where being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
faſten his bridle to the Rack, and have this following doſe in
readineſs, which you muſt give him in a drenching horn, or ſome ſuch
like thing, which will cleanſe his body and much help nature to
recover ſtrength, if he be any ways weakned by his running.</p>

your greateſt pains muſt be about his head, neck; and breaſt;
this being perfected put on his cloths and keep him as warm as
poſſible, and put ſeveral handfuls of ſtraw under his girts, and then
let him remain without either meat or drink for the ſpace of two
hours, during which time you muſt watch him, and ſeldom let him
ſtand ſtill for fear of getting cold, during the time the Potion is in

blood and vital Spirits have not their operation ſo well as in times
of motion, nor the heat of the body power to force up the humors
that lie as it were abſconded in the ſeveral parts. When he has
ſtood in his Bridle, and faſted ſo long as is before-mentioned, or

him all over in what condition or eſtate of body he is, and if you
find him ſweat on a ſudden or any cold clamm over-ſpread his
Limbs, which many call a cold ſweat, or if you obſerve him to
pant, tremble, or fetch his breath ſhort, with-hold your hand and
give not any thing; for if you do, it will much indanger him,
theſe being the Symptoms that the Potions has not done working,
but that it is ſtriving with the vicious humors and ſoul indigeſtures

ſtop all the Lights of the Stable, the better to keep it dark, and
ſecure your Horſe from too much Air, and let him take his eaſe
in your abſeuce for the ſpace of two hours or more, by which time
the Potion will have done working and his ſickneſs will paſs away.</p>
               <p>Then coming to him again, if you find him well you may give
him the ears of wheat by four or five at a time till the whole parcel
is waſted, after that if he will eat any more you may ſuffer him
to have the like quantity again, and after them a ſmall bundle of
Hay bound up very hard and thrown into his Rack, but during
the time of his eating it, be ſure to rub him over as you have been
taught; but more eſpecially his head.</p>
               <p>Within the hour following give him his quantity of Oats
as before, mingling with them a pint of husked Beans, as clean
from husks and duſt as can be, then take tree ſlices of bread
and (the cruſt being cut away) crumble them among the
Oats and Beans, and ſo give them to him, and after he has eaten
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33499:10"/>
them let him ſtand about two hours and a half, or three if you
pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Then coming to him give him ſome Bait again of each the ſame
parcel as before, then dreſs him down well and put on his cloth,
but put not on his Saddle, nor back him, neither let him have
any water that night, but keep him within doors, for if you do
otherwiſe you will endanger your horſe.</p>

with his laſt diet.</p>

               <head type="sub">The manner of making his laſt Diet.</head>
               <p>IN this you muſt uſe three Pecks of Wheat, and but one of
Beans, and let them be ground together upon the black Stones
as ſmall as poſſible they can be, then dreſs it through an exceeding
fine dreſſing-cloth; for note, that every Bread muſt be finer than
the former: Then put to it the fore-mentioned quantity of Ale-Yeſt,
but be ſure it be not ſowre, nor the Grounds. Then knead
it together, and make it up into Loaves as formerly; but to this,
above what has been ſpoken of, you muſt add the Whites of two
or three and twenty Eggs, and inſtead of water put milk, ſo much
as will make it up.</p>
               <p>They being baked, let them ſtand their uſual time, and then
cut the Cruſt away, or as ſome call it, chip them, after which,
dry a quart of Oats well, and after that ſift them, ſo that there be
no defect left in them, to which, put your Beans in like manner
ordered, and at the uſual times, give them all three, mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to him.</p>
               <p>As for his Heating and Courſing-days, the firſt week they
muſt be punctually obſerved, but the ſecond you muſt abate him
one, that is, heat him but once, and that muſt be <hi>Mondays</hi> hear.
After he has ſtood one hour more in his Bridle, you may take
three pints of Oats, and ſteep them in Beer or Ale for a ſhort time,
and then give them to him, and they will much cheriſh him, and
allay his thirſt.</p>
               <p>This being done, about an hours ſpace after, you ſhall give him
the former quantity of Beans, Oats, and Bread in the ſame order,
and manner, or if you think it more convenient, you may give
them ſeveral, and not mingle them; let him by no means want for
feeding at night, for when you make him his laſt, give him not
only his Bait, but leave him a bundle of Hay in his Rack bound up
very hard.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:33499:11"/>
Next Morning, as ſoon as day appears, you muſt give him his
firſt diet, then rub him well in every part; after which, put on
his cloths and air him, that is, ride him abroad, and uſe him as
formerly, permitting him to drink freely; both Gallop and Rack
him, but do not ride him hard.</p>
               <p>When you return, dreſs him, and feed him with Oats, Beans,
and Bread, as heretofore, and ſome Hay, but not ſo much as you
were uſed to give him.</p>
               <p>As for your heating days, they muſt likewiſe be obſerved in all
points as formerly, nor upon any occaſion neglected, unleſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch as has been declared, nor muſt you encreaſe them, nor
ſtrain your Horſe more than you were wont; four heats or cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
will be ſufficient for the firſt fortnight, and four purges or
ſcouring for the whole time of his being made fit for Racing, all
which muſt be obſerved with diligence and caution, according to the
forementioned Methods and Inſtructions; but now to the third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The third Fortnights Dieting and Ordering your Horſe.</head>
               <p>NOw for the manner of Making his Bread, it muſt be as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
finer than formerly was wont, muſt it be made;
therefore take but two pecks of Beans, and with fine Wheat make
it up a Buſhel, let them be ground together as formerly, and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
exceeding fine, ſo that there be hardly a Husk or a Bran to be
ſeen; then with a like quantity of yeſt as before, mingle the meal
and add water to it, ſo much as is juſt ſufficient to make it ſtick
cloſe together; when it is well kneaded and worked up, you muſt
bake it as you have been taught.</p>
               <p>After which, it having ſtood about three days or ſomewhat
more, pare away the Cruſt and give it your Horſe, (that is) three
ſlices crumbled amongſt a quart of fine dreſſed Oats and a quart
of ſplit Beans; your obſervance ſhall be in theſe as in the former
two weeks, his Dreſſings, Airings, times of Feeding, and likewiſe his
heating days muſt be particularly obſerved. And take notice of this,</p>
               <p>That you muſt not, after he has been heated, give him any of
the Scowring, but that being laid aſide, give him in the room of
it Balls about the bigneſs of a Pullets Egg, which are great Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33499:12"/>
and reſtoratives, and you muſt give him one at a time; thus ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Saddle or otherwiſe if you pleaſe, hold up his head
as high as is convenient, and put one of them into his Mouth and
oblige him to ſwallow it, but before you give it him, you muſt
rub him down, or according to your match; for you muſt not heat
him for four or five days before you intend to run your Race, but
you may air him very well, and give him gentle breathings, that
he may in no wiſe loſe his wind, but give him none of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
ſcouring drink.</p>
               <p>One thing more I have conſidered to quicken his Spirits and make
him lively, which is to burn <hi>Storax, Olibanum, Frankincenſe</hi> and
<hi>Benjamin</hi> mixed together, which drive away all ill ſcents and airs,
and there is nothing more wholeſom for the brain.</p>
               <p>As likewiſe, when you give your Horſe his Oats, Beans and
Bread, waſh the two former in neither Ale nor Beer, but take a
pint of <hi>Muſcadine,</hi> and about the Whites of ten Eggs, and ſteep
them therein, but you need not do this above four times in a week;
at other times, give them to him dry as formerly.</p>
               <p>Beware likewiſe how to give him any Hay, unleſs immediately
after his heats, and then holding a ſmall wiſp in your hand, let
him pull it thence by degrees, but if his Belly be apt to ſhrink up,
you may give him more to keep it ſtreight.</p>
               <p>Again, all the laſt week, if your Horſe be given to eat his Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you muſt keep him muzzled as you have been formerly taught,
but if he be not ſubject to the ſame, nor to eat any other foul thing,
three days before you run him will be a ſufficient ſpace to keep
him muzzled.</p>
               <p>The day-morning before you intend to run him, you muſt air
him gently, and when you have brought him home, dreſs him
and rub him as formerly, and be ſure to diet him exceeding well,
omitting no point, neither before nor after his being carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
only towards might you may ſtint him of the third part of his
uſual Bait, but let his laſt Diet be full Proportion, as likewiſe his
dreſſing; another thing is alſo to be obſerved, which is, that you
muſt not keep him out late, but let him be in his Stable at Sun-ſet
or before, and likewiſe the day before the Match, you ſhall ſhooe
him, poll him, and all things elſe that you ſhall think convenient
for fitting him out in the beſt wiſe, but beware that it be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully
performed, for then you may much injure your Horſe, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33499:12"/>
give him ſome cauſe to be offended at your curioſity, or as many
call it Adornment. It is reported by ſome who have had long
experience in this way and manner of ordering of Horſes, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
are ſo skilful as to underſtand the meaning of ſuch orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and what they are to be put to, the next day, which
makes them conceive ſuch Pride that they will not eat any meat
till the time they have run the Race, unleſs it be forced upon
them.</p>
               <p>It is true, all Authors that treat of Naturalities do affirm that
horſes are moſt knowing and ſubtil Creatures, and that they are
endued with many noble Qualities and generous Perfections.</p>
               <p>Now for brading their Tails and Manes, and tying Ribbons on
their fore-head, or at their ears, I hold altogether unneceſſary,
for ſo doing does not only offend him, but many times hinders
him in the performance of his Race, by reaſon that they make
him caſt his head often to look at them, and if he has not been
uſed to them, many times make him ſtart out of his way, and ſo
loſe his ground; therefore in my opinion, only to comb out his
Mane and Tail (and if they be too cumberſome you may clip them
a little) is the beſt Method in that caſe.</p>
               <p>Be ſure there be nothing left undone that you intend to do to
him, till the morning he is to run, for if there be, it may chance
to vex him, and thereupon ſome Horſes will grow ſullen and will
not run freely.</p>
               <p>The morning you are to run, make him a viſit before it is well
light, and after you have pulled off his Muzzle and rubbed his head
in every part thereof, offer him a quart of Oats ſteeped in a pint of
Muskadine or Tent, but before you put them in bruiſe them a
little, if he chance to refuſe it, put him ſome Oats in the whites
of Eggs only; or to be better ſure of his eating, ſome of the
beſt and fineſt Bread, and ſome whole Wheat, well ſiſted and
dreſſed, mingle with his Oats, in which you muſt uſe no Beans;
but be ſure you give him but a little of any of theſe diets, for if you
fill him he will be unfit for the Race and may fail your expectation,
which otherwiſe he no doubt would have anſwered in each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
to your great ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>If he empty not his Body freely, take him abroad and air him
a little, and ſee if you can poſſibly get him to dung and urine, the
which if he do (the which no doubt by this time you will have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33499:13"/>
taught him to do) bring him into the Stable again, and put his
Muzzle on; but on the contrary, if he will empty without any
farther trouble in the Stable, 'tis needleſs to lead him out, and far
better to let him remain till the time you are deſigned to run, or
about half an hour before, according as the diſtance is from the
place he is kept at to the ſtarting place.</p>
               <p>Juſt as you are going to lead him, dip the Bit of his Bridle in
Muskadine or Alicant, and then drawing off his Muzzle, draw on
his bridle, but if you ſee him inclinable to empty, let him do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and to incite him to do it the more ſpeedily, give him about
a pint of waſhed Oats, Bread and Wheat as before you did; then
ſpread ſoft wax, ſuch as ſhoo-makers uſe, under your Girts and
Saddle, which done girt it gently on his back, ſo that he ſcarcely feel
it is on; then ſpread a large white Linen cloth over his Saddle,
and over it all his other cloths, which likewiſe being ſlightly girt,
ſtick wiſps under his Girts or Surſingles, but let them be very ſoft;
then cover him with ſome piece of rich Tapeſtry or Cloth of
State to make him ſhew gallant, after which pour down his throat
with a drenching horn, one pint of Muſcadine, Alicant, or for
want of either, Canary.</p>
               <p>Then lead him forth with courage, and ſuffer him to move gent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
and if he offer to ſmell to any dung, either old or new, ſuffer
him by any means to do it, or if he offer not, endeavour to make
him, for it will cauſe him to evacuate, which will much lighten
him and help him in the Race; nay uſe double diligence herein,
by leading him to ſuch places as you think will ſooneſt provoke
him to it, as heaps of ruſhes, brakes, or heath, little buſhes, high
tufted graſs, or the like; but if there happen to be no ſuch in your
way, then you may ſpread, and light up ſome Straw under his feet,
making it ruſtle; then whiſtle, and touch him gently with your
ſwitch or whip to make him ſtretch, the which no doubt will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
your deſire.</p>
               <p>Again, If he foam at mouth by champing hard upon his Bit or
otherwiſe, you muſt take care to have a fine linen cloth ready to
wipe it off, and a veſſel of fair cool water, to cleanſe and waſh his
mouth ſtill as you obſerve the froth or foam to riſe.</p>
               <p>Then having walked him gently to the place deſigned for ſtart<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing,
you muſt take off all to his Saddle, and having rubbed him
down with care in every part (which muſt be done with hard
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33499:13"/>
wiſps) ſearch and cleanſe his feet, and ſpurt ſome water in his
mouth; after which, your ſelf or whom you aſſign to ride him,
may take his Back, and obſerving the fair ſtart, put him ſwiftly on,
and run the Match.</p>
               <p>—No doubt with good ſucceſs, for this manner of ordering
will ſeldom fail your expectations, if your horſe in himſelf be but
ſound and of good Mettl'd Limbs and ſtrength to bear him out.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall give the curious to underſtand as neceſſary a point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to horſes as has ever been diſcourſed of in any Tract
whatſoever, the which will be very uſeful for all thoſe whoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it is to trade in Horſes, and be as the Sailers Card, to direct
them in that affair, and keep them from being over-ſeen, or cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any Market or Fair whatſoever; with each particular obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
rule and method to be taken notice of in the Limbs, body,
and head, as eyes, mouth, noſe, ears, and the true manner to know
a good Horſe from a bad.</p>
               <p>But to begin, firſt, there are theſe things to be obſerved, if
you will chuſe a Horſe that ſhall be for your turn, and pleaſe you
in every part, and in all his actions, travels, or other labours, as
Hunting, Racing, War, drawing of Coach, Chariot, or any
rural ſervice whatſoever, but take notice that no one Horſe can be
capable of all theſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore you muſt chuſe your Horſe according to what you
deſign him for, and ſo manage him accordingly.</p>
               <p>But to imperfection in general, the which I will undertake to
demonſtrate in the ſound Horſe, who is no ways defective, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in him may lively appear all the maladies and miſchances that
may or can befal any horſe whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, be adviſed, that whenever you deſign to buy a Horſe,
take eſpecial notice of all his parts, and the full proportion of
his body according to his natural ſhape, or if you can obſerve any
imperfection in his Limbs that may ariſe by accident, whereby
they are leſſened or made bigger, take ſpecial care to find out
the cauſe of it if poſſible, by which you may know what you buy,
and whether to like or diſlike him.</p>
               <p>In which, your obſervances in election muſt be drawn from two
heads, the firſt of which is general, the latter peculiar or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:33499:15"/>
               <p>For the firſt of which, it is to be underſtood upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
you buy your Horſe, or for what uſe he is deſigned, what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is beſt, or beſt pleaſes you; next his ſtature, breed and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
theſe are general, becauſe every man in this will pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
according to his fancy, nor ever can we imagine all men to
be of a mind in this, therefore it is beſt to let them chuſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own pleaſure, nor much matters it.</p>
               <p>The next, which is a peculiar or a particular Query, is to know
what Country-breed he is of, whether Engliſh or Foreign, to
know which you muſt enquire of thoſe who have had the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him, or if that cannot be known, by reaſon of his being ſo
often bought and ſold, take theſe particular obſervations; if he
be Spaniſh breed, his Limbs are ſmall and ſtreight, dry and ſpare,
like a Hart's; if Barbary, a fine little Head and a well-ſet Breaſt
and Shoulder; if of Naples, he is hawks-noſed and clear-eyed,
his eyes ſeeming to ſparkle; if Dutch or Flemmiſh, his legs will
be generally rough and large-hoofed; as for French and Engliſh,
they are almoſt alike, only the Engliſh are ſtronger ſet and more
hardy for any exerciſe whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Now to his colour, for the colour of a Horſe is much to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
by reaſon one colour is far better than another, though
there be good Horſes of all colours; the beſt colours, as the moſt
experienced do affirm, are the Roan, the White, the Lyard, the
Bay, the Sorrel, the Dapple Gray, the Flea-bitten, the Black;
Iron-grey, and White, but above all, the Bay is choſen and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the beſt, both by the French and the Engliſh, eſpecially if
they have a Star in their fore-heads, and their feet ſpotted with
white ſpots, the Lyard for courage is eſteemed, which is a mingled
Roan, the Mouſe, Dun and Grizled, were formerly in great eſteem,
as alſo the Dapple-Grey, and ſuch as come neareſt them, the Iron-Grey,
the White Sorrel and Brown-Bay. <hi>Plato</hi> commendeth much
the White, whom <hi>Virgil</hi> does not eſteem; others commend the
Black, eſpecially if he have a white Star in his fore-head, or be
ſtreaked with white down his face, the black if he be not mingled
with Silver-hair, nor have any white about him, is naught for
Service, the Flea-bitten Horſe is always ſingular good for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
and other Labours, and will hold out the beſt of any; the
yellowiſh or glew'd unleſs he be ſpotted or ſtraked with white
is naught, yet if he be well marked he often proves indifferent well;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33499:15"/>
and if he have a black Liſt down his back from the nape of his
neck to his tail, he is excellent good for a Stallion if his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be according; the red Bay, and the blue gray are much
ſubject to Melancholy. The Flea-bitten and the Black with White
are Sanguine, the Roan, the Sorrel, and the Black without White
ſubject to choler.</p>
               <p>But as to their Paces, which are theſe, Trot, Rack, Amble,
or Gallop, the which you muſt chuſe, according as you deſign to
put him to, either for Racing, Hunting, Travelling, or Fight;
if it be for moderate Travelling, an eaſie Trot is beſt, the which
you may know if he be prone to by obſerving his Legs.</p>
               <p>Thus when his near fore-leg and his off hinder-leg, move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or his near hinder-Leg and his off fore-Leg; and farther
obſerve, that if when he moves, he be quick to raiſe his Legs from
the ground, and do it ſhort and with an even diſtance, making but
little treads, he will likewiſe pace very well; for if he lift up his
feet blunderingly or careleſly, it denotes he is given to Stumbling
and will be oft troubled with Lameneſs; if he ſtrike his Legs acroſs,
or take no wideneſs in his ſteps, it denotes he is ſubject to trip, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere
or fall; if he take not his ſtep even, it ſhews an unwillingneſs
to travel and a weakneſs in his Limbs; if he tread large ſteps, he is
ſubject to over-reach and ſtrain himſelf if he be put to the Speed.</p>
               <p>Again, if you chuſe a Horſe for eaſe and pleaſant Journeys, you
muſt chuſe an Ambler, which you may know thus, if he move
both his Legs on the ſame ſide together, fore-Leg and hinder-Leg,
and that he muſt do, large, nimble, and eaſie; for if he tread ſhort
and ſhuffling he is no good Ambler, yet if he be very nimble at his
firſt beginning to pace, it denotes he cannot long hold it.</p>
               <p>Now for hunting either of Buck, Stag, or Hare, for ſpeed on
the Road, or to ride Poſt, if you chuſe a Horſe, then you muſt
take one who has naturally or has been taught the racking Pace,
which is neither trot nor Amble, but between both, and is the
eaſieſt of all, though it gain not ſo much ground, the which you
may obſerve by the ſame method as you did ambling.</p>
               <p>The next I have to treat of is gallopping, which is natural to all
the former Paces, but the Amble; for an ambling Horſe will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
be brought to Gallop, by reaſon it conſiſts almoſt of the
ſame nature with it, only a ſlower and not ſo much ſtraining; for
it being a ſwift Pace, by long uſe has ſo inured the Horſe to it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33499:16"/>
that he cannot without ſome time and inſtruction frame his legs to
it, but will fall into a Pace; if he be overmuch ſpurred, beaten or
forced, that can properly be called no Pace, but a confuſion of all
together, but perfects all things, ſo in time you may bring him to
gallop as you pleaſe if no imperfection in his Limbs reſtrain him.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall lay down ſuch obſervations as you may infallibly
know a good Gallopper by. Firſt, if he raiſe his feet ſwift and
clearly from the ground but not too high, and that he neither
rowl nor boggle in his way, nor ſtriketh his Belly with his feet.
If he take large reaches with his fore-legs, and his hinder follow
quickly, in which you muſt likewiſe obſerve that he do not cut
under the Knee, or on the Shank, which is called by ſome the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopping,
but by others the ſwift-cut, or that he throws not his
Legs croſs or twiſt them as it were, nor that he ſet one foot upon,
or clap it againſt the other, but that he keep him ſteady and even
in all his courſe, and ſtill with his fore-foot head the way.</p>
               <p>The Horſe who has theſe properties always gallops moſt neatly,
and a Man may truſt to him in any time of danger, that is, if he be
beſet with Thieves, or purſued by an Enemy, in time of War, if he
be but able of Body, and well kept.</p>
               <p>If your Horſe raiſe all his feet together, and gallop as it were on
a heap, or round, then he is not ſwift, but will tread ſure and hold
out well, by reaſon of his ſtrength and limbs, and is fit for War
or carry double.</p>
               <p>Again, obſerve if a Horſe, gallops but ſoftly and treads firm,
not being Subject to fall nor ſtumble, yet his Legs ſeem tender,
and he lifts them up as it were in fear, and throws them in and out
as if he was hurt or pained, then he is not for gallopping uſes,
nor ever will he, by reaſon he has ſome obſcure diſeaſe or ſtiff
lameneſs in his Joints that is hard to remove.</p>
               <p>Now as to his height or ſtature, the which muſt be obſerved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the uſe you put him to, or as your ſelf ſhall think fit,
a well-made Horſe with ſtrong Joints, but not much fleſh upon his
Legs, you muſt chuſe, about ſixteen hands high; if you take one
for carrying double or any other great weights; as likewiſe for
drawing either in Cart, Waggon or Coach, and if for recreation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the fineſt and neateſt limbed and ſhaped you can light of, and not
exceeding fourteen hands in ſtature, or if you pleaſe leſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the proportion of your own body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:33499:16"/>
Thus far having given you, as I well hope, a ſatisfactory inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I ſhall now proceed to inform you of the Deformities and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
ſecret Diſtempers and Infirmities that lie hidden ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times from the eyes of the Buyer, the which are not a few, ſo
that it would be almoſt impoſſible to diſcover them all, ſo that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one might underſtand them; therefore I ſhall endeavour to
give you as plain and full an account as is neceſſary, or that can be
underſtood according to the beſt opinions of the skilful.</p>
               <p>To begin then, when any one offers you a Horſe to ſell, after
you have ſeen him tried, as to the former experience, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his Age, and Breed, then cauſe his Saddle and all other his
Cloths, nay his very Bridle, if ſo be you can get him to ſtand ſtill
without it, to be took off, and then place your ſelf juſt before him,
and look wiſhfully upon him, and take eſpecial notice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
at all times, whether he look pleaſant and lively, well and
ſtedfaſt, without change or alteration; the which if he do, it is a
ſign that he is of a good Spirit, and in good health, as to bodily
ſickneſs or inbred diſeaſes; the next thing to be obſerved is his
ears, for if they be thick, ſtiff and taper from the roots to the
tips, as alſo long or of a convenient ſize well faſtned and ſtrong at
the roots, it is a great ſign of mettle, perfection and completeneſs,
for ſuch ears are an ornament to any horſe.</p>
               <p>But if they be contrary, as thick at the ends, lolling, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
moving, it denotes him dull, ſloathful, heavy, and ſtubborn,
and of a very ill temper.</p>
               <p>Now if his face be clean and his forehead riſing, the ſimilitude
of a feather in his forehead, upon his cheeks or any part of his
face, but it is the greater ſign if it be above his eyes, or if he have
a white Spot, Star, or Streak of a pretty large Size, drawn even,
or a ſnip of white upon his noſe, it is a ſign he is good and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, if his face ſeem ſwelled, bloated or puffy,
fat, dull, cloudy, or lowring, his forehead flat and ſquare, which
the Vulgar term Mare-faced, the rach if any he has in his front,
ſtanding very low, or in the middle of his face, his Star or Streak
uneven or crinkled, his noſe ball'd or raw, and the hair in many
places off from his face, are very bad marks and ſignatures of great
deformity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:33499:17"/>
Again, if his eyes be ſhining, full and round, ſtand Eagle-like,
out from his head, and little or none of their whites to be ſeen,
if they be full and ſparkling, it denoteth him chearful, ſwift-ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and comely, full of ſpirit and of good nature, yet fierce and
fiery.</p>
               <p>But if his eyes look askew, ſeem dull, and withered, little and
ſlow in motion, they denote much imperfection, and are unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to behold; if they are the colour of Foxes or Ferrets eyes,
he will be quickly moon-eyed or wall-eyed, and, if not timely
prevented, blind; if he chance to have a thick, dull Philm over
it, and in it white ſpecks, it not only ſhews a timorouſneſs in your
Horſe, but ſubjection to cauſeleſs ſtarting, and alſo in danger of
having a Pin and Web or white skin over his ſight; if they run
either water or matter, or ſeem bloody or raw, they proceed from
an old Surfeit or an over-heating, which was done by immoderate
riding: Corruption ingendring in the Head by exceeding draughts
or the like, as dead eyes that are low ſunk do; that, if he lives
long he will be blind, and that he was gotten by a very aged Stalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and is of no good breed; if the Whites be as much ſeen as
the Black it ſignifies great weakneſs, unnatural and ſullen in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Again, if you obſerve by feeling or otherwiſe, his Chaps or
Jaw-bones Lean, Spare, and large ſpaces between them, his Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe
Head great and wide, not ſurrounded or incumbred with
Nerval ſmall Ropes or the like; and that his neck ſeems to ſhoot
through the Jaw, or be placed in the nether part of it within the
ſame; it is a token of large and ſtrong wind, and that your Horſe
will hold out a Race very well if all his Limbs be proportionable,
and that he is of a good heart, and has a head not ſubject to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes:
But on the contrary, if his Jaws be fat, groſs and full of
kernels or knobs, and that there is but a little ſpace between the
bones, it denotes ſhort wind, foulneſs of Stomach and Belly, and
ſubject to Glaunders, Broken-winded, or Strangury, and many
times apt to be troubled with grievous Colds.</p>
               <p>Now if his Jaws be cloſe and firmly fixed as it were to touch each
other, ſo that they cauſe the fleſh to riſe about them as if ſwelled,
it denoteth ſhort-wind, groſs and vicious humours ſetling there,
and eſpecially if it riſe more in one place than in another, and the
form of the riſings be long, for then ſome inward infection is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33499:17"/>
which if not taken in time will turn to an Impoſtume or
worſe.</p>
               <p>If he have wide Noſtrills, and they open and ſhut and ſeem in a
continual motion, ſo that the inſides or redneſs upon every little
Straining or Snorting appear, yet the compaſs of his noſe but
ſmall, his mouth not wide but deep, with ſmall dry Lips, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without the leaſt hanging over, do likewiſe promiſe the horſe
good. And well-winded, courageous and hardy.</p>
               <p>But if contrary, quite otherwiſe; as ſhort-winded, tender and
weak, a ſhallow-mouthed Horſe will never bear his Bridle well,
but if it be not buckled faſt, the Bit will be apt to fall out of his
mouth, or he will be much apt to ſlaver.</p>
               <p>Again, if his upper Lip be uneven, and will not meet with his
under, but either ſhut over or flap, it is a certain ſign that he has a
lingering Diſeaſe or is exceeding ſlow, as alſo if he have a Rheum
or dropping at the noſe, if that be clear it will if not timely
ſtopped (the which it is hard to do) turn to the Glaunders; if
one noſtril runs it is worſe than if they did both.</p>
               <p>—Now as to his teeth, be ſure to obſerve that when you buy
a Horſe, to look in his mouth, and take a diligent care to ſee if he
have loſt none of his teeth, or if he have, what they are, whether
Grinders, Fore-teeth or Tuſhes; for thereby you may give a
ſhrewd gueſs at his Age, although the mark be out of his mouth;
but to avoid being cheated buy not a horſe that has loſt any, for
if he have loſt ſome the reſt will quickly follow.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered is his Breſt, for if that be broad,
ſtrong-ſet, riſing or full-fleſhed, and adorned with marks or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
then you may confide in his ſtrength, and he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your expectations; but if he be the contrary, it denotes weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Body and unfitneſs for Labour, and that he is given to that
ill quality in Horſes, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſtumbling, as likewiſe to cutting and
tripping; as alſo if his Breaſt ſeem to ſink or give inwards, it ſhews
him of no courage or metal.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered is his Legs; that is, his fore-legs
only, of the hinder hereafter I ſhall treat; firſt obſerve the Joint
next to his ſhoulder, which is properly called his Bow or Elbow,
and from thence his Thigh as low as his knee, and obſerve they
be well Sinew'd and covered with brawny fleſh, no ways giving out
nor tumid, and that he ſtand firm without bending or moving his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33499:18"/>
Joints, which if he do, it is a ſign of ſtrength, as likewiſe they
are all marks of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The next is to obſerve if he carry an even or equal pace with his
Legs, but eſpecially with his knees, and that they be neat, well
knit, and not too fleſhy, of a juſt proportion; for take notice
if they differ in magnitude he has had his knee broke, or elſe
ſome diſtemper harbours there, as the Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if you find any
cuts or ſcars with hair growing in them, he is apt to fall, which
will be hard to cure or rid him of.</p>
               <p>Then leaving his Knees, obſerve his Shanks as low as his Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
and if they be well Sinew'd, finely made and ſhaped propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to his Thighs, and that they neither bend in nor out, and
that there be no ridge nor ſeam deſcending from the knee-joints on
the inſide, there is he good and ſound in thoſe parts; but on the
contrary, if there be ſcars, ſcabs, or knobs on the inſide, it is by
reaſon of his high ſtriking, called by moſt the ſwift-cut; but if
above his Fetlock or Hoof, it is interfering or ſhort-cutting, but
in this be ſure to take good obſervation, for if under the skin, all
over there appear little Knobs or Scabs, it is cauſed by ſome
ill uſage or naſty keeping, or elſe Symptoms of the Maunge, that
will in a ſhort time break forth to the full if not prevented.</p>
               <p>Farther, if his Legs be full-fleſhed, fat, or Dropſical, he will in
no wiſe be fit for ſervile Labour; if on the inward bend of his
Knee there be long ſcars, ſeams or ſcabs, the which have not been
occaſioned by the ſwift-cut, they will prove very dangerous for
it denotes a Mallander that in a ſhort time will turn to a Canker or
Ulcer.</p>
               <p>Now let us deſcend to his Paſterns, the firſt of which muſt be
ſure to be cleaner and ſtrongly knit with Sinews or Ligaments, the
ſecond ſtreight, ſtiff and ſmoothly fixed, not more inclinable to
bend one way than another, but not over-long; for it ſhews a weak
Horſe: Or if the former be gouty or ſwelled, it denotes ſtrains
and over-reaching Sinews.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered is the hoof, the which is as
great a piece of Curioſity to be obſerved, as any that belong to
the chuſing a good Horſe, for if that fail, all the other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
avail not.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, a good hoof ſhould be ſmooth of colour; black and
inclining to long, ſomething hollow and full, ſounding; for, take
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33499:18"/>
notice that a white hoof is not ſo good by reaſon of its tenderneſs;
ſo that it is apt either to let the ſhooe draw, or it ſelf to batter or
ſpread, by being in too much wet or hard riding.</p>
               <p>The next is a withered hoof that ſeems to ſcall, or have welts
or ſeams upon it; which denotes the Horſe to be aged or much
worn by hard travel or over-heats; another ſort of hoofs there are
which are called ſhort hoofs, and are ſo brittle, that they will not bear
any ſhooe above a day at the moſt, if rid or laboured; if his hoof be
exceeding round, it is bad for deep and dirty ways, by reaſon the
horſe cannot tread ſure; a flat hoof that is light and full of pores
or holes is a ſign of his being foundred; if you perceive by ſtriking
the hoof a hollow noiſe, or that it be hollow within, it ſignifies
ſome internal defect, and old feſter not cured, that has waſted the
pith, and therefore is not good.</p>
               <p>The next thing obſervable is the Coronet or Socket of the hoof,
the which being well fleſhed, ſmooth, without Chops or Scars,
and well decked with hair, is a ſign of its being in good plight and
ſound; but if the contrary, he is often troubled with ring-worms,
a crown-ſcab, or the like dangerous misfortune.</p>
               <p>Having taken particular notice of the former properties of
goodneſs or defect, remove your ſelf to the right ſide, and then
take eſpecial notice how his head is fixed to his neck; ſee firſt that
it be ſmall at the ſetting on, and ſo by degrees deſcend taper to
his ſhoulders, not thick, but rather broad; and obſerve that his
head ſtand not too high nor too low, with a high, yet thin Creſt,
his Mane declinable, long, ſoft, and a little curling, which are ſigns
of comelineſs; as on the contrary, a thick joult-head, and thick
neck, ſhort and brawny, ſhews much dulneſs and deformity.</p>
               <p>If there be any ſwelling in, or under the nape of the Neck, it
will certainly turn to the Poll-evil or ſome Fiſtula, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as bad if not taken in time.</p>
               <p>Again, to have a thick Neck, and lank or fallen near the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to have a groſs and flat, or ſunk Creſt, are ſigns of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in ſtrength; exceſſive ſtore of hair upon the Mane, eſpecially
if it be ſtreight and hard, ſignifies dulneſs and want of courage;
a thin Mane, that is not made ſo by any accident or diſtemper,
ſhews the horſe to be of a fiery nature; if it fall away, it ſhews ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Itch, Worms, or Mange to lodge there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:33499:19"/>
The next thing worthy to be obſerved, is his Back or Chine,
which muſt be broad, ſtreight, and ſmooth, well meaſured and
even, to which his Ribs muſt be well grafted, firm, and round, his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
or haunches ſtreight, ſtout and ſtrong, nor muſt there be above
three Inches breadth between his fartheſt rib and huckle bone,
that is the neareſt to the ſame, as the ſhort ribs, which are all ſigns
of a perfect and well ſhaped Horſe.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, to take a ſpecial obſervation of the ſhape of
his Body, if it be plump, ſmooth, and contained within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of his ribs, and not hanging over or paunching out; his ſtones
or genitals muſt likewiſe be contained cloſe in their Purſes or
Cods, as it were girt to his Yard, the which ſhews the Horſe to
be of good mettle, well made and free from Diſeaſes in thoſe parts;
but if the contrary, it ſhews him defective and uncomely.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, if he have a narrow back, he will be prone to Saddle-galls,
hurts and bruiſes in riding; to have a ſway-back is a token
of great weakneſs in the Chine, or if his Ribs be very fat and
ſtreight, they in Travel will hinder him from fetching his full
wind, and ſo conſequently make him tire; if now his hinder Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or Fillets be ſlack, hang flabbing and unſeemly, they will be a
great hinderance to him if he travel in ſteep way, and he can by no
means hold any pace up a hill if it be very ſteep, and but very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
in carrying any burthen.</p>
               <p>Again, if his Belly be gant, and ſeems to be cloſe within his
ribs, or near to his back, if his Stones hang down and ſwag about
in the Cods, they are great ſigns of imperfection and uneaſineſs in
the Horſe, cauſed by ſome Diſtemper, and likewiſe he will be apt
to founder.</p>
               <p>The next things to be taken notice of are his Buttocks, they
muſt be ſmooth, round, and even, not ſtanding too high nor too
low, but as near as can be level with his Body; but many chooſe
a long Buttock'd Horſe for riding double or the like, which if they
do, they muſt obſerve that they riſe behind and wear the Dock
ſpread to the ſetting on thereof, which makes a Horſe ſhew well,
and are ſigns of ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Now for the narrow Buttock or ridged rump, they are both
weak and uncomely, and will not conveniently bear any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:33499:19"/>
From which I ſhall deſcend to his Thighs or Hips, firſt obſerve
if they be well brawned, ſinewed, and that they from the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on to the Bow-Joint are made taper, leſſening by degrees,
and be well fleſhed, all which if they be not, ſhews weakneſs and
unaptneſs for ſervice; after which take ſpecial notice of the Hock
or middle Joint, and with your hand feel if it be well knit, full of
Griſtles, Sinews, and Ligaments, that it be not fleſhy nor ſwelled,
and that it have large Veins, be pliant and apt to bend at each mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the horſe, ſomething bowing it muſt be and firm. All
theſe are good ſigns; but if there be cuts, ſcars, or feſters in the
inſide of the Joint or elſe-where, it is dangerous and not eaſie to
be cured.</p>
               <p>If there happen any ſwelling or heat over the Joints in general,
then it is no other but a blow; but obſerve if ſuch ſwelling be only
in one place, and that on the inſide in the hollow of the Joint,
and the Veins ſtrut, feel hot, and beat much, or throb, and that
the ſwelling be ſoft, it is a blood ſpavin; but if brawny and hard,
a bone-ſpavin; but if it chance to be juſt upon the hock or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,
behind or a little under it, then it is or ſhortly will be a
Curb, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now for his hinder-legs, you muſt obſerve whether they be
fine, neat, and clean, full of ſtrong Sinews, and not very fat, which
ſhews him ſound in thoſe parts; but on the contrary, if his legs be
very fat, fleſhy, large, it ſignifies him bad for Service; if they
be tumid or ſwelling, it denotes the ſetlings of molten greaſe
there; if any ſcabs happen to be ſomething above the Paſterns,
they denote the ſcratches or chops; cuts or ſcars beneath them
denote Pains or Aches, all which are dangerous and require great
skill and diligence to cure them.</p>
               <p>Now for the Tail, it cannot ſtand amiſs nor out of place upon
fair Buttocks; but upon an ill pair if it be never ſo well placed, it
will not ſeem handſom; the poſture it ought to ſtand in, is even
with the parting of the Buttocks, that is broad, high, ſmooth and
ſomewhat bending inward, fleſhy and of a good length, briſtly
and curled, the length being not only a beauty, but very neceſſary
for him to defend himſelf with againſt Waſps, Hornets, and Flies,
though many deſire to have him cut-tailed.</p>
               <p>But in general, the whole body muſt be framed according to
the moſt expert Horſemens Opinions, thus to have the head and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33499:20"/>
legs of a Stag, the ears and tail of a Fox, the neck of a Swan, the
breaſt of a Lyon, the Buttocks of a Woman, and the feet of an Aſs.
The perfect good horſe thus <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Georgicks</hi> deſcribes, the
which to inſert may not be amiſs.</p>
               <l>With head advanced high at firſt the Kingly Colt doth pace,</l>
               <l>His tender Limbs aloft he lifts, as well becomes his race.</l>
               <l>And foremoſt ſtill he goes, and through the ſtream he makes his way,</l>
               <l>And ventures firſt the Bridge, no ſudden ſound doth him affray.</l>
               <l>High creſted is his neck, and eke his neck is framed ſmall,</l>
               <l>His belly gaunt, his back is broad, and breaſted big withal.</l>
               <l>The Bay is always counted good, ſo likewiſe is the Grey,</l>
               <l>The White and Yellow worst of all: Beſides if far away</l>
               <l>There haps a noiſe, he ſtamps and quiet cannot reſt,</l>
               <l>But praunces here and there, as if ſome ſpirit him poſſest.</l>
               <l>His ears be ſet upright, and from his Noſe the fiery flame,</l>
               <l>Doth ſeem to come, while as he ſnuffs and ſnorteth at the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Thick is his Mane, and on his right ſide down doth hanging fall,</l>
               <l>And double Chin'd, upon his Loins a gutter runs withal.</l>
               <l>He ſcraping ſtands, and making of deep holes he paws the ground,</l>
               <l>Whilſt that aloud his horned hoof all hollow ſeems to ſound.</l>
               <p>Thus have you all the particular and general deſcriptions both
of a good and bad horſe, and may therefore know what to chooſe
and what to forbear, and note that amongſt all the Creatures ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational,
there is not one more generous nor more ſerviceable to
man than is the horſe; for as we read of <hi>Bucephalas,</hi> the horſe of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that although he was wounded in the Battle
againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſo that his Life was much deſpaired of, yet
would not he ſuffer his Maſter to mount any other horſe till he
had brought him ſafe out of the Battle. The like has been repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of others, whoſe Loves have been ſo great to their Maſters,
that when they have been encloſed with Enemies, the Horſes have
fought in their defence couragiouſly; and <hi>Eumenius</hi> relateth that a
certain Traveller being ſet upon by four Thieves was killed, which
his horſe perceiving, fell upon them with ſuch fury, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge

which you may diſcern a flat, ſmooth, white Sinew, the which
take up with your Cornets Horn point, and twiſt it round about,

pint of the beſt <hi>French</hi> Wine mingled with three ounces of Honey,
let it be indifferent warm, and then keep him as much from cold
as is poſſible, two hours after you may give him a warm Maſh of
Oats and Barley.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Diſcovery of ſeveral Tricks and Cheats uſed by Jockeys.</head>
               <p>1. FIrſt then, to make a dull Jade both kick, wince and fling,
without either Whip or Spur, they uſe this device; in the
fore part of a Saddle made for that purpoſe, they have an Iron
Plate, through which is drilled three holes, through which with
a ſpring come three ſharp wyers, the which as long as the Rider
ſits upright do not prick the Horſe, but when he leans forward
and preſſes the Bow of the Saddle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they torment him ſo that he
capers and dances though never ſo dull, which the ignorant Buyer
often ſuppoſes to proceed from the height of his Mettle, which the
Jockey ſpares not to avouch with Oaths.</p>
               <p>2. The Second is, if any Gentleman have ſet up a Horſe in a
Stable at Livery, the Jockey either by bribing the Hoſtler, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
by taking an opportunity in his abſence, will with a hair
take up the vein on the inſide of the Horſes Leg, or by cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in the Fet-lock with a ſmall Wyer (neither of which can
be obſerved without a curious ſearch) either of which, will cauſe
the Horſe after a quarter of an hours Riding to halt downright
Lame, then is the owner ſent for, whoſe coming the Jockey having
notice of, pretends ſome Buſineſs in the Stable, and whilſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
is admiring the ſudden miſchance befallen his Horſe, he
puts in his verdict, ſaying, it was a great deal of pity that ſo
good a Beaſt ſhould be diſabled, and by degrees inſinuates into the
Gentlemans acquaintance, deſiring him to ſend for a Farrier, who
comes and ſearches his foot, but finds no cauſe of Lameneſs there,
whereupon the Gentleman diſpairing of his recovery is often preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Jockey to ſell him at half the worth, or ſwap him for
ſome dull Jade, that he or ſome of his Comrades have near at hand,
who having got the Gentlemans Horſe, by uncramping or letting
looſe the vein render him as at firſt.</p>
               <p>3. The Third Cheat they put upon Travellers is this, coming
into a Country Inn, their firſt walk is into the Stable, where ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a view of the Horſes, they ſingle out the beſt for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
demanding of the Hoſtler, who that fine Horſe belongs to,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33499:26"/>
who ignorant of any deſign freely tells them; then they place their
Horſes next him, and ſeem only to feed, or rub them down, and
order the Hoſtler to fetch a peck of Oats, the which whilſt he is
gone to do, they thruſt a ſtone about the bigneſs of a Tennis-Ball
into his Fundament, one of which they have always ready, it not
having been in a quarter of an hour before the Horſe begins to ſweat
mightily, and fall a trembling and ſtaring as if his eyes were ready
to ſtart out of his head, ſo that a white foam ſoon after covers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places about him, which the Hoſtler obſerving, runs to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that owns him, and tells him his Horſe is a dying, at which
ſtarting up, he runs to the Stable and finds him in a bad plight, not
knowing what to think, or if he do, conjectures he is poiſoned,
and in a confuſed hurry enquires for a Farrier or Horſe Doctor,
when as Mr. Jockey ſteps in, and asketh what is the matter, as if
he poor lifeleſs fellow knew nothing of it, but quickly underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the buſineſs, begins both to pity the Horſe and Gentleman,
the former for his miſerable condition, and the latter for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>in of loſing his Horſe, when thus he applies himſelf:
Sir, I am ſorry to ſee your Horſe in ſo bad a plight, then puts in to
buy him at a venture, live or die, the which if he cannot do
handſomely, he undertakes to cure him, telling the Gentleman that
though it is not his uſual cuſtom to meddle with, yet he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
for <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhillings to warrant his Life: The Gentleman
conſents rather than to loſe a Horſe worth twenty pounds; then
for a ſhew he gives him a Drench, and then takes opportunity to
withdraw the ſtone, and within half an hours ſpace the Horſe will
be perfectly well, and ſo they fob the Ignorant.</p>
