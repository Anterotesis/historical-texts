            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(whoſe generall ſtemmes have beene in

conſpicuous or ſo admirable, as in the evangelicall

and Saviour. And pitty it were to ſever them in
place, which accord ſo well in nature. Laſtly, I
conſidered, it could no way be harmefull to have
the plaiſter ready before I adventured to lance
the ſore; ſpecially, in that I am likely to ſearch
ſomewhat deeper, than I have found it ſearched
by others. The onely ſore of the humane ſoule,
whoſe ſcarres cannot in this life be perfectly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is ſinne originall, and the wounds thereof are
ſinnes actuall and habituall; the onely medicine
or ſalve for both, is the knowledge of Chriſt and
him crucified: for hee is the onely tree of life,
whoſe leaves are appointed to heale the Nations.</p>

He did beleeve that
Chriſt (the author and finiſher
of our faith) did ſuffer under Pontius Pilate, yet
this beleefe was farre from making him a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.
That which wee Chriſtians are in the firſt
place to beleeve is, that the man Chriſt <hi>Ieſus,</hi>
whom the Iewes by the helpe of <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi>
did crucify, was truely the Sonne of God, his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sonne; ſo truly and indiſſolubly the Sonne of
God, as well as of man, that whileſt this man was
conceived by the holy Ghoſt, the Sonne of God
was likewiſe conceived by the holy Ghoſt;
whileſt this man was borne of a pure Virgin, the
true and onely Sonne of God was borne of the
ſame Virgin; whileſt this man was put to death,
crucified, dead and buried, the Sonne of God was
likewiſe crucified, dead &amp; buried; whilſt this man
Chriſt was raiſed againe from the dead, the true
and onely Sonne of God was ſo rayſed; whileſt
this man aſcended into Heaven, the Sonne of God
aſcended into Heaven; whileſt this man ſitteth
at the right hand of God, and maketh interceſſion
for us, the Sonne of God there ſits and makes the
ſame interceſſion; that when wee expect the ſame
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7898:7"/>
Ieſus,<note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> whom the Iews did crucifie, ſhall come in
viſible manner to judge the quick and the dead,
wee beleeve and expect that the Sonne of God
ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead. Of
the firſt points wee ought to have, at the leaſt, a
true hiſtoricall beleefe. Our beleefe of that article
concerning Chriſts comming to judgement, and
of our reſurrection from the dead, is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall,
than hiſtoricall.</p>
                  <p>2. Is then an hiſtoricall beleefe of Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
birth, death, and reſurrection ſufficient
for us? Sure it is not, unleſſe withall it be ſalvifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
No faith can ſave, unleſſe it be a ſaving faith:
but no faith can be ſalvificall, vnleſſe it be hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
For hee that doth not beleeve the hiſtory of
Chriſts death and paſſion, can have no Chriſtian
faith at all. Now the utmoſt effect whereunto the
endeavours of Gods Seedſmen are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
terminated, is to plant in the hearts of their
hearers a firme perſwaſion of the divine truth of
the ſacred Hiſtories or Prophecies concerning
Chriſt. In reſpect of this perſwaſion they are ſaid
to plant and water, and to be Coworkers with
Gods Spirit. But to make this perſwaſion to bee
ſalvificall, this is the worke of God alone. For
unleſſe hee give this increaſe to what wee plant
and water, all our labours are loſt, our beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
are to no purpoſe. Yet as we are to beleeve,
that without God wee can doe nothing, ſo are
wee bound to hope that in him and by him, wee
may doe all things, or have all things done in us
and for us, which can be needfull or conducent to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7898:7"/>
our Salvation. No if ſuch as are bound to teach,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note>
and ſuch as are bound to learne, would daily
ſeaſon their endeavours, (their prayers eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
with ſerious conſideration of this twofold
truth, wee could have no juſt occaſion either of
doubt or feare, but that if our beleefe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed
Articles of Chriſt were once truly hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,
it would certainely become rightly ſalvifical.

Aſtronomicall or Chronologicall. This whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depends upon the authority of the Hiſtorians.
Yet if by calculations aſtronomicall compared
with the Annales of thoſe times, it ſhould appeare
that there were no ſuch Eclipſes in the yeares
pretended for theſe practices; this would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
theſe hiſtorians, and thoſe whom they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of errour, if not of forgerie. On the other
ſide, if Aſtronomers ſhould make it cleare, that in
the points of time aſſigned by theſe Hiſtorians,
there did fall out ſuch Eclipſes of the Moone,
this would free them from ſuſpition of fiction,
ſo much the more, by how much they were leſſe
skilfull, or leſſe obſervant of the coeleſtiall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or revolutions of times wherein Eclipſes
happen.</p>
                  <p>2. But ſometimes the ſenſible events or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
may ſquare ſo well with hiſtoricall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as to leave no place for curioſity it ſelfe, to
ſuſpect either fiction or falſehood in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.
As who could ſuſpect the truth of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Hiſtories, which mention the ſubjection of
this Iland to their Empire, for divers ſucceſſions;
if he had ſeene their coynes, lately digged out of
the earth, bearing the inſcriptions of twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Emperours. Or who could ſuſpect the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall
truth of their progreſſe into the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
parts of this Kingdome, that have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ruines of that wall which they built, and
other monuments as ſutable to their Narrations,
as the ſeale is to the ſignet. The beſt is, that the
experiments which ſuite unto the hiſtories of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7898:9"/>
old and new Teſtaments, are more plentifull and
and more pregnant, then any externall ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of any other hiſtoricall narrations can be. For
of ſacred hiſtoricall truth, beſides the legible te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of the great book of the creatures, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little world may have a world of witneſſes in
himſelfe. Now if our beliefe of the hiſtories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Chriſt and him crucified, be but equall to
our beliefe of other hiſtories, yet their authority
or eſteeme will be much greater, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe this truth, but we muſt withall believe
it to be divine; and every man by nature hath a
more ſacred eſteeme of matters which hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
to be divine, then hee can have of things
meerely mundane or humane.</p>
                  <p>3. But where the truth of hiſtoricall beleefe is
to our apprehenſion the very ſame, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of our aſſent unto it equall, yet the eſtimate
of the ſame truth or its impreſſion upon our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
is not the ſame. Theſe vary according to
the ſeverall waight of matters related though by
the ſame Author, and beleeved by equall degrees
of the ſame kinde of beleefe. Of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
ſtrange defeate by <hi>Robert de Bruce</hi> King of
Scotland; and of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and the black
<hi>Prince</hi> his ſonne, or <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth their ſucceſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the French, wee have but one and the ſame
hiſtoricall beleefe, whether for degree or quality:
yet are wee not the ſame way, or in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
affected with the one ſtory as with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The reading of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, of <hi>Henry</hi>
the fifts ſucceſſe, delighteth us Engliſh with the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7898:9"/>
ancient honour of our Nation. The remembrance
of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſeconds defeate, doth ſo diſaffect
us, that wee could wiſh this ſtory were not ſo
true, as the other.</p>
                  <p>But how unpleaſant ſoever the annales of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the ſecond be to ſome Engliſh, yet wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
obſerved any of this age to weepe at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of them, whereas in ſome provinces of this
Kingdome, the battaile of <hi>Pannierehugh,</hi> the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
in the North, and that leſſe diſaſter, in the
yeare following that rebellion upon the Engliſh
borders, could not have beene mentioned or ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
related, within our memory, without many
teares of ſuch Auditors, as had no other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the events ſave onely from hiſtories, or
from traditions which can produce no better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
than hiſtoricall.</p>
                  <p>4. Some caſes then there be, in which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the authority of the Hiſtorian be the
ſame, and albeit the matters related by them be
for weight or ſubſtance the ſame, yet ſhall they
not make the ſame impreſſion upon our hearts or
affections. Yea matters (in themſelves conſidered)
of ſmall moment, will ſometimes ſway double as
much as others of more then double waight unto
them, although the hiſtoric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll beleife of both be
equall. The circumſtances from which hiſtoricall
truths of leſſer waight ſimply conſidered, receive
theſe extraordinary degrees of gravitation, are
ſpecially three, <hi>Vicinity of place, Recencie of time,</hi>
and <hi>Peculiar references to our Selves, to our Country,
to our Friends or Allies.</hi> The true reaſon why the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7898:10"/>
hiſtorie of Chriſts death (in ſome degree I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
beleeved by all) doth worke ſo little or ſo
ſucceſſeleſly upon moſt mens affections, is becauſe
they conſider his death, though in it ſelfe a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of greateſt conſequence, yet as a matter paſt
a thouſand and ſome hundred yeares agone, or as
a matter done by the Jewes more then two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
miles from our coaſt. And thus they conſider
it without any peculiar reference to themſelves,
as the cauſe of it; or no more concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
then as they are <hi>Pars quota humani generis,</hi>
ſome little parcells or graines of mankinde or of
the humane nature which he redeemed, theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more innumerable than the ſand on the Sea
ſhore.</p>
                  <p>5. But how firmely ſoever we apprehend the
truth of Chriſts death and paſſion for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
yet this apprehenſion cannot produce a
true compleate hiſtoricall beleife of his death,
unleſſe our apprehenſion of the ſubſtance be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
with the like apprehenſion of ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
as are peculiar to this hiſtory above
others. What circumſtances are theſe? Although
he ſuffered but once, and that farre off and long
agoe; yet whatſoever he then ſuffered or did, doth
as neerely &amp; as immediately concerne every man
this day living in what place ſoever, as it did
thoſe that were living when he dyed, either ſuch
as were ſorrowfull ſpectators of his death, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
in it. For albeit he were offred but once, and
that but in one place (without the gates of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem)
yet this one offering was of value truely
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7898:10"/>
infinite, and for efficacy everlaſting.<note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> And being
ſuch, it muſt be equally applyable to all perſons,
times, and places. In his death, in his infinite and
everlaſting ſacrifice every one hath a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
not <hi>Pro ratâ,</hi> but <hi>in ſolidum:</hi> by vertue of
that atonement which he made, by that redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he purchaſed once for all, he hath an
entire abſolute right of dominion over every one
of us, and every one of us hath as entire an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in his death, as if what ſoever he did or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the daies of his humiliation, he had done
and ſuffered all for us alone. But this laſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
perhaps is more pertinent to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſt and of him Crucified, then unto
the hiſtoricall beliefe of his death or Croſſe.</p>

much more to invite. But that there is a
knowledge of Chriſt even in this life, which if
not for perſpicuity or evidence of truth, yet for
the excellencie of the truths knowne, exceeds all
other knowledge, we have our Apoſtles peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
ſentence for us: For, writing to his Converts
of Corinth, which then abounded with all kinde
of knowledge ſecular, he ſaith, <hi>I eſteemed or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to know nothing amongst you, ſave Ieſus Chriſt
and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. He therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to know nothing beſides, becauſe
he had no other knowledge in any eſteeme, in
compariſon to this. And what good Chriſtian
would deſire any other, but as it is ſubſervient to
this knowledge? This comprehends all that wee
can deſire either to know or to enjoy; all that
wee can eſteeme or love, even eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
it ſelfe, as the author and fountaine of all
happineſſe inſtructs us, John 17. ver. 3. <hi>This is life
eternall, to know thee the onely true God, and Ieſus
Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> But whether our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in this ſpeech or his Apoſtle in the former, do
uſe the word <hi>knowledge</hi> in a ſtrict or in a vulgar
ſenſe, may be queſtioned. And this queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
it ſelfe into another more generall; as, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Theologie, that is, [knowledge of God] be
a ſcience properly ſo called; or whether many
concluſions of faith may bee clearely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated?</p>
                  <p>2. Two ſorts of men there be, who for the
ſupport or ſecuring of their unreaſonable conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
have ſome reaſon to deny this Queene of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7898:12"/>
ſciences, this Miſtreſſe of Arts, and ſupreame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſe
of all good faculties, to be a ſcience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſo called: The Agents for the Romiſh
Church, and their extreame oppoſites, whether
mere Enthuſiaſts, ſuch as deny al uſe of ſcriptures;
or mixt Enthuſiaſts, men that acknowledge the
uſe of Scriptures, but abuſe them more then ſuch
as reject them, by uſing them too much, or to no
good purpoſe, or mingle them with the ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations
of their private ſpirits or wreſt them to
their owne fancies. Firſt, if the concluſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
betwixt us and the Romane Church,
may be one way or other demonſtrated, as either
to be altogether true or altogether falſe, or ſo
ſublime that in this life they cannot be punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or abſolutely determined: then are wee not
abſolutely bound to beleeve every propoſition,
which that Church ſhall commend unto us as a
doctrine of faith, with the ſame confidence, as if
it were expreſly delivered in Scripture, or in the
Articles of our Creed. Nor ſhould every applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
booke or Sermon albeit their bulke or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
conſiſts for the moſt part of Scripture ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
be acknowledged to be that word of God
to which all owe obedience; if once it were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that there is a facultie or ſcience of
Divinitie, which hath the ſame authority to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
or diſprove doctrinall concluſions or their
uſes, which other Arts or ſciences have to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the workes of all pretenders to them. If
Divinity be a ſcience, then he which is a Divine,
or a maſter of his profeſſion, might cenſure the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7898:13"/>
Profeſſors of other Arts, faculties, or ſciences,
which take upon them to reſolve Theologicall
controverſies, or to teach doctrines which the
Church (wherein they live) never avouched, with
the ſelfe ſame libertie, which the Profeſſors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arts uſually doe Divines, if they take upon
them to teach or practiſe within the precincts of
their profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe two ſects of men, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men which cannot be comprehended under
any ſect or faction, but have the ſame temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to deſire that there might be no true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God or of Chriſt, or no demonſtration
of the Spirit; that the Atheiſt or deſperate ſinner
hath to wiſh there were no God, or no Judge of
quick and dead: I cannot conceive, what reaſon
any man or any ſort of men have to deny Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
to be a true and proper ſcience. Yet to give
the ingenuous Reader, if not full ſatisfaction, yet
ſome Hints (at leaſt) whereby hee may ſatisfie
himſelfe, it will be no digreſſion from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
argument, (at leaſt no long digreſſion) briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſhew, wherein that knowledge of God and
of Chriſt, which may in this life be obtained,
doth differ from ſciences properly ſo called, and
wherein they doe agree.</p>
                  <p>Now all the differences or concordance that
can be betwixt any ſciences, Arts or faculties, do
either concerne the Maxims and Principles, or
the <hi>concluſions</hi> and the <hi>ſubjects</hi> of ſuch faculties.</p>
                  <p>3. The Maximes or Principles of all other ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
may be clearely apprehended, and firmely
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7898:13"/>
aſſented unto, by the induſtrious ſearch and light
of common reaſon, without illuminations ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall:
ſo cannot the principles or Maxims of
Divinity; there muſt be a light or illumination
more then naturall, before wee can have either a
cleare and undoubted apprehenſion of their
truth or a juſt valuation of their worth. Yet this
difference is not much materiall, neither part of
it poſitive, or negative, is any way formall or
eſſentiall to the conſtitution of a ſcience proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo called. For by what meanes ſoever the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of any ſcience become manifeſt and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
unto us, whether by our owne induſtry, or
by the teaching of others, or whether wee bee
taught them immediately from God, (either by
the admirable diſpoſition of his extraordinary
Providence, or by ſpeciall infuſed grace) is meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accidentall to the conſtitution or nature of a
ſcience properly ſo called. Hee that ſees the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Mathematicall concluſions from the
uncontrovers'd Maximes of the ſame Art, as
clearely as another doth, is never a whit the leſſe
skilfull Mathematitian, although perhaps he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Principles by the helpe of an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
teacher, which the other attained unto by
the induſtrious exerciſe of his owne wit. Now if
it be meerely accidentall to the nature of a ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
whether a man be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
his owne Maſter or anothers Scholar (whether
in learning the principles or concluſions:) it can
be no prejudice either to his knowledge, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
in ſuch knowledge, that he hath beene

                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, immediatly taught by God, at leaſt for
the Maximes. And I make no queſtion but that
the principles of ſome other ſciences beſids Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
(at leaſt ſome principles of ſuch ſciences) have
beene immediately taught by God: Or, if any
man liſt to move queſtion or Controverſie about
this truth, I could entertaine many Heathen Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
for my opinion without any great
coſts or paines.</p>
                  <p>4. But as it is true that the principles of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
cannot be knowne without illuminations
more then naturall: ſo it is certaine, that ſince the
ceaſing of extraordinary illuminations or gifts of
the Spirit, the moſt of ſuch principles, (or ſo many
of them as are required to the ſcience or facultie
of Divinity) cannot be diſtinctly knowne without
the knowledge of other Arts or Sciences. Moſt
of the Attributes of God cannot be well unfolded
without competent skill in Metaphyſicall lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Many of his workes can never be knowne
nor admired aright without the ſcience of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy;
nor can the offices or Attributes of Chriſt
be taught aright, without more skill in the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
tongues, then common Grammarians or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Lexicons will afford. He that hopeth to
attaine to the true knowledge of theſe principles,
muſt either uſe the helpe of ſome Lexicon pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to divinity, or make one of his owne. Eaſier
it were to learne the termes of Law or Phyſick,
out of <hi>Thomaſius</hi> or <hi>Riders</hi> Dictionary, then to
know the true Theologicall uſe or meaning of
many principall termes in the Old or New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,

though both of them moſt excellent writers
in their kinde. And yet after a man hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by all the meanes aforementioned, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like helpes of Arts, unto a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the principles; there is no leſſe uſe of
good Logick in divinitie, then in any other ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
whatſoever, for the right deduction of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
concluſions from ſuch principles, or for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
Heterodoxall doctrines, or quelling imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
or frivolous queſtions. But the Principles
of Divinitie being once known, the dilatation or
deduction of them into forme of Art or ſcience,
and the eſtabliſhment of Orthodoxall concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
may be made as certaine and perſpicuous by
Logick, as the like can be in any other ſcience.
For the uſe not of uſuall or vulgar, but of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Logick, is in no Art ſo neceſſary as in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
The method for conſtituting any Art or ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from principles knowne is two-fold, the one
direct and poſitive, by affirmative ſyllogiſmes or
by demonſtration <hi>à Priore;</hi> the other by reducing
concluſions contradictory <hi>ad impoſsible,</hi> that is,
by diſcovering their manifeſt contradiction or
irreconcileable oppoſition unto ſome fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
principles of the ſame ſcience. Now what
concluſions or opinions they be in particular,
which contradict either thoſe theologicall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that concerne the nature and attributes of
God; or the perſonall union of two natures in
Chriſt, his Propheticall, Sacerdotall, or Royall

Divinitie and other Sciences, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay whether the faculty of Divinitie come
ſhort of other Sciences properly ſo called: or
rather exceed them in that wherein they differ.
The difference is this. The totall ſubject of other
Sciences, (of ſome at leaſt) may be exactly known
in this life; though not by any one man, yet by
all that may ſeeke after it. But this ſubject of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie
can never be exactly knowne by any one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7898:16"/>
man, nor by any ſucceſſion of men, though all of
them ſhould ſtudy no other Art, beſides the
knowledge of God &amp; of Chriſt, untill the worlds
end. From this incomprehenſible amplitude of
its ſubject it is, that many principall points in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie,
points neceſſarie unto ſalvation, muſt be
beleeved only, even by Divines themſelves; wee
may not endeavour or hope to know them, untill
wee be admitted into that everlaſting Schoole.
And it is a great part of our profeſſion, or of our
proficiency in it,<note place="margin">Vide Ruge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionibus.</note> to know what queſtions belong
to this preſent inferiour Schoole; and what they
be which muſt be reſerved unto the high Schoole
Everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>3. But other true Sciences there be, and in
their kinde truly Noble, (whoſe juſt challenge
unto both theſe titles no man gaineſayes, no man
queſtioneth) which have their peculiar problemes
as well as unqueſtionable principles or concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is not yet reſolved by Geometricians,
whether the Quadrature of Circles be poſſible, or
whether the continued protraction of lines not
parallel make their coincidence neceſſary. Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
are not yet agreed whether there be ſo
many ſeverall Orbes, as there be Planets, or how
many ſpheares above the Planets, or whether
theſe Orbes or Spheares, (be they few or more)
be concentrique. It is controverſed whether not
the Planets only, but thoſe which we call fixed
ſtarres doe move in the firmament, as fiſhes doe
in the water, or as Eagles ſoare in the aire, or
whether the whole firmament from the Region
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7898:16"/>
wherein the fixed ſtarres doe move, unto this
lower region of the aire wherein we breath, be at
all times ſo uniforme for the tranſmiſſion of light,
or for the true repreſentation of the exact di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
whether of the altitude or latitude of the
ſtarres from us, as at ſometimes it is, or as glaſſe
or the cleare aire is with us. This laſt <hi>Quaere</hi> were

or preſumed Notions concerning <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
trepidationis,</hi> that is, of the ſuppoſed recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
motion of thoſe which they call fixed ſtarres
from South to North, from North to South.
Great expences without hope either of gaine or
of recovering the principall ſpent in trying Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall
concluſions by many in the former age,
will not to this day give ſatisfaction to ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Naturaliſts, whether the converſion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
metalls or materialls into Gold be atchieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Many like problemes there be in other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ſciences which will never be fully reſolved
untill wee ſhall not need their reſolution. Yet
were the number of inſoluble problemes in every
one of theſe ſciences mentioned, or in all that can
be mentioned, much greater then it is, this could
be no prejudice to them, ſo long as the deduction
of many uſefull concluſions from cleare undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
principles may be made evident to men which
have their wit and ſenſes exerciſed in ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
That the number then of inſoluble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes
is in Divinitie much greater then in any
other facultie, this only argues the ſubject of it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7898:17"/>
to be more admirable then the ſubjects of other
faculties. In other faculties or ſciences wee are
bound to give our abſolute aſſent to no more
principles or concluſions then are cleare and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
But in Divinitie we muſt abſolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
many concluſions which we cannot hope
in this life abſolutely to know, or that they
ſhould be made evident unto us. For we muſt
beleeve the finall judgement with the joyes of
the life to come, which no man can know till he
enjoy them: and we muſt beleeve the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
paines ordained for the Devill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
which no man hopes ever to know. Many
matters of fact likewiſe there be related by the
Prophets, Evangeliſts, &amp; other ſacred writers, of
which there can be no ungaineſayable proofe or
demonſtration, no other ground or reaſon of our
aſſent unto them, beſides the authoritie of the
Relator. Howbeit no man can rightly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſuch authoritie, as may command his aſſent
without further proofe, unleſſe there be better
grounds or motives, then the bare propoſall or
aſſertion of the Author. That we are thus bound
to beleeve many ſacred truthes which cannot in
this life poſſibly be knowne, doth no way argue
our beleefe of them to be leſſe rationall, then our
aſſent unto other truthes which may be proved
by reaſon; but rather ſuppoſeth that the true hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall
beleefe of Relations ſacred doth paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
the truth or evidences of ſciences properly ſo
called. No evidence of any ſcience doth ſo farre
exceed true hiſtoricall beleefe of matters ſacred,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7898:17"/>
as it doth all hiſtoricall beleefe of matters ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
and it incomparably exceeds all other hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
beleefe, not only in reſpect of the worth or
juſt eſtimate of matters related, but even for the
rationall evidence of the abſtract or ſpeculative
truth. What eſteeme ſoever we make of <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons</hi>
ſtories, this participates no authoritie, no
credit to <hi>Plutarch</hi> or other Graecian writers of
later times. We may give deſerved credit to <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
to <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and yet iuſtly ſuſpect <hi>Herodotus</hi>
&amp; <hi>Livie</hi> in many particulars. All the credit which
ſecular hiſtorians that live in or write of ſeverall
ages, can expect of us, muſt grow from their
owne rootes. The conſent of many writers in
ſeverall ages may ſerve to underprop a generall
or common truth, which happily would decline
or fall, if it were ſupported by the credit of one
alone. But naturall propagation of truth, from
one ſecular hiſtorian to another, is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
And without ſuch propagation, ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
may be made to our beleefe of one by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
others, but there can be no true growth or
augmentation of our beleefe of matters ſecular,
by comparing divers Hiſtorians. Farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is in the right hiſtoricall beleefe of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſacred.</p>
                  <p>4. The ſeed of Divine myſteries, which are
ſowne in Moſaicall writings, ſhoot out their bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the enſuing hiſtorians the Prophets, and
beare flower and fruit in the Evangelicall ſtories.
So that he that rightly beleeves the truth of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall
hiſtories, cannot diſtruſt the Prophets: or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7898:18"/>
ſuſpect the Evangeliſts in their relations. This is
a truth ſuppoſed by the Author of Truth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
<hi>Had yee beleeved Moſes, you would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
me: For he wrote of me.</hi> Joh. 5. 46. that is,
Chriſt was if not the ſole ſubject, yet the onely
ſcope of Moſes his writings. Now to beleeve the
hiſtories of Moſes or matters related by him,
we have inducements many, no leſſe binding
then the experiments or inductions which
winne, and tie our aſſent unto the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Arts or Sciences. Theſe inducements are
partly from the viſible booke of the Creatures,
partly from the eſtate of the Jewes ſufficiently
known to all Nations from time to time. Of theſe
inducements ſomewhat hath beene ſaid in the
firſt booke of theſe Comments; ſomewhat like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the Treatiſe of Creation. Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of that moſt exact harmonie between
Moſaicall or Propheticall delineations of Chriſt,
and that liue image of him, which the Evangeliſts
by his Spirit have exhibited unto our view, is no
leſſe rationall, then the contemplation of conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
betweene the Principles of other Sciences
and their concluſions. The progreſſe in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the Harmony betwixt the ſeverall
paſſages of ſacred ſtories, is not the ſame that is
betweene Mathematicall principles or Theorems
and their concluſions. The point then next to be
enquired, is, how the myſteries concerning Chriſt
and his Kingdome, which have been revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in the new Teſtament, were delivered by
Moſes, by the Prophets; or other Canonicall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                  <p>2. All the predictions, which wee have in that

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7898:20"/>
they cannot be literally avouched of any

out of their madneſſe they might ſet up a King,
and cry and ſhout before him: yet have they had
no Sion, nor Jeruſalem, wherunto they could have
brought him for theſe fifteene hundred yeares
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7898:20"/>
and more, nor have they beene permitted to
come neere the place where it ſtood with any
other than counterfeit joy, being enforced for
many generations, to purchaſe the priviledge or
liberty of howling over the ruines of that Sion
and Ieruſalem, unto which their expected Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
by the purport of the former prophecie was
to come, at a farre higher rate, then they had
bought the delivery of Him into their power.</p>
                  <p>4. That the comming of their King unto that

or challenge the name of a Prophet from the
truth of ſuch predictions, were more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to prove the party ſo peccant to be a falſe
Prophet.</p>
                  <p>Beſides thoſe predictions which are common
to all men whileſt they have the ordinary gift of
memory, diſcretion, or vnderſtanding: there be
predictions peculiar to ſeverall Arts or Faculties,
which come ſomewhat neerer to the nature of
Prophecies properly ſo called, but (well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
fall further ſhort of them, then they goe
beyond the former preſages or predictions of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
wiſe or diſcreet men.</p>
                  <p>2. A man of ordinary ſkill in Aſtronomy, able
by his owne or others ſkill to foretell the ſet
times of the Eclipſes, whether in the Sunne or
Moone, might eaſily gaine the reputation of a
Prophet or a Southſayer amongſt barbarous illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat
people: yet no civill Nation will account
men thus farre ſkilfull to be extraordinarily lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
much leſſe for coeleſtiall Prophets. <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
or <hi>Galen</hi> (ſo they had bin diſpoſed to play the
Mountebanks) might have gotten a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
amongſt the vulgar, or their Patients, then
they had of themſelves or their owne ſkill: for
both of them could and did diſcover the nature
of ſuch diſeaſes and alterations enſuing in mens
bodies, as the wiſeſt men then living, but not ſo
good Phyſitians as they were, could not gueſſe
at aright, much leſſe diſtinctly foreſee. Yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7898:22"/>
of theſe two famous Phyſitians (for ought I
can learne) did take upon them to interpret the
aſpects or motions of the Starres after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as many meaner Phyſitians ſince their time
have done. So farre were they from challenging
the name or title of Prophets or Southſayers, that
they did not take upon them to foretell, what
the ſecret motions or diſpoſitions of their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
bodies, whether alive or dead, did preſage
either to private men, or to publique States. Yet
to foretell ſtrange events to come, by obſerving
the alterations in mens living bodies, or by the
Anatomy of them dead; is in any reaſonable
conſtruction more congruous and facile, then to
foretell the ſucceſſe of warre or politique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
by anatomizing dead brutiſh Creatures, or
by inſpection of their intralls. This later ſkill
many in times paſt amongſt the Heathens have
profeſſed, and have had the reputation of Augures
or Southſayers.</p>
                  <p>But albeit their predictions in this ſubject
might for the moſt part prove true (which I doe
not beleeve) yet all this was not ſufficient to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
the juſt title of Prophets or Diviners: it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
argues ſome deeper inſight in ominous fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings
or portendments, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
had in medicinall preſages, above ordinary
men. That there may be a peculiar ſkill or dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
of conjecture concerning the peculiar
ſignes of times, whether by interpretation of
dreames, of prodigies of Comets, or the like, is
a point not worth the debating in Divinity. That
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7898:22"/>
this ſkill (were it granted to be much greater
then the Profeſſors of it in what kinde ſoever
arrogate unto themſelves) doth amount to the
nature of a true Prophecie or divination properly
ſo called, all true Divines muſt deny.</p>
                  <p>3. That ſkilfull Phyſitians may truly preſage
the certaine iſſue of ſome diſeaſes ſetled or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as of the life and death of their Patients,
farre beyond the capacity of vulgars, and to the
admiration of men otherwiſe more learned then
themſelves; is not doubted by any man of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
But all wherein they exceed others
not ſkilled in Phyſick, is this; that their art and
experience enables them to diſcerne the working
or firſt projects of cauſes Phyſicall, or ſeminall
Originalls of alterations in mens bodies, much
ſooner and with more dexterity, then men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſkill or experience in their art can doe. But
ſo a well experienced, though illiterate Gardiner,
will diſtinguiſh ſeverall hearbs or ſimples at the
firſt peeping out of the mold wherein they were
hid, much better then a meere contemplative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
(which hath pored oftner and longer upon
<hi>Mathiolus, Dioſcorides,</hi> or other Herbaliſts, then
the moſt induſtrious Gardiner hath done on his
plots) ſhall be able to diſtinguiſh them after a
moneths growth. Yet will not the cunningeſt
Gardiner, though a contemplatiue Herbaliſt
withall, take upon him to tell what ſeedes have
beene ſowne by another of his profeſſion ſo long
as they lie hid in the ground. Nor will the moſt
ſkilfull Phyſitian (unleſſe conceipt of his ſkill
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7898:23"/>
farre exceede his wit or underſtanding) adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to foretell what diſeaſes in particular ſhall
befall men for the preſent in perfect health, for
any one or more of the next ſeaven yeares to
come. Aſtrologers (for ought I can ſay againſt
their profeſſion) may truly foretell or give a
happy gueſſe at ſuch events as uſually follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the apparition of Comets. But I never heard
of any Aſtrologer that could prognoſticate, at
what time, in what degree of altitude, longitude,
or latitude, any Comet (before its appearance)
ſhould be ſeene, neither whether there ſhould
be any Comets at all the next five yeares to
come; much leſſe, if any appeare, what courſe it
ſhall obſerve. I dare not deny all artificiall or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall
ſkill in the interpretation of dreams,
but none of this profeſſion (I preſume) will be
ſo bold to foretell what his Neighbour ſhall
dreame of in the ſeverall nights of the next
moneth, or to recall his dreames to minde if
happily hee have forgotten them. There was
more true Divinity in that briefe reply of the
Chaldean Aſtrologers, or ſuppoſed Diviners, unto
<hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> unreaſonable demand <hi>Dan. 2.
v.</hi> 10. then in all their profeſſed Art of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>The Chaldeans ſpake to the King O King live
for ever: tell thy ſervants the dreame, and wee will
ſhew the interpretation. The King anſwered and ſaid

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7898:23"/>
before the King and ſaid; There is not a man
upon the Earth that can ſhew the Kings matters:
Therefore there is no King, Lord, nor Ruler, that asked
ſuch things at any Magitian, Aſtrologer, or Chaldean.
And it is a rare thing that the King requireth, and
there is none other that can ſhew it before the King,
except the Gods whoſe dwelling is not with fleſh.</hi>
Dan. 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 5, 10, 11. In this laſt clauſe onely
they failed. For that God which revealed <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars</hi>
dreame, and the interpretation
thereof unto <hi>Daniel</hi> was to be <hi>God with us,</hi> to
have his dwelling in our fleſh.</p>
                  <p>4 However, they knew by light of nature and
of reaſon, that it was but one and the ſame ſkill
to tell or retrive matters of this nature paſt, that
is, whereof they had no hint or notice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from their owne ſenſes, or from Hiſtorie
or tradition; and to foretell things contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
or not determined in their comprehenſible
cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Now to foretell things of this nature, any <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
that falls not out by the conſtant and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
courſe of nature; or which hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on any viſible cauſe already attempting
its effect (though ſo ſecretly as none but a perfect
Artiſt can diſcover the project) is that kinde of
prediction, which only deſerves the title of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,
or Divination properly ſo called, and is
not communicable to any creature, ſave onely by
participation of the divine ſpirit. All ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
muſt be derived from ſome revelation
immediatly made by God himſelfe unto ſome
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7898:24"/>
one or other of his creatures, from whom the
reſt receive it, either by writing or by tradition.
This Topicke of Divinitie, the Lord himſelfe
immediatly taught the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Cap. 41.
ver. 21. Produce your cauſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord,) <hi>bring
forth your ſtrong reaſons, ſaith the King of Iacob. Let
them bring forth and ſhew us what ſhall happen: Let
them ſhew the former things what they be, that wee
may conſider them, and know the latter end of them, or
declare us things for to come. Shew the things that
are to come hereafter, that wee may know that yee are
Gods.</hi> This caſe comes home againſt all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
divinations given by Oracles, by the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
heathen Gods, and their Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
So doth that other, <hi>Iſa.</hi> the 47. 5, 6, 7. fully
reach all pretended Aſtrologicall divinations of
contingents future.</p>
                  <p>5. Yet all the predictions concerning Chriſt,
in the writing of <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets, are of
this rank and nature, which God himſelfe denies
could be foreſeene or foretold either by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Heathen Gods or by Aſtrologers. Now this
principle being once granted, [That all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
concerning Chriſt alleaged by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,
were uttered many yeares before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of their accompliſhment by them] no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
man can denie, that the firſt revealer of
them was God himſelfe, who calleth things that
are not as if they were, and foretelleth things to
come, as if they were already paſt. Many things
foretold by the Prophets concerning the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the ſonne of God, his birth, his death,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7898:24"/>
and paſſion, reſurrection, &amp;c. demonſtratively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
a creative or Omnipotent power, from
whom they received this ſpirit of divination.
Many againe, (beſides the ſuppoſall of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
power) manifeſtly argue a wiſedome
truly infinite. Of the deduction of both theſe
attributes from propheticall divinations, of legall
or other typicall praefigurations of Chriſt and his
Kingdome, hereafter (by Gods aſſiſtance:) as the
expoſition of types or Prophecies, or of both, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>That predictions of this rank and nature, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

for their Author, was a common prenotion
amongſt the Heathen, amongſt the Latines eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
in whoſe language the faculty of foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

inſpire theſe Propheteſſes with their predictions
concerning Chriſt? That many things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7898:25"/>
by theſe Heathen Propheteſſes,<note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> the beſt
amongſt the ancient Chriſtians did beleeve, nor
did the Heathens that lived with them or before
them, queſtion the Authority of the Records
which they alleaged. The onely queſtion then
was, whether their predictions of ſtrange altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to inſue throughout the world, did punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
referre to Chriſt whom the Iewes did cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
or to ſome other Heroick perſon. That theſe
Prophecies were extant for many generations
before the bleſſed Virgin, the mother of Chriſt
(from whom alone he tooke his bodily ſubſtance)
was borne or conceived, no literate Chriſtian or
Heathen did ever queſtion. Yet upon her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
to have foretold, that ſhee ſhould conceive
and bring forth ſuch a ſonne as ſhould likewiſe
be the ſonne of God, the great Redeemer of the
world, did farre ſurpaſſe all Aſtrologians ſkill, or
any other <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> which cannot finally be
reſolved into the ſpirit of the onely wiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
God, as into their firſt Author or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
                  <p>2. But many great Divines, many good Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
and Critiques of beſt note in theſe latter
times (which would be accounted the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
move queſtion, whether all, or moſt, or any
competent part of thoſe verſes, which now goe
under the name of <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles, be the very
ſame either for matter or forme, with the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Records, which, it is granted by all, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
long before our Saviours comming into the
world? Or whether moſt paſſages in theſe now
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7898:26"/>
extant have not beene compoſed by Chriſtians
deſirous to make a ſupplement unto ſome frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the true Originalls, which had beene
loſt? To induce this ſuſpition or opinion, that
the volume of Oracles now extant, is but a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious
brood of later times, it is plauſibly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged
by good Writers, that thus much muſt be
granted, or elſe wee muſt grant (which may
ſeeme worſe) that thoſe myſteries of Chriſt and
his Kingdome which we Chriſtians beleeve, were
more expreſly revealed unto the Heathen by
theſe ſuppoſed propheteſſes, then they were to
the Iewes, Gods choſen people, either by <hi>Moſes</hi>
or the Prophets. For ſuch is the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of theſe Sibylline predictions, as now wee
have them, that they may rather ſeeme to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egeticall
explications of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets,
then originall Prophecies, which are for the moſt
part aenigmaticall or parabolicall.</p>
                  <p>2. All the arguments notwithſtanding which
can be drawne from this or the like Topique, are
more plauſible then pregnant, and (well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
conclude <hi>aut nihil, aut nimium.</hi> Which way
ſoever they be drawne or made to looke, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they doe not reach home to the point in
queſtion, or elſe they overreach, or fall awry of
it; none of them doe punctually fall upon it. For
no Chriſtian or Heathen Writer whether ancient
or moderne, hath hitherto made queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the fourth Eclogue of <hi>Virgil,</hi> were penned
by this Heathen Poet, or compoſed by ſome
which lived after our Saviours death, in favour
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7898:26"/>
of the Chriſtians. Now if wee had the <hi>notes</hi> of
that plaine ſong (on which this Prince of latine
Poets runnes ſuch curious <hi>deſcant)</hi> in the very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
wherein <hi>Sibylla Cumaea</hi> left it, (for Virgil,
as he himſelfe profeſſeth, was but a Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
upon this one, among many other heathen
Propheteſſes intitled to this name of Sibyll:) I do
not ſee, nor can I conjecture, what paſſages in
the old teſtament doe more literally and plainely
expreſſe the ſacred myſteries concerning Chriſt
and his Kingdome, which the Evangeliſts have
unfolded unto us, then that one Sibylla did, on
whoſe writings Virgil comments in lofty and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
verſe.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>The Law and Prophets</hi> (ſaith our Saviour)
<hi>continued unto Iohn the Baptiſt.</hi> His meaning is not
that the matter of thoſe writings did then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
or determine; or that the writings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſhould then become <hi>obſolete</hi> or out of uſe:
But rather, that John ſhould take the lampes
which they had lighted and deliver them to ſuch
as were to purſue the ſame courſe, which hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the law and Prophets had undertaken. Hee
was <hi>Lucerna ardens &amp; lucens,</hi> a bright and a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Lampe, to enlighten ſuch as lived with him
or came after him to follow his ſteps with zeale
and devotion towards <hi>him,</hi> whom he did uſher
into the world. As Johns entrance upon his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was a kinde of period to the Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
after which there was a new <hi>Epocha,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of times to follow: ſo there was to be
a determination of Sibylls Oracles about that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7898:27"/>
time wherein Virgil wrote that fourth Eglogue,
<hi>Vltima Cumaei venit jam carminis aetas.</hi> Virgil did
groſſely erre in the perſon or party of whom this
prophecy of Sibyll was literally meant, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the intention of the ſpirit of divination,
by which it was firſt conceived: and erre he did,
though not ſo groſſely, in the circumſtances of
the time wherein it was to be accompliſhed. But
theſe two errors and other circumſtances being
pardoned, the ſubſtance of his diſcourſe, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcant
upon <hi>Sibylla Cumaea's</hi> verſes, is Orthodoxall,
and ſuch as concludently argues the text, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he Comments, to have beene originally more
then humane, truly divine.</p>
                  <p>4. For however wee have learned long agoe,
that all the gratious promiſes made by God unto
the ancient Iſraelites, for continuation of the
Aaronicall Prieſthood and other like preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
peculiar to that Nation under the ſtyle or
tenure of <hi>Legnolam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> for ever, were to determine
at the revelation of their long expected Meſſias:
and although many Chriſtian writers well verſed
in Hebrew Antiquaries, aſſuredly informe us, this
was an unqueſtionable tradition amongſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Hebrew Rabbins, though now denied: yet
no writer either Jewiſh or Chriſtain give me ſo
full ſatisfaction in this point, as Virgil in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Eglogue doth. For after he had ſaid, <hi>Vltima
Cumaei venit jam carminis aetas,</hi> He addeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
<hi>Magnus ab integro ſaeclorum naſcitur ordo.</hi>
This implies, that as there was then an end of
that age or world wherein <hi>Sibylla Cumaea</hi> lived, ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7898:27"/>
there was another age or world to begin at the
accompliſhment of her prophecy, which was to
have no period, but to be as we ſay, <hi>Saecula Saecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi>
a world of worlds, or a world without end.
Such wee Chriſtians beleeve the Kingdome of
Chriſt to be, which was to take its beginning here
on earth at the accompliſhments of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
concerning his reſurrection and exaltation.
With his Croſſe or humiliation <hi>Virgil</hi> meddles
not, having transformed all that <hi>Sibylla</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
of Him, into the ſimilitude of the Romane
Empire as then it ſtood goodly and glorious, and
ſo to continue (as he hoped) with perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of ſtrength and happineſſe. If wee had all
the ſingle threds as <hi>Sibylla</hi> left them, which this
Heathen <hi>Poet</hi> hath twiſted into theſe and the like
<hi>ſtrong lines:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Iam redit &amp; virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna.</l>
                        <l>Iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto:</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Me thinkes they might lead us by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
and gaine way unto a clearer view of
many divine myſteries recorded by ſacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
concerning our Saviours eternall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
incarnation, nativity and propagation of his
Kingdome; then wee can hope to approach unto
by the perplexed Labyrinths of many moderne
Interpreters, of divers Schoolemen, or by any
tradition of the ancient Hebrewes as now they
are extant. But the exact parallel betweene the
undoubted Oracles of Gods Prophets, and ſuch
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7898:28"/>
hints as Virgil deſcants upon, from <hi>Sibylla Cumaea,</hi>
I leave to yonger Academick Divines or Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.
It ſhall ſuffice my preſent purpoſe to adde
ſome one or two more unto the former. The
firſt Revelation concerning Chriſt and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which is extant upon ſacred record, is <hi>That</hi>
Gen. 3. ver. 15. <hi>I will put enmitie</hi> (ſaith God to
the Serpent) <hi>betweene thee and the woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
thy ſeed and her ſeed. It ſhall bruiſe thy head,
and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> That this womans
ſeed was to be a man, all that beleeved the truth
of Moſes writings, did know: but that he was to
be the ſonne of a pure virgin, was more (as is moſt
probable) then our Mother Evah, more then the
father and mother of <hi>Noah</hi> at the birth of their
firſt borne, did apprehend, and perhaps more
then ſome Prophets and many godly men after
them, did explicitely beleeve. Yet of this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that <hi>Sibylla,</hi> whom <hi>Virgil</hi> followes, had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
a prenotion, though transformed by <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
into Poeticall fictions of Aſtraea. For it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Iam redit &amp; virgo &amp;c.</hi> he meant her returne
unto the Earth. The accompliſhment of that firſt
prophecy Gen. 3. ver. 15. by our Saviours victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gotten over Satan upon the Croſſe, was firſt
declared by himſelfe after his reſurrection to his
Diſciples, Marke 16. 17, 18. <hi>And theſe ſignes ſhall
follow them that beleeve. In my name ſhall they caſt
out Devills, they ſhall ſpeake with new tongues: they
ſhall take up Serpents, and if they drinke any deadly
thing, it ſhall not hurt them, &amp;c.</hi> Of all this the
Heathen <hi>Sibylla</hi> had a prenotion, expreſſed by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7898:28"/>
Virgil in few, yet pithy words:

of theſe and the like divine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
unto the heathen, to have beene
ſo perſpicuous as the Sibylline Oracles
(whether thoſe which now are extant, or thoſe
which Virgil did comment upon) doe exhibit;
ſhall wee not hereby contradict the Pſalmiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouchment
of Gods ſpeciall favour to his peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
people, <hi>Pſalme 147. 19, 20. Hee ſheweth his
words unto Iacob: his Statutes and his Iudgements
unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation: and
as for his judgements, they have not knowne them.</hi>
For how can it rightly be conceived, that hee
ſhould deale better with Jacob or Iſrael, then
with any other people, if it bee granted that the
Romanes or other Nations, which were, if not
by Gods command yet by his permiſſion depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of the Sibylline Oracles, had in them as
perſpicuous teſtimonies or revelations of Chriſt,
as Jacob and Iſrael had either in the Law or in the

of Gods gracious dealing with any Nation, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or State, muſt be taken from the ſeverall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

in all ſuch as having juſt title, make right
claime unto them.</p>
                  <p>2. The Pſalmiſt himſelfe (from whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
this objection is borowed) affords a faire hint
for a right anſwer unto it. Hee doth not ſay, that
God ſheweth his word unto Jacob alone; or that
no other Nation beſides Iſrael had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his word, or prenotion of the word which
was to be made fleſh. Wherein then did he deale
better with Iſrael, then with any other Nation?
In ſhewing his ſtatutes and judgements unto that
Nation alone. For albeit the Revelations made
unto the Sibylls (if now wee had the undoubted
originalls) might be more perſpicuous than any
prophecy in the old Teſtament; or admitting
they had been delivered in the ſelfe-ſame words
which God did ſpeak to Moſes and the Prophets:
this would not inferre that the ancient Heathens
had as good meanes of knowing Chriſt as Iſrael
had, or that the manner of ſhewing his words
unto both was (as the words are ſuppoſed to bee)
altogether the ſame. The ſtatutes and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7898:30"/>
which he had given unto Iſrael only were
given unto this purpoſe, that the words which he
had ſpoken by Moſes and the Prophets, might
make more legible impreſſion in their hearts. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many ſtatutes and judgements peculiar
unto Iſrael, theſe were principall and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
that the words which God had ſpoken by
Moſes and the Prophets, ſhould bee publiquely
read, often inculcated, and expounded unto them:
that all his viſitations of this people, whether in
mercy whileſt they obeyed his voice, or in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their diſobedience; ſhould be regiſtred,
to remaine upon record as ſo many ruled caſes or
Preſidents.</p>
                  <p>3. To have the myſteries of ſalvation howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
revealed is a great bleſſing to any Nation.
But it is not one and the ſame bleſſing to have the
wayes of life perſpicuous in themſelves, and to
have them made perſpicuous unto this or that
age or party. This later bleſſing even thoſe, to
whom theſe Sibylline Oracles were imparted,
did want. And want it they did through their
owne default, in that they made no better uſe of
theſe particular prophecies, then they had done
of the common booke of nature. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20, 21.
The Lord of heaven and earth was good and
gratious unto many Heathens in diſpenſing or
ſuffering theſe or the like Crummes to fall unto
them from his childrens table: yet not ſo grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to them as he was to his children, in that hee
gave them no lawes and ordinances for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of theſe myſteries, or for obſerving the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7898:30"/>
times wherein they were to be fulfilled. Nor had
theſe Heathens the grace or goodneſſe in them
to enact publique Lawes for this purpoſe: but
like that ungracious ſervant in the Goſpell, they
held it a point of wiſdome to impriſon theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
talents in their <hi>Archives,</hi> not to be looked
upon, but upon occaſion of ſtate.</p>
                  <p>4. But ſuppoſe the Heathens had beene as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
admoniſhed by God himſelfe, or as
ſtrictly enjoyned by Lawes of their owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
to acquaint poſterity with the Sibylline
Oracles, as the Iſraelites were to inſtruct their
children in Gods word delivered by <hi>Moſes;</hi>
would this have made the meaning of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
in themſelves (as is ſuppoſed) moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous,
either more perſpicuous or more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
to ſucceeding generations then they were?
God knowes that. But the dayly experience of
this age, of this yeare current, and of ſome few
late paſt, will not ſuffer us not to know, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
plenty either of ſpirituall food, or of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
in themſelves moſt divine, though dayly
adminiſtred, doth not alwaies <hi>de facto</hi> purifie the
hearts of Chriſtians from Heatheniſh humours or
diſeaſes. What then is wanting, where ſpirituall
meate and medicines doe ſo abound? A want
there is, firſt of ſevere diſcipline to teach Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
themſelves, how to diſpence the food or
Phyſick of life aright. Secondly, a greater want
there is of coercive Lawes (or of the execution
of them) for binding our patients to a right po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
or diet, whileſt they are under our cure.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7898:31"/>
The lowd out-crying ſinnes of theſe times awake
the thoughts of all that are not dead in ſinne: and
the oftner it is thought upon, the more it will be
lamented by every honeſt heart, That God the
Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, that Chriſt who
is God and man, our gracious Lord and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
ſhould be more traduced, and more groſly
miſtransformed through liberty of prophecying
(as they terme it) amongſt us Chriſtians, then
they have beene in any age before amongſt
Turks or Heathens, which have died in their
ſinnes for want of prophecying. But as for Iſrael
of old they wanted no lawes or diſcipline for
theſe or the like good purpoſes; and prophecies
they had in abundance: Onely they were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to themſelves in not exerciſing the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
in not executing the lawes which God had
given them. And unto this defect they added an
exceſſe of traditions contrary to the lawes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them by God, and extreamely oppoſite
to wholſome diſcipline or doctrine.</p>
                  <p>5. But ſuch Iewiſh traditions as were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the Law of God, how prejudiciall ſoever
they were unto their ſoules which firſt invented
or followed them, doe not prejudice us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
(of this age) halfe ſo much as the loſſe of ſome
Iewiſh traditions or rules for interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which had beene conſtantly received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the ancient Hebrew <hi>Rabbins,</hi> but rejected
by the later Iewiſh Maſters. And it would be a
worke in it ſelfe, worthy any one mans labours
or works of this life, to retrieve the footſteps or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7898:31"/>
progreſſe of the ancient Rabbins, whereof ſome
ſcattered prints here and there, may be obſerved
in ancient Writers. That ſuch rules there were
conſtantly received in the time of our Saviours
converſation here on earth, (though now either
wilfully concealed, or through ignorance not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by later Iewiſh Rabbins) is hence
apparent, in that the mouthes of moderne Jewes
are wideſt open to bark againſt our interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe paſſages of Moſaicall and Propheticall
writings, whoſe bare allegation whether made
by our Saviour himſelfe, or by his diſciples after
his reſurrection, did ſtop the mouthes of thoſe
cruell dogges which ſought their lives. What
theſe rules or traditions were in particular, is not
of facile conjecture, nay almoſt impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
This generall notwithſtanding is moſt
certaine, that God did ſhew the incarnation,

whatſoever Iſrael was to beleeve concerning the

Chriſtians concerning Jeſus Chriſt and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,

literally and expreſly aſſertive; but withall by
ſignes of the time, by hiſtoricall events, by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of fact, by rites and ceremonies, by types and
ſhadowes. By all theſe wayes God did ſpeake or
declare his purpoſe. For as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith,
That <hi>the Heavens declare the glory of God, that dayes
and nights have their words ſo loud and ſhrill, that
their ſound goes throughout all the world,</hi> Pſal. 19.
ſo likewiſe ſignes and wonders are ſaid to have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7898:32"/>
their voyces. <hi>And it ſhall be</hi> (ſaith God to Moſes,
Exod. 4. 8.) <hi>that if they will not beleeve thee, nor
hearken to the voyce of the firſt ſigne</hi> (which was the
reciprocall converſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> rod into a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent)
<hi>yet they will beleeve the voice of the latter
ſigne;</hi> and that was the ſmiting of <hi>Moſes</hi> his hand
with leproſie as white as ſnow, and reſtoring it to
perfect ſound fleſh againe. If ſignes and wonders
have their voices, then God doth ſpeake unto us
by them, as well as by his audible, and written
word, but even where his writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word is for the
ſenſe moſt plaine, the matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in it have

event, whereto no expreſſe prophecie, no aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
notation of him, or application unto him
who was to come, is annexed. And herein the
wiſdome of God appeares moſt admirable, that
the contents of every Article in the Apoſtles
Creed, were reſpectively foreſhadowed by ſome
one or other of theſe wayes mentioned, and ſome
of them by all. The manner of his conception
was clearely prefigured (for ſubſtantially repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it could not be) by the conception of <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and of <hi>Samuel.</hi> And that Generation
wherein hee was conceived and borne, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
warned to obſerue theſe three prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

(as then to be accompliſhed,) by the
ſtrange conception of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> His cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
with the myſteries implied in it, or
ſubſequent unto it, were fore-ſhadowed in the
covenant eſtabliſhed betweene God and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
in the Circumciſion of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Of his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
(though that be not expreſſed in our Creed)
the waſhing of the high Prieſts body in the day
of atonement was a type. Of his leading into
the wilderneſſe, (upon the ſame day) to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Satan, the ceremony of the ſcape Goate
was a true prognoſtique. Of his appearing in
the forme of a Servant, and of his performance
of all the duties, which can be required from a
ſervant in the moſt exquiſite manner that can be
imagined, holy <hi>Iob</hi> was more then a type, a living
ſhadow. Of all his trobles and deliverance
from them, his Father <hi>David</hi> was a live example.
Of his depreſſion by his envious and malicious
brethren, and of his exaltation by the immediat
hand of God, the hiſtory of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
exhibits an illuſtrious image. Of his death
upon the Croſſe, and the glorious victory obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereby over Satan, the brazen Serpent ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, was a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Hieroglyphick. His incloſure three dayes
and three nights in the womb of the Earth, and
his reſurrection from the grave, were portended
by the impriſonment of <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Whales bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by his deliverance thence. And of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
in particular, the offring of the firſt
fruites in the feaſt of unleavened bread, from the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7898:33"/>
firſt inſtitution of that ſolemnity, was an annuall
ſigne or token. Of this coeleſtiall Kingdome of
peace, <hi>Salomons</hi> glory and peaceable raigne here
on Earth, was an exquiſite map. Of his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
into Heaven the tranſlations of <hi>Enoch</hi> and
<hi>Elias</hi> were undoubted pledges. The Eternity of
his perſon and everlaſting duration of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
were exquiſitely fore-ſhadowed, the one
by the perſon, the other by the Prieſthood of
<hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> The full view and contemplation
of theſe and the like types, and the examination
of their congruity with the live body, to wit,
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom in ſome part or other every one of
them did fore-picture, wee muſt referre unto the
explication of the ſeverall Articles in this Creed,
whereunto they do reſpectively appertaine.</p>
                  <p>2. The rule or Topick for demonſtrating the
truth of every Article by theſe &amp; the like types,
is the ſame with that fore-mentioned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chapters concerning teſtimonies meerely
propheticall, or predictions of future events as
yet not extant in any cauſes viſible or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
by art. To draw an exact picture of a
childe as yet unborne, or whoſe parents at this
time are not conceived, is a ſkill as impoſſible for
any Painter or Limmer to attaine, as it is for an
Aſtrologicall Phyſitian to deſcribe the nature,
complexion, or diſpoſition of men that ſhall have
no actuall being or exiſtence till hee be dead.
Now Chriſts acts and offices, his humiliation and
exaltation, were not more exactly fore-deſcribed
or diſplayed by the Prophets, then they were
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7898:34"/>
fore-pictured or fore-ſhadowed by Hiſtoricall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
or legall types. Every ſuch type or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
was a reall or ſubſtantiall, though a ſilent
Prophecie; and the moſt expreſſe prophecie
concerning Chriſt, was but a ſpeaking type or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſhadow. The ſpirit of God did ſpeake by the
one, and ſignifie his purpoſe by the other: his
wiſdome in both is alike admirable. The moſt
exquiſite Artiſt living cannot take ſo true a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of a mans face, as it ſelfe without any
art or invention, will draw in a true glaſſe: yet
this wee admire not becauſe it is ordinary. But
to make as perfect a reſemblance of a mans vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
by a chaos of <hi>Chymaera's,</hi> or painted devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which repreſent no viſible creature, if you
looke upon them ſingle, or tranſmit their ſhapes
into a plaine glaſſe, might well ſeeme an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſurpaſſing all ſkill of Art, if a late Artiſt had
not given us an ocular demonſtration of this
ſkill, in thus repreſenting the perfect viſage of
that great and famous Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth
of France: however there be no reſemblance of
any humane face, or of any part thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the painted Baſe; yet the reflection of
ſuch incondite figures, or confuſed fancies as are
thereon painted, falling upon a Columne of braſſe
or Bell mettle glazed with latten, placed in the
centre or point aſſigned in the plaine table by
the Author of this invention, doth effigiate this
great Princes viſage and countenance as perfectly
as any picture, which hath beene taken of him in
his life time. The ſkill in this deviſe is ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7898:34"/>
as it would require but a very little ſkill in
Rhetorick to perſwade an illiterate man which
hath ſeene him living, that his Ghoſt were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
(though inviſible to by ſtanders) looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelfe in this artificiall viſible glaſſe: yet all
this ſkill exhibited in this maſterpiece of modern
inventions, how admirable ſoever it may ſeeme
to men not exerciſed in the like, is comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to accurate Artiſts in this kinde, and can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
no true illuſtration of the incomprehenſible
wiſedome of God, in forepicturing Chriſt with
his Acts and offices. Of this incomprehenſible
wiſedome wee have a better model by adding
this ſuppoſition or fiction to the former inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that an hundred picture-makers or more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had free libertie one after another, to draw
their lines and poſtures upon the ſame table (none
of them acquainting another with his intention
or worke) ſhould have framed ſuch a true repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,
as this now extant is, of <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth French King, in the age before he was
borne. But after a more admirable manner, then
this fiction ſuppoſeth, were Chriſt and his Croſſe,
&amp;c. forepictured by matters of fact, by hiſtoricall
events; by types and ceremonies, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
with theſe of mens free actions &amp; inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which knew not one another, much leſſe
had notice of their purpoſes, the laſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> living

                  <p>For the right apprehenſion or imblazoning
theſe meerely typicall repreſentations of Chriſt,
no artificiall ſkill is more uſefull then the true Art
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7898:35"/>
of Heraldy or ſkill in Hieroglyphicks. And no

And this kinde of teſtimonie or prenotion of

there was betwixt theſe two expreſſions,
not only in the order or placing of the words,
but in the matter alſo thus tranſplaced, was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
before, Chapter 5.—Whereſoever the
type hath precedence, or is concomitant to the
inſcription annext unto it, yet ſo as both point at
Chriſt to come: there the teſtimony or proofe is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7898:35"/>
typicall propheticall.<note place="margin">Cap. 11</note> Where the words or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
have precedence of the type, and both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
unto Chriſt; the proofe or prenotion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
typicall. That the ceremony of the
paſchall Lambe was inſtituted by God himſelfe
to prefigure or forepicture our Saviour Chriſt, no
Chriſtian denies. And one Law concerning the
Paſchall Lambe was, that <hi>not a bone thereof ſhould
be broken.</hi> Exod. 12. 46. The words of this Law
were no prediction in reſpect of the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the paſſeover, but an appendix or conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant;
and yet a moſt remarkable prophecie in
reſpect of our Saviour Chriſt, in the manner of
whole death both the type and the Law of the
type were, by Gods admirable providence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
fulfilled. <hi>Then came the ſoldiers,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. John
<hi>and brake the legs of the firſt, and of the other which
was crucified with him: But when they came to Ieſus,
and ſaw that he was dead already, they brake not his
legges, but one of the ſoldiers with a ſpeare pierced his
ſide.</hi> That our Apoſtle Saint John did take both
theſe events as a concludent proofe, that Chriſt
was the true Lambe of God foreſhadowed by the
Paſchall, is apparent from his emphaticall expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion
of his obſervation upon it. <hi>He that ſaw it
bare record, and his record is true, and he kneweth
that he ſaith true, that hee might beleeve. For theſe
things were done, that the ſcripture ſhould be fulfilled;
A bone of him ſhall not be broken.</hi> And againe, Zach.
12. 10. <hi>They ſhall looke on him whom they have peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</hi>
John 19. 32. 37.</p>
                  <p>2. Thoſe words of the Prophet Hoſea cap. 11. 1.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7898:36"/>
according to their literall ſenſe, referre to an
hiſtoricall event forepaſt; <hi>When Iſrael was a child
then I loved him, and I called my ſonne out of Egypt.</hi>
They beare no ſemblance of prophecy in reſpect
of the Iſraelites deliverance out of Egypt by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
but both this deliverance &amp; the prophets ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
upon it, have a peculiar aſpect unto
Chriſt, who was by divine appointment to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journe
a while in Egypt, but to be called thence.
So as the ſame words which are an hiſtoricall nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in reſpect of the type (to wit, Iſrael, or the
ſonnes of Jacob brought out of Egypt by Moſes:)
are an expreſſe prophecy of Chriſts comming
thence, with Joſeph and his mother, into the
Land of promiſe. That ſpeech of the Pſalmiſt
likewiſe Pſal. 118. 22. <hi>The ſtone which the builders
refuſed, is become the head ſtone of the Corner;</hi> doth
allude or referre unto ſome hiſtoricall event then
freſh in memory. They containe no prophecy
in reſpect of the event, whatſoever that were, yet
are they a moſt true concludent Prophecie of
Chriſts exaltation by his father, after his rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Prieſts and Elders. So our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
it Matth. 21. 42. All theſe three teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
mentioned, conſiſting both of word and
matter of fact, are firſt typicall, then propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
But oftentimes the ſame words (though not
alwayes according to the ſame ſenſe,) are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
as well in reſpect of the type as of the
antitype, and then the proofe or teſtimony is
prophetically typicall or meerely typicall from
their firſt date, and afterwards in proceſſe of time
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7898:36"/>
both typicall and propheticall. Of this ranke is
that prediction made to David, 2 Sam. 7. 12, 13.
&amp;c. <hi>And when thy dayes be fulfilled, and thou ſhalt
ſleepe with thy fathers, I will ſet up thy ſeed after thee,
which ſhall proceed out of thy bowells, and I will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
his Kingdome: He ſhall build an houſe for my
name, and I will eſtabliſh the throne of his Kingdome
for ever. I will be his Father, and he ſhall be my ſon;
if he commit iniquity I will chaſten him with the rod
of men, and with the ſtripes of the children of men,
but my mercy ſhall not depart away from him, as I
tooke it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. And
thy houſe &amp; thy Kingdom ſhal be eſtabliſhed for ever
before thee: thy throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever.</hi> Of
the ſame rank and order is that repetition of this
promiſe Pſal. 89. from ver. 20. to the 37. Both
places conteine an expreſſe prophecie of Gods
favour unto David and to his poſterity, and both
include the prerogative of Salomon above all
Kings that had gone before him. And yet, in as
much as Salomon in the height of his glory was
but a ſhadow or picture (though a faire one) of
the ſonne of God, who was to be made the ſonne
of David likewiſe: the ſame words which were
undoubtedly verifyed of Salomon in his time,
were afterwards exactly fulfilled in Chriſt, who
was the living perſon or ſubſtance whom Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
did forepicture. No Chriſtian can, no Jew
will deny theſe words of the Prophet Iſaiah cap.
22. 20, 21, 22. &amp;c. to be propheticall in the firſt
place of Eliakims advancement to be chiefe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
or high Steward over the houſe of David in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7898:37"/>
Shebna's ſteed. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that
day, that I will call my ſervant Eliakim the ſonne of
Hilkiah: And I will cloth him with thy robe, and
ſtrengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy
government into his hand, and he ſhall be a Father to
the Inhabitants of Ieruſalem &amp; to the houſe of Iudah:
And the key of the houſe of David will I lay upon his
ſhoulders: ſo he ſhall open and none ſhall ſhut, and hee
ſhall ſhut and none ſhall open. And I will faſten him
as a naile in a ſure place, and he ſhall be for a glorious
throne to his Fathers houſe. And they ſhall hang upon
him all the glory of his fathers houſe, &amp;c.</hi> But in as
much as <hi>Eliakim</hi> both by name and office did but
prefigure or delineate Chriſt in his acts and office,
the ſame words which were literally meant of
<hi>Eliakim,</hi> are in a more exquiſite ſenſe fulfilled in
Chriſt. But of the ſeverall ſenſes of Scriptures
and how the Scriptures are ſaid according to
theſe ſeverall ſenſes to be fulfilled, ſomewhat in
the two next chapters following.</p>
                  <p>Theſe proofes or teſtimonies whereof we now
treat, whether typically propheticall, or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
typicall are in number many, and of all the
reſt moſt concludent to Readers but ordinarily
obſervant. For they containe the intire force

by chance, but that the Citie or Palace had beene
built by his directions, which made the model,
or by ſome others which made uſe of his ſkill, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
no handy-workman imployed in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
albeit none but the Architect, or generall
director, did perceive as much. Thus all hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
events related in the new teſtament concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Chriſt his birth, his death, and paſſion, &amp;c.
have their exact Maps or Models drawne in the
hiſtory of the old teſtament, beſides the expreſſe
propheticall inſcriptions, which inſtruct us how
to referre or compare every part of the legall or
hiſtoricall model unto the Evangelicall aedifice
anſwering to it. This to every obſervant Reader
is a concludent proofe, that one and the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
did both forecaſt the models, and in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of time accompliſh the worke it ſelfe, to
wit, the building up of Sion and Jeruſalem, though
this he effected (as maſter builders in like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
doe) by the hands of inferiour workmen, not
acquainted nor comprehenſive of his project or
contrivances.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Every houſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle Heb. 3. 4.)
<hi>is builded by ſome man, but he that built all things, is
God.</hi> This power of God by which he made all
things, even the materialls of all things whereon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7898:38"/>
men doe work, doth not farther exceed the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of other builders, then the wiſedome of the
ſame God, which is manifeſted in the aedifice of
the heavenly temple, doth ſurpaſſe all ſkill or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of the moſt ſkilfull Architects or Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.
For whatſoever is by them forecaſt or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
doth never proſper, never come to any
perfection, unleſſe the workemen imployed by
them follow their rules or directions. But this
greateſt worke of God; the erection or edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Church, did then goe beſt forward,
when the workmen or builders imployed about
it, did forſake his counſell, and followed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of his malitious adverſary, who ſought
the confuſion both of it and them. He built up
the Kingdome of Sion and Jeruſalem in peace
without let or interruption, even whileſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
builders deſigned by him did lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or chiefe corner ſtone of it, in blood. And
after it was ſo laid, did accompliſh whatſoever
he would have done in this great worke, by the
hands of ſuch workemen, as did nothing leſſe,
then what he would have had them to do. Though
Judas, one of the twelve, by Satans ſuggeſtion
did betray his Lord, though the high Prieſt and
Elders became the Devills agents to condemne
him, and though Pilate (laſtly) turned Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie
to ſentence him to death: yet all theſe did
that which the moſt wiſe, moſt righteous and
moſt mercifull God had fore-determined to be
done. <hi>Thoſe things</hi> (ſaith Peter Acts 3. 18.) <hi>which
God before had ſhewed by the mouth of all his Prophets,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7898:38"/>
that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, hee hath ſo fulfilled.</hi> Yet
ſaith S. Paul Acts 13. 27. <hi>They that dwell at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
and their rulers, becauſe they knew him not, nor
yet the voice of the Prophets, which are read every
Sabboth day, they have fulfilled them in condemning
him.</hi> So then God is ſaid to fulfill all things which
were written of Chriſt, becauſe he did order and
direct all the counterplots and malicious intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his enemies according to the models and
inſcriptions which had been exhibited in the old
teſtament. <hi>Iudas</hi> his treachery againſt his Lord
and Maſter, with its accurſed ſucceſſe, was exactly
forepictured by <hi>Achitophels</hi> treaſon againſt <hi>David.</hi>
The malice of the high Prieſt and elders was
foretold and forepictured by the like proceeding
of their predeceſſors againſt Jeremie, and other
of Gods Prophets, which were Chriſts forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and types and ſhadowes of his perſequuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They then fulfilled the Scriptures in doing
the ſame things that their predeceſſors had done
(but in a worſe manner and degree) albeit they
had no intention or ayme to worke according to
thoſe models which their predeceſſors had fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
nor to doe that unto Chriſt which the
Prophets had foretold ſhould be done unto him:
For ſo S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 3. 17. <hi>Now</hi> (Brethren) <hi>I wote
that through ignorance yee did it, as did alſo your
Rulers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. But here I muſt requeſt all ſuch as reade
theſe and the like paſſages of Scriptures, not to
make any other inferences or conſtructions of
the holy Ghoſts language or manner of ſpeech,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7898:39"/>
then ſuch as they naturally import, and ſuch as
are congruous to the rule of faith. If wee ſay no
more then this, <hi>God did order or direct the avarice
of Iudas, the malice of the high Prieſt, the popularity
of Herod, and ambition of Pilat, for accompliſhing of
that which he had fore-determined concerning Chriſt,</hi>
wee ſhall retaine the <hi>forme of wholſome doctrine.</hi>
In thus ſpeaking and thinking, wee think and
ſpeake as the Spirit teacheth vs. But if any ſhall
ſay or think, that God did ordaine either <hi>Iudas</hi>
to be covetous, or the high Prieſts to be malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilat</hi> to be popular and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
to this end and purpoſe that they might
(reſpectively) be the betrayers and murtherers
of the ſonne of God; this is dangerous. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall
truth, and wholſome forme of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it, in this and the like point, is acutely ſet
downe in that diſtinction, which (for ought I
find) was unanimouſly embraced by the Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
and by all at this day that be moderate, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be true, <hi>Deus ordinavit lapſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Adami: non
ordinavit ut Adamus laberetur.</hi> God did diſpoſe
or order <hi>Adams</hi> fall (for by his all-ſeeing provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and all ruling power, he turn'd his fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his owne and our greater good:) but he did
not decree, ordaine, or order that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould
fall, or commit that tranſgreſſion by which hee
fell. For ſo hee ſhould have beene the Author
both of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſinne, and of all the ſinnes
which are neceſſarily derived to us from him.
For no man (I think) will denie, that God is the
ſole Author of all his owne ordinances and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7898:39"/>
or of whatſoever hee hath fore-decreed or
fore-determined us for to doe.</p>

as to know the true ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them intended by the holy

more ſenſes intended by the holy Spirit, than
one; or whether in ſome ſenſe or other, every
paſſage in <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, in the Prophets, in the

either immediatly, or mediatly at Chriſt, or at <hi>Him</hi>

by the Evangeliſt out of the old Teſtament,
to prove that Jeſus, whom the Jewes did crucifie,
was their expected Meſſias; admit more ſenſes,
I take as granted. The queſtion is, how many
ſenſes either the places alledged by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
or Apoſtles, or other paſſages in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
may <hi>reſpectively</hi> admit. And in this
<hi>Quaere</hi> I will not be contentious, but onely crave
that liberty which I willingly grant to others in
all like caſes, that is, to make mine owne diviſion,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7898:40"/>
and to follow mine owne expreſſions of every
ſeverall ſenſe or branch of this diviſion, that ſo I
may referre the particular explication of every
type, of every Prophecie, or other praenotion of
Chriſt, which hath beene fulfilled, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
or confuſion, to its proper or generall
head. That ſenſe of Scripture, in my expreſſion,
may happily be referred unto the literall, which
in ſome other mens language would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
figurative or Allegoricall. That ſenſe againe
(according to my diviſion) may be reduced unto
the literall, myſticall, or morall, which ſome
great Divines make a diſtinct ſenſe from all theſe,
to wit, Anagogicall. Or admitting all theſe and
more ſenſes of Scriptures, I may perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
touch upon another ſenſe, which is not (to
my apprehenſion) reducible to any of theſe.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſeverall ſenſes of Scriptures (eſpecially
ſuch as more immediatly point at Chriſt) cannot
be better notified, or more commodiouſly redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to their ſeverall heads, then by a review of
the ſeverall wayes, by which God from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
did intimate or manifeſt his will, his
good will towards mankinde, in <hi>him</hi> and through
<hi>him</hi> which was to come. And the wayes, by
which God did manifeſt Chriſt to come, were in
the generall two; either by words aſſertive, and
expreſſe prediction, or by way of picture and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,
or by a concurrence of both: which
third way is no way oppoſite to the two former,
but rather a friendly combination of them. The
ſecond branch of this diviſion, to wit, praenoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7898:40"/>
of Chriſt repreſentative, may (as heretofore
it hath beene) be ſubdivided into repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
reall, as by type, hiſtoricall event, or other
matter of fact; or into repreſentations meerely
literall, verball, or nominall. The firſt generall
branch of this diviſion, (that is, prenotions of
Chriſt delivered in words expreſly aſſertive) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
to us that which wee commonly call the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
or grammaticall ſenſe. For that (as beſt
Divines agree) is the literall ſenſe or meaning of
the holy Spirit, which is immediatly ſignified by
words aſſertive, whether legall, propheticall, or
hiſtoricall, without any intercourſe or interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any type or matter of fact. Whether the
words be logicall &amp; proper, allegoricall, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
figurative, ſkills not much. The variety
of expreſſions by words aſſertive, if ſo the words
immediatly expreſſe the matter foretold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intervention of type, or matter of fact, doth
not divide or diverſifie the literall ſenſe. As
when God foretold that <hi>the wilderneſſe ſhould be
planted with pleaſant trees,</hi> Iſa 41. 19, &amp;c. <hi>That the
Wolfe ſhould dwell with the Lamb, that the Leopard
ſhould lye downe with the Kid, and the Calfe and the
young Lion, and the Fatling together.</hi> The forme
of ſpeech is figurative, and (in the language of
ſaecular Rhetoritians) Allegoricall. And ſo that
other of the Vineyard, <hi>Iſay</hi> 5 is parabolically fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative.
And yet the ſenſe of all theſe places
is in the Schoole of Divinity as truly literall, as
when it is ſaid, <hi>The womans ſeed ſhall bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
head;</hi> or that <hi>in Abrahams ſeed all the Nations
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7898:41"/>
of the earth ſhould be bleſſed.</hi> For by the trees
wherewith the wilderneſſe was to be planted, by
the Wolfe, and by the Lamb, by the Leopard and
the Kid, &amp;c. divers ſorts of men were immediatly
meant: and to the fulfilling of all, or any of the
prophecies, it was not required that there ſhould
be a transformation either of men into trees,
Leopards, Wolfes, or Lions, &amp;c. or of theſe or like
creatures into men. For how ever the ſenſe of
Scripture in all theſe places be literall; yet it is
literally Allegoricall. And of the literall or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball
Allegory, that Maxime is moſt true, <hi>Senſus
allegoricus non eſt argumentativus, No firme argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be drawne from the allegoricall, parabolicall,
or other figurative ſignification of words.</hi> As wee
may not inferre that the wilderneſſe was to be
planted with trees, or that the Wolfe and the
Lamb, the Leopard and the Kid, were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
as well together on dry land, as ſometimes
they did in <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, whileſt the deluge laſted,
before theſe prophecies could be fulfilled, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the literall ſenſe; as this ſenſe in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the holy Ghoſt, is oppoſed unto the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall:
For that in the Apoſtles language is
ſaid to be ſpoken allegorically, which is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
foretold or ſignified by words (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proper or figurative) but fore-ſhadowed by
ſome reall event, by mens perſons or their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or by matter of type or fact. <hi>It is written</hi>
(ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 4. 22, 23.) that Abraham
had two ſonnes, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a
free woman: but he who was of the bondwoman, was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7898:41"/>
borne after the fleſh: but hee of the free woman was
by promiſe. Which things are an Allegory, for theſe
are the two covenants.</hi> The Evangelicall myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
implied in this Allegory, and vnfolded by
our Apoſtle, were not immediatly notified by
any words or propoſition in the hiſtory of <hi>Sarah</hi>
and <hi>Hagar,</hi> and their ſonnes, but onely fore-pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by matter of fact, or by the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which the words, according to the literall
ſenſe, did immediatly fore-ſignifie. For the
word <hi>Hagar</hi> did in that ſtory literally ſignifie <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi>
handmayd or bondwoman. But this bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
and her ſonne, and their eſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life did excellently repreſent the eſtate
and condition of ſuch as did adhere unto the Law
after the Goſpell was proclaimed. And the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
with the happy eſtate of ſuch as imbrace it,
was not fore-ſignified by the name <hi>Sarah,</hi> or by
the name <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but by their eſtate and condition
who were ſo named. Moſt of our Apoſtles Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
throughout the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes
are drawne, not from the literall, but from the
allegoricall ſenſe. Yet God forbid that wee
ſhould ſay or think, that his arguments did not
conclude. I ſhould rather ſay (if it be lawfull to
compare ſacred teſtimonies or authorities, one
with another) that Arguments drawne from the
Allegoricall ſenſe of Scriptures are moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
if not moſt firmely, concludent. For they
are Arguments of proportion, and preſuppoſe
foure termes at the leaſt either <hi>expreſſed</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,</hi>
And the Allegoricall ſenſe of Scriptures
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7898:42"/>
alwayes includes the myſticall, though the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
doth not alwaies include the allegoricall. For
whereſoever any Evangelicall myſtery was fore-ſhadowed
by any type, by any hiſtoricall event
or matter of fact, there is a latent myſticall ſenſe,
though not expreſſed by words or letters.</p>
                  <p>3. But it oftentimes ſo falls out, and (as I take
it) alwayes in teſtimonies either typically pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall,
or prophetically typicall, that there is
an inſeparable concurrence or combination of
the literall and myſticall ſenſe, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
after the ſame manner. Sometimes the
literall ſenſe, according to the ſame propriety or
ſignification of words, doth fit the Antitype or
body as well as the type or ſhadow. As whether
wee apply that ſpeech, <hi>Exod. 12. 46. Yee ſhall not
breake a bone thereof,</hi> unto the paſchall Lamb, or
to Chriſt, who was myſtically fore-ſhadowed by
it: the literall ſenſe is the very ſame, there is no
variety in the ſignification of the words. Chriſt
had as true bones as the Paſchall Lamb, and the
preſervation of his bones was literally fore-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
in the Law concerning the Paſchall
Lamb, but withall myſtically fore-pictured by
the obſervance or practiſe of that law. Sometimes
againe the literall ſenſe doth better befit the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype,
then the type. As thoſe words fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>2. Sam. 7. 14. I will be his Father, and hee
ſhall be my ſonne:</hi> are more proper in reſpect of
Chriſt who was the Antitype, then of <hi>Salomon</hi>
who was the type or ſhadow of his Sonne-ſhip.
So that our Saviours incarnation or nativity is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7898:42"/>
collaterally foreprophecyed with the nativity of
<hi>Salomon;</hi> and his royall office and favour with
God, myſtically foreſignified by Salomons perſon
and office.</p>
                  <p>4. But many times the expreſſions of the holy
Ghoſt (as well in teſtimonies typically propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
as prophetically typicall) are like inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or mottoes in Impreſes or Emblemes. Now
theſe Inſcriptions beſides the plaine literall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſenſe of the words, have a further Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
importance, or morall ſignification. No man
that ſees that deviſe of bulruſhes couched in a
ſwelling ſtreame, with this inſcription, <hi>flectimur,
non frangimur undis:</hi> but will acknowledge, the
plaine literal ſenſe to point immediately at them.
Yet beſides this literall ſenſe, they have this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall
importance (partly implyed in the words
themſelves, and partly repreſented by the <hi>body</hi> of
the deviſe,) that he which gave this deviſe, had

wherein they grow, when the flood (unto whoſe
violence for a while they yeelded) hath ſpent its
ſtrength. That forecited ſaying of the Pſalmiſt,
Pſal. 118. 22. <hi>[The ſtone which the builders refuſed,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7898:43"/>
is become the head ſtone in the corner. This is the
Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes:]</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the literall ſenſe, is terminated to an
hiſtoricall event, then preſent or freſh in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And, if we may relie upon the authority of
the Author of the Scholaſtick Hiſtory, the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
event or matter of fact to which theſe words
literally and immediately referre, was a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſtone for which the builders of the Temple
could finde no convenient place in the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
ſtructure, which yet unexpectedly proved
the fitteſt corner ſtone or <hi>finiſher</hi> that they could
have deſired. This ſaith he was even then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
not to fall out by meer chance or without
ſome further portending meaning or ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The exceptions taken againſt this tradition
avouched by this Author <hi>Petrus Comeſtor,</hi> are (to
men acquainted with the manner of ſacred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of things to come,) ſo weake that they
adde ſtrength unto it. But whatſoever the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
event were, at which theſe words in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
ſenſe immediately point, wee Chriſtians
know, that in the Symbolicall or ſpirituall ſenſe
they referre to Chriſt. His exaltation unto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
and glory, after the chiefe Rulers of the
Temple had caſt him aſide and rejected him, as
not fit to be entertained amongſt Gods people,
was myſtically foreſhadowed by that matter of
fact or hiſtoricall event, whereof the Pſalmiſt
ſpeakes (whatſoever that were:) yet not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foretold according to the direct literall ſenſe of
his words, but onely ſignified according to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7898:43"/>
Symbolicall importance. After the ſame manner
the forecited words of the Prophet Iſa. 22. 23.
<hi>[The key of the houſe of David will I lay upon his
ſhoulder: ſo he ſhall open and none ſhall ſhut, and hee
ſhall ſhut and none ſhall open:]</hi> doe in their literall
and native ſenſe immediately point at <hi>Eliakim,</hi> of
whoſe office in the houſe of <hi>David</hi> a materiall
and viſible key was the enſigne or pledge, as the
like is of ſome great offices in moderne Princes
Courts. But according to the emblematicall or
ſymbolicall importance, both <hi>key</hi> and <hi>office,</hi> both
inſcription and matter of fact, referre unto the
ſpirituall inviſible power of the ſonne of <hi>David,
Who hath the keyes of Hell and of death Rev.</hi> 1. The
keyes likewiſe of the Kingdome of Heaven; and
where he openeth, no power in heaven or earth
can ſhut, nor open where he is pleaſed to ſhut.</p>
                  <p>That which ſome call the morall ſenſe of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is alwayes reducible to this generall branch
laſt mentioned, to wit, to the emblematicall or
ſymbolicall importance of the words expreſſed,
as they concurre with matter of fact or reall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation.
Only there may be a morall ſenſe,
where there is no prophecy, no repreſentation
truly myſticall. As when it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt
not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe, which treadeth out
the Corne:</hi> this law was to be obſerved according
to the plaine literall ſenſe. And yet both the law
it ſelfe, and its obſervance from the firſt date of
the letter, had that morall, which the Apoſtle
makes, <hi>That ſuch as ſerve at the Altar, ſhould live
by the Altar.</hi>

5. To this branch likewiſe belong all the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
of legall ceremonies, which doe not
immediately point at Chriſt, in whom they were
exactly fulfilled, but at morall duties to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as well by us Chriſtians, as by the ancient
Jews. <hi>Chriſt our Paſſeover</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.
5. 7, 8.) it ſacrificed for us. Therefore let us keepe
the feaſt; not with old leaven, neither with the leaven
of malice and wickedneſſe: but with the unleavened
bread of ſincerity and truth.</hi> This was the true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of that legall obſervance of the feaſt of unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
bread, which was to be kept according to
the ſtrict letter of the law, whileſt the law of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
was in force. Concerning this ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
or morall ſenſe (eſpecially when it is not
propheticall,) <hi>Maldonats</hi> adviſe is very good;
He that will ſearch after ſuch ſenſes, muſt hold
cloſe to the letter: <hi>Propiùs mihi Rupertus videtur
in quaerendo morali ſenſu ad literalem acceſsiſſe; quod
ſemper faciendum eſſe ei, qui ridiculus eſſe nolit, ſaepe
monumus.</hi> And of allegoricall, myſticall or ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall
ſenſes, which are propheticall or prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
none are current or concludent, but ſuch
as hold exact proportion with the ſenſe hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</p>
                  <p>6. Some good Divines there be, which would
have an anagogicall ſenſe diſtinct from all theſe
mentioned. The Allegoricall, Spirituall, or My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
ſenſe is by them limited to matters already
accompliſhed in the Goſpell; whereas the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogicall
reacheth to matters of the world to
come. But this difference in the ſubject or time
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7898:44"/>
unto which whether words or matters ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
makes no formall difference in the ſenſe or
manner of the prediction or prefiguration. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is in Scripture foreſignified or intimated
concerning the ſtate and condition of the life to
come, is either literally foretold by expreſſe
words, or myſtically foreſhadowed by matter of
fact, or notified by ſome concurrence of predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and repreſentation; and ſo may be reduced to
one or other of the ſenſes mentioned, either to
the meere literall, or to the meerely myſticall, or
to the literally or ſymbolically myſticall or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

doe want the ſingular number. In this caſe alone
they doe not extend the ſignification of the verb

                  <p>2. I am the more inclined to this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
many of the ancient and moſt orthodoxall
writers obſerve a more diſtinct expreſſion of the
bleſſed <hi>Trinity</hi> throughout divers places of the
firſt chapter of Geneſis, from the repetition of
the name of God or <hi>Elohim</hi> in the more perfect
workes of ſeverall dayes; as in the workes of the
fourth day ver. 14. <hi>And God ſaid, Let there be lights
in the firmament of the Heavens.</hi> This is the voice
of God the Father giving out his <hi>fiat,</hi> and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
againe ver. 16. <hi>And God made two great
lights.</hi> This referres to God the Sonne by whom
all things were made, and by whom theſe lights
were ſet in the firmament ver. 17. It is laſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ver. 18. <hi>And God ſaw that it was good:</hi> The
note or character of the holy Ghoſt approving
what was made by the Sonne from the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Father. So <hi>Moſes</hi> againe deſcribes the
workes of the firſt day. <hi>And God ſaid, let the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
bring forth abundantly</hi> ver. 20. And in the 21.
he repeates againe. <hi>And God created great Whales.</hi>
&amp;c. And againe, <hi>God ſaw that it was good.</hi> When
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7898:46"/>
it is ſaid ver. 22. of the ſame dayes worke, <hi>And
God bleſſed them ſaying, Be fruitfull and multiply:</hi>
this may referre unto the three perſons joyntly.
So in the workes of the ſixt day ver. 24. <hi>God ſaid
Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his
kinde, &amp;c.</hi> And it is repeated againe ver. 25. <hi>And
God made the beaſt of the earth after his kinde, &amp;c.
And God ſaw that it was good.</hi> But when <hi>Moſes</hi>
comes to the accompliſhment of the ſixt dayes
worke ver. 16. hee alters the forme or character
of ſpeech, and makes the Verbe, as well as the
noune, plurall. And God ſaid, Let <hi>us make man in
our Image after our likeneſſe.</hi> This order obſerved
by the ancients in the firſt creation of all things is
admirably exemplified in the manner of mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
wrought by the Father, Sonne and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt joyntly, yet not without diſtinction of
order in their joynt working, in their undivided
worke. But of this, by the aſſiſtance of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Trinity,</hi> hereafter.</p>
                  <p>3. But however the Ancients, or ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them may faile in this or the like particular
ſearch of myſteries, from no better hint then the
repetition of the ſame words or matter: Yet their
endeavour in the generall to finde out deepe hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
myſteries from theſe or the like ſuperficiall
or charactericall prenotions, is warranted by the
word of God according to its literall or aſſertive
ſenſe. For ſo we are taught by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that ſuch
repetition of the ſame things as in ſecular ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would incurre ſuſpition of tautology or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity
of words, may be the undoubted character
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7898:46"/>
of ſome matter more then ordinary, and more
obſervable then if it had beene repreſented but
once, or after one manner onely. A ſecular
Southſayer or profeſſed Interpreter of noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
repreſentations, would have ſought after
more interpretations than one of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> two
dreames; eſpecially ſeeing the matter repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him in the firſt viſion, was ſo unlike to the
matter repreſented in the ſecond. Yet <hi>Ioſeph</hi> by
the guidance of Gods Spirit diſcovers theſe two
dreames, though diſtinct in time and manner of
repreſentation, to be for ſubſtance but one. <hi>And
Ioſeph ſaid unto Pharaoh, The dreame of Pharaoh is
one: God hath ſhewed Pharaoh what hee is about to
doe. The ſeaven good Kine are ſeaven yeares: and
the ſeaven good eares are ſeaven yeares: the dreame is
one. And the ſeaven thin and ill favoured Kine that
came up after them, are ſeaven yeares, and ſeaven
empty eares blaſted with the Eaſt winde, ſhall be ſeaven
yeares of famine,</hi> Gen. 41. 25, 26, &amp;c. <hi>And for that
the dreame was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the thing is eſtabliſhed by God: and God will
ſhortly bring it to paſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. When we ſay, an honeſt mans word ſhould
be as good as his oath, wee ſuppoſe that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
integrity or perfection in man, hath a farre
more exquiſite patterne in God. Hee is no leſſe
immutable in his promiſes than in his oath. It
is impoſſible for him to change his minde, or to
deceive men in the one as in the other: To what
end then doth hee ſo often interpoſe his oath,
ſometimes when hee denounceth judgement,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7898:47"/>
otherwhiles for the conſolation of men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their beliefe in his gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?
Sure it is one thing to ſay, Gods purpoſe,
will, or promiſe is immutable; another, that the
thing purpoſed, will'd, or promiſed by him, is
immutable. The abſolute immutability of his
purpoſe, or promiſe, can yeeld us no full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that the things promiſed or purpoſed by
him are unchangeable, or that ſentence denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
(though in terms peremptory) is irreverſible.
But unto whatſoever promiſe or ſentence wee
finde his oath annexed,<note place="margin">Vide Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorem In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum (id eſt Aguanum ut Lorinus ſaepius mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net) et pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres quos in hunc finem citat, in Pſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rules for the right interpreting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and for the reconciliation of divers Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

Saviours conſecration to his everlaſting Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;

God is ſaid to repent; in what caſes not to repent.
For both aſſertions are frequent in Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>5. Sometimes divine myſteries are repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not in ſome one word or name, but in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
character or frame of ſome one letter, or in the
addition of a letter or point. There is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
amongſt us Chriſtians, but that he who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto <hi>Moſes (Levit. 1. 1.)</hi> from the mercy ſeat
(as we gather from <hi>Numb. 7.)</hi> was the ſonne of
God, the eternall word who ſince hath taken our

nature upon him, and calleth unto us with a voice
and mouth truly humane, though the voice and
mouth of God. But at that time he called to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
not in a loud and thundring voice (like that
in Mount Sinai) but with a ſoft and gentle voice.
And this gentleneſſe of the voice (as the Hebrew
Doctors obſerve, and ſome good Chriſtian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricians

compoſition (as it ſeemes) <hi>Iagnakab,</hi> did (as the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
ſignified by it in the birth) portend, that
he ſhould ſupplant his elder brother, and get the
birthright from him.</p>
                  <p>8. After this name given him by his Parents,
he was in his full age named <hi>Iſrael</hi> by God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
by way of addition only, without any change
or determination of his former name, or the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of it. But it is not without obſervation why
he is ſometimes called <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Iſrael</hi> in
the ſame continued hiſtoricall Narration, the
name <hi>Iacob</hi> characterizing his preſent infirmity;
the name <hi>Iſrael</hi> notifying his recovering or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7898:49"/>
of ſtrength. But one of the moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
prerepreſentations <hi>literall not aſſertive,</hi> of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
plainely afterward avouched and fulfilled,
which I have either obſerved, or found obſerved
by others, is in the <hi>Benedictus, Luke 1. 68, &amp;c.
Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for hee hath viſited
and redeemed his people; and hath raiſed up an horne
of ſalvation for us in the houſe of his ſervant David,
&amp;c. To performe the mercy promiſed to our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and to remember his holy Covenant, the oath
which he ſware to our Father Abraham, that he
would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of
the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without
feare; in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the
dayes of our life.</hi> The ſumme of that which God
had ſpoken by the mouth of his holy Prophets,
which had beene ſince the world began, was now
reavouched by <hi>Zacharias</hi> (being filled with the
holy Ghoſt) in a literall aſſertive ſenſe, plaine and
eaſie even to the capacity of the naturall man.
And yet the ſumme of all, which <hi>Zacharias</hi> by the
Spirit of Prophecie did now utter, was clearely
repreſented (to men of ſpirituall underſtanding
in the Scriptures, or experienced in their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſenſe) in the very names of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and of
his Parents. For <hi>Zacharias</hi> (the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> Father)
is by interpretation <hi>the remembrance of God. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
(his mother) as much as <hi>the oath of God.</hi>
And the name <hi>Iohn,</hi> imports the <hi>free grace of God.</hi>
And all theſe put together ſound as much, as that
God did now remember his people with that
grace, which he had ſworne to beſtow upon them
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7898:49"/>
in his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, with
grace of deliverance from their enemies (&amp; their
owne ſinnes were their greateſt enemies) with
grace enabling them to ſerve him in holineſſe and
righteouſneſſe all the dayes of their life. Of more
particulars in this kinde, as they ſhall fall within

                     <hi>qui tanti menſuram nominis imples.</hi> Now
ſeing this phraſe <hi>[This was done that the Scripture
might be fulfilled]</hi> is ſo frequent in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>Maldonat</hi> did very well and like himſelfe
in unfolding the ſeverall wayes (as he conceived
them) according to which the Scripture is ſaid
to be fulfilled, almoſt in the very beginning of
his learned Commentaries upon the foure Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts.
Yet ſome queſtion there may be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he did all this, which was ſo well and wiſely
attempted by him, ſo well and ſo judiciouſly as
might in reaſon have beene expected from him.</p>
                  <p>2. The Scripture (ſaith he) ſo farre (as I could
hitherto obſerve) is ſaid to be fulfilled foure man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7898:50"/>
of wayes. Firſt when that very thing is done
or comes to paſſe which was meant by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
or other ſacred writers in the literall and
proper ſenſe: As when Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> (to uſe his
inſtance) ſaith Chap. 1. 22. That which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Prophet, <hi>(behold a Virgin ſhall conceive
and beare a ſonne, and ſhall call his name Emanuel)</hi>
was fulfilled in the bleſſed virgin. The rule is true
and without exception, but the illuſtration of it
is not ſo fit, as <hi>Maldonat</hi> ſuppoſed. For that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was fulfilled more
wayes than one, perhaps according to all the
foure ſeverall wayes, which he conceived, in the
conception birth and <hi>name</hi> of our Saviour Jeſus
Chriſt. <hi>Secondly, the ſcripture is ſaid to be fulfilled,
when that comes to paſſe which was foreſhadowed by
the proper and immediate ſubject of the Prophets</hi>
ſpeech. <hi>As that ſaying Exod. 12. 46. Yee ſhall not
breake a bone of it, was properly and immediately
meant of the paſchall Lambe, yet fulfilled in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Chriſt, of whom the paſchall Lambe was the type
or ſhadow.</hi> Unto this ſecond rule or branch hee
likewiſe referres that prophecy 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 14. I
will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a ſonne.</hi>
This was fulfilled in Chriſt as the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. though properly meant of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
as <hi>Maldonat</hi> takes it for granted; although
ſome judicious Commentators of the Romane
Church in his time doe queſtion, or rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
(yet too boldly) deny it. However,
this ſecond rule of <hi>Maldonat</hi> is good and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by all, only his expreſſion of the two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7898:51"/>
needs ſome correction: for the firſt place
alleaged by him was as literally and as properly
meant of Chriſt as of the Paſchall Lambe; and
the ſecond more properly meant of Chriſt than
of <hi>Salomon,</hi> though literally and properly meant
of <hi>Salomon</hi> and fulfilled in him. The truth is that
both places were two wayes fulfilled both in the
literall, and myſticall ſenſe, and the ſecond twice
fulfilled, once in the literall, and againe both in
the literall and myſticall ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly <hi>(ſaith the ſame Author)</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſaid to be fulfilled, when neither that which was
literally and properly pointed at by the Prophet, nor
that which was fore-ſhadowed by it comes to paſſe, but
ſome other thing which is ſo like unto it, that the ſame
ſpeech may as aptly and as handſomely be applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, as unto that which was properly and literally
meant. <hi>For illuſtration of this third rule, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth
that of the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah cap. 29. 13, 14.
For as much as this people draw neere unto me with
their mouth, and with their lippes doe honour me; but
have removed their heart farre from me, and their
feare toward me is taught by the precept of men: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
behold I will proceed to doe a marvellous worke
amongſt this people, even a marvellous worke and a
wonder. For the wiſedome of their wiſe men ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and the underſtanding of their prudent men ſhall
be hid: <hi>This (ſaith</hi> Maldonat) <hi>was properly meant
of the Jewes which lived in</hi> Iſaiahs <hi>time; and yet
our Saviour</hi> Matt. 15. 7, 8. <hi>gives us to underſtand
that this was fulfilled of the Jewes, which conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and diſputed with him.</hi> Yet Hypocrites, well
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7898:51"/>
did Iſaiah prophecy of you, ſaying: This people draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth mee
with their lips; but their heart is farre me. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this third rule or obſervation,</hi> Maldonat <hi>would
draw that other ſaying of the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah cap.
6. 10. Make the heart of this people fat, and make
their eares heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with
their eyes, and heare with their eares, and underſtand
with their heart, and convert and be healed. <hi>Yet this
prophecy, as our Saviour expreſly tells us</hi> Mat. 13,
14. <hi>was fulfilled in the Jewes to whom he ſpake</hi>
Ore tenùs, <hi>in parables. And ſo doth S.</hi> Paul Acts
28. 26. <hi>where he expounds the Orthodoxall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
both of our Saviours &amp; the Prophets words.
The truth of this third rule will come in ſome
queſtion in the next chapter: but admitting it
for the preſent to be orthodoxall and true, yet
the inſtances or illuſtrations are impertinent. For
all the paſſages alleaged by him were more lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and more properly meant of the incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Jewes which converſed with our Saviour
than of thoſe Jewes which were the Prophet</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiahs
<hi>coëvalls; as the underſtanding Reader will
eaſily collect from the 12. of</hi> Iohn 41. <hi>being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the forecited 6, of</hi> Iſaiah.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth way by which</hi> (in <hi>Maldonats</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation)
<hi>the ſcripture is ſaid to be fulfilled, is, when
that which was foretold or prefigured though already
done in part, or begunne to be done, is afterwards more
conſtantly and more fully done.</hi> The obſervation or
rule is unqueſtionably true, but it is not a rule or
branch diſtinct from the two firſt, but rather a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7898:52"/>
tranſcendent to all the wayes according to which
the ſcriptures may be rightly ſaid to be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>4. And theſe wayes can be neither more nor
fewer, then are the ways by which God did either
foretell or prefigure things to come, and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed
in Chriſt. Some predictions were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prophetical, ſome prefigurations were meerely
typical, other meerly literal or charactericall. And
unto theſe &amp; their commixtures all the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
or prenotions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Evangelical myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have bin reduced. Now according to all theſe
wayes the ſcripture is ſaid to be fulfilled. Where
the teſtimony is meerly propheticall, that is ſuch
as is literally applyable to Chriſt alone, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſaid to be fulfilled only in the literall ſenſe.
When the teſtimony or prenotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is only typicall,
as when the repreſentation is made by matter of
fact or hiſtoricall eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in this caſe the Scripture is
fulfilled only according to the myſticall ſenſe; and
after this maner moſt of the legall ceremonies are
ſaid to be fulfilled in Chr. The hiſtory of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was myſtically fulfilled in his death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the croſſe: the ſtory of <hi>Ionas</hi> his impriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in
the whales belly was thus fulfilled in his buriall, &amp;
3 dayes abode in his grave: the Ceremony or rite
of offering the firſt fruits was thus fulfilled in his
reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Where the teſtimony &amp; prenotion is
both typical &amp; prophetical, as is that of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Lamb, &amp; of the ſtone which the builders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
there the Scripture is fulfilled both accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the literall &amp; the myſticall ſenſe, whether
the words as they are referred to Chr. be logicall
&amp; proper, or whether they be allegori: or ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7898:52"/>
yet can we not ſay that theſe Scripture were
fulfilled as well in the type as in Chriſt, but in
Chriſt alone. For neither of theſe paſſages <hi>[Yee
ſhall not breake a bone of it] [the ſtone which the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
refuſed]</hi> were propheticall in reſpect of the
type, but only in reſpect of the myſteries typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And no Scripture is ſaid to be fulfilled, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
then as it is either a prediction or prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſomewhat to come. But where the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is prophetically typicall, there one and the
ſame Scripture is twice fulfilled both in the type
and in the antitype, as that 2 <hi>Sam. 7. [I will be to
him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a ſonne]</hi> was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in <hi>Salomon</hi> in the literall ſenſe, but in Chriſt
both according to the literall and myſticall ſenſe.
So was that forecited paſſage <hi>Iſay</hi> 22. fulfilled in
<hi>Eliakim</hi> according to the literall ſenſe, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fulfilled in Chriſt both according to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
ſymbolicall and the myſticall ſenſe. And
thus the names given to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> himſelfe, and
to his Parents had their accompliſhment when
Chriſt was exhibited in our fleſh: and yet theſe,
and many other of the ſame rank, were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
fulfilled after his reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maldonat</hi> his fourth rule (as was before intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
will hold in all theſe ſeverall wayes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which the Scripture is ſaid to be fulfilled,
whether according to the meere literall and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſenſe, or according to the meere myſticall
ſenſe, or according to both with their ſeverall
branches, or according to the charactericall ſenſe,
or literall repreſentative only not aſſertive. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7898:53"/>
to every one of theſe ſenſes may one and
the ſame Scripture be oftner fulfilled than once
or twice, and in a manner more remarkable at
one time than at another, though alwayes truly
fulfilled and according to the intention of the
holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>5. To beginne with the literall aſſertive. No
man I thinke will queſtion whether that of the
Prophet Iſaiah [with the breath of his lips ſhall
he ſlay the wicked] were literally meant of any
beſides our Saviour Chriſt. And there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but theſe words were fulfilled within the
compaſſe of that age which brought him forth,
and ſo then fulfilled in ſundry wicked ones: yet
doe not theſe words referre to them, or thoſe
times alone, but are to be fulfilled in a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
manner at the day of Judgement, or
perhaps before it. For from this place of the
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> our Apoſtle had that revelation
<hi>2 Theſſ. 2. 8. Then ſhall that Wicked he revealed,
whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his
mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſſe of his
comming.</hi> Many like prophecies there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the glory of Chriſts Church and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
eſtate of his elect, which are even in this life
literally fulfilled or verified by way of pledge or
earneſt, but ſhall not be exactly fulfilled, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the life to come. Ignorance of this rule, or
non-obſervance of it, hath been the nurſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and ſuperſtitious error, as well in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Church as in her extreme oppoſites: in
ſuch I meane, as beginne their faith and anchor
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7898:53"/>
their hopes at the abſolute infallibility of their
perſonall election with no leſſe zeale or paſſion
then the Romaniſt relyes upon the abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the viſible Church:</p>
                  <p>6. That very inſtance which <hi>Maldonat</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
for the confirmation of his third rule <hi>[This
people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
honoureth me with their lips, &amp;c. Matth. 15. 8.]</hi>
was literally meant of the Jewes which lived in
<hi>Iſaiahs</hi> time, yet not properly fulfilled in them
or of them; for in reſpect of them, it was not a
Prophecy, but a ſharpe reproofe or taxe; yet this
reproofe or taxe was a moſt exact prophecy in
reſpect of the Jewes which converſed with our
Saviour, of whom it was literally meant in a more
exquiſite ſenſe than of their Anceſtors, and in
this ſenſe often fulfilled. The ancient Jewes did
not honour God being perſonally and viſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
with their lips as theſe later did, nor were
their hearts ſo malitiouſly ſet, at leaſt their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
not ſo diametrally bent, againſt God at any
time, as the hearts and malice of theſe later Jews
were againſt Chriſt, who was the God of their
Fathers. As theſe later Jewes did fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of their Fathers ſinnes; ſo whatſoever God
did threaten to this ſtiffenecked people for their
rebellion againſt him, was more exactly fulfilled
in this laſt generation, then it had beene in any
former. The ſeverall generations or ſucceſſions
created no difference in the true object of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
ſenſe: that may and did as equally reſpect
many generations as one man, infinite tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7898:54"/>
as truly as ſome few. This Scripture may be
as truly fulfilled in all as in one, though no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in all
according to the ſame meaſure. So S. <hi>Stephen</hi> tells
the Jewes <hi>Acts 7. 5. 52. Yee ſtiffenecked and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
in heart and eares, yee doe alwayes reſiſt the
holy Ghoſt: at your Fathers did, ſo doe yee. Which of
the Prophets have not your Fathers perſecuted? And
they have ſlaine them which ſhewed before of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the juſt one, of whom yee have beene now the
betrayers and murderers.</hi> And our Saviour himſelfe
chargeth the preſent generation of the Jews with
the blood of <hi>Zacharias</hi> forme of <hi>Barachias,</hi> whom
their forefathers had ſlaine many hundreds of
yeares before <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 35. adding withall, that
his blood ſhould be required of that generation
preſent. Which is a proofe ſufficient that this <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi>
was not the Father (as ſome have ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
of <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt.</hi> For if he had beene ſlaine
betweene the Temple and the Altar, hee muſt
have beene ſlaine by that preſent generation to
whom our Saviour directs this ſpeech, and ſo
there had beene no matter of obſervation capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of that Emphaticall <hi>Epiphonema Luke 11. 51.
Verily I ſay unto you it ſhall be required of this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Now his blood was to bee required of this
laſt generation, becauſe they had fulfilled the
meaſure of their forefathers ſinnes, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly
ſlaine their high Prieſt <hi>Zacharias.</hi> But
how the Prophecy of this their high Prieſt, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his dying curſe, was fulfilled more exactly of
this laſt generation than of that generation which
put him to death, would require a particular trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,

not in this place to be inſerted. His dying
ſpeech (though uttered by way of imprecation)
was propheticall. And the event of his impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though exhibited ſhortly after his death
was typically propheticall of that which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this laſt generation within forty yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death of our Saviour, whom <hi>Zacharias</hi> did
in his death (though not in his dying ſpeeches)
exactly foreſhadow.</p>
                  <p>7. As one and the ſame Scripture may be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then once fulfilled or exactly verified in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
meaſure only by way of growth or incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ſame literall ſenſe; ſo likewiſe may it
be of one and the ſame man in reſpect of ſeverall
times. For out of queſtion it is, that the Scripture
<hi>Gen. 15. 6. Abraham beleeved God, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
unto him for righteouſneſſe,</hi> was literally veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of <hi>Abraham</hi> at that very point of time, when
God firſt called him from his owne kindred and
his Fathers houſe into the promiſed Land. And
yet S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 23. that this very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was fulfilled when <hi>Abraham</hi> offered up <hi>Iſaac</hi>
his ſonne upon the Altar: and from this laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of <hi>Abraham</hi> he had, if not the firſt, yet
the trueſt, title to bee called the friend of God.
Not altogether after the ſame manner, but after
a manner not much different was that Scripture
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. 4. twice fulfilled of our Saviour before
his reſurrection: <hi>Surely he hath borne our griefes,
and caryed our ſorrowes, &amp;c.</hi> This was moſt exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fulfilled in his ſufferings (whatſoever theſe
were) upon the Croſſe, unto which S. <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7898:55"/>
it, 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>He his owne ſelfe bare our
ſinnes in his owne body on the tree, that we being dead
to ſinne, ſhould live to righteouſneſſe, by whoſe ſtripes
you were healed.</hi> Yet was the ſame teſtimony tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fulfilled before, as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
us cap. 8. ver, 16, 17. <hi>When the even was
come, they brought unto him many that were poſſeſſed
with Devills; and he caſt out the ſpirits with his word,
and healed all that were ſick. That it might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
which was ſpoken by Iſaiah the Prophet ſaying,
Himſelfe tooke our infirmities and bare our ſickneſſes.</hi>
The teſtimonie alleaged by theſe two Apoſtles
unto ſeverall purpoſes is one and the ſame, and
yet concludent of what they both purpoſed or
intended. Nor is it neceſſary to ſearch out two
ſeverall ſenſes of one and the ſame teſtimony al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged
and twice fulfilled. For of one and the
ſame literall ſenſe or ſignification there may bee
two objects or more. The literall ſenſe of the
words, as forecited by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> hath for its object
our Saviours ſufferings, or his bearing our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and the diſeaſes of our ſoules upon the
Croſſe. The object whereto S. <hi>Matthew</hi> referres,
was the infirmites or ſickneſſes of mens bodies;
for theſe he bare though not (as we ſay) in kinde,
yet by exact ſympathy or fellowfeeling, before
he bare our ſpirituall infirmities upon the Croſſe;
and whether hee bare theſe after ſuch an exact
ſympathy, as he did the bodily infirmities of thoſe
whom he cured, may be diſcuſſed in the Article
of his paſſion.</p>
                  <p>8. But as for teſtimonies either typicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7898:55"/>
or prophetically typicall, beſides that
they may be oftner fulfilled then once, according
to the ſame ſenſe in generall, (as either according
to the literall or myſticall ſenſe or both) they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in greater variety of particular ſenſes no way
oppoſite unto the generall, but ſubordinate and
coordinate one to another. Sometimes the ſame
words fit the type in ſuch a proportion, as the
names of ſhires or Provinces doe thoſe parts of
the Maps wherein they are repreſented; but fit
the Antitype in ſuch a meaſure as the ſame name
in the Mappe doth the province which it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents:
ſometimes in one and the ſame Prophecy
or continued hiſtoricall narration, one clauſe or
paſſage doth fit the type only, another the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type
only, according to the proper literall ſenſe;
and ſome others ſo fit both. As in Pſalme 72. 1.
<hi>Give the King thy Iudgements, O God, and thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
unto the Kings ſonne:</hi> by the King it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
<hi>David</hi> meant himſelfe, and by the Kings
ſonne, both <hi>Salomon,</hi> and him of whom <hi>Salomon</hi>
was the ſhadow or type; the one according to
the literall ſenſe only, the other both according
to literall and myſticall. Theſe words againe in
the 2. verſe, <hi>He ſhall judge the people with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and the poore with equity,</hi> referre both to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
and to Chriſt; to the one as to the modell,
to the other as to the edifice. So doth that other
paſſage ver. 8. <hi>He ſhall have dominion alſo from ſea
to ſea, and from the River unto the ends of the earth.</hi>
This prophecy was fulfilled or exactly verified
according to the letter in <hi>Salomon:</hi> For hee did
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7898:56"/>
command from the <hi>Phaenician</hi> ſea unto the ſea of
<hi>Edom,</hi> and from the river <hi>Euphrates</hi> unto the lands
end, according to that ancient <hi>terrar</hi> which the
Lord himſelfe had given of <hi>Iudahs</hi> dominion.
Yet this dominion whileſt it was moſt entirely
poſſeſt by <hi>Salomon,</hi> was but a Map of Chriſts
Kingdome; he was to rule from Sea to Sea, over
all the Seas in the world, and from river to river
from every point of ſea and land unto the ſame
point againe; For all was to be given him as well
in earth as in heaven. <hi>Salomons</hi> earthly Kingdom
doth fit Chriſts Kingdome here on earth, as a
Mappe of paper doth a Countrey or Province;
and Chriſts Kingdome here on earth is but the
ſcale of his Kingdome and dominion in heaven.</p>
                  <p>9. Sometimes the ſame paſſage of Scripture
may according to the intent and meaning of the
holy Spirit be fulfilled or verified of the type or
pledge in an ordinary literall or proverbiall ſenſe,
(which is ſomewhat more then the ordinary lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall)
and yet be fulfilled of Chriſt in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
punctuall literall ſenſe that can be imagined.
<hi>They that dwell in the wilderneſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> Pſal.
72. 9.) <hi>ſhall how before him, and his enemies ſhall
lick the duſt.</hi> This was truly meant and verified
of <hi>Salomon</hi> in the literall and proverbiall ſenſe,
but moſt exactly fulfilled in Chriſt, unto whom
<hi>all knees ſhall how of things in heaven, of things in
earth, and of things under the earth:</hi> and all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
death it ſelfe, and him that had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of death, ſhall inherite the Serpents firſt curſe,
that is, to be fed with duſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 14. No doubt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7898:56"/>
but <hi>Salomon</hi> and his ſhare in that prediction v. 12.
<hi>He ſhall deliver the needy when he cryeth, the poore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
and him that hath no helper;</hi> Him that is not able
to cry or ſpeake for himſelfe. But <hi>Salomon</hi> could
never give ſight unto the blinde, or limbes unto
the Lame, or ſpeech or hearing to ſuch as were
borne deafe or dumbe. Theſe were prerogatives
peculiar unto that ſonne of <hi>David</hi> whom <hi>Salomon</hi>
did foreſhadow. But even the deafe and dumbe
had ſome friends to ſolicite Chriſts aide for them;
the lame, the blinde, and the ſick, could cry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
unto him or make ſignes of their deſire of
his helpe; yet others he helped which did not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by themſelves or by their friends deſire his
helpe, as that impotent man which had layd ſo
long at the poole of Betheſda. <hi>Salomon</hi> might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the poore from civill oppreſſion or bodily
violence, and might raiſe them in their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
fortunes; but it was the promiſed ſonne of
<hi>David</hi> alone, that could deliver them from the
oppreſſions of the Devill, or from the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their owne bodily ſenſes. Thus he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<hi>Lazarus</hi> from the very bonds of death, and
from the priſon of the grave, when hee himſelfe
could not, and his ſiſters would not or did not
cry unto him for this deliverance, but rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
him from attempting it. Now the very
name <hi>Lazarus</hi> is by interpretation as much as
<hi>David</hi> in that verſe expreſſeth, <hi>Him that hath no
helper.</hi> According to this difference or allowance
moſt paſſages in that 72 Pſalme beſides the 5 ver.
&amp; the concluſion from the 17, are literally meant
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7898:57"/>
both of <hi>Salomon</hi> and of Chriſt. But theſe prayers
of <hi>David</hi> were propheticall both in reſpect of the
type and the antitype; ſo are not many other like
paſſages in the Pſalmes, which containe patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
expreſſions of the parties deſires, griefes, or
ſorows, which did pen them; and yet are no
leſſe exquiſitely fulfilled in Chriſt, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
which were literally meant both of Chriſt
and of the Pſalmiſt, though propheticall only in
reſpect of Chriſt. Every religious man, which
had a religious woman to his mother, might
frame his prayers in the ſame literall forme that
the Pſalmiſt uſeth <hi>Pſal. 116. 16. O Lord, ſurely I
am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant, and the ſonne of thy
handmaid.</hi> Yet in as much as this Pſalmiſt (who
ever he were) was a type of Chriſt, that which
he ſpake and meant of himſelfe in an ordinary
and common ſenſe was fulfilled of Chriſt in the
moſt exquiſite ſenſe whereof theſe words or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are capable. For he was the ſonne of an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
of Gods handmaid <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
manner as no ſonne of man before him was
nor after ſhall be. And hee was the ſervant of
God in ſuch a ſenſe and after ſuch a manner, as no
man could be, no man would deſire to bee, ſave
only that man who was the eternall and only ſon
of God. But of this Title of the ſonne of God, his
being the ſervant of God, in his proper place.</p>
                  <p>10. The Pſalmiſt againe did queſtionleſſe
both act and pen his owne part, when he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
<hi>Yea mine owne familiar friend in whom I
truſted, which did eate of my bread, hath lift up his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7898:57"/>
heele againſt me.</hi> Pſal. 41. 9. This was but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of ſome intolerable ingratitude and
wrong, either paſt or then in working; the ſpeech
was neither altogether figurative nor hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
but a typicall prophecy of <hi>Iudas</hi> his Traito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
dealing with his Lord and Maſter; and in
<hi>Iudas</hi> alone it was properly fulfilled according to
the moſt exquiſite and moſt punctuall literall
ſenſe that could have beene deviſed. For <hi>Iudas</hi>
being in an office of truſt, did then lay waite for
his maſters life, and did then fully reſolve upon
his intended treaſon, when he was in the meſſe,
and dipt his finger in the ſame diſh with him.
The Father of lyes, of treaſon, and ingratitude
did enter into his heart at the ſame inſtant, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he devoured the bread his maſter had reached
unto him. By the ſpeedy and more diſaſtrous iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
of this prodigious Treaſon, preventing the
Traitor for triumphing in his maſters death, as
his bloody confederates did: this people might
have knowne that Chriſt was the man whom
God did favour, whom the Pſalmiſt did foreſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in his complaint; and of whoſe reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he prophecied in his prayer Ver. 10, 11, 12.
<hi>But thou O Lord be mercifull unto me, and raiſe mee
up that I may requite them: by this I know that thou
favoureſt me, becauſe my Enemy doth not triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me. And as for me thou upholdeſt me in mine
integrity, and ſetteſt me before thy face for ever.</hi> All
that the Pſalmiſt here pens, was more exquiſitly
acted by our Saviour, if we ſubduct the impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon his enemies, which the Pſalmiſt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7898:58"/>
with his prayers for himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>11. The Author of the 69 Pſalme (were hee
<hi>David</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> or ſome other ſo enſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for the ſame reaſon, for which <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> is
by our Saviour himſelfe called <hi>Elias)</hi> did not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that complaint without ſome urgent cauſe or
preſſing occaſions, Ver. 20, 21. <hi>Reproach hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
my heart, and I am full of heavineſſe, and I looked
for ſome to take pity, but there was none, and I looked
for comforters, but I found none. They gave me alſo
gall for my meate, and in my thriſt they gave me vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
drinke.</hi> Theſe paſſionate expreſſions could
hardly proceed from ſuch ſympathy, as a pure
propheticall viſion of what the malignant Jewes
would do for many generations after unto Chriſt,
was likely to raiſe. They ſeeme live characters
of experienced griefe and ſorow, and it may be
the Pſalmiſt was then a priſoner fed with the
bread of affliction, and compelled to drink water
as bitter as his bread was naſty. But whatſoever
the Pſalmiſt here ſpeakes of himſelfe, and of his
miſerable perplexities, though in an high and
tragicall ſtraine, or in a ſenſe ſomewhat hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall;
was we know fulfilled in Chriſt according
to the literall and punctuall ſenſe. Briefely, all
the Pſalmiſts and other Prophets, in all their
cauſeleſſe and undeſerved ſufferings at the hands
of worthleſſe and malitious men, were true types,
and yet no more than types or ſhadows, of Chriſt
in his agony and bloody paſſion. But in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
and bitter imprecations uttered in
their guiltleſſe ſufferings, they were not ſo much
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7898:58"/>
types as foyles of his unſpeakable patience, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and long ſuffering: for he never prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his enemies (as the Prophets did) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
for them. Their demeanour in their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
diſgrace, or torments was ſuch as did ſhew
themſelves to be but men: His, alwayes ſuch as
did declare Him to be, what he often ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
truly God. And yet the bitter imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the Pſalmiſt and other Prophets uſed
in their indigne ſufferings, or againſt the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enemies of his Church and people did (by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
inſpiration) prove moſt exact typicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of all the Calamities which befell the
Jewiſh nation after they had declared themſelves
to be the enemies of the God of their Fathers,
and put the Lord of life, their promiſed Meſſias,
to death. As in particular and for inſtance, that
imprecation of this Pſalmiſt ver. 23. unto the 28.
with that other Prophecy <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. S. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſee
in part fulfilled in the Jewes of his time <hi>Rom. 11.
8, 9, 10. According as it is written, God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them the ſpirit of ſlumber: eyes that they ſhould
not ſee, and eares that they ſhould not heare unto this
day.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let their table be made a
ſnare and a trap, and a ſlumbling block, and a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
unto them. Let their eyes be darkned that they
may not ſee, and bow downe their back alway.</hi> This
imprecation made by the Pſalmiſt (but never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
by our Saviour) did fall upon them by the
law of retaliation. Therefore their Table became
a ſnare unto them, becauſe they gave the ſonne of
God gall for meat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, and vineger in his thirſt to

would lead us by a faire and ſafe way, as it were
by the rule of three, unto the juſt product or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie
of the true allegoricall and myſticall ſenſe,
in which they were fulfilled. But as our caſe
now ſtands, the luxuriant and perplexed branches
of ſuch forced Allegories, as men fancie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or frame by gueſſe, without any perfect
ſcale or proportion from the true hiſtoricall ſenſe,
have occaſioned many judicious Divines, to
doubt or queſtion whether thoſe things which
by the Evangeliſts are ſaid to bee done that the
<hi>Scriptures might bee fulfilled</hi> doe alwayes imply
ſome concludent proofe or demonſtration of the
Spirit. <hi>Calvin,</hi> for being ſometimes too bold,
ſometimes too ſparing in the expoſition of ſuch
places, as the Evangeliſts ſay are fulfilled in Chriſt
is deeply taxed by the Lutherans generally, and
by many of the Romiſh Church. But Chriſtian
charity will perſwade men of ſober paſſions, that
it was rather feare leſt he ſhould give offence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Jewes, then any deſire or inclination to
comply with them, which made him ſometimes
give the ſame interpretations of Scriptures which
they doe, without expreſſion of, or ſearch after
farther myſteries than the letter it ſelfe doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.
How ever it be, if <hi>Calvin</hi> be lyable to a
judgement, <hi>Ianſenius, Sasbout,</hi> and <hi>Maldonat,</hi> three
of the moſt judicious Commentators of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Church for theſe many yeares, are lyable to
a Councell, for their unadviſed preſumption in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7898:60"/>
this kinde. One of them denyeth that often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
place; <hi>I will be to him a Father, and be ſhall be
to me a ſonne,</hi> to bee literally meant of <hi>Salomon:</hi>
wherein he gives juſt offence unto the Jewes, and
by ſuperſtitious feare of committing that errour,
whereof <hi>Calvin</hi> is often accuſed, doth fall into
the contrary. The two others queſtion whether
that of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, Out of Egypt have I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
my ſonne,</hi> were properly fulfilled in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
or only ſaid to be fulfilled <hi>per accommodatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
by way of alluſion, that is, in ſuch a manner as
we might ſay that of the Poet,
<q>Omnis in Aſcanio chari ſtat cura Parentis,</q>
were fulfilled in any father or mother, whom
we ſaw to dote upon, or much to deligt in their
lovely ſonne. And this was the explicite meaning
of <hi>Maldonats</hi> third rule before cited, <hi>in what ſenſe
the Scripture is ſaid to be fulfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That this was his meaning in that place,
may be gathered from his comment on that other
ſaying of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 13. ver. 34, 35. <hi>All
theſe things ſpake Ieſus unto the multitude in parables,
and without a parable ſpake he not unto them; that it
might be fulfilled, which was ſpoken by the Prophet
ſaying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter
things which have beene kept ſecret ſince the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world.</hi> His obſervations upon this place
are, in his owne words (engliſhed) thus. <q>The
particle, <hi>That,</hi> doth not denote the cauſe why
our Saviour ſpake in parables; for he did not
thus ſpeake, to the end that <hi>Davids</hi> ſayings
might bee fulfilled, but becauſe his Auditors
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7898:60"/>
were unworthy of ſuch perſpicuous declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as he uſed to his Diſciples in private.</q> This
he takes as granted from our Saviours ſpeech ver.
13, 14. <hi>Therefore ſpake I to them in parables, becauſe
they ſeeing ſee not, and hearing they heare not, neither
doe they underſtand. And in them is fulfilled the
Prophecy of Iſaiah which ſaith, By hearing, &amp;c.</hi> The
abſtract of his obſervations upon ver, 34, 35. is
this; that it was no part of our Evangeliſts mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to teach us, that <hi>Davids</hi> prophecy was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
fulfilled by our Saviours parables: ſeeing
<hi>Davids</hi> diſcourſe (as he conceives) was indeed no
prophecy, but an hiſtoricall narration of matters
paſt, beſides that the word which the Pſalmiſt
there uſeth, doth not ſignifie ſuch parables as our
Saviour in this 13. chapter meant; but rather ſuch
pithy ſentences, as the Greekes call Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegmes.
<hi>Maldonats</hi> concluſion therefore is, that
the Evangeliſt (according to his uſuall manner)
did only accommodate that which <hi>David</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
to our Saviours ſpeeches in this place, to
which they have ſome affinity or ſimilitude,
though no concludent congruity: and for our
better ſatisfaction, hee referres us to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 15. that is indeed, <hi>to his
third rule,</hi> in what ſenſe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are ſaid to

the ſame purpoſe, this Author onely gives us to
underſtand, how eaſie a matter it is for good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
ſometimes to ſpend a great deale of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and wit to no good purpoſe; eſpecially when
they ſtrive to be hypercriticall, or to be cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7898:61"/>
of others pious endeavours, though perhaps
not ſo accurate.</p>
                  <p>3. To reviſe theſe his animadverſions <hi>ordine
retrogrado,</hi> that is, beginning with the laſt, and
ending with the firſt:</p>
                  <p>No man did ſay that the narrations in that
Pſalme were propheticall in reſpect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
literally and immediately ſignified by the
words themſelves; <q>Yet in as much as theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
though paſt, as Gods wonders in Egypt
and in the wilderneſſe, the conducting of his
people to the land of Canaan, and their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
behaviour in it, were true types or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of the like events in future times;</q> there
is not any thing in that Pſalme related, which in
the myſticall ſenſe doth not fore-repreſent ſome
parallel event, when the God of their Fathers
ſhould come in perſon to expoſtulate with his
people, in ſuch a manner as <hi>David</hi> did with the
people of his time, which he did not in his owne
name or authority, but in the name and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Lord and God. For ſo he beginnes that
Pſalme, <hi>Give eare, O my people, to my Law, incline
your eares to the words of my mouth. I will open my
mouth in a parable, I will utter darke ſayings of old.</hi>
This preamble cannot literally bee applyed to
<hi>David</hi> or any Prophet, ſave only as he was a type
or ſhadow of him that was to come. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
words immediately following though A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophthegmaticall
and pithy, were plaine in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the literall ſenſe, (if you conſider them
only as matters of fact forepaſt;) were knowne
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7898:61"/>
and had been taught, at the leaſt by ſome of their
Fathers, though perhaps forgotten by poſterity.
However, in reſpect of their myſticall importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
or as they containe a proportionable parallel of
the Kingdome of Heaven with the Kingdome of
Iſrael according to the fleſh; they are ſentences
both hard and darke, and ſuch as did require a
better paraphraſt upon <hi>David</hi> or the Author of
this Pſalme, then he was of <hi>Moſes</hi> or of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Hiſtorians before his time. For by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables
meant in ver. 2. of this Pſalme, if we may
beleeve S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> paraphraſe upon theſe
words, were meant, <hi>things which had beene kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
from the foundation of the world Matt.</hi> 13. 35.
This was the myſticall ſenſe of the Pſalmiſts
words, and according to S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> literall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of them, they neceſſarily import the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of the Kingdome of Heaven; and ſo all the
parables which our Saviour uſed in that Chapter
(as he there uſeth many) reſpect the Kingdome
of Heaven, and were hard and darke to ſuch as
were not of Chriſts diſciples, or ſuch as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
there deſcribes, <hi>A ſtubborne and faithleſſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>
It is true therefore which <hi>Maldonat</hi> in
his ſecond animadverſion ſaith, that the cauſe
why our Saviour ſpake to his common Auditors
in parables was, becauſe they were unworthy of
cleerer revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, uncapable for the time of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
talents, having uſed their former ordinary ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
ſo ill. Thus our Saviour reſolves his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ver. 11, 12. <hi>Vnto you it is given to know the
myſteries of the Kingdome of Heaven, but to them it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7898:62"/>
is not given. For whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
and he ſhall have abundance: but whoſoever
hath not, from him ſhall be taken away even that hee
hath.</hi> And to the ſame effect the Pſalmiſt had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
or forewarned this generation, even all
generations following. It was then an allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unconcludent and impertinent, and no way
beſeeming <hi>Maldonat,</hi> to ſay our Saviour did not
ſpeake in parables, to the end that <hi>Davids</hi> ſayings
might be fulfilled, but becauſe this preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
did deſerve no other language. For theſe
two are no way oppoſite, but ſubordinate. And
if it be ill for men to ſeparate thoſe things which
God hath conjoyned, it is much worſe to ſet
things at oddes or in oppoſition which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God hath made coordinate, or ſet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                  <p>Now both theſe aſſertions, as well that which
<hi>Maldonat</hi> refuſes, as that which he approves,
have a divine truth in them. Firſt it is moſt true
that our Saviour did ſpeake unto the multitude
and to the Phariſees, on whom they relyed, in
parables, becauſe they were for the time unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of ſuch declarations as he made to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for the increaſe of their talent which they
had uſed not ſo much amiſſe as the others had
done. And no leſſe true it is, that the Pſalmiſt
did foreprophecy that the poſterity of Iſrael from
his owne time untill the comming of the Meſſias
ſhould be more unworthy hearers of divine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
then their forefathers had beene; unleſſe
they ſeriouſly repented both their owne ſinnes,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7898:62"/>
and the ſinnes of their forefathers. So that our
Saviour did ſpeak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nto them in parables for theſe
two reaſons. Firſt, becauſe they were unworthy
hearers. Secondly, to the end his diſciples might
know and beleeve, that this manner of ſpeaking
was foreprophecied by the Author of the 78.
Pſalme.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Maldonats</hi> firſt animadverſion was, that
this Latine particle <hi>ut,</hi> or the greeke, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth not
alwayes ſignifie the cauſe of what is ſaid or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but ſometimes the event only. How true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this be, it no way prejudiceth the truth now
delivered by us. For it will not follow that this
particle <hi>ut</hi> either in this place of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> or in
any other place where it imports the fulfilling of
Scriptures, doth not ſignifie <hi>the cauſe,</hi> becauſe it
ſometimes or oftentimes ſignifieth the event on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But ſeeing the right uſe of this particle, or
the knowledge of its ſeverall references, is much
conducent to the juſt valuation of many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
which have beene, and muſt be hereafter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged
out of Scriptures; it will be very uſefull in
this place to unfold its ſeverall ſignifications or
importances once for all.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes this particle, as well in the Greek,
as in the Latine, and in our Engliſh, is tranſitive
only; and imports neither any true cauſe nor the
event; as in that of our Saviour <hi>Iohn 17. 3. This is
life eternall, that they may know thee, the only true
God.</hi> The reſolution of which words, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wrong either to their full importance in logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
conſtruction, or to their grammaticall elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7898:63"/>
is but this, <hi>Cognoſcere te eſſe verum Deum eſt vita
aeterna, To know thee to be the onely true God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life.</hi> From this uſe or importance of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<hi>ut,</hi> that other, which <hi>Maldonat</hi> makes, is
not different, or no otherwayes different then
the end of a tranſition or paſſage is from the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
or tranſition it ſelfe; as when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſaith <hi>Mat. 23. 34. I ſend unto you Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and wiſemen &amp;c, that upon you may come all
the righteous blood ſhed upon the earth from the blood
of righteous Abel, &amp;c.</hi> God forbid any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſhould referre this particle <hi>That</hi> unto the
firſt words, Behold I ſend unto you Prophets,
&amp;c, and by this meanes conceive the end and
cauſe why God did ſend wiſemen and Prophets
unto them ſhould be this, that all the righteous
blood ſhed by their Fathers, ſhould be required
of this generation; it refers only to thoſe words,
<hi>Some of them ſhall yee kill and crucifie, &amp;c.</hi> The true
importance is, as if he had ſaid, yee ſhall, or you
will, goe on in your Fathers ſinnes ſo farre and
ſo long, untill at length the blood of all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
whom your Fathers have ſlaine, ſhall come
upon you: Or, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>ſhall be required of
you.</hi> So that the importance of this particle <hi>ut</hi> in
this place denotes the event of their practiſes or
reſolutions, not the finall cauſe of the Prophets
comming unto them. And it is the ſame with that
which S. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes in the infinitive moode
<hi>Rom. 1. 20. For the inviſible things of him from the
creation of the world are clearely ſeene, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by the things that are made, even his eternall
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7898:63"/>
power and Godhead, ſo that they are without excuſe,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The end why God did
manifeſt himſelfe unto men in the booke of his
Creatures was, that they might know him to be
God, and glorifie him as God. And it was the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
meaſure of manifeſtations made to this end,
which left even the Heathens themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Apologie or juſt excuſe; and according to
this importance of the particle <hi>ut,</hi> (as it noteth
onely the event or ſome tranſition to the event)
many good writers would value that of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
chap. 12. 37, 38. <hi>Though he had done ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
before them, yet they beleeved not on him. That
the ſaying of</hi> Eſaias <hi>the Prophet might bee fulfilled
which he ſpake,</hi> ut impleretur ille ſermo; <hi>Lord who
hath beleeved our report, and to whom hath the arme
of the Lord beene revealed.</hi> And I could wiſh, that
<hi>Maldonats</hi> animadverſions upon the forecited 35.
verſe of <hi>Mathew</hi> the 13. had beene as Orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or diſcreet, as they are upon this place of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
For of ſuch Commentators as I have read, none
ſpeakes more pertinently or more diſcreetly to
the difficultie wherewith that place is charged,
unleſſe it be his brother <hi>Tolet,</hi> who hammers out
<hi>Athanaſius</hi> his expoſition as learnedly (and more
fully) as <hi>Maldonat</hi> doth upon the expoſitions of
other Greeke Fathers. However, I cannot aſſent
to them, or to any others, in this one point,
in that they would make the particle <hi>ut,</hi>
here, (as elſewhere it doth) to poynt onely
at the event, not any cauſe. That it cannot in this
place denote the finall cauſe, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> carryes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7898:64"/>
it clearely againſt ſome heretiques of his time
or before him, who did ſo interpret it; who
yet ſpake conſequently enough to their wicked
opinions in that they acquit theſe unbeleeving
Jewes from blame and lay their charge upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayas,</hi>
whoſe prediction, they thought, did either
cauſe or inferre the neceſſity of theſe Jewes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie,
after ſo many glorious miracles as had
beene done by our Saviour in their ſight.</p>
                  <p>5. But that this particle, <hi>ut,</hi> doth in this place
denote and import more then the event, that it
refers unto ſome true Cauſe, is moſt evident, in
that the uſe of it ver. 38. is, in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> meaning,
aequivalent to that other particle uſed by him
ver. 39, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>Therefore they could not beleeve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Iſaiah ſaid againe</hi> &amp;c. Now that this particle,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>therefore, ideo, quia, and ſuch like,</hi> do alwaies
referre immediately unto ſome true cauſe, wee
cannot deny without ſome wrong to <hi>Priſcian</hi> or
without ſome <hi>non obſtante,</hi> or ſuch licentious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
(as it is ſaid a Pope once gave) <hi>ut fiatur
contra omnes grammaticos.</hi> It is certaine againe,
that neither particle doth immediately referre
to any reall cauſe of the thing it ſelfe avouched
by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> or that <hi>Eſaias</hi> his ſaying, or the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, ſhould be any cauſe at all of the Jewes
infidelity, neither the principall cauſe (as the
Heretiques whom <hi>Athanaſius</hi> refutes, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
nor any acceſſory or leſſe principall cauſe,
as ſome moderne writers imagine, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Maldonat</hi>
(without naming them) well confutes. But wee
ſhould conſider how that which is the true effect
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7898:64"/>
of ſome reall cauſe, is oft-times the true cauſe of
our true knowledge or apprehenſion of the cauſe
it ſelfe, or of its connexion with the effect: and
ſuch a cauſality theſe and the like cauſall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
or <hi>conjunctions, ideo, quia, propter, &amp;c</hi> do uſually
import. As if one which had never ſeene the King
or Court before, ſhould ſay, Sure this is the King,
becauſe the reſt ſtand bare before him: this
ſpeech imports a true cauſe not of the thing it
ſelfe avouched, or why this is the King, but of the
parties knowledge or notice of him as King. And
ſo we know that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had many
ſinnes forgiven her becauſe ſhe loved much: but
her love was the effect not the cauſe of this plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
forgiveneſſe, as the more intelligent ſort of
Pontifician writers now grant, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the text will clearely evince it, againſt
all that ſhall avouch it to be any more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a cauſe
of our knowledge. However ſeeing every cauſe is
a cauſe of ſome effect, or referres to ſome things
produced or occaſioned by it, The queſtion ſtill
remaines of what effect the fulfilling of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi>
prophecy, or the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation of the event which
he foretold, ſhould be the true cauſe, if it were no
cauſe at all of theſe Jewes infidelity?</p>
                  <p>6 The ſerious contemplation of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſaying after the holy Ghoſt had called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and the matter which they ſo have fitted unto
our Evangeliſts minde, was a true cauſe why he
did ceaſe to wonder at the ſtupiditie of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For if <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had not long before decyphered
their froward &amp; ſtubborne diſpoſition, poſterity
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7898:65"/>
would have ſuſpected either that S. <hi>Iohns</hi> taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their ſtupidity had beene more hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
than true, or elſe that our Saviours miracles
had not beene ſo all ſufficient in themſelves, as
the Evangeliſt makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for winning crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to
his doctrine, or reſpect unto his perſon. But ſeeing
nothing breakes forth in this laſt generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe
ſeeds &amp; roots had not beene diſcovered by <hi>Iſaias</hi>
in their forefathers, this takes away all occaſion
in poſterity to ſuſpect either the truth of S. <hi>Iohns</hi>
narration, or ſufficiency of our Saviours mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
No theſe cauſall particles onely, as, <hi>ut,</hi> or,
<hi>propter,</hi> but adverſative alſo, as <hi>verunt amen, ſed,</hi>
doe ſometimes referre not to any written clauſe
or ſentence precedent, or any matter conteined
in them, but unto the ſecret or tacite thoughts
of the writer or ſpeaker, or to ſome ſtrong affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſeeking to vent it ſelfe in ſuch abrupt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall
language. To begin a ſpeech with <hi>nam</hi> or
<hi>veruntamen</hi> would be a ridiculous ſoloeciſme, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it were by way of decorum in ſome appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

theſe two cauſall ſpeeches <hi>[ut impleretur ille
ſermo Iſaiae,</hi> Joh. 12. <hi>Propterea non potuerunt credere
&amp;c.]</hi> referre to theſe or the like precedent cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> 
                     <q>Is it poſſible that men of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
linage, that any creatures indued with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſhould not beleeve, after ſo many miracles
done in their ſight?</q> Yes, I know it to be more
then poſſible, becauſe the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath
foretold as much. Yea, but S. <hi>Iohn</hi> goes further,
and ſayes, <hi>they could not beleeve becauſe</hi> Iſaiah
<hi>had foretold their unbeleife.</hi> Yet if wee ſcan his
words aright, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth not reſolve the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
or difficulty of their unbeliefe into <hi>Eſaias</hi>

ſpake</hi> Eſaias, <hi>when he ſaw his glory.</hi> The moſt that
can be made of theſe words, the ſtrongeſt colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that can be inferred from them, for infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any divine cauſality of their unbeleife, will
amount to no more then this; It is not poſſible
that the greateſt part of men in our times ſhould
underſtand many divine truths about which they
diſpute, or be wiſe unto ſalvation; becauſe it is
ſaid by a good Author, [Wiſdome cannot enter
into a froward heart.] This <hi>ſpeech</hi> is Canonically
true of all ſuch men <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> that is, whileſt
they continue perverſe and froward, but not true
<hi>iu ſenſu diviſo.</hi> for though it were abſolutely true,
that it is impoſſible for wiſedome to enter into a
froward heart, yet it is poſſible for a froward heart
to put off frowardneſſe, and for ſuch as are now a
ſtifnecked and ſtubborne people in good time to
brooke the yoake of Chriſtian obedience.</p>
                  <p>7 But doth this period of S. <hi>Iohn [after ſo many
miracles done before them, they did not beleeve, that
the ſaying of</hi> Eſaias <hi>might be fulfilled]</hi> import no
more than if a man ſhould ſay, the factious ſpirits
of our times cannot beleeve aright, becauſe it is
written that <hi>wiſdome cannot enter into a froward
heart?</hi> In <hi>Maldonats</hi> expoſition on this place of S.
<hi>Iohn,</hi> and of that other <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 34. &amp;c, <q>this is
the utmoſt value of both allegations [that the
Prophets words do ſo well fit the eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts related
by theſe two Evangeliſts, as that they could not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7898:66"/>
fit them better although 'twere granted that it
were meant of them alone, or had beene ſpoken
to no other end, than to notifie theſe two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</q>]
Yet if we may have the libertie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the Prophets meaning, or to ſpeake conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
unto the truth it ſelfe (acknowledged by
all good Chriſtians) or to ſome ſpeciall truths for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
delivered, the prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> alleaged
by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> was in a more peculiar manner fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the ſtrange infidelity of the Jewes which
ſaw our Saviours miracles, then any Proverbs of
<hi>Salomon</hi> or other generall Maximes can be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or verified of any miſbeleevers in theſe our
times, either of ſuch as deny Chriſt in expreſſe
words, or confeſſing him in words deny him in
deeds. For the words of <hi>Salomon</hi> or other moral
ſayings of Canonicall writers, how well ſoever
they may fit the errors or infidelity of our times,
had no punctuall aſpect to them, but were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as abſolute truths without reſpect of age, time,
or perſons, and fit all men and every ſort of men,
of what condition, age, or nation ſoever they be.
Whereas the former forecited prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
was punctually or literally meant of the Jewiſh
Nation, which lived after his time unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the City and Temple, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
of the Babiloniſh captivitie. For ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
in the 6. chap. ver. 10. <hi>Make the heart of
this people fat, and make their eares heavie, and ſhut
their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and heare with
their eares, and underſtand with their hearts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
and be healed. Then ſaid I, Lord, how long? And
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7898:67"/>
he ſaid, untill the cities be waſted without inhabitants,
and the houſes without man, and the land be utterly
deſolate: and the Lord have removed men farre away,
and there be a great forſaking in the middeſt of the
Land. But yet in it ſhall be a tenth, and it ſhall return
and ſhall bee eaten, as a Teyle tree and as an Oake,
whoſe ſubſtance is in them when they caſt their leaves:
ſo the holy ſeed ſhall be the ſubſtance thereof.</hi> This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
prophecy was more exactly fulfilled in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cecation
and obduration of the Jewes which did
not beleeve our Saviours miracles, and in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
of Judea which enſued upon his death.
But whether the laſt part of this prophecy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their returne againe to God, ſhall bee as
exactly fulfilled in theſe out-caſts of Iſrael, future
times would better reſolve us or ſuch as ſhall live
after us, then any living interpreter of Scriptures
can. With this queſtion S. <hi>Iohn</hi> meddles not, but
beſides that the former part of that prophecy
doth according to the literall ſenſe as truly point
at this later generation of the Jewes, as at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
The reall event it ſelfe or matter of fact
foretold was more conſpicuouſly remarkable in
this later generation, then it had beene in the
former: For it was a prediction prophetically
typicall. The firſt deſolation was ſuch a reall type
of the later, as <hi>Iſraels</hi> caſting off God from being
their ruler in the time of <hi>Samuel,</hi> was of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
abrenunciation of Chriſt which theſe later
Jewes made before <hi>Pilate,</hi> when they cryed; <hi>Wee
have no King but Caeſar.</hi> Or the like deſolation
was ſuch a <hi>Criſis</hi> of that deadly diſeaſe, whereof
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7898:67"/>
the excecation and obduration mentioned by S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> was the ſymptome, as that calamity which
befell <hi>Iudah</hi> the next yeare after <hi>Zacharias</hi> death
was, of the calamity which befell the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
within forty yeares after our Saviours death.</p>
                  <p>8. So then the particle <hi>Vt,</hi> neither in this place
of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor in any other, doth ever import a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
true cauſality of excecation or obduration on
Gods part or his Prophets; but in this place of
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and in every other, where it is ſaid, <hi>[that
this or that was done that the Scripture might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled]</hi>
the ſame particle doth alwayes import, that
whatſoever was ſo done, whether poſitively or
directly by God himſelfe, or with permiſſion of
his juſt providence, by the poſitive intentions of
Sathan or incorrigible ſtubbornneſſe of men, was
alwayes ordered by God to this end and purpoſe
that poſterity might beleeve and know, no ſuch
event did follow by chance, or that the Prophet
did foretell ſuch events only in generall, without
ſpeciall reference unto the particular events rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Evangeliſt. Seing every finall cauſe is
purpoſed or projected by ſome intelligent nature,
one and the ſame particle, <hi>That,</hi> or the like, with
reference to ſeverall projectures, may ſometimes
denote a true finall cauſe, ſometimes the event
or conſequent only, in one and the ſame propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as in that of our Saviour <hi>Matth. 23. 34. Some
of them you ſhall kill and crucifie; &amp;c. that upon you
may come all the righteous blood ſhed upon the earth,</hi>
The finall cauſe projected by Sathan, was to bring
righteous blood upon theſe Jewes, but this was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7898:68"/>
the event or conſequent only, no finall cauſe, of
their projects againſt Gods meſſengers: But theſe
meſſengers were ſent by God onely to this end,
that they might recall his people to their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
yet this end or purpoſe did include this
condition, that if they continued or made up the
meaſure of their Fathers ſtubbornneſſe, they were
to ſuffer more grievous puniſhment, then if they
had not beene forewarned by the Prophets. In
like manner the excecation and obduration of
theſe later Jewes was the marke at which Satan
aimed, no true cauſe (though a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent)
of their continued abuſe of that talent
which God had given them; but no finall cauſe,
no cauſe at all why our Saviour did ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
amongſt them: their excecation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was from themſelves.</p>
                  <p>9. That Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and that other of
our Saviours <hi>Matt. 23. 35. that upon you may come
all the righteous blood,</hi> (or as S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath the ſame
prediction more emphatically,) <hi>Verily I ſay unto
you it ſhall be required of this generation:</hi> both theſe
and the like were conformable to that generall
rule delivered by <hi>Ieremie, Chap. 18. ver. 7, 8. At
what inſtant I ſhall ſpeake concerning a Nation, and
concerning a Kingdome, to pluck up and to pull downe,
and to deſtroy it: If that Nation againſt whom I have
pronounced, turne from their evill, I will repent of the
evill that I thought to doe unto them.</hi> And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
prediction <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 31. though the words
may ſeeme moſt peremptory, did implicitely
conteine or admit the ſame condition, which he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7898:68"/>
in another prediction of his to the ſame effect
doth expreſſe <hi>Luke 13. 3. I tell you nay, but except
you repent yee ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> that is, periſh
after the ſame diſaſtrous manner that the Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
there mentioned, or the inhabitants of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
had periſhed. Now however the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> or <hi>Zacharias</hi> his imprecation when
he dyed; were no true cauſes of this peoples infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
or deſtruction, yet in as much as what they
threatned, though with this condition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo
<hi>[Vnleſſe they doe repent]</hi> did ſo exactly come
to paſſe, the event is of moſt concludent proofe
to us that they ſpake by the Spirit of God; a true
cauſe of our knowledge that they were Prophets
indeed, and that theſe events were not cauſuall in
reſpect of their predictions, though in themſelves
contingent, or holding the true meane betweene
neceſſity of being, and neceſſity of not being.</p>
                  <p>10. But the beſt way to convince them of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
who teach that prophecies are ſometimes
ſaid to be fulfilled only by alluſion, will be, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the particular manner how theſe places at
which they ſtumble moſt, doe conclude what the
Evangeliſts rather intimate, then fully expreſſe.
For ſo it was the will of God, that even the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts
themſelves ſhould oft times only give us
hints for ſearching out thoſe demonſtrations of
the ſpirit, which they perfectly knew, but would
not ſet downe at large, leſt this ſhould occaſion
ſloathfull negligence in ſucceeding ages, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
our admiration at the exact conſonancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Propheticall predictions and evangelicall
narrations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:7898:69"/>
To conclude this preſent treatiſe: it is alwayes
more ſafe for the moſt learned expoſitor of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to ſay, [I doe not conceive how this or that
allegation doth conclude, or how this or that
prophecy was exactly fulfilled] then perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to avouch of any particular alleaged by the
Evangeliſt, that it was no concludent proofe but
alluſive only, becauſe he, or ſuch as he hath read,
cannot conceive how it is fulfilled. It is hard for
any one man to ſee or heare all that hath beene
ſaid or written by others upon any parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but it may be eaſie for others that come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to ſay ſomewhat in arguments of this nature,
which no one before had ſaid or obſerved, yea
ſomewhat more then the Prophet himſelfe did
diſtinctly foreſee, when he ſpake or wrote theſe
very words which the Evangeliſts ſay were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>

part of this probleme, not only
as true in it ſelfe, but as one ſpeciall
ground of difference betweene the
Prophets of the Lord, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Soothſayers or Diviners, which ſometimes
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7898:69"/>
foretold that which afterwards proved true,<note place="margin">Cap. 16</note> but
without any apprehenſion of the truth of it. That
Heathen Diviners did ſometimes rave, or ſpeake
they knew not what, in their divinations, I will
not deny; that they did alwayes thus; is more
then I can affirme. However, betweene raving
predictions and a diſtinct apprehenſion or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
of matters foretold, there is a greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
then between ſtaring and being ſtark mad.
That the Prophets of the Lord did never rave in
their predictions, that they had alwayes a true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of the truth delivered by them, and a
foreſight of the events future which they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
I reſt aſſured. But that this foreſight ſhould
extend to all the branches of truth, which are ſaid
to come to paſſe, that their ſayings might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
I ſee no convincent argument to perſwade
me. The contradictory to his aſſertion, (if any be
pleaſed to undertake it) we thus inferre. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts
and Apoſtles, or others enabled to
preach the Goſpell with power from above, men
viſibly annointed with the holy Ghoſt to this
function, were bound to teach no other things
than what had beene foretold by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the
Prophets. And yet the Evangeliſts both knew
and taught others to beleeve many things, which
the<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 13. 17. For verily I ſay unto you, that many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and righteous men have deſired to ſee thoſe things which yee ſee, and have not ſeen them; and to heare thoſe things which yee heare and have not heard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Prophets, even the<note n="c" place="margin">See Lu. 10. 24. For many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Kings have deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſee thoſe things which yee ſee, and have not ſeen them &amp;c.</note> Kingly Prophets, much
deſired but could not be admitted to ſee or heare.
And this is a concludent proofe, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
did not alwayes diſtinctly foreſee or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all things which were foretold by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not
thoſe events which the Spirit of God ſaith came
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7898:70"/>
to paſſe that their ſayings might be fulfilled. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
they muſt have ſeene all that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts
ſaw, have knowne all the myſteries of the
Kingdome of heaven, which the Apoſtles after
our Saviours reſurrection knew or taught: but
this is directly contradictory to our Saviours aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion;
and whatſoever is contradictory to truth
it ſelfe muſt of neceſſity be untrue. Wherein then
did the Prophets of the Lord differ from heathen
Soothſayers or raving Diviners?</p>
                  <p>2. He that can make a good conſtruction of
what he ſpeakes or writes, cannot be ſaid to rave,
albeit he know not the iſſue or full importance
of things uttered by him. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> did not rave
when he ſaid, it <hi>was expedient that one man ſhould
die for the people rather then all ſhould periſh.</hi> Yet
was he no Prophet, although (as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us)
he did in this ſpeech prophecy. For hee did not
intend or take upon him to foretell any unuſuall
matter or divine myſtery, but only give his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall
adviſe or <hi>placet</hi> concerning the buſineſſe
then in hand. Any worldly wiſeman might have
ſpoken as wiſely as he did. That his ſpeeches
then did prove ſo happily ominous as they did,
this was meerely from the extraordinary diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of divine providence. He neither ſpake as
heathen Diviners did when they raved, nor as
the Prophets of the Lord uſed to ſpeake whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they foretold things to come in the name
of the Lord. For they alwayes had a true inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to foretell ſuch things, and to give aſſurance
unto the people that whatſoever they foretold
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7898:70"/>
in the name of the Lord ſhould come to paſſe,
whether their predictions were for forme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
disjunctive; or whether they were abſolute
and peremptory, that is, not charged with condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
exceptions, or Proviſoes either implicite or
explicite. Somewhat then they alwayes expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foreſaw, as often as they tooke upon them to
foretell or foreſhew things to come, but ſeldome
did they know all which came to paſſe, that their
ſaying might be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>3. The Probleme propoſed cannot be diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolved without a review of the different
wayes or manner how things future were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by the Prophets. Now of divine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
or predictions ſome were meerely prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
others prophetically typicall, and both
theſe ſtemmes againe did divide themſelves into
more branches. Some predictions meerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
were delivered in a plaine grammaticall
or hiſtoricall ſenſe of words, others in termes
allegoricall or enigmaticall. Of ſuch predictions
meerely propheticall as are expreſſed in the
plaine grammaticall or hiſtoricall ſenſe of words,
ſome did referre to one matter or fact, or to ſome
determinate point of time, and in the intention
of the holy Ghoſt were to be but once fulfilled.
Others according to the ſame literall ſenſe were
to be fulfilled (ſometimes in the ſame; ſometimes
in a different meaſure) oftner than once, at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times, and in ſeverall ages. Of ſuch predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as were to be but once fulfilled, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the plaine literall ſenſe, this affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7898:71"/>
is univerſally true; [The Prophets had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a diſtinct knowledge or apprehenſion of
the ſumme or ſubſtance of the events which are
ſaid to come to paſſe that their ſaying might be
fulfilled.] Search all the predictions of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Incarnation, Nativity, Circumciſion, of his
Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
places in the Prophets doe literally referre
to theſe points, were to be but once fulfilled. For
our Saviour was to be but once incarnate, but
once to be borne, to die but once, to be raiſed
from death once for all. Now if the Prophets
which did literally foretell theſe things, had not
diſtinctly foreſeene the ſubſtance (at leaſt) of
theſe Evangelicall myſteries, they muſt either
have raved in their predictions (as it is preſumed
the heathen prophets or <hi>Apollo's</hi> prieſts uſed to
doe) or elſe have foretold them onely after ſuch a
manner as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> did foretell his death. And
the fulfilling of their prophecies, though accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their plaine literall aſſertive ſenſe, could
not prove them to have been Prophets properly
ſo called, that is, men indowed with the true
ſpirit of divination. For no man I thinke will ſay,
that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was thus qualified, although hee
propheſied in ſome ſort of our Saviours death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſurely did foreſee that the promiſed
ſeed ſhould be conceived of a pure Virgin, when
he uttered that prophecy <hi>chap.</hi> 31. 22. So did
<hi>Eſaias</hi> foreſee, that the Meſſias, whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
expected, ſhould be deſpiſed of many,
ſhould be a <hi>man of ſorows,</hi> ſhould dye and riſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7898:71"/>
againe, when he uttered that Prophecy <hi>chap. 35.
v.</hi> 3. But we have not the like inducement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that hee did ſo diſtinctly apprehend that
the expected Meſſias ſhould be brought up in
<hi>Nazareth,</hi> although this was foretold by him,
<hi>chap.</hi> 11. 1. not in the plaine literall ſenſe, but enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically.</p>
                  <p>4 Where the prediction, according to the plaine
literall ſenſe, was in the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Ghoſt
to bee oftner fulfilled than once, the Prophet w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
foretold it, did alwaies diſtinctly foreſee the eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in the firſt place foretold, or the firſt fulfilling of
his own predictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There is not the like neceſſity
for us to beleeve or think that he had the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
foreſight or apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe events in
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> one &amp; the ſelfeſame prophecy was the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
third, or fourth time to be fulfilled. <hi>Eſaias</hi> diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foreſaw the future inclination of theſe Jewes
by their preſent diſpoſition to draw neere to
God with their lips and bee farre from him in
their hearts, and that their hypocriſie (if continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
would worke their deſtruction; otherwiſe he
had but raved, or but ſpoken by gueſſe, but that
the matter of this his reproofe or Propheticall
admonition ſhould be more exactly fulfilled of
the Jewes ſixe hundred yeares after his time, as it
was; wee cannot determine whether he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
this or no. In that viſion made unto him, chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the 6. he diſtinctly foreſaw this peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to winke withtheir eyes, &amp; to harden their
hearts unto their own deſtruction and deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of their Country; &amp; out of his diſtinct foreſight
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7898:72"/>
hereof, hee did deliver his meſſage in an impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſenſe, <hi>excaeca, obdur a, make blinde their eyes and
harden their hearts,</hi> which in the propheticall uſe
of theſe words is uſually as much (but no more) as
if he had ſaid, I am commanded to forewarne
you of ſuch a ſpirit of ſlumber and hardneſſe of
heart now creeping upon you, that (unleſſe you
repent) your Cities ſhall be deſolate, &amp;c. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
we reſume what we formerly granted, and
cannot now deny, that <hi>Eſaias</hi> had a diſtinct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of our Saviours death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet whether he had the like diſtinct apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or foreſight of that excecation and obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his people, which did preſage the ſecond
deſolation of Jeruſalem and deſtruction of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Temple, as he had of the former made by
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> is queſtionable. And the more
probable part of the queſtion is, that he had not.
Of the returne of <hi>Iudah</hi> from the Babyloniſh
Captivity <hi>Eſaias</hi> (as appeares from the 6. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
had a true prenotion: yet neither ſo full nor
diſtinct as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> had, when he ſaw
the Captivity come upon them. For from the
booke of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> not of <hi>Iſaiah, Daniel</hi> (a Prophet
no way inferiour to either of them) learned the
diſtinct time of his captived peoples returne to
their owne Land. As for the time of the ſecond
Temples deſtruction, or for the deſtruction of it
at all: that <hi>Daniel</hi> did neither learne from the
prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> or of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> or of any bookes
before extant; for it was revealed unto him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the Author of truth himſelfe, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7898:72"/>
after ſuch a manner as that we cannot reaſonably
imagine, either the ſubſtance or circumſtance of
what was then revealed, to have beene knowne
to any Prophet before him. And yet it is true,
that divers prophecies both of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
were more exactly fulfilled in the deſolation
of Judah by <hi>Titus,</hi> than they had beene fulfilled
in the former deſolation by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5 But predictions prophetically typicall (as
well as teſtimonies meerely propheticall) were
of two ſorts. In ſome ſuch predictions the plaine
literall ſenſe did fit the antitype as well as it did
the type; as in the prediction before mentioned.
<hi>I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a ſon;</hi> &amp;
in the like Pſal. 72. In others the literall inſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
did fit the type only according to the plaine lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
or logicall ſenſe; and the antitype only in the
morall or ſymbolicall ſenſe. Of both ſorts it is
true that the Prophets alwaies had a view or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of that which was immediately fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
according to the literall ſenſe or of the firſt
fulfilling of it; the caſe is the ſame as it was in
teſtimonies meerely propheticall. But of that
which was immediately ſignified not by words
but by ſome matter of fact or hiſtoricall event,
whereto the words in the literall ſenſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
referre, of ſuch ſecond events, or of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of the Prophecy both according to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
and myſticall ſenſe, the Prophets had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a diſtinct foreſight or apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Such as
they ſometimes had, was by extraordinary privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or diſpenſation, it was no neceſſary appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7898:73"/>
of the ordinary gift of prophecy; leſſe appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
thereon than the prenotion or foreſight of
the ſecond or third event was upon the foreſight
or apprehenſion of the firſt. For in that caſe the
ſame prophecy, though often fulfilled, was yet
alwayes fulfilled onely according to a fuller im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
or growth of the ſame literall ſenſe,
without the intervention or mixture of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> could properly be called a real type
or map of that which afterwards hapned. As, if
the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did not by vertue of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
gift of the Spirit foreſee the ſecond or third
remarkable fulfilling of that prophecy; <hi>This people
draw neere me with their lips, but are farre from me
in their hearts;</hi> it is leſſe probable that the Prophet

Lord liveth which brought the children of Iſrael out
of the Land of Aegypt; but the Lord liveth, which
brought up the houſe of Iſrael out of the North Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
&amp;c. Ierem.</hi> 23. 7, 8. For in the ſecond fulfilling
of this prophecy, beſides the improveme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation
of the literall ſenſe, there was an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of matter of fact or type.</p>
                  <p>6 Againe, if it be doubtfull whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
had alwaies or for the moſt part ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
foreſight of the antitype as they had of the
type, or if it be more probable that they had no
ſuch apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the antitype, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the literall
ſenſe of their words did (though in a different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree)
truely fit both; then is there no probability
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7898:73"/>
that they ſhould foreſee the ſecond accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch prophecies as no way reach the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype
in the plaine literall or grammaticall ſenſe,
but by ſymbolicall or Emblematicall importance.
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> no doubt, had a cleare foreſight of <hi>Eliakims</hi>
admiſſion into <hi>Shebnah's</hi> office, whoſe depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he likewiſe foreſaw: But that he foreknew the
harmony betweene the depoſition of <hi>Shebnah</hi>
(which he knew would ſhortly be fulfilled) and
the rejection of the Jewiſh Rulers, or betweene
<hi>Eliakims</hi> advancement and our Saviours exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
after his reſurrection, wee have no probable
inducement to beleeve; but inducements many
to perſwade us that the foreknowledge of things
thus foreprophecied and foreſhadowed, was
for the moſt part reſerved unto the holy Spirit,
not imparted to the Prophets, who in foretelling
or foreſhadowing the antitype were for the moſt
part his Organs onely, though his Agents in the
prediction of the type, and did ingage their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits
only for the firſt fulfilling of the Prophecies
or for their fulfilling in generall. Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the knowledge of the Spirit of
God, and the Prophets whom he did imploy in
repreſentation of myſteries to come, wee may
have a proportionable ſcale in the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the extraordinary Herauld, or other inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of ſuch devices as they give, and the ordinary
Painter. An ordinary Scholar that ſhould ſee a
painted Eclipſe of the ſun with this inſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
adimit quo ingrata refulget,</hi> would eaſily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that this word <hi>ingrata</hi> refers to the Moone;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7898:74"/>
but what ingratitude or ingratefull perſon the
Moone in this deviſe ſhould repreſent, that hee
could not learne from ſkill in painting but from
the hiſtory of the times, or from the Author of
this deviſe, which (to my remembrance) was an
Italian Prince, who had beene brought under a
cloud, much prejudiced in his honour &amp; fortunes
by an unthankfull plant of his ſtocke, whom his
favour and countenance had advanced to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a Cardinall. Or if one ſhould intreat a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Painter to repreſent three ſmall veſſels in the
ſame river, diſtant one from another neere upon
the ſame line, one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> uſing the furtherance of
oares and winde to goe ſpeedily againſt the
ſtreame, another the benefit of oares to outrunne
the ſtreame, and a third in the middle moving
neither ſwiftlier nor ſlowlier then the ſtreame it
ſelfe doth, with this motto or inſcription, <hi>videor
occurſari utriſque,</hi> the ingroſſer of this deviſe from
his owne experience would eaſily conceave the
truth of the inſcription in the grammaticall or
naturall conſtruction of the words, and might
conjecture in generall, that they imported ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than a bare repreſentation of what
we ſee by dayly experience verified of things
floating in the water. For whileſt we row ſwiftly
by them, we thinke they come againſt us, when
they goe the ſame way which wee doe, but
more gently. And this is the condition of ſuch
men in our times as will not combine with facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſpirits, either with ſuch as by helpe of Arts
and other potency directly oppoſe the truth, or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7898:74"/>
ſuch as follow it with furious zeale or indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He that ſeekes to hold the middle courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
theſe oppoſites, regulating as well his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
as his opinions by the placide current of
the water of life, neither ſtriving againſt it, nor
ſeeking to outrunne it, ſhall be thought to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
both parties and come in danger of being
cruſht betweene them. But this morall is more
then the ingroſſer of ſuch a deviſe could appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
without further inſtruction then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of his owne work, or the grammaticall ſenſe
of the inſcription (ſuppoſe he underſtood Latine)
would afford him. Now the Prophets in many
caſes were but the ingroſſers of ſuch viſions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
of myſteries to come, as the holy
Ghoſt did dictate unto them, whether by word
or matter of fact, or both wayes. The full impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of many ſuch repreſentations neither was,
nor could be revealed, ſave onely by him which
had the ſpirit of prophecy not by meaſure.</p>
                  <p>7. If <hi>Enoch, Moſes, Elias</hi> and the whole fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Prophets which foretold our Saviours
comming (whether firſt or ſecond) had beene
ſpectators of all his miracles, or eare-witneſſes of
all his words; every one of them would have
learned more from him, then all of them knew
before. Each of them would have beene able to
make better conſtruction of one anothers words,
then any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without his interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, could
have made of his own. It is a lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in many interpreters, not to obſerve or ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manifeſt proofes which our Saviour gave
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7898:75"/>
of his immenſe prophetick ſpirit, from which,
for the moſt part, they gather only morall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and uſes. For that ſaying though delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Authors not Canonicall, is yet canonicall
and univerſally true, <hi>Never ſpake man like this man.</hi>
And thus hee ſpake as well in interpretation of
propheticall predictions or legall Ceremonies, as
in his expoſitions of the morall Law.</p>
                  <p>8. Briefely then, if wee had no better inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of the Prophets then the Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or no clearer apprehenſion of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
now exhibited then they had when they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
them; this would bee ſufficient to confirme
our faith, that they ſpake by the Spirit of God;
more then ſufficient to leave us without excuſe, if
we ſhould not glorifie Chriſt as God: but when
it is ſaid that we are built upon the foundation of
the Prophets and Apoſtles, the meaning is nor,
that wee are bound to ground our faith only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the actuall apprehenſions or intentions of the
Prophets and Apoſtles, but eſpecially upon the
intent and meaning of the ſacred Spirit by whom
they ſpake and were inſpired. For (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
they were ſometimes or in ſome reſpects
his agents, in others his Organs only: Nor are
we bound to beleeve, that his inſpirations or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
ſuch as concerne the particular point
whereto they ſpake, were alwayes comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by thoſe that were plentifully inſpired by
him. For his inſpirations were oft times more
plentifull then their capacity was, and yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow
not ſpilt, but plentifully diffuſed to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7898:75"/>
in matter of fact or hiſtoricall event,<note place="margin">Cap. 17</note> if wee

                  <p>Laſtly, in thoſe places of propheticall predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which admit either amphibology of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,

will ſufficiently conclude for us in that
great controverſie concerning Chriſts tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall,

For if the heavens muſt containe his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

he neither is nor can be preſent (according to
this nature) in the Sacrament, whileſt it is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated

Lutherane long ſince hath ſhrewdly replyed, by
making a quite contrary conſtruction of the
words alleaged, without alteration of any letter or

the whole ſentence, beſides an equivocall or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

perpetuall Governour of it. But that Heaven doth
ſo indiſpenſably receive or containe our Saviours
body or humane nature, that he may not at any
time goe or be out of it, untill the time of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or the laſt day, is more then any man ſafely
may affirme. Surely he was preſent with S. <hi>Paul</hi>
and was ſeene by him after another manner, then
he is preſent with or ſeene by the Lutheranes or
Papiſts in their Sacraments. And how erroneous
ſoever their doctrines concerning the manner of
Chriſts preſence in the Sacrament be, this text
can be of no great uſe to refute them.</p>
                  <p>2. Yet ſome have replyed upon the Lutheran,
that by the forecited interpretation of this Text,
they make S. <hi>Peter</hi> (a moſt ſacred Writer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe)
to ſpeake in the language of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguouſly

oracles. But this reply, with what eloquence
ſoever it might be preſſed upon the Lutherans,
may by them be as eaſily, and yet as forcibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
upon ſuch as make it. For if it be a fault
to grant that theſe ſacred oracles may admit am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibologies,
or a ſcandall to give ſuch interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
as may occaſion others thus to conceive
of them: the fault and ſcandall (for ought I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
muſt be equally divided betweene the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7898:77"/>
interpreters and their oppoſites. For if
either would yeeld to other in their interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this text, either for the right placing or
conſtruction of the words, or for the various ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of one and the ſame word, there could
be no ſcandall given or taken. Hee in this caſe
gives the greateſt ſcandall, (if a ſcandall it be to
grant Amphibologies in propheticall or Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
writings,) who is moſt peremptory in his
owne opinion, or faſter wedded to the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of his owne ſect or faction. For my ſelfe,
(I thanke God) I can with patience and chriſtian
charity permit either party to imbrace their own
interpretation of this place, being fully reſolved
that to grant either amphibologicall or equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſenſes or both in one, and the ſame ſentence
whether of morall or propheticall writings, can
be no prejudice to that ſacred eſteeme, which all
men ought to have and may have of them. And
he that will take upon him to diſtinguiſh the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by this diviſion or difference, that the
one did admit ambiguous conſtructions (whether
for amphibologies or equivocall ſenſes) which the
other doth not admit, ſhall in this doing neither
much prejudice the heathen <hi>Apollo,</hi> nor much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the Oracles of God.</p>
                  <p>3. To the objection we are to anſwere anon.
Our poſition for the preſent is, that many paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as well in the Prophets, as other ſacred ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
may and doe admit both Amphibologies
and ambiguous ſenſes, and that the ſame prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7898:77"/>
are oft times fulfilled according to both ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
that in the interpretation of morall precepts,
which are ambiguous, we doe not offend, unleſſe
we chuſe the ſiniſter or leſſe ſafe part in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.
It is ſo in this caſe, as in doubtfull opinions:
the one part is uſually more ſafe to bee followed
in practiſe then the other, although there be no
abſolute reſolution whether is ſpeculatively more
true. As ſuppoſe it to be equally probable on both
ſides, whether tithes be due <hi>Iure divino,</hi> or no:
yet it would be the ſafer way for every man to
pay his tithes as duly, as if hee were fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that they were due by Gods peremptory
Law. For ſo long as any doubt remaines, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be due by Gods Law or no; the detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them cannot by any humane law be made
<hi>ex fide,</hi>

                     </gap>, and whatſoever is ſo, is (in
our Apoſtles ſenſe) a moſt grievous ſin. But to
proceed in our aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>4. Two grave and learned<note n="*" place="margin">Angelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus <hi>and</hi> Rupertus.</note> writers in their
times (and their times were ancient in reſpect of
ours) have obſerved an Amphibologie in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
which <hi>Samuel</hi> gave to <hi>Saul</hi> (from Gods
owne mouth queſtionleſſe) 1 <hi>Sam. 10. 8. Thou
ſhalt goe downe before me to Gilgal, and behold I will
come downe unto thee to offer burnt offerings, and to
ſacrifice ſacrifices of peace offerings: ſeaven dayes
ſhalt thou tarry till I come to thee, and ſhew thee what
I will doe.</hi> It was <hi>Sauls</hi> miſfortune, ſhall I ſay, or
miſdemeanour to make choiſe of the worſe part
of that double conſtruction which theſe words
may admit, for this Amphibologie was not <hi>in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7898:78"/>
ſcripto,</hi> but in words uttered, though afterwards
committed to writing. Reaſon might have taught
<hi>Saul,</hi> that if the warre were undertaken, it was to
be adminiſtred likewiſe by the counſell of the
Lord; and therefore he did fooliſhly in adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to offer ſacrifice or doe any other ſolemne
act, before the Prophet (who was the Lords Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
in this buſineſſe) came unto him. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be ſaid Chap. 13. ver. 8. <hi>That he tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeaven dayes, according to the time ſet by Samuel,</hi>
yet in this doing ſurely he did not as <hi>Samuel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him to doe: otherwiſe <hi>Samuel</hi> had done
more fooliſhly of the two. He ſtayed then the
juſt meaſure of that time which <hi>Samuel</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
but he did not obſerve the ſeaſon, the
end, or purpoſe which <hi>Samuel</hi> had appointed.
The ſeaven dayes were appointed him to offer
ſolemne ſacrifice, and if he had not digreſſed from
<hi>Samuels</hi> direction herein, the ſeaven dayes of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
had beene his ſolemne inauguration to the
Kingdome, as may with probability be gathered
from the 13. verſe of the 13. Chapter. <hi>Samuel
ſaid to Saul, thou haſt done fooliſhly: thou haſt not
kept the Commandement of the Lord thy God, which
he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
thy Kingdome upon Iſrael for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. To admit either an Amphibologie in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
by mutuall tranſpoſition of words or clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
or ambiguous ſignification of words by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of points, can be no greater diſparagement
to the ſacred authority of the originall Text, then
the equivocall or ambiguous ſignification of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7898:78"/>
ſame word without any alteration of points or
letter, would occaſion; if either ſort of ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
did juſtly miniſter any ſuch occaſion at all.
Now that the ſelfeſame word, or words, may in
one and the ſame ſentence admit ambiguous and
much different ſignifications, no man that reades
the Scriptures with as much diligence or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
as reverence, can make queſtion. There
is no difference at all betwixt Chriſtians and
Jewes, much leſſe amongſt the Chriſtians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
about letters or poynts in the 8. Pſalme
in that verſe eſpecially. <hi>Thou haſt made him little
lower then the Angels, and haſt crowned him with
glory and honour.</hi> This word <hi>little</hi> admits two
ſenſes grammatically much different, and yet
muſt reſpectively bee interpreted according to
the full purport of both. This Pſalme by the
title and inſcription is a Pſalme of <hi>David,</hi> and
beares the character of <hi>Davids</hi> pen: The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
or matter of it is thankſgiving to God for
his extraordinary favour unto man above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
viſible creatures. That which rayſed his
thoughts to ſuch an high pitch, and his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of them in ſuch a loftie Propheticall ſtraine
as he here uſeth, was his ſerious contemplation
of the beauty of theſe Heavenly bodies, the
Sunne, Moone, and Starres, &amp;c, all which he knew
to be the workes of Gods owne hand: and yet
he ſaw them nothing ſo much regarded by him
as man, even the meaneſt of men <hi>Enoſh</hi> or <hi>Ben
Adam.</hi> The heavens indeed were farre above
men in ſituation or place; but man was further
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7898:79"/>
above them in dignity, than he was below the
Angels or Coeleſtiall Creatures <hi>Elohim.</hi> Now if
we reſpect onely the plaine literall ſenſe of the
Pſalmiſts ſpeech, or conſider it as it reflects onely
upon the hiſtory of the firſt creation, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is an adverbe of quantity, and is
rightly rendred by the Latine <hi>paulò</hi> or <hi>aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulum,</hi>
as it is moſt true, that man by the gift of
creation was <hi>little lower</hi> than the Angels, being
true Lord and King of this inferiour world. But
moſt Pſalmiſts <hi>(David</hi> eſpecially) whileſt they
contemplate the ſacred Hiſtories of times paſt,
not as Polititians doe hiſtories ſoecular, but as
<hi>vates praeteritorum,</hi> as <hi>men rapt with Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
towards their Forefathers, become withall
<hi>vates futurorum,</hi> true Prophets of better things
to come. In this admiration of mans firſt eſtate
which was now loſt, <hi>David</hi> had a view or glimpſe
of his reſtauration to it, or a better: Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his thoughts or apprehenſions for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
were, his expreſſions by diſpoſition of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
providence, reached the manner of mans
reſtitution to it, as they doe the firſt eſtate it
ſelfe from which we fell. And in reſpect of this
myſticall ſenſe the ſame Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> without
any alteration at all, is an adverbe of time, and
is moſt divinely rendred by our Apoſtle <hi>Heb. 2.
5,</hi> 6. &amp;c. <hi>Vnto the Angels hath he not put in
ſubjection the world to come, whereof we ſpeake, but
one in a certaine place teſtified ſaying, What is man
that thou art ſo mindfull of him, or the ſonne of man
that thou viſiteſt him? Thou madeſt him lower for
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7898:79"/>
a little while than the Angels, thou crownedſt him
with glory and honour, and didſt ſet him over the
workes of thy hands. Thou haſt put all things under
his feete, &amp;c.</hi> His inference is admirable: For
albeit the former words, <hi>thou haſt made him but a
little lower than the Angels,</hi> were literally true of
the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> yet were they not verified
in any ſonne of <hi>Adam.</hi> Nor were the words
following <hi>thou haſt given him dominion over the
workes of thy hands &amp;c,</hi> ever fulfilled either in the
firſt man, or in any other creature; nor can they
in their exquiſite ſenſe be applied to any beſide
the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> or ſonne of man <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. He is
now Lord of all, all things are ſubject to him,
even as he is the ſonne of man. And that he
might be thus crowned with glory and honour,
and bring his brethren (miſerable men, and the
ſonnes of miſerable men) unto glory, he was for
<hi>a while to bee made lower than the Angels through
the ſufferings of death,</hi> as our Apoſtle hath it <hi>ver.</hi> 9.
But to bee made lower than the Angels after this
manner, was to be made a great deale lower than
they or the meaneſt of men, as the ſonne of man
was, though but for a little time.</p>
                  <p>6 But the utmoſt extent of that varietie of
ſenſes which may ariſe either from the different
ſignification of one and the ſame word, or from
amphibologie of conſtruction, from diverſitie of
points or change of letters, is not infinite. And
if we ſhould examine all the poſſible changes of
points or letters which the Rabbins or others
imagine, there will not appeare any ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7898:80"/>
throughout the whole Bible, for the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
or moralitie of the ſeverall ſenſes thus occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned,
as the alteration of one poynt often doth
in ſecular writings: not any ſuch as was in that
ambiguous anſwer, which a Biſhop of this Land
ſometimes gave to a wicked propoſall, <hi>Edvardum
occidere nolite timere bonum eſt,</hi> Had be pointed
this ſaying as it might have beene pointed, his
counſell had beene good and Ghoſtly, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the pointing of it to their diſcretion which
aſked his reſolution, his dealing was impious and
diabolicall. But the Founder of an Abbey did
leave this inſcription upon the frontiſpice thus
rightly pointed <hi>Porta patens eſto: nulli claudatur
honeſto:</hi> The turning of one point out of his place
thus, <hi>Porta patens eſto nulli: claudatur honeſto,</hi> did
turne the Abbot (as the tradition is) out of his
place. <hi>Sicque anum ob punctum perdit Robertus
Aſylum.</hi> But the varietie of pointing or changing
letters, which hath beene by divers imagined in
the Hebrew, expoſeth no man to the like danger,
can give no countenance to any lewd or wicked
practiſes. A various reading may ſometimes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or incumber the true myſticall or ſpirituall
ſenſe; it never depraveth the morall ſenſe: and
oftimes againe it furthereth the true and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſenſe. As that place of <hi>Ieremy chap. 25. ver.</hi> 38.
is very ambiguous and variouſly rendred by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
good interpreters. Some read, <hi>the Land ſhall
be deſolate becauſe of the fierceneſſe of the Grecian;</hi>
as if Greece had taken the name of <hi>Iönia</hi> from
the Hebrew <hi>Ionah,</hi> which is the word uſed in that

place. Others, and thoſe of good note, reade, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the fierceneſſe of the Dove;</hi> moſt of moderne
writers read, <hi>becauſe of the fierceneſse of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
or Tyrant.</hi> The participle or the verball (as
ſome good Hebricians obſerve) is both active &amp;
paſſive, either an oppreſſor or an oppreſſed. From
the paſſive ſignification the Dove hath its name
in the Hebrew, becauſe it is ſo ſimple a creature,
expoſed to oppreſſion, without active ability to
oppreſſe others. Howſoever we tranſlate it in
this place or in the like <hi>Ierem.</hi> 46. 16. there will be
no danger in the morall ſenſe, nor no controverſie
about the fulfilling of this prophecy in <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>

it were for his folly after his conqueſt of Aegypt

Both of them might have better reaſons
of the two knowne ſenſes which the originall
might well beare, to chooſe that ſenſe which they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7898:81"/>
imbrace, than I have to approve the contrary. For
however the Dove be a ſilly impotent creature
in it ſelfe, yet was it a nurſing mother (as ſome
ancient writers ſay) unto <hi>Semiramis</hi> that great
Foundreſſe of Babylon, and was the royal enſigne
of the Babyloniſh Empire, ſometimes as terrible
to the Eaſterne Nations, as the Roman Eagles
were to the Weſterne. And it is not unuſuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for ſacred writers, to decipher the tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or revenging power of greateſt Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by their Enſignes, whether theſe were by
nature terrible or weake. And thus our Saviour
himſelfe deſcribes the ſagacity and potency of
the Romane forces by their Enſignes. This latter
reading <hi>à facie columbae</hi> doth much better chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cterize
the ſwiftneſſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

The Prophet in that 46. <hi>cap. v.</hi> 16. implies, that
unleſſe they take their flight in time, they ſhould
wiſh, when it was too late, that they had wings
like a Dove to flye away and be at reſt. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

he aimes at ſome further myſterie, then
the contrary reading which the Hebrew (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

will reach unto. There is as great a difference in
the reading of one or two words, without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of any conſonant, in the laſt verſe of the
ſecond Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> betwixt the vulgar
tranſlation &amp; ours, as in any place which I have

                     </gap> and that the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Iod</hi> was added by negligence of tranſcribers.
Admitting his conjecture to be true, yet it no
way diſparageth the ſincerity of the Hebrew
text, but rather occaſioneth a greater admiration
of the all-ſeeing Providence of the Author of
Scriptures, in repreſenting that devolution of
the price of blood (which <hi>Iudas</hi> rete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred unto the

ſuch brogues or eſcheats as this, were by ordinary

It is but one and the ſame branch of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7898:84"/>
thus to turne the negligence of tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

                  <p>11. Sometimes againe one and the ſame ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
word may have contrary ſignifications, and
have another to parallel it in its contrarietie. So
the Hebrew <hi>Kalal</hi> in its abſtract or firſt ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
anſwers to the Latine <hi>elevare</hi> to be light or

<hi>exaltation</hi> or <hi>advancement.</hi> If we value the
firſt ſignification of it as it is applyable to the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
or juſt ſcale, to be elevated or diſcovered to
be light implies no good, but evill. Yet to be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up or exalted above others, not in juſt bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
but whiles things compared ſtand upon
their owne bottome or Center, includes matter
of glory, or praeeminence. The Hebrew <hi>Cabad</hi>
which in its prime ſignification is contrary to
<hi>Kalal,</hi> and punctually anſwers to the Latine
<hi>Grave eſſe,</hi> or (in our Engliſh) to <hi>be waighty, heavy,
or ſway downewards,</hi> ſo long as the compariſon
ſtands betwixt things weighed in juſt ballance,
argues matter of better value or preeminence.
And hence it is that one &amp; the ſame word which
in its prime ſignification imports waight or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe,
in the next metaphoricall or tranſlated
ſenſe imports praiſe, honour, or glory: yet if we
take it out of the ballance and ſet it in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpeciall reference, it implies depreſſion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7898:84"/>
or ignominy. Now according to the two
contrary ſignifications of each of theſe words,
whoſe prime ſignifications are directly contrary,
that prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cap. 9. ver. 1. was exactly
fulfilled. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

Populus qui ambulabat in obſcuro, vidit lucem

time had beene waighed, as <hi>Balſhazzar</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
was, in the ballance, and were found too
light. They were the firſt which were ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the rod of <hi>Aſhur,</hi> and led Captives into
a ſtrang Land. Yet wore they the firſt into whom
the Goſpel of the Kingdome was preached by our
Saviour himſelfe: and ſo the former prophecy
which had beene in our Prophets time fulfilled of
them according to the prime ſignification of the
Hebrew <hi>Kalal,</hi> which is to be <hi>vile or light,</hi> was in
our Saviours time fulfilled of them according to
the ſecond importance of the ſame word, which
is, to be exalted or advanced; and according to
the firſt tranſlated ſenſe or metaphoricall ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>Cabad</hi> which is to be honourable or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
The former fulfilling of this prophecy yee
have in the ſacred hiſtory 2 <hi>Kings 15. 29. In the

captive to Aſſyria.</hi>
                  </p>

by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> chap. 4. ver. 12, 13. &amp;c. <hi>Now
when Ieſus had heard that Iohn was caſt into priſon,
he departed into Galilee: and leaving Nazareth, hee
came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Sea
coaſt in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthali: that it
might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by Iſaias the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſaying. The Land of Zabulon and the Land of
Nepthali, by the way of the Sea beyong Iordan, Galilee
of the Gentiles; The people which ſate in darkneſſe,
ſaw great light, and tathem which ſate in the region
and ſhadow of death, light is ſprung up,</hi> But as <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulon</hi>
and <hi>Nepthali</hi> changed their mindes or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt, whom at firſt they honoured; ſo the
words of this prophecy did change their ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and were fulfilled of them againe in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſenſe. It was their glory that they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated
or lift up to heaven, at our Saviours firſt
comming to them: is was their ignominy and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
that they afterwards became <hi>graves</hi> or <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vati,</hi>
preſſed downe with their ſinnes to hell. For
unto this place of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> that ſpeech
of our Saviour refertes <hi>Matt. 11. 20. &amp;c. Then
beganne he to upbraid the Cities, wherein moſt of his
mighty workes were done, becauſe they repented not.
Woe unto thee Cherazin, woe unto thee Bethſaida:
for if the mighty works which were done in you, had
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7898:85"/>
beene done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
long agoe in ſackcloth and aſhes. But I ſay unto
you, it ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in
the day of judgement, then for you. And thou Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum
which art exalted unto heaven, ſhalt be brought
downe to hell: for it the mighty workes, which have
beene done in thee, had beene done in Sodome, it would
have remained unto this day. But I ſay unto you, that
it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodome in the
day of Iudgement then for thee.</hi> In this our Saviour
did ſpeake as never man ſpake, and manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

without ſome ſkill, either experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
or ſpeculative, in meaner faculties. Moſt of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7898:87"/>
the parables uttered by our Saviour, albeit wee
take them with his owne expoſitions of them to
his diſciples, can hardly be underſtood by beſt
Divines of theſe times, unleſſe they be weighed
with the matter or ſubject whereon the parable
is grounded, or to which his ſpeeches in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
referre. No parable is more clearely expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
than the parable of the ſower; and yet many
good interpreters have erred in the expoſition of
it; and from this errour have made the Land of
Jewry (whilſt Gods temporall bleſſing was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it) to be envied for its fruitfulneſſe in reſpect
of others. To reape twentie buſhells of Corne
for one of ſeed, exceeds the rate of fertile ſoiles
amongſt us; and yet this is the loweſt ſcantling
of that increaſe which the ſeede ſowne in good
ground did bring forth. But if wee meaſure the
increaſe mentioned in the parable, not from the
meaſure of the ſeed which is ſowne and reapt,
but from the particular graines which tooke
roote and proſpered in good ground, wee ſhall
ſhall have no cauſe to accuſe our owne fields of
Barrenneſſe in reſpect of Judea. For one graine
in ſome parts of this Kingdome (not the moſt
fertile) yeelds more then ſeaventie, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the ſame Land yeeld not twentie, and
ſome it may be in other places above an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred.</p>
                  <p>5 Hee that knowes not ſo much in the art of
grafting, as that the graft doth ſweeten the ſap
and moiſture, which it receives from the ſtocke,
not participating of its ſowreneſſe, ſhall hardly
underſtand S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning <hi>Rom. 11. 24. If thou
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7898:88"/>
wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature,
and wert grafted contrary to nature in a good olive
tree: how much more ſhall theſe which be the naturall
branches be grafted into their owne Olive tree?</hi> To
graft wild plants in ſweets ſtocks (at leaſt for the
graft ſo planted to proſper) is contrary to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
cuſtome of nature, and it is in particular
more contrary to the nature of the Olive, then
to any other tree, becauſe it will hardly admit of
any graft by reaſon of its fatneſſe, nor will the
grafts of it eaſily thrive in any other ſtocke, if we
may beleive ſuch, as write of plants.</p>
                  <p>6 With ſowing and planting, the dreſſing of
Vines hath more then affinity, and without ſome
knowledge or experience of this part of huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
ſome intire parables and other allegoricall
ſpeeches uttered by our Saviour himſelfe cannot
rightly be interpreted: and for theſe three parts
of huſbandry and others, the rule is but one;
[that every one who takes upon him to expound
thoſe paſſages in the Goſpell which refer to theſe
branches of huſbandry, peruſe ſuch Authors as
write in particular of the cuſtomes or manners
uſuall in that climate wherein our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
in ancient times:] For neither doth the
huſbandry of theſe times, or of this climate wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we live, in many points well ſuite with thoſe
practiſes or rules of huſbandary whereunto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
alludes.</p>
                  <p>7 But however many of our Saviours Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
referre unto theſe or like experiments in vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
trades, yet ſundry parables and other ſpeeches
uttered by him, and by his Apoſtles, require ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7898:88"/>
ſpeculative or experimentall Knowledge in
more ingenuous and more noble profeſſions; or
in civill rites or cuſtomes which vary in ſeverall
ages, or Nations. A man that had never ſeene any
marriage celebrated out of his owne native ſoile
or neighbour Countreys, nor read of the rites or
cuſtomes in this kinde uſed by Eaſterne Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before or about the time of our Saviours pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
here on earth, could not be much edified
by the parable of the ten Virgins, or the like
which allude to nuptiall cuſtomes in thoſe times.
<hi>Briſſonius</hi> and <hi>Rea</hi> would ſtead a Preacher more

                  <p>8 To compare the Tabernacle of the Sunne
which God hath placed in the heavens, and the
riſing of this glorious light, unto the manner of
a Bridegromes comming out of his chamber after
the manner and faſhion in uſe with us, would be
but an homely expreſſion. Yet hath it pleaſed the
Spirit of God to deſcribe the outgoings of this
great light which governes the day, in that moſt
elegant ſacred hymne; <hi>In them hath he ſet a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
for the Sunne, which is as a Bridegroome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of his Chamber, and rejoyceth as a ſtrong man
to run a race. Pſal.</hi> 19. 4, 5. But the cuſtome or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of uſhering Bridegroomes, in thoſe times, out
of their Chambers by Lamps or Torches in the
night time, had a poeticall <hi>decorum</hi> for repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the manner of the ſuns recourſe unto us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
darkneſſe, the morning ſtarre or ſtrayned
glimmerings of the dawning being as his torch-bearers.
And as the Bridegroomes comming out
of his Chamber to fetch his Bride, was a ſilent
poem of the Sunns approach unto us; ſo the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
deſcription of the Sunne in its riſing and
courſe is a ſpeaking picture of the comming of
the Sunne of righteouſneſſe into the world, after
the light of prophecies or revelations, whether
by Vrim and Thummim, or by voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
had beene farre removed from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere
of Judaea, untill they began to returne
againe in <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and his Father <hi>Zacharias,</hi>
who were as the day ſtarre or dawning to uſher
in the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, who was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his courſe from the one end of the Earth
to the other, with more indefatigable courage,
and with more comfortable warmth, then this
viſible Sunne doth viſite the earth. He was that
ſtrong man, that <hi>Gebor,</hi> unto whom the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
compares the Sunne in its ſtrength, for
<hi>Gebor</hi> is its proper title. And I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion

here on earth, though deſcending from heaven
where it ſhall bee accompliſhed, was by the
Holy Ghoſt intended according to the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
ſenſe of that Pſalme, which is not
a Hiſtory onely but a true prophecy.</p>

                  <p>9 But meere ignorance in theſe and the like
parables of our Saviour, whoſe knowledge neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned the generation in which and for
whoſe good hee uttered them, (however the
knowledge of them much concerne us of this
age and nation) cannot bee ſo prejudiciall to all
good Chriſtians, as the ignorance of other para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and proverbiall ſpeeches of his, which alike
neerely concerne mankinde. Yet an ignorance
there is of many rites and cuſtomes, unto which
both the words of the Prophets and his explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them, which concerne mans redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by him, punctually referre according to the
literall ſenſe. Moſt of us know not him as our
Redeemer, becauſe were know not our ſelves,
nor that miſerable bond of ſervitude which hee
did diſſolve for us all. And this wee know not,
becauſe wee conſider not the ſtate and condition
of legall ſervants unto cruell &amp; tyrannicall Lords.
We were ſervants to a moſt cruell Tyrant. And
the Sonne of God for our Redemption became
truely and properly a ſervant to his Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he became our Lord in ſpeciall, and ſo muſt
wee be ſervants to him in ſpeciall before wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

or <hi>Verbo tenùs</hi> Allegoricall, and allude
unto thoſe ſtrivings or conflicts which ſeldome
were determined without blood, wherein it was
a ſhame to yeeld, before any blood was drawne.
Such was the law or practiſe of thoſe games which
the Latines call <hi>Pugilatus,</hi> wherein <hi>manus demit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi>
to let downe the hands, was an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of victory; which happily might have been

<hi>Heb. 12. 12. Wherefore erect the hands which

charity towards impotent or feeble men, but
that the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> whom this precept doth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concerne, ſhould encourage their flock to
ſtrive againſt ſinne, with as great courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
as the Olympick or other Gameſters did
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7898:92"/>
againſt their Antagoniſts, not to let downe their
hands, or give over after many wounds or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
unto blood; as being ſure, though they dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in fight to be better rewarded, then the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
were in theſe bodily fights. Unto the ſame
courage and reſolution the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had
exhorted the people of God in his age, though
not them onely but all ſucceeding generations.
For his words are typically propheticall, &amp; point
directly to the time of our Saviours comming to
viſite and redeeme his people: and yet alluſive
withall unto the bodily ſtrivings or wreſtlings of
thoſe ancient times. <hi>Iſa. 35. 34. Strengthen yee
the weake hands, and confirme the feeble knees, ſay to
them that are of a fearefull heart, Bee ſtrong, feare
not, behold your God will come with vengeance, even
God with a recompence, he will come and ſave you.</hi>
The end and ſcope as well of the Prophet as of
our Apoſtle, was to inſpire ſuch life and courage
into Gods people in their heavieſt preſſures, as

                  <p>Uſuall it was with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and with other

euery man that ſtriveth for the maſterie, is temperate
in all things. Now they doe it to obtaine a corruptible

not as uncertainly: ſo fight I not as one that beateth
the aire. But I keepe under my body, and bring it into
ſubjection, leaſt that by any meanes, when I have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

if of all thoſe which runne in ſecular races, it bee
not poſſible for more then one to receive the

The ſame word commeth to ſignifie a <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi>
or a man finally rejected by God, or irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fibly

of ſacred writ, who take this title uſuall in

from falſe coines or counterfeit metals, faile more
in Logique then in Grammar; though faile they

as victor. But the originall word, for its formall
or abſtract ſignification, is a great deale more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
then to be reſtrained either to coyned me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
or to men which ſtrive for maſtery in any

                  <p>14. Or if we interpret this word by its refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

baſeneſſe of the metall, or for the counterfeit

ſtamp, or for want of weight. For if it bee but
ſome few graines too light, any man may refuſe
it, although it beare <hi>Caeſars</hi> image and ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Or if it be full waight and pure gold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
yet if it be elſewhere eſtamped, then where
<hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhall appoint, or by any ſtamp or perſon
not authorized, no man is bound to receive it,
and he that tenders it, is to be puniſhed. And yet
both theſe kindes of Reprobate coines may bee
legitimated or made currant, by new coining or
addition of quantitie without any alteration of
the qualitie. But coines <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> for the metall, as
if that be braſſe, copper, or ſilver gilt, and eſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

no Lawes currant. And yet ſome there be (as
we ſaid) which profeſſe the art of turning ſuch
metalls into gold, but whether this be facible, or
no, is no point of Divinity. But ſurely the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Creator of all things hath more ſkill in
transforming men of what condition ſoever, then
any Alchymiſt hath in changing metalls from

in oppoſition to the Chriſtian faith, or whether

there ſhall not be a reverſion of that curſe which

have beene inſtructed in all points neceſſary for a
Chriſtian to believe, to men that have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
in this faith, to men partakers in a plentifull

But may wee or ought wee to apply this

viſible member of the true Church, or of thoſe
Churches in which the pure word is conſtantly
preached, and the Sacraments duely adminiſtred?
Are all theſe bound upon paine of Reprobation

not in that place only but in many others of
the new Teſtament, that is, for men either irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſibly
ordained to death, or finally forſaken of
God? That the word is uſed by our Apoſtle in
this ſtrict ſenſe, I dare not either peremptorily
affirme or deny. The point more queſtionable
and more uſefull for our edification will bee, to
inquire what the Apoſtle meanes by theſe words,
<hi>Know yee not, that Ieſus Chriſt is in you?</hi> The bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the enquiry are two; the firſt what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Chriſts being in them is here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
The ſecond what kinde of knowledge they
were to have of his being in them: or whether
for Chriſt to be in them be all one, as for them to
be in Chriſt by the ſpirit of regeneration and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
or all one, as to be elected, that is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſibly
ordained unto glory; and whether they
were bound to beleeve all this <hi>certitudine fidei,</hi> by
the certainty of faith.</p>
                  <p>2. To this wee anſwer that neither all nor any
of thoſe points were neceſſarily to be beleeved
by theſe Corinthians, much leſſe by ordinary
Chriſtians at this day; albeit we grant the word
<hi>Reprobates</hi> to be taken in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, that is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7898:96"/>
for men irreverſibly fitted for deſtruction. For
ſo it may be taken, and in my opinion ought to
be taken in that place if in any. But ſo taking it,
wee muſt rate our Apoſtles meaning in the words
precedent <hi>[Know yee not that Chriſt is in you]</hi> by
that peculiar reference, which the preſent eſtate
of thoſe Corinthians had unto the eſtate of the
rebellious Iſraelites, who after ſo many wonders
and manifeſt documents of Gods peculiar provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
over them, did tempt him and require fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſignes, whether God were among them or
no. <hi>Exod. 17. 7. And he called the name of the place</hi>
Maſſah <hi>and</hi> Meribah, <hi>becauſe of the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and becauſe they tempted the Lord ſaying; Is the
Lord among us or not?</hi> Unto the ſame height of
iniquitie thoſe Phariſees were come, who after
they had ſeene ſo many miracles done by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
as did fully teſtifie that he was that very
God whom their Fathers had thus tempted in the
wilderneſſe, yet <hi>came forth unto him, and beganne
to queſtion with him, ſeeking of him a ſigne from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
tempting him. Marke</hi> 8. 11. And hence it
was, that this Heavenly Phyſitian of their ſoules,
upon this deſperate Criſis, <hi>ſighed deeply in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and ſaid, Why doth this generation ſeeke after a
ſigne? Verily I ſay unto you, there ſhall be no ſigne gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to this generation: and he left them. ver.</hi> 12, 13.
Now theſe Corinthians, after unqueſtionable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
of many miraculous effects of Chriſts
power wrought amongſt them by the miniſtry of
<hi>Paul,</hi> did ſeeke after a further proofe or ſigne of
Chriſts ſpeaking in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. and for
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7898:97"/>
their ſatisfaction, he exhorts them to examine
themſelves whether Chriſt were not in them, not
in him alone: and this they might know, unleſſe
they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is, ſuch Reprobates as the
forementioned rebellious Iſraelites were. For it
could be no other then a Symptome or Criſis of
a Reprobate minde, or of men rejected by God
and left of Chriſt, to murmur, doubt or queſtion,
whether the gift of tongues, of healing, and other
wonderfull effects of Chriſts power manifeſted
by <hi>Pauls</hi> miniſterie, did not truly teſtifie that his
Commiſſion was from heaven, or that Chriſt was
amongſt them, to wit, in that Church. For ſo the
originall <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is in his place to be taken, as it is
elſewhere in the New Teſtament; as when cur
Saviour ſaith to the Phariſees <hi>Luke 17. 21. The

the power of it is manifeſted amongſt you: but

                  <p>3 It is not all one for any amongſt us to doubt
or queſtion whether the doctrine conteyned
in the Apoſtles Creede or in the new Teſtament,
be the doctrine of life and ſalvation; as to doubt
or be uncertaine, whether he himſelfe be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in the eſtate of life or a choſen veſſell. To
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7898:97"/>
doubt of the former generall is infidelity, a ſinne
not incident to a true Chriſtian. But many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us may doubt of the later point, and yet
be as good Chriſtians, as thoſe who think they
have aſſurance of faith, that they are predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and condemne all others as Reprobates in
the worſt ſenſe, who doe not as certainely beleeve
that they live in Chriſt, as that Chriſt died for
ſinners. But this was no part of our Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in that paſſage to the Corinthians. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
betweene him and them was not about
ſpeciall beleife of perſonall election, but about
this generall, whether he were a true Apoſtle or
no: Or, whether the miracles which had beene
manifeſted amongſt them by his miniſtery, were
wrought by the power of Chriſt or no. If they
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in this doubt or tempting of God, they
would (as he forewarnes them) hereby prove
themſelves to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is ſuch as the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
Iſraelites had beene, or ſuch as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
generation of the Jews for the moſt part,
were, that is, caſt off from being Gods Church or
people. So that if we take the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the
ſtricteſt and ſevereſt ſenſe, it rather imports a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
or provinciall rejection of that people
from being his people, or from his reſidency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them by his publique Spirit, than a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Reprobation of every particular or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall.
For to pronounce thus much of every Jew,
that hath not adjoyned himſelfe to Chriſts body
the Church, ſince the generall rejection of that
Nation, is beyond my Commiſſion, altogether

the word <gap reason="foreign">

requeſt every ingenuous ſober reader to acquaint
himſelfe, as well as with the ordinary expoſitors
of the 9. to the Romanes, and not adventure to
ſaile in a narrow uncouch and unſounded ſea on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

done, and for want of an experienced <hi>Pilot</hi> have
either fallen upon dangerous Rocks, or ſtricken

ſafe arivall without ſome ſuch extraordinary mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellow paſſengers found, yet
with loſſe of the ſhip wherein they ſailed.</p>
                  <p>7. Divers other places of Scripture there be,
which (in my opinion) are uſually extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their native compaſſe, though ſometimes
without any great danger of bad conſequences,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7898:99"/>
yet alwayes with ſome loſſe of contentment to
him that deſires the true knowledge of the holy
Ghoſts meaning in them. And thus they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-extended
through want of obſervation, unto
what matters of fact, or ſpeciall circumſtances of
ſome peculiar times they punctually referre. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Pſalmiſt in the eighth Pſal. doth ſo mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the goodneſſe of God, and his ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
over mankinde in generall; it muſt needs
put an obſervant Reader of thoſe ſacred Hymnes
to a demurre, why the Author of the 90 Pſalme
ſhould ſo pathetically complain of the ſhortneſſe
and miſery of mens dayes or yeares. And to this
demurre; I know not how to make any juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
if wee take the matter of his complaints to
concerne all men which lived either in that time
or ſince. But if we conſider that <hi>Moſes</hi> the man
of God was the Author of that Pſalme, (as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of it directs us to think) and that hee
penned it ſome few yeares after the deliverance
of Gods people by him out of Aegypt; the cauſe
or occaſion of the complaint is very juſtifiable
and ſerious, yet peculiar to thoſe preſent times
and the people whereof he was governour. For
I think it was never experienced in any age or
Nation beſides, that of ſixe hundred thouſand li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſoules, and likely to live in reſpect of the
conſtitution of their bodies or any Epidemicall
diſeaſe, that then did raigne, ſo few (males at laeſt)
ſhould outlive threeſcore and tenne yeares, and
fewer foureſcore. And yet of all the males which
had beene delivered out of Aegypt, not one that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7898:100"/>
was but twenty yeares old did live above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
yeares, not one that was but thirty could
live above threeſcore and tenne, not one that
was but forty (two or three only excepted,) could
live above foureſcore yeares; or if ſome attained
to that age or above it, yet their pilgrimage was
to be full of ſorrow, all of them, (beſides two or
three) excluded by oath from entring into the
Land of their promiſed reſt; all above twenty
(beſides <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhuah)</hi> were to dye within
forty yeares in the wilderneſſe<note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 4. 21.</note> Even <hi>Moſes</hi>
the man of God himſelfe, who penned this Pſal.
was prohibited to enter into the Land of Canaan
and therefore had juſt reaſon to complaine, as
there he doth (yet without murmuring) not of
Gods diſreſpect unto mankinde in generall, but
of that heavy doome which he had pronounced
againſt all the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> above twenty years
old; of which number we cannot imagine fewer
then two hundred thouſand. That the 33. verſe
of <hi>Pſalme</hi> the 78. <hi>[therefore their dayes did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
in vanity, and their yeares in trouble]</hi> doth pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
referre unto that ſentence denounced
<hi>Numb.</hi> 14. againſt thoſe rebellious Iſraelites
whoſe carkeiſes fell in the wilderneſſe, is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable.
Now albeit the words of this verſe bee
not the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Moſes Pſal. 90. 10.
[Yet is their ſtrength labour and ſorrow: for it is ſoon
cut off, and we flie away]</hi> yet their ſignification is
Synonimal.</p>
                  <p>8. But this errour in ſtretching the native
ſenſe of Scriptures beyond its proper liſts or
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7898:100"/>
bounds: is ſometimes committed by overſight,
not in matters of hiſtory or morality only, but in
the greateſt myſteries of faith, as in that place
<hi>Ierem. 31. 22. How long wilt thou goe about, O thou
backſliding daughter? For the Lord hath created a
new thing in the earth, A woman ſhall compaſſe a man,</hi>
(as we uſually reade it.) Such as acknowledge
the great myſtery of the womans ſeed, or incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the ſonne of God, to bee included in
this prophecy, extend the native ſignification of
the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in the <hi>earth,</hi> too farre. Howbeit
in this errour or overſight, there is no falſhood;
for that the woman or female ſhould encloſe or
compaſſe the male, or that mighty one the ſecond
<hi>Adam,</hi> was a new thing indeed and a wonder to
all the earth. But this generall truth doth not hit
the punctuall meaning of the holy Ghoſt in that
place, for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>earth,</hi> is to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto the Land of Ephraim or of Iſrael, as it
was oppoſed unto the Land of Judah. Thus much
the literall circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance of this prophecy alone wil
enforce, and that prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> parallel unto
this, will perſwade us, <hi>Iſa. 11. 13. The envy alſo
of Ephraim ſhall depart, and the Adverſaries of Iudah
ſhall be cut off, Ephraim ſhall not envy Iudah, and
Iudah ſhall not vexe or upbraid Ephraim.</hi> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
is, that the one Kingdome was to ſhare
with the other in the fulfilling of this grand my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
foretold by theſe two Prophets in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Chapters. The Kingdome of Ephraim, of
which Nazareth was a Limbe (though a ſmalone)
was to be graced with the Meſſias conception
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7898:101"/>
and incarnation, and with the Angell Gabriels
preſence for the avoucher. The Kingdome of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah
(whereof Bethlem was a remarkable portion)
was to be dignified with his birth; and that was
proclaimed by an hoſt of Angells.</p>

(with whoſe meditations I have ſince that time

in this place of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy.</hi> In their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>the new thing</hi> which the Lord promiſed to

of man and wife) ſhould be diſpenſed with,
or repealed, as it did concerne Ephraim or Iſrael
who had beene ſometimes Gods ſpouſe, but now
divorced for her manifold adulteries, and yet by
Gods ſpeciall grace had libertie to returne unto
him againe. To this purpoſe I am not ignorant
that ſome later Rabbines interpret this place, (as
they doe many other) to elevate the myſtery of
the incarnation; but ſo doe not thoſe exquiſite
Chriſtian Hebricians, from whom I muſt crave
pardon to diſſent. All that they ſay concerning

Chapter. That meaning which they would faſten
upon this place, was expreſſely delivered by our
Prophet, Chap. 3. not to Ephraim, but to Judah
before ſhee followed Ephraim into Captivitie;
and therefore this could be no new thing to bee
created afterwards in the Land of Ephraim. <hi>They
ſay if a man put away his wife, and ſhee goe from him

a new Creation far ſurpaſſing the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

in this new Creation the <hi>Geber,</hi> the ſonne of God
himſelfe was to be made man of a woman. And
it is not unworthy the obſervant Readers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that when the Lord doth as it were

Firſt in that of S. <hi>Matthew 23. 34, 35, 36. Behold I
ſend unto you Prophets and wiſe men, &amp;c. That upon
you may come all the righteous blood ſhed upon the
earth, from the blood of righteous</hi> Abel <hi>unto the blood
of</hi> Zacharias <hi>ſonne of</hi> Barachias, <hi>whom yee ſlew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Temple and the Altar, verely I ſay unto you,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7898:103"/>
all thoſe things ſhall come upon this generation.</hi> The
reaſon why moſt Interpreters of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> have
wandered as men overtaken with a thicke miſt
upon a wilde heath or forreſt, was becauſe they
did not conſult the <hi>Index Mercurialis,</hi> which S.
<hi>Luke,</hi> from the words expreſſely uttered by our
Saviour, had ſet up for their better direction. For
whereas S. <hi>Matthew</hi> expreſſeth the Epiphonema
or concluſion of our Saviours ſpeech, thus; <hi>All
theſe things ſhall come upon this generation:</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi>
cap. 11. expreſſeth it; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you it ſhall be
required of this generation.</hi> What was to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of this generation? The blood of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zacharias</hi> his blood
in particular. For though this preſent generation
by not repenting for their forefathers ſinnes had
made themſelves guilty of the blood of all the
Prophets, which ſtood upon ſacred Record from
<hi>Abels</hi> time unto the deſtruction of the Temple:
yet <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Zacharias</hi> the high Prieſt, whoſe
death was in many reſpects moſt prodigious,
were the eſpeciall avengers of blood. For the
blood of the one after he was dead, and the dying
voice of the other, did cry to God for vengeance.
For ſo it is recorded in the ſecond of <hi>Cron.</hi> 24. 22.
of <hi>Zacharias, [When he dyed he ſaid; The Lord looke
upon it, and require it.]</hi> Now our Saviour in the
words recorded by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> forewarnes this impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently
ſtubborne generation, that <hi>Zacharias</hi> his
dying curſe (which had been through his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
often deferred and often mitigated) ſhould be
executed upon them, as an ungodly race of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7898:104"/>
Anceſtors in a fuller meaſure then perhaps
<hi>Zacharias</hi> intended. The exact parallel betweene
the ſinnes of this people in the dayes of <hi>Ioaſh</hi>
King of Judah, who cauſed <hi>Zacharias</hi> to be ſtoned
to death in the Temple, and the ſinnes of this
preſent generation who put the High Prieſt of
their ſoules (the Lord of Glory himſelfe) to an
ignominious death; in what ſenſe the blood of
<hi>Zacharias</hi> was more required of this generation
then the blood of our Saviour or of his Apoſtles;
in what manner the death of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and of our
Saviour, were the cauſes of this preſent generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
deſtruction, I have elſewhere diſcuſſed at
large, and, if God permit, meane ſhortly to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
amongſt other meditations upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Saviours
propheticall function, or of ſuch prophecies wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſpake as never man ſpake; which were not
to be fulfilled in himſelfe, as in his death, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and aſcenſion, or comming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For all prophecies of this ranke which, ſhall
come unto my memory or obſervation, will have
their fit place in theſe Commentaries.</p>
                  <p>12 So will not that ſpeech of his <hi>Mat. 24. 28.
Whereſoever the Carkerſe is, there will the Eagles be
gathered together.</hi> Yet ſeeing the expoſition of this
place hath beene omitted in the explication of
ſome prophecies with which it hath moſt affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as with the ſignes of his comming to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Math.</hi> 24. and <hi>Marke</hi> the 13. I have
thought good to ſay ſomewhat of it in this place.
Moſt Interpreters grant the ſpeech to be prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall,
and yet (as uttered by our Saviour) to be a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7898:104"/>
Prophecie. The myſterie foretold moſt of the
Ancients would have to be the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Saints unto Chriſts body at the finall
judgement; or at leaſt the gathering together of
thoſe bodies, which being alive, ſhall be raught up
into the ayre to meete him at his comming. But
however the Eagles (at leaſt ſome kinde of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles)
may be fit Emblemes of Gods Saints, yet
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the body or Carkeiſe whereto the Eagles
reſort, hath no handſome or comely reſemblance
of Chriſts appearing in glory; although it were
granted that his wounds or ſkarres ſhould then be
conſpicuous. I make no queſtion but our Saviour
in the forecited place, did meane that kinde of
Eagles, whoſe properties we have deſcribed by
God himſelfe, even by this our Lord God and
Redeemer, <hi>Ioh. 39. 27. Doth the Eagle mount up at
thy command, and make her neſt on high? ſhe dwelleth
and abideth on the Rocke, upon the Crag of the Rocke,
and the ſtrong place, from thence ſhe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

The Eagle here diſplayed is either the Vulture,
or of the Vultures kind, and their ſagacitie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ſmelling ſlaine bodies a farre off, or in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging
where great ſlaughters are like to happen,
as alſo their ſwift reſort unto the prey, is well
knowne to ſecular Philologers. But the flocking
together of this kinde of Eagles doth rather me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
deſtruction, then miniſter any matter of
comfort, according to the literall ſenſe either of
proverbiall ſpeech or of prophecy. So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7898:105"/>
                     <hi>Habakuk</hi> doth character the fierce and ſwift
incurſion of the Caldaeans by this kinde of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
haſtening to the prey, chap. 11. ver. 8. <hi>Their
horſes alſo are ſwifter then the Leopards, and are more
fierce then the Evening Wolves, and their horſemen
ſhall ſpread themſelves, and their horſemen ſhall come
from farre; they ſhall flye as the Eagle that haſteth
to eate.</hi> And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> long before had threatned
this people <hi>Deut. 28. 49. The Lord ſhall bring a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt thee from farre from the end of the earth,
as ſwift as the Eagle fleeth, &amp;c.</hi> And this prophecy
was moſt exactly fulfilled in the Conqueſt, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and deſtruction of this Nation by the
Romanes and their Allyes, eſpecially the Italians,
Spaniſh, Germane, and Britiſh with other of theſe
Weſterne Nations. And our Saviour in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
place foretels the fulfilling of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Moſes</hi> upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Jews of that preſent age; For
all that our Saviour had ſaid in that 24. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
was to be accompliſhed (according to the
literall ſenſe) in that age current: for ſo he ſaith
ver. 34. <hi>Verely I ſay unto you, this generation ſhall not
paſſe, till all theſe things be fulfilled.</hi> Now it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that this gathering together of the Eagles,
was to be fulfilled before thoſe ſignes of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to judge Jeruſalem were to bee exhibited
ver. 29. Our Saviours propheſie then cannot (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the literall ſenſe) <hi>refer</hi> unto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to finall judgement, but unto his comming
to viſite Jeruſalem and the Nation of the Jewes,
of whom, as he intimates, ſome few ſhould bee
ſtrangely reſerved, others remarkably plagued,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7898:105"/>
and ſo to be plagued by the Romanes, whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
was the Eagle. Thoſe whom God had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
or appointed to the ſlaughter within that age
current were (as we ſay) dead in Law; &amp; whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they fled, the Romane Eagles, which
God had authorized to be his executioners of the
heavy Judgements there denounced, would be
more ſwift then they; more ſagacious then they
were ſubtill. And albeit theſe wandring Corps
did take the Temple for their Sanctuary, and
make Jeruſalem and it, the laſt ſeat of that deadly
warre; yet even there ſhould theſe Eagles or Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
be gathered againſt them, and teach their
young ones to ſuck their blood. And indeed if a
man would accurately obſerve the proceſſe and
ſucceſſe of the warre againſt them by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
it would appeare to have beene begun and
ended rather by ſuch ſecret inſtinct or preſage,
as the Eagles have of great ſlaughters then by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
project or humane conſultation.</p>
                  <p>13. To this expreſſion of the literall meaning
of the forecited place S. <hi>Luke</hi> directs me, who of
all the three Evangeliſts mentioneth the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
cauſe or occaſion of our Saviours prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall
ſpeech, Luke 17. 37. <hi>And they anſwered or
replyed) and ſaid unto him, where Lord?</hi> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the interrogatory is, where ſhall the place
or ſeate of theſe ſtrange Calamities be? and to
this he anſwers, <hi>Whereſoever the body is, there will
the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> The importance of
his anſwer is, whitherſoever theſe ſons of death
ſhall repaire, thither will the executioners of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7898:106"/>
Gods wrath be gathered together; to wit, the
Romans, who ſhould not ſpare ſuch as did reſiſt
or ſeeke to ſave their lives by hoſtility or
ſtrength, and yet be ready to ſpare ſuch as would
ſubmit themſelves unto their mercy. Thus much
(in my apprehenſion) was intimated ver. 33. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall ſeeke to ſave his life, ſhall loſe it, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall loſe his life, ſhall preſerve it, I tell you
in that night there ſhall be two men in one bed, the one
ſhall be taken, the other ſhall be left: Two women ſhall
be grinding together, the one ſhall be taken and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
left. And they anſwered and ſaid, where Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi>
This I take to be the literall meaning of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.
As for the myſticall, parallel to this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
(if this afford any ſuch) that cannot elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
bee ſo fitly handled, as in the Article of
Chriſts comming to judge the world, both quick
and dead. Now according to the myſticall ſenſe,
we are (I take it,) to underſtand by the body,
the bodies of the Saints deceaſed: and then to
make the Allegorie or proportion (ſuch as the
Scripture alwaies maketh) hanſome and comely:
the Eagles muſt not be ſuch as <hi>Iob</hi> deſcribeth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vultures, or of Vultures kinde, but <hi>Iovis
Aquilae,</hi> which as Philologers tell us, do not uſe to
feed on dead Corps or ſlaine fleſh. Theſe are fit
emblemes of the ſwift miniſtery of Celeſtiall
Angels in gathering or ſummoning the bodies
of deceaſed Saints from the one end of the Earth
to the other.</p>

without ſome manifeſt ground of the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

can bee no concludent allegoricall or myſticall
ſenſe, unleſſe it be grounded on the literall. And
of all the branches of the literall ſenſe none is ſo
evidently concludent againſt the Jew, the Arian,

the Socinian) as that which for the moſt part is
leaſt obſerved, or moſt ſlenderly proſecuted by
ſuch as ſeeke to confute the Jew, or other Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells

which according to the plaine literall or
grammaticall ſenſe cannot, without blaſphemy
or literall ſolaeciſme, bee applyed to any perſon
but God, to any beſides the God of Iſrael, and yet
cannot be meant of God himſelfe (according to
the punctuall literall ſenſe) ſave only as he was to
be incarnate, or to have his converſation amongſt
men, after a more peculiar manner then in the
ancient times of the world he had. And theſe
places be for number many, perhaps more then all
the other prophecies or predictions concerning
Chriſt whether literall or myſticall. My purpoſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7898:107"/>
is not in this place to rehearſe all of this kinde
which I have obſerved, but rather to explicate
ſome few of theſe many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt ſhall be that</hi> Exod. 29. 45, 46. And I
will dwell amongſt the children of Iſrael, and will bee
their God, and they ſhall know that I am the Lord their
God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
that I may dwell amongſt them: I am the Lord their
God. <hi>That this place cannot be literally meant of
any perſon, man or Angell, but of God himſelfe
which brought Iſrael out of the Land of Egypt,
no moderne Jew doth or can deny. The ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is renewed or repeated,</hi> Lev. 26. 11, 12, 13.
And I will ſet my tabernacle amongſt you, and my
ſoule ſhall not abhorre you, and I will walke among you,
and will be your God, and yee ſhall be my people. I am
the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the
Land of Egypt, that yee ſhould not be their bondmen;
and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made
you goe upright.</p>
                  <p>3. God before this time had appeared unto
them, had conducted them by a cloud by day, and
by a pillar of fire by night, had divers wayes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
his ſpeciall preſence, and ſpoken to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
their leader in a more familiar manner, then he
had done to any Prophet before or ſince his time.
Yet all thoſe evidences of his glorious preſence
amongſt them, were but pledges of a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
manner of his future preſence with them, or
of walking or talking, not with ſome one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
man amongſt them only, ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> was,
but with all that are willing to walk and talk with
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7898:108"/>
him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had done with that generation.
Neither of thoſe prophecies could be exactly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
according to the punctuall literall ſenſe, of
thoſe ancient times; wherein the firſt Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
did wander with them in the wilderneſſe,
though verified according to the vulgar literall
ſenſe, in thoſe times. For God their Lord was
ſaid to remove or to ariſe, when the Ark removed
or ſet forward <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 1. Nor were the ſame
prophecies fulfilled in thoſe times, wherein the
Lord had a permanent Tabernacle, or conſtant
place of reſidence amongſt them in Jeruſalem.
Albeit hee was then ſaid to dwell betweene the
Cherubims and to have choſen Sion for his place
of reſt, yet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> after the deſolation of the
Temple projected by <hi>David</hi> and built by <hi>Salomon,</hi>
doth promiſe this people more then a redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
of the Temple, or any other materiall
Temple, more then a meere <hi>revivall</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
promiſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 45. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 12, 13.
for ſo the Prophet aſtipulateth in the name of
his God chap. 37. ver. 26, 27, and 28. <hi>Moreover,
I will make a Covenant of peace with them, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them, and will ſet my ſanctuary in the midſt of
them for evermore: my Tabernacle ſhall be with them,
yea I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people; and
the heathen ſhall know that I the Lord doe ſanctifie. Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
when my ſanctuary ſhall be in the midſt of them
for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. But now we ſee, and ſeeing cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
that the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the
fleſh, whom this promiſe did (in the firſt place)
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7898:108"/>
concerne, hath had no place of dwelling in the
land of Canaan almoſt for theſe ſixteene hundred
yeares paſt. Nor hath the God of Iſrael dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, after ſuch a manner as he did, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of the firſt Tabernacle, or whileſt
the firſt or ſecond Temple were ſtanding. And
yet this covenant was (according to the literall
ſenſe of the Prophet) to be an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
yea perpetually everlaſting, after it once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to be <hi>in eſſe:</hi> God was to dwell with Iſrael
or with the ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> there meant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruption in this life, and everlaſtingly in
the life to come. Beſides this everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
was a covenant likewiſe of everlaſting peace
to ſuch as were partakers of it. For the peculiar
manner of Gods dwelling with Iſrael, the Jew
cannot imagine a more punctuall fulfilling of this
prophecy then the Evangeliſt S. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
record chap. 1. ver. 14. <hi>And he dwelt amongſt
us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the onely
begotten of the Father) fall of grace and truth.</hi> Thus
he dwelt and converſed with the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
according to bodily deſcent, and with none
elſe; how then is it ſaid by the Prophet that hee
was to dwell with them for evermore, or that this
covenant of peace ſhould be an everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
Seeing Iſrael or the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
deſcent did for the moſt part reject this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
when God for his part was ready to ſeale
it unto them, the Gentiles were ingraffed in the
beleeving ſtock, when the naturall branches were
broken off: and yet God ſtill dwels <hi>in medio Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:7898:109"/>
he hath his everlaſting Tabernacle in Iſrael,
that is in the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Iacob</hi> which
he aſſumed and did chooſe, not as he had done <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but for a perpetually everlaſting
reſt. And though this place of his reſt be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
not only from the ſonnes of Iſrael, but from
all the ſonnes of men that live here on earth; yet
he ſtill dwelleth with us, who are ingraffed in the
ſtock of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of Iſrael, unto the end of
the world, and ſo ſhall dwell with true Iſraelites
world without end. He hath his reſidence in every
Church throughout the world, in as peculiar a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as he ſometimes did reſide in the Temple of
Jeruſalem: for whereſoever God is truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
there doth he dwell.</p>
                  <p>5. This covenant of everlaſting peace, which
the Prophet foretold was to be eſtabliſhed as the
firſt covenant, was by blood, but by farre better
blood then the blood of Bulls and Goates, by the
blood of the Teſtator himſelfe, that is, of God
himſelfe. <hi>Bellum geſsit, ut nos pace fruamur,</hi> Hee
was once for all to warre with fleſh and blood,
with powers, and principalities, that all ſuch as
embraced this covenant avouched by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
might enjoy everlaſting peace, not the peace of
this world, yet peace in this world, to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
in the world to come. And our Saviour
the ſonne of God, for more full declaration that
he was the Author of this covenant, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death bequeathed the legacy of peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Apoſtles and Diſciples, as feoffees in truſt
for all that ſhould follow the faith of <hi>Abraham.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7898:109"/>
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not
as the world giveth, give I unto you: let not your heart
be troubled, neither let it be afraid, Iohn</hi> 14. 27. And
after he had ſealed this covenant with his blood,
his ſalutation unto his Diſciples was, <hi>Peace be unto
you; and, Behold I am with you unto the end of the
world.</hi> After his death he did walk and talk only
with his Diſciples, but before his death hee had
walked, conferred and converſed with all the
children of Iſrael, that would come unto him, in
a more familiar manner, then he had done with
<hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe in Egypt and in the wilderneſſe.
And though his body bee removed out of their
ſight and ours, yet he dwelleth in his Church and
walketh in it by his ſpirit. <hi>Theſe things ſaith hee
that holdeth the ſeven ſtarres in his right hand, who
walketh in the middeſt of the ſeaven golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.

6. This prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is one of that ſort
and rank before rehearſed Chapter 14. par: 6, 7.
to wit, a prophecy which was oftner to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
then once and after different meaſures in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times. It was to be fulfilled according to
the ordinary ſcale of the literall ſenſe, and in the
intention of the holy Ghoſt, at this peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
from the Babyloniſh captivitie. From that
time Judah and Iſrael, or Ephraim, were not to
ſtrive or contend: and thus we ſee it fulfilled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the deſtruction of the Temple. For though
many of the ſeverall Tribes of Iſrael did returne
to their owne land ſucceſſively or now and then,
yet al were inſtyled or indigitated by the name of
<hi>Iudaei</hi> or Jews, a good name, untill they forfeited
their intereſt in this promiſe. And God did upon
their returne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Temple. Now
this covenant, which God did promiſe to make
with Iſrael and Judah upon the delivery from the
<hi>North Countrey, and from all the Countryes wherein
he had ſcattered them,</hi> was to exceed the former
covenant, which he had made with their fathers,
when he brought them out of Egypt, as appeareth
<hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 5, 6, 7, 8. And to exceed it, not only in
reſpect of benefits ſpirituall, or the matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
but in reſpect of the very forme and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
of the Covenant it ſelfe. Not that this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
was either in it ſelfe, or in the Nations
eyes, greater then the former, but that this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
after it once beganne to be <hi>in eſſe,</hi> was to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7898:110"/>
continue for ever without interruption; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the former Covenant was broken, did expire,
or determine. For during the time of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh
Captivitie, neither Judah nor Iſrael
had either a wandring Tabernacle or ſtanding
Temple, God did not dwell amongſt them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the native and literall meaning of
that promiſe <hi>Levit. 26. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> But according to this
Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel, God even their God was to
dwell amongſt them to have his Sanctuary in the midſt
of them for evermore.</hi> But did this Sanctuary or
Tabernacle there promiſed, continue in the
midſt of them ſince that time? yes, it hath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and ſhall continue for evermore, though
not in the ſame kinde, or <hi>quoad materiam,</hi> yet by
an aequivalency or more then aequivalency, or
by a ſpirituall and ſupereminent manner. For
when the ſecond Temple begun to decay, or
become as a Carkaſſe, or body without a ſoule;
the body of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, which
he tooke from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> became
the Temple of God, and continueth to this day
our Sanctuary, or Sanctification it ſelfe. And
wee Heathens or Gentiles doe now know,
that the Lord hath ſanctified Iſrael, and that
his Sanctuary is in the midſt of them for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>7. All thoſe places wherein God promiſed to
be their God, all thoſe ſacred hymnes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
which enſtile him God, even <hi>our</hi> God,
in the exquiſite or ſublime literall ſenſe, referre
or drive to that point which we Chriſtians make
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7898:111"/>
the foundation and roofe of our faith, to wit, that
he was to be God with us, or God in our nature or
fleſh, God made man of the ſeed or ſtock of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
like us in all things, ſin excepted. This new
&amp; glorious Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was according to ſtrict proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
erected <hi>in medio Iſrael,</hi> or <hi>in interiore Iſrael,</hi>
that is, in one that was truely an Iſraelite, the very
Center or Foundation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, or of
<hi>Iacobs</hi> poſterity. But being erected in the midſt
of Iſrael or in the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after this

or of Iſrael by bodily deſcent, but all were
to become true Iſraelites that ſhould be united
to this ſeed and worſhip God in this Sanctuary.
For in that Chriſt Jeſus was the ſonne of God, he
was more truely the Iſrael of God then <hi>Iacob</hi> had
beene, and all that are ingraffed into this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Articles. The firſt inſtance in this kind
after he was annointed to preach the Goſpell,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7898:112"/>
ſhall be that of the Pſalmiſt Pſalm. 89. 8, 9. <hi>O Lord
God of hoſts, who is a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Lord like unto thee? or to thy

And againe, Pſal. 107. 23. &amp;c. <hi>They that go downe to
the Sea in ſhips, that do buſineſſe in great waters, theſe
ſee the workes of the Lord and his wonders in the deep.
For he commandeth and raiſeth the ſtormy winde
which lifteth up the waves thereof: they mount up to
the heaven, they go downe againe to the depth, their
ſoule is melted becauſe of trouble, they reele to and fro
and ſtagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits
end. Then they crye unto the Lord in their trouble,
and he bringeth them out of their diſtreſſe. He maketh
the ſtorme a Calme, ſo that the waves thereof are ſtill:
then are they glad becauſe they be quiet, ſo he bringeth
them to their deſired haven.</hi> For Majeſty or beauty
of ſpeech, an heathen perhaps would be ready to
compare ſome deſcriptions of <hi>Virgil,</hi> or other

this is not all nor the principall point to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered

and did (at leaſt aenigmatically) foretell wonders
to be viſibly unfolded, and openly revealed in
later ages. Maſters and teachers they were, not
onely of Orthodoxall doctrines, and their morall
uſes, but of ſacred myſteries, ſuch as none but true
Prophets could foretell. It was a point of vulgar
Catechiſme amongſt the Jews, that unleſſe the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7898:113"/>
Lord did guide the ſhip the Pilot labor was but
loſt; except the Lord did rule the Sea, the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
paines were to no purpoſe. Every ſon of <hi>Iacob</hi>

upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his ſpeciall providence over the
Sea, and Seafaring men, would heartily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that it was the Lord, not their ſkill and
paines, that brought them to the haven, where
they would be. But whatſoever the Pſalmiſts oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
was to pen this Pſalme, the holy Ghoſt,
by whoſe inſpiration he tooke occaſion to pen it,
by whoſe direction it was inſerted into this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Canon of Scripture, did intend, that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of Gods experienced favours in
times paſt or preſent, ſhould be a prophecie
for the direction of times to come. And however
the Nation of the Jews were for the moſt part
affected, the underſtanding of the better, and
more religious amongſt this people was enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Spirit to foreſee, all of them were
bound to exact the fulfilling of this prophecie, in
a more diſtinct, remarkable, and exquiſite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
then the Pſalmiſt, or his forefathers, had any
experience of. If any man deſire to know the
time when, with the manner how, it was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
fulfilled, let him peruſe that Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſtory <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. &amp;c. <hi>And when he was entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a ſhip his Diſciples followed him; And behold there
aroſe a great Tempeſt in the Sea, inſomuch that the
ſhip was covered with the waves, but he was aſleepe.
And his Diſciples came to him and awoke him ſaying,
Lord ſave us, wee periſh. And he ſaith unto them, why
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7898:113"/>
are yee fearefull, O yee of little faith? then he aroſe
and rebuked the windes and the Sea, and there was a
great Calme.</hi> Or as it is, <hi>Mark. 4. 39. And he aroſe
and rebuked the winde, and ſaid unto the Sea, peace, be
ſtill; and the winde ceaſed, and there was a great
Calme.</hi> He uſed no ceremony, no inſtrument, ſuch
as <hi>Moſes, Elias,</hi> or other Prophets uſed in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
wrought by their miniſtery; but layes his
command upon them, in token and teſtimony
that he was abſolute Lord of both, that very Lord
of whom the Pſalmiſt had ſaid, <hi>Thou ruleſt the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the Sea, when the waves ariſe, thou ſtilleſt
them:</hi> that very Lord unto whom Seafaring
men did uſe to cry in their diſtreſſe. There were
more paſſengers at this time with him, ſpectators
of the miracle, and earewitneſſes of his words,
for as S. <hi>Marke</hi> tels us, there were alſo with him
other little ſhips ver. 36. And theſe other Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
not his Diſciples, perhaps were thoſe whom
the ſame Evangeliſt ver. 41. ſaith, did feare excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
and ſaid one to another, <hi>What manner of
man is this, that even the windes and the ſea obey him?</hi>
His Diſciples ſure at that time did apprehend
him to be more then man, and though they do
not expreſſe ſo much in words, yet by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
or ſecret inſtinct, they acknowledge him
to be that very God, whom the Pſalmiſt had de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcribed;
otherwiſe they had not preſented their
prayers immediately unto him in that forme
which S. <hi>Mathew</hi> relates, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh,</hi> but
rather thus, Maſter pray unto thy God, or, unto
thy Father, that we periſh not. But he being with
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7898:114"/>
them, though they are not aware of his peculiar,
and immediate preſence: So that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that all this was done and ſaid, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Scripture might be fulfilled; and the reaſon
perhaps, why he taxeth them ſo ſharply for want
of ſaith, was not ſo much for that they feared
to periſh in ſuch a terrible ſtorme, but that they
did not apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that there was for this time no
ſuch occaſion to feare, becauſe the forecited pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
were to be punctually fulfilled by their
prayers unto him being viſibly preſent. And for
the ſame reaſon, it may be, he reprooveth <hi>Peter</hi>
for want of faith, when he walked towards him
upon the Sea: for <hi>Peter</hi> might and ought to have
conceived, that his Maſter was that very Lord
and God, which ſtilleth the raging of the Sea,
and that this was the very point of time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that other prophecy of the Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſal. 77.
19.</hi> was to be remarkably fulfilled. <hi>Thy way is in
the Sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
are not knowne;</hi> and that he could conduct
him as ſafely over the ſea of Tiberias, as he led
his people by the hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
through the Red ſea. If wee knew the times or
occaſions of the writing of thoſe Pſalmes, or what
dayes they were appointed in the ancient
Church of the Jews, it would much conduce to
this or the like ſearch, how and when they were
fulfilled; it may be they were appointed to be
read upon thoſe very dayes wherein theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were done. That there was to be a ſecond ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
even of thoſe miracles which the Pſalmiſts
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7898:114"/>
celebrate, as being done before, we gather from
the Prophet <hi>Iſa. 43. 15, 16. I am the Lord your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one, the Creator of Iſrael, your King: Thus ſaith
the Lord, which maketh a way in the Sea, and a path
in the mighty waters &amp;c. Remember yee not the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
things, neither conſider yee the things of old, Behold
I will doe a new thing: Now it ſhall ſpring forth, ſhall
yee not know it? I will make a way in the wilderneſſe,
and rivers in the deſert.</hi> Now this Prophecy of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi>
was to bee remarkably fulfilled, when the
Lord their Redeemer came to viſit them.</p>
                  <p>2. Amongſt other Attributes of the God of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
mentioned by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. theſe
are inſerted ver. 7. <hi>He giveth food to the hungry,
the Lord looſeth the Priſoners: The Lord openeth the
eyes of the blinde, the Lord raiſeth them that are bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
downe.</hi> No child of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
in his hunger and thirſt by the hand of
men, but was ready in the firſt place, to thank the
Lord God of his Fathers, for his bounty. They
knew it was the Lord, which gave men power to
gather wealth, that putteth it into the hearts of
the rich to releeve the poore. If the liberality of
the Princes and Nobles at any time did abound,
they knew they were Almoners to the God of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi>
If any of them being formerly (by law or
authority) kept in durance, were ſet at liberty,
they were taught to thank the Lord, more then
man, for their deliverance. Him they knew to
be Lord of Lords, to have the hearts of Kings in
his hands; yet all this was not the only, or the
principall uſe, which the godly and learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7898:115"/>
the Iſraelites made of the Pſalmiſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
They were taught by their fathers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that the Lord himſelfe would come to feed
them with his owne hand, and would ſet Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
free <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> with the words of his owne
mouth. That this Lord was to live amongſt them,
and to converſe with them, from the greateſt to
the leaſt, in more viſible manner, then he did with
<hi>Moſes</hi> on the Mount or in the wilderneſſe, at the
time appointed for the exact fulfilling of this, and
other prophecies, <hi>Thou openeſt thine hand</hi> (ſaith
the Pſalmiſt) <hi>and ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living
thing. Pſal.</hi> 145. 16. Now that Jeſus was that
Lord, of whom the Pſalmiſt, in theſe two places
laſt cited, ſpeaketh, was fully teſtified by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
which he wrought, in feeding many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
with ſome few loaves, and two ſmall fiſhes,
and in filling ſo many baſkets with the fragments
or reliques of that ſmall proviſion, wherewith he
had filled thouſands. From theſe miracles, the
people which had ſeene him doe them, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
of his bounty, did rightly inferre, that hee
was that Prophet, which was to come into the
world, as you may read <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 14. and being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be that Prophet, they conſequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
that he was likewiſe to be the King of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;
and out of this conceit or preſumption, they
would have enforced him to be their King, ver.
15. But all theſe good prenotions of him, as their
promiſed Meſſias, were drowned in their bellies,
which were indeed to them their gods, and theſe
being ſatisfied their religion was at an end; their
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7898:115"/>
zeale was come unto a period. For as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſaith ver. 26. <hi>they ſought him not becauſe they
ſaw the miracles</hi> (which did truly prove him to be
that God, which filleth al things living) <hi>but becauſe
they ate of the loaves, and were filled.</hi> And that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition he would ſo feed them with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
food continually, they would have made him
King, and have enforced him to undertake this
charge, as it is, ver. 15. Who the Pſalmiſt did
meane by the hungry, in the forecited Pſalme, is
certaine, and how the Lord himſelfe did feede
them, is plaine; but who are literally meant by
the Priſoners, or what Priſoners Jeſus, during the
time of his propheticall function, did unlooſe or
ſet at libertie, is not ſo evident from the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
ſtory. It is not indeed at the firſt ſight, or
according to the rate of the Engliſh phraſe. But
the learned Commentators upon the 61, of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
have well obſerved that by Priſoners or men ſhut
up, the Hebrews uſually underſtand the deafe, the
dumb, the blinde, and the phraſe is very proper
and elegant. For hearing, as the Philoſophers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
being the ſenſe of diſcipline by which man
learnes to conceive and ſpeake; deafeneſſe, where
it is naturall, and implanted hath alwayes dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for its conſort, and is no other then a cloſe
impriſonment of the humane ſoule. For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
miſery of cloſe impriſonment is, that men ſo
impriſoned can neither open their minds to their
deareſt friends, nor their deareſt friends open
their mindes to them: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are free to expreſſe their griefe unto their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7898:116"/>

beene ſhut up from the wombe, can neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any intelligence from others, nor give any
ſignifications of their owne thoughts unto their
friends, with whom they converſe. Yet many
ſoules thus ſhut up from the womb did Jeſus, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the priſon dores were opened, and the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

from the womb, had their eares unſtopped, and
the ſtrings wherewith their tongues were holden
preſently untyed.</p>
                  <p>3. But the Pſalmiſt added, <hi>The Lord opened the
eyes of the blinde,</hi> and blindeneſſe is a part likewiſe
of the ſoules impriſonment, ſuch as before the
Pſalmiſts time had received their ſight, by helpe
of Phyſick or other ſecondary meanes, were ſaid
(in the language of thoſe good times) to have
their eyes opened by the Lord; becauſe unleſſe
the Lord doe bleſſe the medicine, the Phyſitians
labour is in vaine. Yet of many blinde men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to ſight by miracle or by the immediate

Nor could the Phariſees, though they were the

in plaine termes he avoucheth againſt the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
<hi>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</hi>
But if no man, ſince the world beganne, had done

ſent from God, even God himſelfe? Why did he
not acknowledge, that the clay, which Ieſus made

of that God, which had made the earth it ſelfe
of nothing, by whom all things were made, and
without who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing was made? unto this point
of beleefe he came by degrees; and our Saviour
from this experiment, begets beleefe in him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the maine point of Chriſtianity, and workes
his ſoule unto confeſſion, that he was the ſonne
of God. <hi>Ieſus heard that they had caſt him out, and

thou beleeve on the Prophet that is to come into

<hi>doeſt thou beleeve on the ſonne of God? He anſwered,

ſaid unto him, thou haſt both ſeene him, and it is
he that talketh with thee. And he ſaid, Lord I beleeve
and he worſhipped him. Iohn</hi> 9. 35, 36, 37, 38. With

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7898:117"/>
which was due only unto God. Thus you ſee,
that Jeſus by feeding the hungry with his owne
hand, by opening the eares of the deafe with the
breath of his mouth, and the eyes of the blinde
with his finger, doth prove him to be that very
Lord and God, in whoſe praiſes that excellent
hymne (the 146, Pſalme) was written and daily
ſung by the Iews and Phariſees, although their
eyes, becauſe they winked with them, and hated
the light, were not open to underſtand the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it.</p>
                  <p>4. But were there no other Priſoners, beſides
the deafe and the blind, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Pſalmiſt foretells
the Lord (in whoſe praiſe that Pſal. was conceived
&amp; ſung) would unlooſe? no other whom Ieſus du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of his propheticall function did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe?
Sure all were priſoners that were bound
by Satan, and ſo bound were moſt of theſe lame
and diſeaſed, which our Saviour cured, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
that poore woman, mentioned <hi>Luke 13.
15,</hi> 16. was Satans priſoner, as wee may gather
from our Saviours reply unto the ruler of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,
whoſe heart was inflamed with diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
zeale and indignation aſwell againſt our
Saviour for healing, as againſt the people for
bringing their ſicke to bee healed upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day. <hi>The Lord then anſwered him and ſaid,
thou Hypocrite doth not each one of you on the Sabbath
looſe his Oxe or his Aſſe from his ſtall, and lead him
away to watering? And ought not this woman, being
a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, loe
theſe eighteene yeares, be looſed from this bond, on the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7898:117"/>
Sabbath-day? And when he had ſaid theſe things, all
his adverſaries were aſhamed, and all the people rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for all the glorious things that were done by him.
Luke</hi> 13. 15, 16, 17. Not only the cure it ſelfe,
but his manner of working it, manifeſtly witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that he which wrought it, was that Lord, in
whoſe praiſe the Pſalmiſt conceived that ſong.
For he did not cure her as a meſſenger ſent from
God, or as a miniſter of delegated power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but by word of majeſtie as Lord and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the health which hee beſtowed upon her.
<hi>Woman ſaith he, thou art looſed from thine infirmitie.
And he laid his hands upon her, and immediatly ſhee
was made ſtraight, and glorified God.</hi> Beſides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
correſpondence between the Pſalmiſts words,
<hi>[The Lord raiſeth up them that are bowed downe]</hi> and
the Evangeliſts deſcription of the party cured
and the cure, <hi>[as that ſhee was bowed together, and
could in no way lift her ſelfe up;]</hi> there is another
point very remarkable in the character or phraſe
of the Evangeliſt. For in the beginning of this
relation he ſaith, <hi>when Ieſus ſaw her he ſaid unto her:</hi>
(this was before ſhee was healed) but when hee
relates our Saviours reply unto the Ruler of the
Synagogue (after ſhe was healed) he doth not ſay,
Ieſus then anſwered him and ſaid, <hi>but the Lord
then anſwered him and ſaid;</hi> as if he himſelfe had
conceived, and would lead us into the ſame
truth that this very fact had ſufficiently manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
that Ieſus, whom the people tooke for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
to be that very Lord, of whom that Pſalme
was literally meant, and in whom this clauſe of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7898:118"/>
                     <hi>raiſing up thoſe that were bowed downe,</hi> was at this
time, and not before, punctually fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>For concluſion, I would requeſt the Reader
to obſerve that our Saviours anſwer unto <hi>Iohn
Matt.</hi> 11. 5. hath as ſpeciall and peculiar refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto this 146. Pſalme, as it hath unto thoſe
places in the 35, and 61 of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which have been
expounded<note n="*" place="margin">In Chr: anſwer to Iohns que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> elſewhere. All three places, but the
35, of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and this 146, Pſalme eſpecially, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
prove Jeſus to be not only the Meſſias, or
him that was to come, but to be the Lord God of
<hi>Iacob,</hi> whoſe praiſes this Pſalmiſt and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſought to ſet forth.</p>
                  <p>5. The difference betweene the Evangeliſts
relation, and the Pſalmiſts prediction of Chriſts
miracles <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 5. is very little, or (to ſpeake
properly,) is no difference, or a difference im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
ſuch exact correſpondency, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the character and the letter, or impreſſion
which it makes. The verball difference, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
correſpondencie is this. The Evangeliſt from
our Saviours mouth in the firſt place relates the
miracles, <hi>[tbe blinde receive their ſight, and the lame
walke, the Lepers are cleanſed, and the deafe heare,
&amp;c.]</hi> and from theſe particulars makes up this
generall principles, <hi>[Bleſſed is he whoſoever ſhall not
be offended in me.]</hi> The Pſalmiſt contrariwiſe firſt
ſets downe the ſame principle, and afterwards
foretells the miracles, which were to be as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
proofes or experiments, whereby this people
might know the God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> when hee ſhould
come in perſon, to make them happy. <hi>Happy is he</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:7898:118"/>
(ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that hath the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>for
his help, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God.</hi> Why are
they happy which truſt in him, or would not be
offended in him, when he came unto them? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he made heaven and earth, the Sea and all that
therein is, which keepeth truth for ever, which exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth
judgement for the oppreſſed, which giveth food
to the hungry, the Lord looſeth the Priſoners,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal.
146. 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>6 The ſumme of all that the Iew or heathen
can object againſt us, for thus interpreting this
place, or for adoring Chriſt Ieſus whom they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
as the very God here meant by the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
muſt amount from that generall prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(as they will interpret it) ver. 3. <hi>Put not your
truſt in Princes nor in the ſonne of man, in whom there
is no helpe,</hi> or <hi>no ſalvation.</hi> But yee Chriſtians (will
they ſay) put your truſt in the ſonne of man, in
the ſonne of <hi>Mary</hi> a woman, and therefore tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
the Pſalmiſts precept. But admitting theſe
words <hi>[Put not your truſt in Princes</hi> &amp;c.] had beene
expreſt in this univerſall forme [Put not your
truſt in any Princes, nor in any ſonne of man
whomſoever: for there is no help in any of them]
Yet ſuch univerſall rules do uſually admit ſome
exception, or an exception of ſome principall
particular. As when it is ſaid, <hi>he hath put all things
under his feet; it is manifeſt</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle 1 Cor.
15. 27. <hi>that he is excepted, who put all things under
him,</hi> though He be more then all things that are
put under him. And when our Apoſtle tells us,
that wee muſt utterly renounce all workes, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7898:119"/>
only rely on the mercy of God in Chriſt: Yet the
renouncing of all workes (which is the greateſt
of all workes) muſt be excepted from this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rule. For he that renounceth this worke can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come to Chriſt, cannot be partaker of Gods
mercy in him. And ſo in this generall prohibition
of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>put not your truſt in Princes, nor in
any ſon of man, that ſonne of man</hi> muſt be excepted,
who is alſo more then the ſonne of man, more
then any Prince, the ſonne of God, the Lord God
of Iſraell. In all other Princes, beſides this one
Prince, who was to raigne for ever, there is no
help, no ſalvation, and becauſe they are voyd of
help and ſalvation, they are uncapable of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;
wee may not ſafely repoſe our truſt in
them, or upon them. But I would demand of the
Iew, what opinion his Forefathers, in the time
of <hi>Moſes, Samuel, David,</hi> and the Prophets, had of
their expected Meſſias? What opinion the ſeed
of <hi>Abraham</hi> this day living have of the ſonne of
<hi>David,</hi> whom they expect ſhal raigne over them?
Was he, in the opinion of their forefathers, to be
no more then the ſonne of man, though the ſon
of <hi>David?</hi> If he were to be no more then ſo,
there was no confidence, by the Pſalmiſts rule, to
be placed in him; they were not to expect help
or ſalvation from him; he could be but another
<hi>David,</hi> another <hi>Sampſon,</hi> another <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> or <hi>Moſes.</hi>
If he were to be but a King on Earth, as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have beene before him, though all others,
though put together, of much leſſe power then
they expect he ſhall be; yet their expectation of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7898:119"/>
him is fuller fraught with revenge and malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, then with hope of any great good
unto themſelves, if ſo he were to be but a mighty
Prince or Monarch, not truely God, or if his
Kingdome were but of this world, or to be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within the ſphere of the Moone, for ſo he
might bruiſe and cruſh the Nations, as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> the
Canaanites, or <hi>David</hi> his enemies; he could not
make all his own followers Kings and Monarchs.
Nor could Monarchies or Kingdomes make them
happy, on whom he did beſtow them; there could
be no help or ſalvation generall either in Prince,
or Subject. The more bountifull he were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
temporall bleſſings, wealth, power or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
upon the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh,
the greater calamity he ſhould bring upon other
Nations. How then could he be that promiſed
ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in whom all the Nations of the
earth were to be bleſſed? Finally if the ancient
Iews (as I think theſe moderne Iews will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
expected help and ſalvation from their Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if they taught their poſterity to put truſt in
this promiſed ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whenſoever he
ſhould be revealed, then it is concluded, that their
expected Meſſias was to bee that God of Iſrael,
whom the Pſalmiſt in the 146. Pſalme deſcribeth.
And this is the fundamentall article of Chriſtian
faith, unto the acknowledgement whereof this
Lord God of Iſrael in his good time bring the
ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh, and all others
which either deny it, or are ignorant of it.</p>

and Phariſees</hi> (who were then preſent) <hi>begun to

It was moſt true what from this place they col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
to wit, that God alone could forgive ſins. But
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7898:120"/>
from the preſent miracle,<note place="margin">Cap. 22</note> and the manner of our
Saviours converſation with them here on earth,

they compared theſe with the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

for them to have gathered that he was that only
God, which did forgive ſinnes. For ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
had ſaid to this people in the perſon of his
only God, <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins,
thou haſt wearied me with thy iniquities.</hi> This in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
is one of thoſe many places, which even
by the Jews confeſſion, could be literally meant
of none, but God himſelfe, and yet could never

make God to ſerve under their ſinnes, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wearied with their iniquities; ſave only
whileſt he took the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant upon him,
and did beare their ſinnes in the ſubſtance of

                  <p>2 Of the ſame obſervation is that other place,
<hi>Eſay 63. 9, 10. In all their affliction he was afflicted,
and the Angell of his preſence ſaved them: in his love
and in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare them,
and caryed them all the dayes of old. But they rebelled
and vexed his holy Spirit. Therefore he was turned to
be their enemie, and he fought againſt them.</hi> And ſo
it is ſaid, <hi>that he was grieved forty yeares with that
generation, which he had delivered out of Egypt.</hi> And
both places, were they to be limited only with

ſenſe. But as well that complaint of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
as this of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> were not meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hiſtoricall, but propheticall, both to be fulfilled
after a more exquiſite ſenſe in later ages. For all
Gods mercies and loving kindneſſe to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were but as pledges, or talents given by
way of earneſt, for greater goodneſſe, and more
tender mercies towards later generations; ſo they
would be thankfull for the former. God, whileſt

All thoſe are paſſions, or accidentall affections,
incident only to fleſh and bloud, or at leaſt to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

all thoſe duties of Chriſtian charitie, or fellow-feeling
of others infirmities, practiſed by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and commended to us by them; he by his
practiſe and converſation, ſet the moſt exquiſite
patterne, more exquiſite then any, who was but
man, could have ſet. For he was a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
and infirmities to beare all our grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
He cured no bodily infirmitie (though he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
many) whoſe griefe (untill the cure was
wrought) he did not ſuffer by exact and perfect
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7898:121"/>
ſympathy. And only by the anguiſh of his ſoule
and ſpirit, not Iſrael alone, but all people through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world, whoever found, or hope to finde
any, muſt find reſt and comfort to their ſoules
and conſciences. Yet all this the wicked poſterity
of that wicked generation, (whoſe ingratitude
towards the God of their Fathers did miniſter
both matter of complaint and of prophecy to the
Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the Pſalmiſt) no way regarded,
but requited all the paines, trouble, and affliction
which he had undertaken for their poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
bodily good, and the comfort of all their
ſoules, with ſuperaddition of thoſe deadly griefes
and ſorowes, which by the Romans help they
brought upon him. This God of Iſrael in former

them in the form of an Angell, <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but his deputy, or under Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander. But now
that they have thus ungratefully requited him
for all his loving kindneſſe towards their Fathers,
whilſt he was onely in the forme of God, or did
appeare in the garb or figure, not in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of an Angell, and for all the troubles and
grievances undertaken by him for their good,
whileſt he was in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of man, and <hi>forme</hi>

and fought againſt them. For as Viſitors, though
farre abſent, do yet viſite by their Commiſſaries;
ſo this God of Iſraell, that Jeſus whom the Jews
had crucified being made King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords, did judge Ieruſalem, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Iews, by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> as by his

gods, whom yee know not: and come and ſtand before
me in this houſe which is called by my name, and ſay,
We are delivered to doe all theſe abominations? Is this
houſe, which is called by my name, become a denne of
Robbers in your eyes? Behold even I have ſeen it, ſaith
the Lord. <hi>To have denyed, that God at this time
did truly heare what this people ſaid, did truely
ſee what they did, did perfectly underſtand their
ſecret thoughts, had beene an errour much groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
and more dangerous, then the errour of the</hi>
Anthropomorphitae, <hi>that is, of ſuch as imagined God
by nature to have eyes, eares, and heart like man.
For that was but an hereſie or transformation of
the Deity; the other was</hi> Epicuriſme, <hi>the worſt
and groſſeſt errour wherewith the very heathen
or Infidels were poſſeſt. And ſo the Pſalmiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
it,</hi> Pſal. 94. 7. Yet they ſay, the Lord ſhall

inſtructions, they could have learned: thus
much at the leaſt; that the Lord God himſelfe,
who ſent the Prophet to deliver this meſſage,
The Lord God of Iſrael, who neither ſlumbreth
nor ſleepeth, would watch his oportunity, unleſſe
they did amend theſe miſdemenors, to viſit them
and his temple, not by a Prophet or deputed
Commiſſary, but in perſon, and after as evident
and viſible a manner to fleſh and blood, as the
Prophet had done, but with farre greater power.
The Prophet had only meere ſpirituall power to
proteſt againſt them, no coërcive authority to
puniſh the delinquents, or to baniſh theſe abuſes
out of the Temple: This caſe was reſerved unto
the Lord himſelfe, and was put in execution by
him oftner then once, as I take it, at two ſeverall
Paſſeovers. For ſo we read <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 13. &amp;c. <hi>And
the Iews Paſſeover was at hand, and Ieſus went up to
Ieruſalem, and found in the Temple thoſe that ſold Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
and ſheep, and Doves, and the changers of money
ſitting. And when he had made a ſcourge of ſmall cordes
he drove them all out of the Temple, and the ſheep and
the Oxen; and powred out the changers money, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew
the Tables, and ſaid unto them that ſold
Doves; Take theſe things hence, make not my Fathers
houſe an houſe of Merchandiſe.</hi> This was done, I
take it, at the firſt Paſſeover after his baptiſme,
but hee exerciſed the ſame power with greater
authority at his laſt comming to Jeruſalem in
triumph, ſo we read <hi>Matt. 21. 12, 13. And Ieſus
went into the Temple of God, and caſt out all them,
that ſold and bought in the Temple, and overthrew the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7898:123"/>
tables of the money changers, and the ſeats of them
that ſold Doves; and ſaid unto them, it is written, My
houſe ſhall be called the houſe of prayer: but yee have
made it a denne of theeves.</hi> It is to me remarkable,
that this Evangeliſt ſaith, he went into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God: and yet when hee relates the very
words which he then uſed, he ſaith not, as in the
former place of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> he did; <hi>It is written, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe ſhall be called an houſe of prayer;</hi> but <hi>My
houſe ſhall be called the houſe of prayer, yet yee have
made it a denne of theeves.</hi> And both S. <hi>Marke</hi> and
S. <hi>Luke</hi> retaine the very ſame character of ſpeech:
<hi>Ieſus</hi> ſaith he, <hi>went into the Temple, &amp;c. and would
not ſuffer, that any man ſhould cary any veſſell through
the Temple,</hi> (an abuſe for which <hi>Ieremie</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Gods judgement againſt their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:)
and he taught, ſaying unto them, <hi>Is it not
written, my houſe ſhall be called of all Nations the houſe
of prayer: but yee have made it a denne of theeves?
&amp;c. Mark</hi> 11. 15, 16, 17. The like is <hi>Luke 19.
46.</hi> Both by his ſpeech, and by the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exerciſe of his more then royall authoritie, he
gave them evidently to underſtand, ſo they
would have beene taught by him, that hee was
that very Lord, that very God of Iſrael, unto
whom that houſe had beene dedicated, that Lord
which had ſent his Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> to dehort their
forefathers from polluting the Temple, as now
their poſterity doe. And if we conſider the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
condition, or ſtubborne temper of Church tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
men, and the ſtrong back which long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of this plauſible cuſtome of making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7898:124"/>
for ſacrifices in the temple, had given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that ſharp edge, which the opportunity of this
great and ſolemne feaſt had ſet upon their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
deſires of gaine; it is not imaginable, that ſo
many men would ſo quickly have quit their ſeats
of merchandize, for the laſh of any one mans hand
unleſſe it had been withall the very hand of God:
not credible that all the eyes in the world beſides
could have blencht them in their wonted courſe,
unleſſe they had bin eyed &amp; looked upon, by the
very eyes of God himſelfe, of that God who was
chiefe Lord of the Temple. For ſo the eyes of
Chriſt, as we Chriſtians beleeve and know, were
as truly the eyes of God, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremies</hi>
eyes were his owne, and that whileſt he ſaw and
looked upon thoſe abuſes of the temple with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
eyes, yet he ſaw them with the eyes of God
in as ſtrict and exquiſite a ſenſe, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> had ſeen
them with the eyes of man.</p>
                  <p>3. The contents of this text are a prediction,
or preſignification, of that rank and nature, which
hath beene before deciphered in the generall,
that is, a prediction typically propheticall; ſuch as
that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The ſtone which the builders
refuſed, is become the chiefe ſtone in the corner.</hi> Or
that which in the literall or hiſtoricall ſenſe did
reſpect the Paſchall Lamb. <hi>[Not a bone of it ſhall be
broken.]</hi> For the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> did by expreſſe
words foretell, and by matter of fact foreſhadow,
that which afterwards was moſt exactly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.
He was perſecuted by that generation
wherein he lived, for the delivery of that meſſage
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7898:124"/>
Chap. 7. ver. 12, 13, 14. <hi>But goe yee now into my
place which was in Shiloh, where I ſet my name at
the firſt, and ſee what I did to it, for the wickedneſſe
of my people Iſrael. And now, becauſe yee have done
all theſe works, ſaith the Lord, and I ſpeake unto you,
riſing up early, and ſpeaking, but yee heard not; and I
called you, but yee anſwered not: therefore will I doe
unto this houſe, which is called by my name, wherein
yee truſt, and unto the place which I gave to you, and
to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</hi> The ſame
meſſage was delivered by him, many yeares after
this time, by the expreſſe commandement of the
Lord, chap. 26. ver. 4, 5, 6. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſay unto
them, Thus ſaith the Lord, if yee will not hearken to
me, to walk in my Law which I have ſet before you
to hearken to the words of my ſervants the Prophets,
whom I ſent unto you, both riſing up early, and ſending
them (but yee have not hearkened:) then will I make
this houſe like Shiloh, and will make this citie a curſe
to all the nations of the earth.</hi> His perſecution for
this delivery of his meſſage from the Lord, is
upon ſacred record, ver. 8, 9. <hi>Now it came to paſſe
when Ieremiah had made an end of ſpeaking all that
the Lord had commanded him to ſpeak unto all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that the Prieſts and the Prophets and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
tooke him, ſaying, Thou ſhalt ſurely die: why haſt
thou prophecited in the name of the Lord ſaying? This
houſe ſhall be like Shiloh, &amp;c.</hi> The laſt generation
of the Jews, with whom our Saviour converſed
in as viſible and familiar manner, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> had
done with their forefathers, did charge him firſt,
and afterwards his Martyr S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> with capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7898:125"/>
blaſphemy, for ſaying, the Temple then ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſhould be deſtroyed. The accuſation of our
Saviour for theſe words (conceived to be uttered
by him) you have <hi>Mat. 26. 60, 61. Yea though
many falſe witneſſes came, yet found they none. At the
laſt came two falſe witneſſes and ſaid, this fellow ſaid,
I am able to deſtroy the Temple of God, and build it in
three dayes.</hi> Or, as S. <hi>Mark</hi> hath the ſame accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Chap. 14. ver. 57, 58, 59. <hi>And there aroſe
certaine, and bare falſe witneſſe againſt him, ſaying,
We have heard him ſay, I will deſtroy this Temple that
is made with hands, and within three dayes I will
build another made without hands. But neither ſo did
their witneſſe agree together.</hi> If they had agreed, or
come home to the interrogatories propoſed, he
had dyed (if they had had the power of death)
for ſaying the very ſame words in effect, for
which their forefathers threatned <hi>Ieremy</hi> with
death. The ſame practiſe you have reiterated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
S. <hi>Stephen, Acts 6. ver. 12, 13. And they
ſtirred up the people, and the Elders and the Scribes,
and came upon him, and caught him, and brought
him to the Councill, and ſet up falſe witneſſes, which
ſaid, this man ceaſeth not to ſpeake blaſphemous words
againſt this holy place, and the Law. For wee have
heard him ſay, that this Ieſus of Nazareth ſhal deſtroy
this place, and ſhall change the cuſtomes which</hi> Moſes
<hi>delivered us.</hi> Whether S. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid thus or no,
I will not diſpute, but moſt probable it is, that he
did never ſay this in expreſſe termes, becauſe the
Text ſaith, <hi>They ſet up falſe witneſſes againſt him.</hi>
However, theſe falſe witneſſes againſt S. <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:7898:125"/>
did truly prophecy as <hi>Cataphas</hi> did. For Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made Chriſt, did deſtroy the Temple by the
Romanes, and abrogated the ceremonies given
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe they had made up the meaſure
of their forefathers ſinnes, who perſecuted <hi>Ieremy</hi>
for ſaying no more, in effect, then they laid to S.
<hi>Stephens</hi> charge. And that which <hi>Ieremy</hi> threatned,
was in part fulfilled not long after his perſecution
and impriſonment. For Sion became like Shiloh,
a deſolate place and forſaken of God for a long
time; yet reedified againe within the age or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
then living: ſo was not Shiloh untill this
day. Nor hath Jeruſalem or Sion been reſtored,
ſince they forſook the Lord God of their Fathers,
when he came to viſit his Temple, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> had
done, and to be annointed King over Sion.</p>
                  <p>4. All that I have to adde unto the former te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 7. is this; that our Saviour, at this
time of his conſecration, or whileſt he was a King
or Prieſt <hi>in fieri</hi> only, did give ſome documents
of his royall power, or juſt chalenge to his right
over Judah and Jeruſalem, in a more ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
then at any time before hee had done. For
wee doe not reade, that he did take upon him to
judge betweene party and party in matters tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
nor to diſpoſe of the goods or poſſeſſions,
whether of Jews or of Gentiles, ſave once, when
he gave the Legion of Devills leave to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heard of Swine, and to cary them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into the Sea. And this hee did immediatly
after he had manifeſted himſelfe to be God, by
commanding the winde and the water, as was
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7898:126"/>
before declared. Before this time he might have
ſaid more truly then <hi>Samuel</hi> did, whoſe Oxe or
Aſſe have I taken? Yet now when he came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
his Temple, he gave his Diſciples Commiſſion
more then royall, to take an Aſſe and her colt for
his ſervice, to ride on them in triumph (as the
Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> had foretold) unto Jeruſalem
and to Sion. And this he did <hi>jure dominii,</hi> by right
of Dominion. The tenour of the Commiſſion,
and the execution of it, you have diſtinctly ſet
downe, <hi>Matt. 21. 1, 2, 3. And when they drew nigh
unto Ieruſalem, and were come to</hi> Bethphage <hi>unto the
Mount of Olives, thou ſent Ieſus two Diſciples, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto them. Goe into the village over againſt you,
and ſtraight way yee ſhall finde an Aſſe tyed, and a colt
with her; looſe them, and bring them to me. And if
any man ſay ought unto you, yee ſhall ſay, The Lord
hath need of them: and ſtraightway he will ſend them.</hi>
And S. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, Chap. 11. ver. 5. <hi>And certain
of them that ſtood there, ſaid unto them, What doe yee
looſing the colt? And they ſaid unto them, even as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
had commanded; and they let them goe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. This manner of his comming to Jeruſalem,
his powerfull viſitation of the Temple immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
upon it, and the Inſcription which <hi>Pilate</hi>
made on his Croſſe, ſome foure dayes after, with
other remarkable circumſtances of the ſtory or
journall of that ſacred weeke, be a pregnant teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
that this Ieſus of Nazareth, whom wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
was that King of the Iews and of Sion,
whoſe comming <hi>Zacharias</hi> had ſo long before
foretold. But it is not ſo apparent out of his
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7898:126"/>
forecited prophecy, either that this King of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on
was the God of Sion, or that the God of Sion, and
of Iſrael, was to be made King of both. For in that
he was God, he was the King not of Iſrael or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea
only, but of all the earth, God over all from
everlaſting to everlaſting by right of Creation.
The next point then in queſtion betwixt the
Iew and us, is this; Whether it may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
proved from the literall ſenſe of thoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
which they adore, that he, who was the
God of Sion, and of Iſrael, from everlaſting to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting,
were to be made King of Sion in later
times, or after the gift of Prophecy did ceaſe in
Iudea and Ieruſalem.</p>

that judgement of the people, which he implores
of God. I dare not affirme, that the 47. Pſalme
was penned or conceived by <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, yet
authenticke and Canonicall among the Iewes.
Now the whole current of that Pſalme containes
a generall acclamation, or gratulatory hymne of

had their literall verification in the practiſe of

ſuch joyfull acclamations, as are here cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractered,
and exalt the name of the Lord, by
hymnes of praiſe and thankſgiving. But both
ſongs and ditties, the geſtures of both Prieſts and
people which ſung them, did foreſignifie matter
of more univerſall triumphant joy, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to all Nations, when God ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſuch a gratious King over them, as he had
beene over the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ver. 7, and 8.
<hi>For God is the King of all the earth, ſing yee praiſes

God ſitteth upon the throne of his holineſſe.</hi> Was it the
chiefe matter of this publique joy, that God
ſhould ſubdue the Nations under the feete of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
poſteritie? This had been rather cauſe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to the heathen Nations, then any juſt cauſe
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort to the Iew, if theſe words (according to
the literall) did import a temporall or civill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the Nations by conqueſt of ſword. Nor
doth the originall word import any ſuch thing,
but a voluntary ſubjection or ſubmiſſion wrought
by faire and gentle perſwaſion. And by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
meaning of the very letter; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were to rejoyce, in that they were to be
thus ſubdued, not to the whole Nation of the
Iews, but to the inheritance which God had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
for them, or to the excellency of <hi>Iacob</hi> whom
he loved. And theſe (as <hi>Theodores</hi> rightly obſerves)
were the Apoſtles and Diſciples, whom God had
choſen out of the Iewiſh Nation. Theſe indeed
have brought not our bodies, but our ſoules and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7898:128"/>
conſciences, under ſubjection to the yoake of
Chriſt; who was the God whom the Pſalmiſt
therefore prophecied ſhould be very highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,
not by aſcending of the Ark into Mount
Sion, nor by propagation of his Kingdome, or
gayning a greater multitude of ſubjects here on
earth, then he had whilſt the Jews only were his
choſen people; but by erecting a new throne and
Kingdome in the higheſt Heavens, where now
he dwelleth, and executeth the royall judicature
which he before did in the Tabernacle or in the
Temple: there he had a viſible <hi>throne,</hi> and a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<hi>mercy ſeate,</hi> but there his preſence was not
alwaies viſible, nor viſible at any time but in
type or figure. And if wee may beleeve the later
Iewiſh Doctors, when they ſpeake unwittingly
for us againſt themſelves, that ſolemne feſtivall
wherein this triumphant ſong was publiquely
ſung, was firſt inſtituted, and afterwards continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as an anniverſary memoriall of the dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Temple,<note n="a" place="margin">Vide Mollerum in argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum hujus Pſalmi.</note> or for bringing the Ark
into it: and that was as much as the inthronizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the God of Iſrael, as peculiar King and Lord
of Sion. But they themſelves do grant, that this
very Pſalme was not only a triumphall memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of what was paſt, but withall propheticall, and
to bee fulfilled in the dayes of their expected
Meſſias. And ſo we Chriſtians ſee it now exactly
fulfilled, according both to the myſticall and to
the punctuall literall ſenſe, in Chriſt Ieſus their

                  <p>3 That the God of Iſrael was to become

that time, when theſe late cited hymnes were
conſecrated to his praiſe, had been experienced;
many other Pſalmes do ſo punctually import,
that without this ſuppoſition, or this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, they can have neither any true lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
meaning, nor conteyne any remarkable truth
worthy the note of <hi>Selah,</hi> which is often inſerted
in Pſalmes of this kind. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the 93. Pſalme) <hi>reigneth; he is cloathed with
maieſty. The Lord is cloathed with ſtrength, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he hath girded himſelfe.</hi> He was to be thus
cloathed, thus girded with ſtrength, not as God,
but as King. <hi>The world alſo is ſtabliſhed; that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                     <hi>of old,
â tunc,</hi> from then, that is, from the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was thus to raigne, and thus to be cloathed
with Majeſty. And by this eſtabliſhing of his
throne, the world was to be eſtabliſhed after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
manner then it had beene. He himſelfe
indeed (as it followeth in the ſame verſe) was
from eternitie. So was not the throne or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which the Pſalmiſt there doth not only
deſcribe but prophecy of; [his throne is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
throne] yet everlaſting (as we ſay) <hi>à parte

eternitie: and ſo is the kingdome here meant. And

Lord raigneth, the world alſo ſhall be eſtabliſhed, that
it ſhall not be moved: he ſhall judge the people righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.
Let the heavens rejoyce, and let the earth be glad,
let the ſea roare, and the fulneſſe thereof: Let the
Feilds be joyfull, and all that is therein, then ſhall all
the trees of the wood rejoyce before the Lord: for he
commeth, for he commeth to judge the earth, he ſhall
judge the world with righteouſneſſe, and the people with
his truth.</hi> All theſe are characters of times future;
and that joyfulneſſe <hi>of the fields and all that is in
them,</hi> &amp;c. which the Prophet mentions, is (I take
it) no other then the fulfilling or ſatisfying of
<hi>the earneſt expectation of the Creature, wayting for
the manifeſtation of the ſonnes of God. Rom.</hi> 8. 19.</p>
                  <p>That of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 1. fals under the
ſame line of obſervation: <hi>The Lord reigneth, let
the earth rejoyce, let the multitude of the Iſles rejoyce.</hi>
This literally implies, that the earth, whether ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
taken, or reſtrained to the Land of Jewry,
ſhould have better cauſe to rejoyce, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Iles new occaſions of greater glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
then in former times they had knowne.
When then was this new matter of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
there promiſed to all the earth and her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
to begin to beare date, or bee <hi>in eſſe?</hi>
From that point of time, wherein the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to raigne after another manner, then before
he had done. The raigne of the Lord over all the
earth, and over all the Ilands of the earth (if wee
conſider him only as God) was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world, and ſo ſhall continue without
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7898:130"/>
change or alteration World without end. The
raigne of the Lord then, in this place foretold,
muſt be the raigne of God incarnate, or of Gods
being made King. And thoſe holy men of God
which thus ſpeake, did by the ſpirit of prophecie
foreſee thoſe dayes which <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
to ſee. Now the beginning of theſe joyfull
dayes; was from the time wherein the Lord did
<hi>looſe the Priſoners, did deale his bread unto the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
did open the eyes of the blinde, and rayſed them,
that were bowed downe,</hi> with his owne hands, or
with his owne voice. For ſo the Author of the

conclude that admirable <gap reason="foreign">

(by Gods aſſiſtance) I have finiſhed the reſt
of theſe Comments; and then, by way of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or devotions only. Thus much notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the former conſiderations, and the very
fundamental grounds of true Chriſtianity inforce
us to grant; that in the divine nature, though moſt
indiviſibly one, there is an eminent ideall paterne
of ſuch a diſtinction as we call betweene party and
party; a capacity to give, &amp; a capacity to receive;
a capacity to demand, and a capacity to ſatisfie:
Capacities ſufficiently different for the exerciſe
of juſtice and love, not <hi>ad extra</hi> only, but within
the divine nature it ſelfe. If there were but one
<hi>party,</hi> or <hi>perſon</hi> in the divine nature, the remiſſion
of mens ſinnes without ſatisfaction had beene
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7898:131"/>
more proper and pertinent, then remitting of
them upon ſatisfaction. For one and the ſelfe
ſame party to demand ſatisfaction of himſelfe,
and to make it to himſelfe (eſpecially by way of
puniſhment or diſgracefull affliction) is ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
to reaſon it ſelfe, that it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of admiration to reaſon ſanctified, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
by grace.</p>
                  <p>2. But this is that which ſome moderne here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
labour to prove; to wit, That God did not
exact ſatisfaction for our ſinnes of our Saviour
Chriſt Ieſus; that it had beene exact cruelty in
God to have laid the burthen of all our ſinnes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, who knew no ſinne. But how then is
Chriſt ſaid to have taken away our ſinnes? God,
(ſay theſe man) did freely remit them without
ſatisfaction, and Chriſt did take them away, by
ſetting us a paterne of holineſſe; and of patience
in affliction; That is, in ſuch ſort as a Phyſitian
might be ſaid to have taken away an epidemicall
diſeaſe, by preſcribing a <hi>recipe,</hi> which every one
after might make for himſelfe, and be his owne
Apothecary. Briefly, they thinke that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be excuſed from cruelty, but by denying all
true and proper ſatisfaction made to him by
Chriſt. But it is an overſight uſually incident to
men enclouded in groſſer errours, to object that
unto their Adverſaries, as an inconvenience or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
conſequence, which is ſuch only according
to the objecters owne tenets, but moſt true and
conſonant to their principles whom they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne,
if theſe might be taken into due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

of death denounced by the Law, without
perfect inherent righteouſneſſe or fulfilling of the

the mercies of God in Chriſt, who once for all
ſuffered for our ſinnes, and daily abſolves us from

Indeed, were there but one party or capacity in

who preſſe a neceſſity or convenience of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

fall either wide, or ſhort, of all ſuch as maintaine
this diſtinction of parties, or perſons in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature. For if the ſonne of God, or <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
were truely God from eternity, and remained
God after man did make himſelfe the ſervant of
Satan; he might, without wrong to any man, to
any party, without wrong to himſelfe (for <hi>volenti
non ſit injuria)</hi> voluntarily take the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
upon him, and in that <hi>forme,</hi> or low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man, make <hi>perfect</hi> ſatisfaction <hi>per tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem
paenae, for all our debts, for all our ſinnes;</hi> and
our debts being fully paid, reſtore us to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and priviledge of the ſonnes of God. He both
might and did truly purchaſe that peculiar domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over us, which he hath over all men, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
dominion of puniſhing all Gods ungraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and of crowning all his thankfull and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſervants. This dominion, as it is peculiar to
Chriſt, was purchaſed by true and reall ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made unto God.</p>
                  <p>4. But what it was for <hi>Chriſt, the ſonne of God,</hi>
to take upon him the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant, or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this condition or <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
conſiſt, are points which neither the Arian
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7898:134"/>
nor the Socinian did ever take into ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
If the Socinian would yet doe ſo, he
might clearely ſee that his former objections
could not reach us, but muſt rebound upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
For the man Chriſt Jeſus, being ſo juſt a
man, as we beleeve, and he grants he was, unleſſe
he had been more then man, truly God, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a ſervant withall, it could not have ſtood with
the goodneſſe of God, nor with any rule of juſtice
divine or humane, either to have puniſhed him
for our ſakes, as we ſay God did, or to have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to undergoe ſuch hard and cruell uſage
at the hands of wicked and ſinfull men, as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians
confeſſe he did undergo; without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
or complaint. But this is a point which
cannot be orderly handled, untill we come to the
death and paſſion of our Lord and Saviour, which
was the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or period (rather,) of his ſervitude,
or of being in the forme of a ſervant, which was
the <hi>Baſis</hi> of his humiliation. And albeit I purpoſe
not in that place to diſpute, whether God could
poſſibly have freely remitted our ſinnes without
any ſatisfaction (a queſtion to which no wiſe men
will take upon them to give a peremptory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
whether negative or affirmative:) yet I ſhall
by Gods aſſiſtance, there make it cleare, that no
other meanes of manner of remitting out ſinnes,
of abſolving or juſtifying us, or of bringing us to
glory, which either the <hi>Socinian,</hi> or the wit of
man can imagine, could have been ſo admirable
to ſober capacities, as that way and manner which
the Scripture plainly teacheth, and that in briefe
is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:7898:134"/>
5. The divine nature, in the perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
requires ſatisfaction for the tranſgreſſions
of man againſt the eternall Law and unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rule of goodneſſe, or thoſe poſitive Lawes
which he had given in ſpeciall to man. The ſame
divine nature in the perſon of the ſonne, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
to make ſatisfaction for us, in taking our
nature upon him, and <hi>Hee</hi> having by right of
conſanguinity, the authority and power of redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
us; the ſame divine nature in the perſon of
the holy Ghoſt doth approve, and ſeale this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and ever bleſſed compromiſe. This ineffable
accord betweene the divine perſons in the unity
of the Godhead, concerning the great worke of
mans redemption, is moſt exactly parallel to that
accord, which ſome of the Ancient have excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
obſerved betwixt them in that work of
creation, as hath beene before expreſſed in that
article. Not to repeat, nor to adde to that which
was there delivered, but to continue theſe preſent
diſcuſſions concerning the eternity and perſon of
the ſonne of God.</p>
                  <p>6. Some there have beene, and are, who gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all that wee have ſaid, or can deſire to bee
granted, concerning the incarnation of God, or
Trinity of perſons in the unity of the Godhead,
further demand; why God rather in the perſon
of the ſonne, then in the perſon of the father, or
of the holy Ghoſt ſhould bee incarnate or made
fleſh? But might not theſe men (ſome perhaps
will ſay) as well have demanded, why God the
Father did make the world rather by the ſonne
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7898:135"/>
then by himſelfe, or by the holy Ghoſt? Or why
this title of <hi>Him, by whom all thing were made,</hi>
ſhould be peculiar to God the ſonne? And to this
queſtion, it would be a ſatisfactory anſwer to ſay,
that we muſt believe that the world was ſo made
becauſe the Scripture, which is the only rule and
guide of faith, doth ſo inſtruct us; or becauſe the
perſons of the bleſſed Trinity (for reaſons beſt
knowne unto themſelves alone) would have it to
be ſo, and ſo to be written. But many arguments
there be well obſerved by the ancient, and better
explicated by moderne Divines, (ſome of whoſe
works are extant in print, others worthy of the
preſſe) unto which I ſhall be as farre from adding
as from detracting. Theſe reaſons alone abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſatisfie all the deſires, which I ever had to
be informed in this point. Firſt, ſeeing the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Trinity was pleaſed to have ſatisfaction made
for the ſinnes of mankinde, and by this ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to exhibit an exquiſite paterne of juſtice and
equitie: Secondly, ſeeing mans ſinne did eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
conſiſt in rebellion; the ſatisfaction was (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rule or paterne of equitie and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice)
to be made by moſt exquiſite obedience.
Now the moſt exquiſite obedience that can bee
performed, is from a ſonne unto his father, or
from a ſervant unto his Lord. Hence it pleaſed
the eternall wiſedome, and ſonne of God, to take
not the nature of man only, but the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
(for a while) upon him, to make the moſt
perfect and abundant ſatisfaction, by the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
obedience of which both the ſtate of a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7898:135"/>
ſonne, and condition of a ſervant was capable.</p>
                  <p>7. The ſtone of offence, whereat the Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
(who account themſelves good Chriſtians,
and doe not deny Chriſt to be the Sonne of God)
doe ſo much ſtumble, is in part the very ſame
with the prejudice which the Arians had of the
orthodoxall truth; whoſe breach or diſruption in
the Canon of the ancient Catholique faith, the
firſt Nicene Councill ſought to repaire, not by
addition or ſuperſtruction of any new Articles of
beleife, but by a gentle diduction or dilatation of
that ſenſe, which was included in the Apoſtles
Creed, or in the ancient rule of faith. <hi>I beleeve in
one God, &amp;c, and in one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the only
begotten ſonne of God, begotten of his father before all
worlds,</hi> and againe, <hi>very God of very God, begotten
not made, being of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father,
&amp;c.</hi> It is not improbable, that the Arians and their
followers might take offence, or pick a quarell,
at this Title [of being the only begotten ſon of
God before all worlds] the rather, becauſe ſome
of the moſt ancient, and not a few middle-age
writers do ſeek to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this article upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

                     </hi> as if <hi>hodiè</hi> in that place did not literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

or notable hiſtoricall events, but were put

no queſtion betweene profeſſors of Chriſtianity
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7898:136"/>
about the eternall generation of Chriſt Jeſus, as
he is the ſonne of God. But ſo it often falls out,
that ſome one impertinent allegation, or weake

That the Pſalmiſt Pſal. 2. ſpeakes of our Saviours

or have any eſpeciall reference to what is paſt,

of that great Article. I dare not in this
place, uſe the former authority, to proove the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
generation of the ſonne of God.</p>
                  <p>8 That hee ſhould bee [the onely begotten
Sonne of God] otherwiſe then by his <hi>begetting
from the dead</hi> unto glory and immortalitie; or
that he ſhould be ſo before the World (from all
eternity) may ſeeme to imply a contradiction <hi>in
terminis.</hi> For the Father muſt be before the ſonne,
unleſſe we take theſe termes, as termes meerely
relative, not as importing any ſubſtance or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
All termes meerely relative <hi>quà tales</hi> are
<hi>ſimul naturâ, coaevall for ſtanding. Abraham,</hi> though
an ancient man, was not <hi>Iſaacs</hi> Father, before
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7898:136"/>
                     <hi>Iſaac</hi> was his ſonne. But if wee reſpect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or ſubſtances betwixt whom ſuch relations
ſtand, the perſon of the Father is alwaies before
the perſon of the ſonne, according to precedence
of time; or if we conſider not the perſons or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
but that which they call <hi>proximum funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
relationis, that act or operation, from which
ſuch relations do immediately reſult;</hi> ſo it is true that
<hi>generans eſt prior generato, Begetting or to beget hath
priority or precedencis</hi> (though not of time yet of
nature) of <hi>being begotten.</hi> But if the Sonne of God
be coeternall to his Father, there can be no place
for either of theſe precedencies or priorities, nor
for any thing truely proportionable to them,
ſeeing in eternitie there is <hi>nihil prius, nihil poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
no prioritie, no ſucceſſion. How then can
Chriſt Jeſus be conceived to be the onely ſonne
of God, begotten of his father before all worlds,
if to be before all worlds, be as much as to bee
from all eternitie, or in eternitie? To this wee
anſwer, that where the truth of the matter is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable;
men ſoberly minded ſhould not
wrangle about the ſtrict proprietie of words; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in myſteries whoſe comprehenſion far
ſurpaſſeth mans capacitie, and are even to bleſſed
Angels ineffable, or unexpreſſible in any punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or proper phraſe. The truth which the Nicen
Fathers ſought to eſtabliſh, was this; that Chriſt
Jeſus was not <hi>made</hi> the Sonne of God before all
worlds, but was the ſonne of God, very God of
very God, from all eternitie, coeternall, and coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to his Father. For ſo they expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7898:137"/>
                     <hi>[Hee was begotten and not made]</hi> The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his eternall generation or begetting,
they ſeeme to reſemble to the generation or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of light. For ſo they ſay, <hi>light of light, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
God of very God, &amp;c.</hi> Now that light which the
ſplendid body of the ſunne diffuſeth through the
ayre (but eſpecially through caeleſtiall bodies) is
coevall with its Fountaine, which produceth or
begetteth it. For it was never held a ſoleciſme, to
call <hi>Lumen filiam lucis,</hi> to ſay <hi>light</hi> is the <hi>daughter</hi>
of <hi>the ſunne.</hi> But however it ſhall pleaſe men to
expreſſe the manner of the Sonne of Gods Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
generation; the former inductions, that <hi>Peter
eſt prior filio naturâ et tempore, that the perſon or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Father hath alwayes precedency both of
time and nature</hi> in reſpect of the perſon and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the ſonne, or that <hi>generans</hi> is <hi>prius naturâ
generato,</hi> to <hi>beget hath alwayes precedence of nature,</hi>
(though not of time) of being begotten, are
true onely in temporall generations, or ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
All men, and other generable creatures ſince
the world began have beene moratall <hi>de facto.</hi> The
firſt man was but conditionally immortall. And
albeit he might have lived for ever, yet had he a
beginning of life in time; and ſo were his ſons or
ſucceſſors to have; albeit they had been borne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
or both borne and begotten before he
did ſubject himſelfe and them to mortality, by
ſinne. If immortall creatures could have ſonnes
or ſucceſſors by nature, they were to be immortall
by nature: otherwiſe they ſhould be a kind of
monſters, or an equivocall brood. If then he who
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7898:137"/>
poſſeſſeth eternitie, have a true and proper ſonne
[which the word <hi>only begotten</hi> implyes] after what
manner ſoever he be his ſon, (though by a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
altogether unconceivable to us) that <hi>ſon</hi> muſt
be coeternall to his Father. For the truly eternall
God to have, beget, or produce a ſonne which is
not eternall, but everlaſting only <hi>à parte pòſt,</hi> is as
unconceivable to reaſon, as that an immortall
Father ſhould beget a mortall, or a mortall Father
an immortall ſonne. No Schoolemen did ever
acknowledge the generation of the Son of God
to be univocally like to other generation in all
points beſides the eternitie of it. For even in that
wee acknowledge it to be eternall, wee <hi>difference</hi>
it from all other generations by ſuch an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible
ſuperminencie, as eternitie hath over
time, or diuine immenſitie of all bodily magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
or the Divine Eſſence it ſelfe of Created
Natures.</p>

of ſo great conſequence, I will not allot one place
onely for the clearing of it, but inſiſt upon it
(more or leſſe) in all the articles which concerne
Chriſt. For in all of them, wee ſhall be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to incounter the Jew, as well as the Arrian, or
Socinian.</p>
                  <p>2 Whether of theſe two be the greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or more dangerous enemy to the croſſe of
Chriſt, that I leave to God the Father, and Chriſt
Jeſus the judge of quick and dead, and to the holy
Spirit to determine. But ſeeing it is no ſinne to
refute or cenſure both their errours; the errour
of the moderne Jew, who utterly denieth Chriſt
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7898:138"/>
to be the ſonne of God in any ſenſe ſeemes to
me more excuſable,<note place="margin">Cap. 26</note> at leaſt leſſe inexcuſable
then the errour of the Arrian or Socinian; who
granting Chriſt to be the ſonne of God, deny him
to be coeternall to his Father. And my reaſon is,
becauſe it is not more plaine or pregnant out of
the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets (which the
Jews only acknowledge) that God was to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate
or to become man (though that be moſt
pregnant;) then it is from the Evangeliſt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſacred writers of the new Teſtament, (whoſe
authoritie the Socinian denies not) that Chriſt is
the only ſonne of God from all eternitie. Two or
three teſtimonies ſhall ſuffice for the preſent.
Were there no other place beſides that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
Heb. 7. 3. and that of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> chap. 1. theſe
would captivate my underſtanding to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of beleife in this point. The Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> ſaith, <hi>he was without beginning
without end of life,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that
is, albeit he had both Father and Mother, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and end of dayes, yet he is repreſented unto
us, without beginning or end of dayes, that ſo he
might be a type or ſhadow of the ſonne of God.
But how farre a type of the ſonne of God? only
in this, as he was without beginning of dayes, or
end of life. That the Apoſtle by the ſonne of God
did meane Chriſt Jeſus and none elſe, none deny.
The very ſcope and end of this parallel betwixt
<hi>Melchiſedech</hi> and Chriſt was, to ſhew that Chriſt
the ſonne of God was truely and really ſuch as
<hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was only by ſhadow or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7898:139"/>
that is really and abſolutely without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
or end of dayes, he who is, who was, &amp; is
to come: perfect characters of eternitie. Againe,

                     <hi>[the word of God]</hi> was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

which the wit of man cannot more punctually
preſſe againſt all that in future times ſhould deny
or queſtion it, then S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth in the beginning
of his Goſpell. And the manner of his reiterate
emphaticall expreſſions of himſelfe, (every later

opinion or tradition of the Ancient: that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
wrote that maieſtick proeme to his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
(which is but a paraphraſe, though moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
upon the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
touching this great myſterie) for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the ſpreading of the Arian or like here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
whoſe ſeeds were by the envious man ſowne
in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, after Chriſts other Apoſtles were
fallen aſleepe. <hi>In the beginning</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn) the
Word was;</hi> What <hi>beginning</hi> doth he meane? The
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7898:139"/>
ſame which <hi>Moſes</hi> meant, when hee ſaid, <hi>In the
beginning God made the Heaven and the Earth.</hi>
The originall phraſe, whether uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi>
in the Hebrew, or by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Greeke,
exactly anſwers to the Latine <hi>in principio.</hi> Now
though every cauſe be <hi>Principium, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
or that which gives beginning to its proper
effect: Yet <hi>Omne principium every beginning</hi> is not
a proper cauſe of that which uſually followes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. For the firſt dawning or <hi>ſcaring</hi> of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is the beginning, yet no true poſitive cauſe,
of the day following; it is firſt in order of time,
but not of cauſality. And this ambiguity of the
Phraſe <hi>in the beginning</hi> is the ſame both in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
and in the Chaldee as the learned in theſe
tongues (no parties in this buſineſſe) have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Now in that firſt of Geneſis, we muſt take
the word <hi>beginning,</hi> not for the cauſe of all which
followed, but for the firſt in order or preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of duration. For the heavens and the earth
(if we take them as now they are) were not made
in that <hi>beginning</hi> or point of time wherein God is
ſaid to have made the heaven and earth: Nor did
any of theſe, or any other parts of the world ſpring
or reſult by way of cauſality from the firſt maſſe
which was without order of parts; or true forme;
otherwiſe the diſtinction of light from darkneſſe,
or ſeparation of the waters which are above the
firmament, could not have beene works of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
properly ſo called, but rather of generation;
whereas the Scripture tells us, that theſe were the
works of the firſt and ſecond day: much leſſe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7898:140"/>
could the production of plants or vegetables, or
ſubſtances endued with ſenſe have been any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
works of creation, after the heavens and

as God himſelfe had, when all things elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne

were made by him,</hi> to wit, <hi>by the Word</hi> [This is the
character of his Almighty power or coequality

perhaps the Arian, or other involved in his error,
will object, at leaſt in favour of this opinion it
may be objected, that this <hi>univerſall</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn,
all things were made by the Word,</hi> is ſubject to the
ſame limitation or exception which thoſe two u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall
before<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 21 parag. 6.</note> mentioned were, the one out
of S. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 15. [When he ſaith he hath put all
things under his feet, he is excepted who hath put all
things under him:]</hi> the other out of the Author of
the 146, Pſal. [that we may not put truſt or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in any ſonne of man] which admits of this
limitation [unleſſe it bee in that ſonne of man,
who is alſo the ſonne of the Lord God of Iſrael:]
why then may not this univerſall of S. <hi>Iohn [All
things were made by the Word,]</hi> admit of this or
the like reſtraint; All other things beſides the
word were made by God, and by the word as his
coagent, but the word himſelfe made by God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone?
Indeed if our Evangeliſt had ſaid only thus
<hi>[All things were made by the Word]</hi> this limitation
would be more tolerable; but to prevent this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
or captious limitation, he expreſſely addeth
<hi>[Without him was not any thing made that was
made]</hi> This clauſe reacheth home, and caries it
cleare, that this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the Word,</hi> was not any of
thoſe things which were made or created, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7898:141"/>
it ſhould have been made or created by it
ſelfe, which is impoſſible. The addition of this
clauſe is but an exegeticall, or fuller expreſſion of
that which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid before <hi>[that the Word was
with God in the beginning,]</hi> that is, when all things
which have beginning, did beginne to hee, this
word was Gods coagent, truely eternall and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                  <p>5. The ſame concluſion is contained (though
more cloſely couched, eſpecially in our Engliſh
verſion) in that of S. <hi>Paul, Heb. 1. 2. God in theſe
laſt dayes hath ſpoken unto us by his ſonne, whom hee
hath appointed heire of all things, by whom alſo hee
made the Worlds.</hi> Though he be appointed heire
of all things, as he is man, yet this right of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
was derived unto him as man, from the
work of Creation, as he was the ſonne of God.
For as the Apoſtle there addes, <hi>God by him made
the Worlds.</hi> Were there then more worlds then
one? If there were, all were created by the <hi>ſonne,</hi>
and without him neither any world, nor any part
of the world was created. Howbeit the world in
the original, doth no ſignifie this viſible or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative
world, <hi>non mundos ſed ſaecula, non</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not the heavens, the earth, the elements,
or any other part which we ſee, but all things
whatſoever, which have any duration or ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were made by the ſonne of God; and he had
a perfect being before any thing could hee made
by him, and is therefore truly eternall. The
worlds in the originall comprehends all things
which heretofore have beene, and now are not;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7898:141"/>
all things which now are and ſometimes were
not; all which hereafter ſhall be, though after
their beginning of being they ſhall have no end.
So that S <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech expreſſely extends it ſelfe
ſomewhat further then that of S. <hi>Iohn, All things
were made by him, and without him was nothing made
that was made.</hi> S. <hi>Iohns</hi> ſpeech (expreſſely) refers
only to things which were then made, S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
ſpeech extends it ſelfe as well to things future as

ſaith <hi>Heb. 1. ver. 3. He upholdeth all things by the
word of his power.</hi> As the father then created all
things, ſo were all things created likewiſe by the
ſonne. The Father preſerveth all things, and yet
the ſonne (who is the expreſſe image of his glory,)
preſerveth and upholdeth all things. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

by right of inheritance, as being his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſonne: yet not his ſucceſſor but his coequall
from eternitie. And here (by the way) I cannot
ſufficiently admire the care and wiſedome of the
ancient Church, in appointing the goſpell for that
great feſtivall, (wherein we celebrate the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Chriſts nativitie) out of the forementioned
Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> and the Epiſtle for the ſame
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7898:142"/>
feſtivall, out of the firſt of the Hebrews; to the
end that all Chriſtians might bee ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
as well in the truth of his eternall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or eternity of his perſon, as he is the ſonne
of God, as of his nativity in time, as he was the
ſonne of <hi>David</hi> borne of the Virgine, or of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
from the dead. And as for the errour of
the Arians or others, who acknowledging the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truth of the new Teſtament, deny the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or eternall generation of the ſonne of God;
The moſt compendious way to refell them is not
(as I conceive) fiercely to diſpute againſt them,
but rather to let them be caried with the blaſt of
their owne doctrine, or draw them unto theſe
fundamentall Rocks, and let them ſplit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>6. But to follow S. <hi>Iohns</hi> expreſſions a little
further, which come neerer to the point now in
handling, ver. 4. <hi>In him</hi> (that is, in the word) <hi>was
life,</hi> this is more then if he had ſaid, he is the word
of life. For ſo is the Goſpell by way of efficacy
or efficiency; but men only, who live by it, are
the ſeat and ſubject of that life which it imparts;
which is wrought by the preaching of it. But
when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>in the Word was life,</hi> this
implies, hee was that ſeat and fountaine of life,
from whom both the efficacy of the Goſpell, and
that life which is ſubjectively in men or Angells,
is derived or participated. <hi>And the life was the light
of men, and the light ſhineth in darkneſſe, and the
darknes comprehended it not.</hi> All theſe are Attributs
or expreſſions of a nature truly divine, characters
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7898:142"/>
of a living eſſence, or of life it ſelfe, before men
or the world were made, and this is confirmed to
us ver. 8. <hi>The Word was the true light, which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
every man that commeth into the world,</hi> And
if every man that commeth into the world, then
the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> was enlightned by this word:
For he was both the light and life of the world,
ever ſince the firſt beginning of either; albeit the
world and worldly men did not apprehend him
to be ſuch, as it is expreſſed ver. 10. <hi>He was in the
world, and the world was made by him, but the world
knew him not,</hi> So them, he was in the world ever
ſince it was made, and the world was in him (as
in its eminent, or ideall efficient cauſe) before it
was made. <hi>He came unto his owne, and his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him not.</hi> Who were theſe <hi>his owne?</hi> If all
generations of men, or all ſucceſſion of time, or
things temporall were made by him, all theſe
were his owne. Yet before the comming into the
world, of which the Apoſtle here ſpeakes, all theſe
were not his owne by the ſame peculiar right. He
alwayes was Lord of lords, and King of kings,
and ſupreame ruler of ſuch as ruled the nations;
yet were not all nations his peculiar inheritance:
this was the prerogative of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed or <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
poſterity. And albeit he had beene in them
and with them after a more ſpeciall kinde of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
for many generations: yet at this time,
whereto the Apoſtles words <hi>referre,</hi> he firſt came
by a peculiar maner, both into the world and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, by becomming an inhabitant or ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the territories bequeathed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7898:143"/>
to his ſeed. But theſe who were thus his owne by
peculiar redemption from the land of Aegypt, for
the moſt part received him not. Yet his comming
(though) after this peculiar manner, to his owne
was not loſt, nor was Gods promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi>
any way impeached by their refuſing, or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of him. <hi>For to as many as received him</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed after the fleſh,
or of the Gentiles, to all of both ſorts) <hi>he gave a
right or priviledge to become the ſonnes of God.</hi> ver.
12. All were made the true and lively ſonnes of
<hi>Abraham</hi> by receiving him, who was before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
but was now made man of the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
Now in that he made all the ſonnes of God
which received him: this preſuppoſeth he was
the ſonne of God, not <hi>by making,</hi> not by taking
the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but the ſonne of God by
nature or eternall generation, the true God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.
For ſo the Evangeliſt concludes that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
diſcourſe ver. 14. <hi>And the word was made
fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the
glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace
and truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Why S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the proaeme to his Goſpell
doth iuſtyle Chriſt Jeſus <hi>the word of God,</hi> rather
then <hi>the ſonne of God,</hi> why it is rather ſaid, the
<hi>Word became fleſh,</hi> then the <hi>ſonne became fleſh:</hi> in
what prophecy the <hi>words</hi> becomming fleſh was
foretold or foreſhadowed, with the manner how
it was made fleſh, or the meaning of this phraſe;
muſt be the ſubject of ſome Chapters following.
This, for the preſent, is evident out of places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7898:143"/>
alleaged, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did meane no other
party or perſon by the <hi>word,</hi> then him whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
throughout his whole Goſpell, he ſtiles
the <hi>ſonne of God:</hi> and out of the ſame places it is as
evident, that <hi>the word,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, was that very God
of Iſrael, who had promiſed to erect a Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
and dwell in his people or amongſt them, and
to manifeſt his glory to them after a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner, then he had done, either during the
time of the firſt tabernacle, or of both the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
For that text of S. <hi>Iohn Iohn, 1. 14. He dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, and wee ſaw his glory, the glory as of the
only begotten ſonne of God,</hi> imports the exact fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of all thoſe prophecies, wherein the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of Gods glory in ſucceeding ages is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.
That the glory of God was to be revealed
in the fleſh, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did learne from Scriptures,
which were extant before our Saviours incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
though this he learned not by ſtudy or art,
but from Divine revelation. But that the man
Chriſt Ieſus, with whom he converſed here on
earth, was the <hi>word,</hi> which the Scripture foretold
ſhould be made fleſh, or that the glory, which
ſhined in him, was the very brightneſſe of Gods
glory; this S. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew by experiment; as having
ſeene his transfiguration upon Mount Tabor, and
converſed with him after his reſurrection. This
both he and S. <hi>Paul</hi> beleeved from ſenſible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of experiments exactly anſwerable to the
predictions of <hi>Moſes</hi> and other Prophets, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the glory of God, which was in later
times morefully to be revealed, then in former.</p>

8 To omit thoſe two places before cited <hi>Exod.
29.</hi> 44, 45. and Leviticus 26. 11, 12. (unto both
which places that of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> chap. 1. 14. doth in
ſpeciall referre) wee will inſiſt a while upon that
text <hi>Exodus</hi> 33. 14. to the 23. <hi>The Lord ſpake unto</hi>
Moſes <hi>face to face, as a man ſpeaketh with his friend.</hi>
The ſumme of this dialogue is expreſſed ver. 14,
15. <hi>My preſence</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall go with thee, and I
will give thee reſt. And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, if thy preſence go
not with us, carry us not up hence, for wherein ſhall
it be knowne here, that I and thy people have found
grace in thy ſight?</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> not ſatisfied with
the promiſe of Gods preſence, and ſeparation of
them from other people, requeſts a ſight of his
glory, and this in part is granted ver. 21, 22, 23. <hi>And
the Lord ſaid, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
ſhall ſtand upon a Rock. And it ſhall come to paſſe while
my glory paſſeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of
the Rock, &amp; will cover thee with my hand, while I paſſe
by. And I will take away mine hand, and thou ſhalt ſee
my back parts: but my face ſhall not be ſeene.</hi> For ſo
God had ſaid ver. 20. <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face: for
there ſhall no man ſee my face, and live.</hi> Yet this
ſight of Gods glory, or ſo much of it as <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſaw, left ſuch an impreſſion in his face or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
as you may read chap. 34. ver. 33. that he
was conſtrayned <hi>to put a vaile upon his face, whileſt
he talked with the people, who were not able to behold
the glory.</hi> But <hi>this vaile</hi> as our Apoſtle tels us, 2
<hi>Cor. 3. 14.) is put away in Chriſt.</hi> It is true. Yet this
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>the word,</hi> was not <hi>the Chriſt</hi> to doe away
this vaile, till he put on the vaile of fleſh. The
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7898:144"/>
fleſh then was a vaile to him, but as a glaſſe or
mirrour to us. Wee may in Chriſt with open face
behold that glory of God, whoſe reflexe on <hi>Moſes</hi>
face the Iſraelites could not behold, but through
a vaile. Chriſt then is that glaſſe or mirrour, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the brightneſſe of Gods glory, which the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
could not then behold, may now be ſeene.
But did the Iews or Iſraelites in the time of the
old Teſtament (or in that time, wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the booke of Wiſdome wrote) conceive
any ſuch matter, as our Apoſtle here inferres, that
the glory of God ſhould be more fully revealed;
or that men ſhould be more capable of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of his preſence in later ages, then they
had beene in former? Some of them did, others
did not; all of them ought, even by their owne
prenotions or interpretations of Scriptures, ſo to
have conceived and beleeved. For thus ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Iews conceive of <hi>Moſes</hi> his requeſt. <hi>What
was that</hi> (ſaith a great Rabbin amongſt them)
<hi>which</hi> Moſes <hi>our Maſter ſought to attaine unto, when
he ſaid, I pray thee ſhew me thy glory?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>9 He requeged to know the truth of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(or eſſence) of the holy bleſſed God, untill
that he were knowne in his heart, like as a man
is knowne, whoſe face is ſeen, and whoſe forme
is ingrave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ones heart: ſo that man is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
or ſeparated in his knowledge from other
men. So <hi>Moſes</hi> requeſted that the Eſſence of
God might be diſtinctly knowne in his heart
from the eſſence of other things, ſo that
he might know the truth of his Eſſence as it is.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7898:145"/>
But God anſwered him, that the knowledge of
living man, who is compounded of body and
ſoule, hath no ability to apprehend the truth of
this thing concerning his Creator.</q>

of God or ſight of his glory whereof <hi>Moſes</hi>
was uncapable, was truely ingraven in the heart
of the man Chriſt Ieſus, and in his light wee ſee
light. He that ſaw him with the eyes of faith, did
ſee the father; he did ſee the glory of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
The brightneſſe of the divine glory is alike
inacceſſible, alike incommunicable in the Sonne
as in the Father, if we conſider them in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature alone; but in the man Chriſt Ieſus, and
in him alone, wee may behold the brightneſſe of
the Divine glory, which neither eye nor heart of
man could behold in it ſelfe, or in any divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

that Jeſus the ſonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> whom he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
when he was preſented in the Temple,
was the ſalvation of God. <hi>Lord now latteſt thou

our Saviour, whileſt hee lived here on
earth, had no conſtant dwelling, no place of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;
yet at this time the Godhead, or that
glory of the Godhead, of which the Pſalmiſt
ſpeaketh, was incorporated in him. Theſe and the
like Scriptures S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did ſee fulfilled in Chriſt,
when he ſaid, <hi>the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, and wee ſaw his glory the glory as of the

could not bee communicated to any but to him,

as no fleſh could behold, otherwiſe then as it was
in Chriſt, or in the word made fleſh; ſuch a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the divine Majeſtie as none beſides the
ſonne of God could declare. So the Apoſtle ſaith,
ver. 18. <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time, but the

                     </gap>, <hi>he hath declared, or expounded him.</hi>
But wherein doth this declaration conſiſt, or how
was it made by the <hi>ſonne?</hi> Not by <hi>word</hi> only, or
by declaration of his will, but by matter of fact,
or reall repreſentation. But of this point more
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7898:146"/>
fully in the expoſition of the name <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Seeing
<hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, that no fleſh could ſee God and
live, it may ſeeme ſtrange to men, which have
not their ſenſes exerciſed in the ſearch of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſhould avouch <hi>the
glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall
ſee it together. Iſay 40. 5. Moſes</hi> ſpeech, and that
conceipt which the ancient had, [that man could
not ſee God and live] was univerſally true, untill
the <hi>word</hi> or brightneſſe of Gods glory was made
fleſh. But this was the very myſterie which <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
in that chapter foretold, as elſewhere hath beene
declared in part, and ſhall be (as it comes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Chapter.</p>
                  <p>11 That the moderne Iews can expect the
God of their Fathers ſhould dwell with them,
ſhould walk with them, ſhould manifeſt his glory
unto them, after ſuch a manner as their owne
Doctors interpret his promiſe made to <hi>Moſes</hi> to
al theſe purpoſes, after any other way or manner,
then the Evangeliſt witneſſed, he did walk with,
and manifeſt his glory unto, his Diſciples: This
(to us Chriſtians) is an evident demonſtration,
that the vale, which their Forefathers put before
their faces, when they could not behold the
brightneſſe of Gods glory, which ſhone on <hi>Moſes</hi>
face after he had ſeene God and talked with him,
is to this day put before their hearts, when they
read <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. For this glorious
Majeſtie of God, <hi>the very expreſſe or graven Image
of his ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> which (they ſay) <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7898:146"/>
but could not, did ſo perſonally dwell in the man
Chriſt Jeſus, that whileſt he walked with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
God did walke with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; whileſt he remayned
within the territories of Iudah or Galilee, <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; glory did dwell in their Land.</hi> And to this day
in whomſoever he dwelleth by faith in him God
dwelleth by faith. As he is the expreſſe image
of the perſon of his Father: ſo every one in whom
he thus dwelleth, in him is the expreſſe image of
<hi>him</hi> as he is man; he is the Tabernacle or Temple
of the living God. The inference is our Apoſtles 2
<hi>Cor. 6. 16. Yee are the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of the living God, at God

S. <hi>Iohn Revel.</hi> 21. 3. exegetically dilates the

a great deale further, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. <hi>Paul</hi> here doth, <hi>I heard
a great voice out of Heaven, ſaying, Behold the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of God is with men, and he will dwell with
them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelfe
ſhall be with them, and be their God, and God ſhall
wipe away all teares from their eyes. And there ſhall
be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither
ſhal there be any more paine, for the former things are
paſſed away.</hi> But this mortalitie muſt put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
and our corruptible fleſh become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,
before this laſt clauſe of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy

<hi>Exod. 29. Levit. 26. Ezek.</hi> 37. ſhall be final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

fulfilled in differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meaſure &amp; manner, both
according to the literall, and myſticall ſenſe: For
God hath dwelt and doth dwel more properly in
the man Chriſt Ieſus then at any time he did in
the Tabernacle or Temple. Theſe were in their
times the ſeats of Gods peculiar preſence, of the
manifeſt appearances of his divine Maieſtie, from
which all the bleſſings upon Iſraell or <hi>Abrahams</hi>
poſteritie by bodily deſcent were derived, after
ſuch a manner as the viſible light in this inferiour
world is derived from the body or ſphaere of the
ſunne. Yet ſuch as were partakers of theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
all the particular Synagogues through the
land of Iury, did not by this participation of his
preſence in the Temple or Tabernacle, become
Temples or Tabernacles of the God of Iſrael:
theſe were never conceived to be or inſtyled the

ſince the <hi>Word</hi> was made fleſh, ſince the ſeed of
<hi>Abraham</hi> was made the Temple of the living
God; every particular Church, truely Chriſtian,
becomes a more proper ſeat of Gods peculiar
preſence, then the materiall Temple in its glory
and ſplendour was; and farre more communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of all bleſſings ſpirituall to every true parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
member of them. Every individuall or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
man, who is incorporated into this Church,
and made a living member of it, doth by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of that Spirit which dwelleth in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a true Temple or Tabernacle of the living
God. Whoſoever truely beleeves in Chriſt, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

Chriſt (who is the <hi>prototypon</hi> and true temple of
God) doth dwell in him, and he in Chriſt: he is
in God, and God in him after a more peculiar
manner, then either the patriarks or Prophets
were in God, or God in them. But this peculiar
manner of Gods dwelling in us by faith, and wee
in him, hath his peculiar place in other principall
Articles of the Creed, or in the Treatiſe of the
Sacrament, concerning the myſticall union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Chriſt and his members. The next Quaere,
which in this Section offers it ſelfe to be diſcuſſed

under the title of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, long
before his incarnation, and longer, before S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
wrote his Goſpell. Now it is not improbable,
that thoſe heretiques which did call the Divinity
of Chriſt in queſtion, (againſt whoſe hereſie the
Evangeliſt did put in that Caveat in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7898:148"/>
of his Goſpell) at the leaſt ſuch as were in

men naturally both conceive and imbrace the

Now ſuch as were well read in <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megiſt,</hi>
or would be willing to read them, could
not be ignorant of an eternall <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> which they
called the ſonne of the eternall <hi>minde</hi> or eſſence.
And this <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>the word</hi> or image of the eternall

Unto theſe &amp; the like prenotions, which the
heathen Philoſophers had of an eternall Father
in his eternall ſonne, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> (in the judgement of
ſome great Divines) did purpoſely apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and frame his expreſſions to their capacity,
whom he ſought to reclaime, or to inſtruct. Nor
is it either unuſuall, or unbeſeeming the Apoſtles
themſelves, to alter both the matter and forme
of ſpeech, according to the diverſity of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
whom they ſeeke to reforme. S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not
diſpute with the Athenians after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he did with the Jews, nor did he inſtruct the
Hebrew converts in the ſame language or forme
of catechiſme, which he uſed amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> then (in the conjecture of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ancient Divines) did make the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of the Athenian Altar; <hi>that God</hi> (ſaith hee)
<hi>whom yee ignorant by worſhip, him declare I unto you.</hi>
But did theſe harmeleſſe ſpeculations of theſe
Philoſophers require any ſuch reformation from
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as the Athenians ſuperſtitious worſhip did
from S. <hi>Paul?</hi> Sure their followers were to bee
better catechized in this truth, then they had
been, or could be, by any Philoſophy: their beſt
ſpeculations (though in themſelves true) were to
their Profeſſors altogether fruitleſſe, and (as I take
it) without any prenotion or expectance that this

                     </gap> as God, or by <hi>him.</hi> All
this they were to learne from S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> for this is
a myſtery which farre ſurpaſſeth the capacitie of

as was knowne among the Heathens, before S.

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his Goſpell. And it is no leſſe impious

borrow thoſe divine expreſſions of the Words di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
from any Heathen Philoſopher; as that
blaſphemous Platonick exclaimed when he read
the beginning of his Goſpell, that he had ſtolne
his expreſſions out of his maſter <hi>Plato.</hi> Nor was
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe the firſt of all ſacred writers,
which did diſplay the titles of the ſonne of God
by <gap reason="foreign">

But two places of <hi>Onkelus</hi> there be, more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably

<hi>they heard the voice of the word of the Lord;</hi> or, <hi>the
voice of the Lord God the word.</hi> So that <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Word</hi> (which in the beginning was with God, and
was God) did convent our firſt parents, as having
peculiar reaſon to examine and convict them of
their tranſgreſſion; becauſe he in perſon, not the
Father or holy Ghoſt, was to undertake for their
reſtauration, was to combat with the Serpent for
their redemption, whom immediately after hee
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7898:150"/>
convents in the womans preſence, and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
this ſentence upon both; <hi>The Lord God ſaid

if we read it ſo, we ſhall not diſſent from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
meaning of the Chaldee; and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
referre the word <hi>walking</hi> unto God
himſelfe, (as if he had ſaid, <hi>they heard the voice of

whether of God, or of the word of God, though
<hi>Fagius,</hi> with ſome other, think the word <hi>walking</hi>
may be read in the accuſative caſe, <hi>audiverunt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem

it ſelfe by degrees. But this, otherwiſe moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
writer ſometime cenſures the ſeaventie
Interpreters of ignorance in the Hebrew tongue,
ſometime ſleights their interpretation, without
juſt cauſe. For ſeeing it hath pleaſed the holy
Ghoſt, in the greateſt myſteries concerning
Chriſt, to follow their interpretation, though not
ſo authentique in it ſelfe as the Hebrew Canon is;
this commands my aſſent, though not to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of ſome among the ancients, that theſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7898:150"/>
were as truly inſpired by the holy Ghoſt,
as the penmen of the Hebrew Canon were; yet
thus farre, that they were directed, either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
by the Spirit, or by the rules and traditions,
in their times received, for the right unfolding
of many places, which in the Hebrew were either
ambiguous or involved; and better directed by
ſuch rules then moderne Hebricians are by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorets</hi>
or the later <hi>Rabbins:</hi> albeit both of them
be of good uſe. Thus to think of the LXX, their
conſonancy with the Chaldee Paraphraſe, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places of great moment, doth (beſides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſpeciall motives) ſomewhat incline mee, yet
did not the Chaldee (as I am perſwaded) borrow
ought from them, or they from the Chaldee; but
both were beholden to the prenotions or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
rules of the ancient Hebrews.</p>
                  <p>4. The ſecond remarkable place, wherein <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelus</hi>
doth not diſſent from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unfoldeth the myſtery implicitly contained
in it, is that of <hi>Geneſis 22. 15, 16. By my ſelfe have
I ſworne, ſaith the Lord, that in bleſsing I will bleſſe
thee, &amp;c. and in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the
earth be bleſſed, becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voice.</hi> So
the Hebrew: The Chaldee, thus, <hi>By my word have
I ſworne (ſaith the Lord,) that bleſsing I will bleſſe
thee, &amp;c. Becauſe thou haſt obeyed my Word.</hi> This
tranſlation of the Chaldee affords more light for
the right and punctuall explication of S. <hi>Paul Heb.
6.</hi> 17. then moſt Commentators of that place
have done, albeit ſome greeke Scholiaſts which I
have conſulted (but whoſe words I now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7898:151"/>
not) have made acute and accurate ſearch for
the true meaning of it. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
<hi>willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heires of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
the immutabilitie of his counſell, confirmed it by
an oath.</hi> So our Engliſh reads it; yet with this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
or animadverſion in the margine <hi>[inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
himſelfe by an oath]</hi> but the originall <hi>verbatim</hi>
ſounds thus, <hi>Deus intermediavit juramento, God did
intermediate by oath.</hi> Now the object of this oath
(as our Apoſtle tells us, ver. 13.) was God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
<hi>When God made promiſe to Abraham, becauſe
he could ſweare by no greater, he ſware by himſelfe</hi>
(yet this, <hi>by my ſelfe have I ſworne,</hi> is more expreſſe
in the Septuagint, then in the Hebrew.) But the

ratified only by oath: but from this time the ſon

<hi>Abraham,</hi> or the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the ſonne
of God; as afterwards the ſeed or ſonne of <hi>David</hi>
was; to wit, from that time wherein the Lord

ever, and his throne as the dayes of Heaven. Pſal.</hi> 89.

ſit thou at my right hand &amp;c.</hi> the Chaldee hath it,
<hi>The Lord ſaid unto his Word; ſit thou at my right

this <hi>Word,</hi> or this <hi>Lord</hi> (for ſo the Hebrewes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
it by <hi>Adonai)</hi> was then deſtinated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by oath, to become not only the ſonne of
<hi>David,</hi> but to be a Prieſt for ever after the order
of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> ver. 4. All theſe three places
will require ſome further conſideration, in the
treatiſe of Gods Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and
with <hi>David,</hi> or of our Saviours conſecration to
his everlaſting Prieſthood. Thus much for the
preſent may ſuffice, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was nto the firſt,
which conceived the ſonne of God, God himſelfe
to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; much leſſe did he need to borrow his
expreſſions from any Writers not truely Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.
For all this was conteyned in the places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alleaged, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Onkelus</hi> interpret
them; and was likewiſe expreſſely conteyned in
the Hebrew, in ſundry places of the Prophets;
of ſome of which (God willing) in the next
Chapter.</p>
                  <p>5 As little probabilitie there is, either that S.
<hi>Paul Heb</hi> 1. 1. ſhould borrow his characters of the
Sonne of God from the Author of the booke of
Wiſdome; or that Author his, (though much
what the ſame) from S. <hi>Paul:</hi> as that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould
take his expreſſions from the former Chaldee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſt,
or the later from S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Both S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
and the Author of the booke of Wiſdome, had
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7898:152"/>
their hints, (at leaſt) from ſuch prenotions as the
ancient Hebrews had of the wiſdome or ſonne of
God, or of their expected Meſſias, when he ſhould
be revealed. It is no way improbable, (much leſſe
incredible) that ſuch Interpreters or paraphraſers
upon ſacred writ, as (for ought we know) did not
expreſſely beleeve in the ſonne of God, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his incarnation or ſince, ſhould have the
forementioned prenotions concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Meſſias; ſeeing the very Samaritans had the
like, which they could not gather from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
reading of originall Scripture, if at all they
read them. Such a prenotion that woman <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.
had of the Meſſias, before ſhe did beleeve that
Jeſus was the promiſed Meſſias or Chriſt. <hi>I know</hi>
(ſaith ſhe) <hi>that Meſsias commeth which is called
Chriſt; when he is come, he will tell us all things. ver.
25.</hi> She had a prenotion and conceit, that the
Meſſias ſhould tell them all things in a better
manner, then the prophets could do. For ſhee
had acknowledged our Saviour to be a Prophet
ver. 19; yet reſted not ſatisfied with his anſwer
to her queſtion there made, untill he had told her
in expreſſe termes, that hee was the promiſed
Meſſias.</p>

                  <p>7 There is not one propoſition or character
in all this paſſage, which (for ought I yet know)
is not Canonicall. No attribute of wiſdome,
which can fitly be applied to any perſon or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſave onely to the ſon of God or at leaſt to
the holy Ghoſt. But whether this Author did ſo
intend them, or apply them; or whether the holy
Ghoſt did by his peculiar inſpiration, or God by
his ſpeciall providence, direct him thus to ſpeake
or write, after the ſame manner he did <hi>Moſes</hi> and
other Authors of Canonicall Scriptures, is not to
me ſo evident. Nor is it probable that this booke
was written by <hi>Solomon,</hi> albeit the Author of it
doth put upon him the perſon of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and
perſonate himſelfe under the habit or Garb of
the King of Iſrael. The opinion is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
who think this book was written by <hi>Philo</hi>
the Iew, to ſolace himſelfe, and his Country men,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7898:153"/>
upon the ill ſucceſſe of his Embaſſage unto <hi>Caius</hi>
the Emperour, which was not many yeares after
our Saviours death, nor many before S. <hi>Paul</hi> did
write his Epiſtle, or S. <hi>Iohn</hi> his Goſpell. The book
it ſelfe (whoſoever was the Author of it) is an
excellent and a moſt elegant paraphraſe upon
many Canonicall Scriptures, and conteynes many
exquiſite expreſſions of Gods ſpecial providence,
and infinite wiſdome in governing the world, and
in over-ruling both the policie and the power of
greateſt Princes. The ſame booke notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is, (for many reaſons) juſtly denyed by S.
<hi>Ierome,</hi> by our Church, and by many grave wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in other Churches reformed, to be any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
part of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; to be any portion
of the rule or Canon of the Hebrews faith recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by them before our Saviours incarnation.
And being no portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Catholique rule or
Canon, it is no way probable that our Apoſtle S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> when he wrote the divine Epiſtle directed
in ſpeciall to the Hebrews his countrymen,
would borrow his titles or Attributes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
glory from this Authors encomiaſme of
wiſdome. Nor can any convincing proofe be
brought, to perſwade us, that the Author of this
booke (whoſoever he was) did make application
of theſe characters of wiſdome (in <hi>the abſtract)</hi>
unto Chriſt; or truely beleeve, either that Ieſus
the ſon of <hi>Mary</hi> (though living haply on earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his time) or that the promiſed Meſſias, whoſe
coming he did expect, ſhould be the wiſdome of
God, which he ſo magnifies, or God incarnate in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7898:154"/>
whom all former Scriptures, and his owne enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miaſme
of Divine wiſdome ſhould in particular
and punctually be fulfilled; That the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which he gives to wiſdome, (at leaſt the
moſt of them) can really and truely be applied to
none but Chriſt, who is the wiſdome and ſonne
of God. All this, and more, being granted will
not conclude, that he did intend or thinke of
Chriſts birth or incarnation, or apprehend the
perſonall union betweene the ſonne of God, and
the ſonne of <hi>David.</hi> For <hi>Tully</hi> and other Heathen
writers have made ſuch panegyricall deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of vertues morall and intellectuall, of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
eſpecially or of Philoſophy in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
notion, as can have no reall paterne ſave
only in the divine incomprehenſible eſſence: and
yet they themſelves lived, and (for ought wee
know) dyed without any diſtinct knowledge or
apprehenſion of the true God; yea many times
committed groſſe Idolatry with thoſe vertues,
whether morall or intellectuall, which they ſo
magnified in the abſtract.</p>
                  <p>8. Whileſt we peruſe Authors either Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall
or not Canonicall, this rule (I take it) is of
generall good uſe; that for matter of practiſe, or
application, wee are ſpecially to conſider <hi>quàm
benè,</hi> not <hi>quam bona;</hi> on the contrary, in point of
ſpeculation, not <hi>quàm benè, ſed quàm bona,</hi> not how
well, or to what good end they ſpeake, but how
good things they ſpeake or write. The writings
of the moderne Jew are, for the moſt part, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and morally evill; yet (unto ſuch as know to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7898:154"/>
make right uſe of them) in their ſpeculations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the old Teſtament (even in ſuch of them as are
profeſſed enemies to our Lord and Saviour, and to
the Evangelical ſtory) there be ſo many ſcattered
<hi>characters</hi> or miſplaced ſyllables, as being rightly
put together, and well ordered by ſome judicious
<hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> or <hi>accurate compoſer,</hi> would make up a
more exact commentary upon moſt of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets which we Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
uſually alleage for proving the truth of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
articles in this Creed; then can be gathered
out of the Chriſtian Interpreters of the old or
new Teſtament, which have not the care or ſkill
to beat thoſe enemies at their owne weapons, or
to retort thoſe blowes, which they offer at us, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves. Thoſe ſtrange dreames or fancies
which they have concerning myſteries to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the dayes of the Meſſias, are evident
ſignes that the Lord hath caſt them into this long
ſlumber for the inſtruction of us Chriſtians. And
the right interpretation of their dreames, or their
application, is one of the higheſt degrees of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
which in this later age can ordinarily bee
expected. And I would to God ſome ſonnes of
the Prophets would addreſſe their paines and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to this purpoſe, unto which according to our
poore talent we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeake in
ſome ſpeciall articles following. But to returne
unto the point propoſed in the beginning of this
Chapter; one ſpeciall reaſon why S. <hi>Iohn</hi> inſtyles
our Saviour; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the Word</hi> (not <hi>the ſonne)</hi> was to
make up a more exquiſite reſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7898:155"/>
Eſſence, of the eternity of his perſon,
and his eternall generation, of his conſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with God the Father; then (without this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
expreſſion) we could have had, or perhaps
would have ſought for. Every one of his ſeverall
titles, whether given to him by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> or by S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> addes ſomething to the better expreſſion of
his unexpreſſible excellence, unto the raiſing of
our apprehenſions to a higher pitch of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe incomprehenſible myſteries, then one
or two, or fewer then are made, could have done.
To informe our underſtandings, or rectifie our
faith, that the ſon of God is more exquiſitely, or
more conſubſtantially like unto his Father, then
any ſonne of man is unto the father of his body;
he is by the holy Ghoſt inſtyled the expreſſe <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
or character</hi> of his Fathers perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.
No man can be altogether ſo like another as the
impreſſion is to the print. To inſtruct us againe
that this abſolute and perfect expreſſion of the
father in the ſonne farre exceed, any ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
as the Statue can make of man, or ſuch as the
ſeale leaves in the waxe: he is by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> inſtyled
by the name of <hi>life;</hi> being the living ſubſtantiall
image of his Father. Againe, to rectifie our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
that the ſonne of God did not grow
into this abſolute live image of his Father by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
after ſuch a manner as the ſonnes of men
doe, (for no child is altogether like his father
from his birth) it hath pleaſed the holy Ghoſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to emblazon his incomprehenſible generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or begetting under the character of <hi>brightneſſe</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:7898:155"/>
or <hi>light. He is the brightneſſe of Gods glory</hi> ſaith S.
<hi>Paul</hi> and by S. <hi>Iohn, the light.</hi> And this is the moſt
exquiſite of any reſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that can be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
things ſenſible. The ſunne and fountaine of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
light doth naturally, without interpoſition of
time, without any labour or operation, produce
or beget brightneſſe or ſplendour. And this it doth
ſo unceſſantly, ſo perpetually, that if we could
imagine there had beene a ſunne or fountaine
of light without beginning to continue without
end of time or dayes; we could not but imagine,
that there ſhould be a brightneſſe or ſplendour
perpetually produced without beginning or
without ending of ſuch production, or of the
brightneſſe ſo produced, by this fountaine of
light. Yet this ſuppoſition being granted or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
the reſemblance would herein faile; That
this continual production of light, without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
without ending, did yet admit a ſucceſſion,
or continuitie of time, which the eternall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the ſonne of God doth not admit, for
that onely is truely eternall which is not onely
without beginning or end of dayes, but without
all ſucceſſion in duration, without menſuration of
dayes or yeares: all which are conteyned in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
as this viſible world, and all the power in it
are conteyned in his power who is inviſible and
incorporeall. All theſe reſemblances are taken
from things ſenſible. Laſtly, the eternall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſonne of God (as moſt Divines will
have it) is moſt fitly reſembled by the <hi>Word,</hi> or
repreſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mind or ſpirit, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> for its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7898:156"/>
is more immortall then the light. Yet this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance,
or any that can be taken from our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection,
or ſecret conference betweene the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and ſoule of man within it ſelfe, is in this
point (to omit others) lame or defective: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the ſpirit or minde of man be immortall, and
as unceſſant in his proper acts or operations as
the Sunne is in ſending forth light to this inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
world; yet our choyſeſt thoughts or cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
moſt internall and moſt ſpirituall vaniſh.
The mutuall conference betwixt our ſpirits and
internall ſenſes, is not perpetuall and unceſſant.
The reaſon whereof (as the Philoſopher tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth)
is, becauſe the paſſive underſtanding (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the cogitative facultie or phantaſie) without
whoſe continuall ſervice or atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance; there can
be no conſtant record or remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Acts
or inſtructions of the underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, is corruptible
eſpecially in its act or operation; and ſubject to
greater change and alterations then the lower
regions of the aire, albeit the minde or ſpirit be
as cleare and conſtant as the Sunne. But in the
life to come, when this corruptible ſhall have put
on incorruption, and our inferiour faculties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
immortall, not only the proper acts or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the minde or ſpirit, or of the active un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
but the apprehenſion alſo of what
the minde or ſpirit ſuggeſts, or their impreſſions
upon the inferiour faculties of the ſoule, ſhall be
incorruptible, unceſſant and perpetuall. And then
no doubt our apprehenſions of this great myſtery
comprehended under this name or title of the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7898:156"/>
                     <hi>Word,</hi> ſhall be more cleare and perfect to the moſt

of the only <hi>ſonne of God.</hi> But where then
was the incarnation of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> foretold or foreſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed?
It was (I take it,) not only foretold, but
ſolemnely proclaimed, by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
chap. 40. and the fulfilling of what he promiſed,
was declared by <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> at our Saviours bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.
<hi>Iohn</hi> (we know) was the voice of the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
foreprophecyed ver. 3. of that chapter, and did
perform his function (as it was foretold he ſhould)
in the wilderneſſe. The chiefe contents of the
cry or proclamation it ſelfe are two: the firſt, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
yee the way of the Lord, and make ſtraight in the
deſert a high way for our God.</hi> This was fulfilled
by <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> preaching of repentance. The
burden of his preaching was <hi>repent, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God is at hand.</hi> But the voice ſaid againe
(whether to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> or to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> or to both)
<hi>Cry, and he ſaid, what ſhall I cry? All fleſh is graſſe,
and all the goodlineſſe thereof is as the flower of the
field. The graſſe withereth, the flower fadeth; becauſe
the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: ſurely the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is graſſe. The graſſe withereth, the flower fadeth,
but the Word of our God ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> This
was the effect, or ſumme, of that which <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>
was to proclaime. Of the exact congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine and the Prophets predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I have elſewhere (to my remembrance) trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Concerning the meaning of the Prophets
words, <hi>All fleſh is graſſe,</hi> that is handled by moſt
Interpreters, &amp; Preachers, in funeral ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:7898:157"/>
Nor can there be a fitter Text for diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mortality and frailty of our Nature: nor
(as ſome think) for ſetting forth the excellency of
preaching. But to magnifie the word of God in
generall, as it is preached by us the unworthy
miniſters of it, is (in moſt mens interpretations)
indirectly to magnifie our ſelves, or our calling,
which (howſoever our perſons bee) is queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
honourable, and ſo to bee eſteemed by all
good Chriſtians. Yet this excellency whether of
the word preached, or of Preachers, was either
no part, or the leaſt part of the Prophets meaning
when he ſaith <hi>the word of the Lord endureth for ever</hi>
For the true uſe and end of that prophecy Chap.
40. is expreſt in the beginning of it: <hi>Comfort yee,
comfort yee my people, ſaith our God. Speak yee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
to Ieruſalem, and cry unto her, that her war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
is accompliſhed, that her iniquity is pardoned. For
ſhee hath received of the Lords hand double for all her
ſinnes.</hi> But what comfort could it be to Jeruſalem,
or to Gods people, that the word of God which
is preached to them <hi>endureth for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> when as
they were but as <hi>the graſſe which withereth?</hi> The
more the Prophet did magnifie the immortality
of Gods word in this ſenſe, the more hee muſt
have increaſed the ſad remembrance of their own
miſery and mortality. And however <hi>Iſaias</hi> and
other Prophets had preached the word of the
Lord more plentifully, and more powerfully in
that age wherein he lived, then it had been in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
age before, or in any age ſince, (excepting the
times wherein <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and our Saviour and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:7898:158"/>
his Apoſtles lived on earth:) yet mortality and
miſery did ſtill grow faſter upon this people, then
it had done in any age before; ſo faſt for foure or
five generations, that this people became like
graſſe withering by degrees, and at laſt to be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up. The matter then of comfort which the
Prophet there promiſeth to Jeruſalem, was not
in his time really exhibited, but to be continually
expected, untill the word of the Lord, which hee
ſo magnifieth for its glory &amp; immortality, ſhould
become viſible to all fleſh. The comfort there
prophecyed of, did conſiſt in the manifeſtation
of that glory, which he then foretold ſhould bee
revealed. For whatſoever in that Chapter he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
was not delivered by way of common place
by ordinary catechiſme of doctrine and uſes, but
by the extraordinary ſpirit of prophecy. The iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
of his prophecy was, that the ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all fleſh ſhould bee much better in later
times, then in his age or any age before, it was.
At what time then was this comfort actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to all fleſh which before was but graſſe,
and as the flower of graſſe that fadeth? Then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly,
when the <hi>word of the Lord, which endureth
for ever,</hi> did become fleſh, or was incorporated
in our fleſh. For the life and efficacy of this word
(as the text literally imports) was to be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
by its admirable effects or operations upon
the mortality or weakneſſe of fleſh. Our morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or miſerable condition (as the Prophet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes)
could not weaken the immortall efficacy
of the Word, whereas the Word might give life
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:7898:158"/>
and immortality to all fleſh which ſhould ſee the
glory the taſt the goodneſſe of it. By the <hi>Word
of the Lord</hi> then <hi>which endureth for ever,</hi> we are to
underſtand, not <hi>Verbum Domini,</hi> not onely the
word of the Lord as it is daily preached, but the
Lord himſelfe, who if he ſpeake the word, great
ſhall be the number of the Preachers of the word,
both of Prophets, and of Propheteſſes.</p>
                  <p>2. The beſt interpretation of the prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi>
is already made unto our hands partly by S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
partly by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the beginning of his Goſpell.
<hi>Wee are brone againe,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Peter) not of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God which
liveth and abideth for ever. 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 23. By <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
ſeed,</hi> he meanes our corruptible nature, as
we are the ſonnes of <hi>Adam.</hi> For ſo he expounds
his owne meaning in the words of the Prophet
before mentioned, <hi>For that all fleſh is as graſſe, &amp; all
the glory of man as the flower of graſſe, the graſſe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth,
and the flower thereof falleth away.</hi> Now
that which it ſelfe withereth and falleth away can
yeeld no ſeed of life, can miniſter no comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
miſery or mortality. The antitheſis then or
oppoſition requires, that by the incorruptible
ſeed of which wee are borne againe, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the <hi>word</hi> of God which endureth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or ſomewhat into which that word doth in
ſpeciall manner infuſe life, or <hi>verbum caro factum,</hi>
the eternall word as it is invailed in fleſh, but in
fleſh exempted or priviledged from all corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For it is called <hi>the word of God which liveth for
ever;</hi> not ſo much in reſpect of its owne life, but
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7898:159"/>
in regard of its communication of life to ſuch as
are deſtitute of life. That this is the true ſcale of
S. <hi>Peters</hi> meaning we may gather from S. <hi>Iohns</hi>
parallel paraphraſe upon the ſame words of the
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah. In the beginning was the word, and
the word was God, &amp;c. And hee came unto his owne
and his owne received him not, but as many as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him to them he grave power or right to become the
ſonnes of God, even to them which beleeve on his
name.</hi> But who are they that rightly beleeve on
his name? <hi>Such as are borne not of blood, nor of the
will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man,</hi> (this is that
which S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>not of corruptible ſeed,) but are
borne of God.</hi> And whoſoever is borne of God is
queſtionleſſe borne of that immortall ſeed wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes. The further explication of this
point will much depend upon the ſolution of
theſe two queſtions. The firſt, in what ſenſe we
are ſaid to be borne of God. The ſecond, when
miſerable and corruptible men were firſt ſo borne.
To aſſoile the later queſtion in the firſt place;
Fleſh and blood were not capable of this new
birth, whereof S. <hi>Iohn</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeake untill
<hi>that word of God which endureth for ever,</hi> that word
which was with God and was, God, by whom the
world alſo was made, came into the world, and
being made man was borne of a woman. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Patriarks &amp; Prophets were true heires of this
glorious promiſe, but could not be reall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of the bleſſing promiſed, before this time.
But was the incarnation of the eternall word to
this purpoſe concludently foreprophecyed by
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7898:159"/>
                     <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in that 40. chapter? Yes; this was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
part of thoſe glad tidings which the <hi>voice
of him that cried in the wilderneſſe</hi> was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime,
as it is expreſſed ver. 5. <hi>The glory of the Lord
ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together.</hi> The
ſight of it was to bee a ſight of life and comfort
to all fleſh: and this was the height of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
which the ſight of this glory exhibited, that
as they had beene the miſerable ſonnes of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
men, ſo they ſhould become the ſons of God,
bleſſed for ever. Now it is evident out of other
Scriptures that no fleſh could ſee the glory of
God and live, ſave only as the brightneſſe of it
was to bee alloyed by a vaile a fleſh, through
which the Apoſtles themſelves, not all, but <hi>Peter,
Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> did behold it, as weakeſighted
men do the ſplendour of the ſunne through a
cloud. Hence ſaith S. <hi>Iohn</hi> (by way of comment
or paraphraſe upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forecited 40. of <hi>Iſaiah)</hi> ver.
5. <hi>The word was made fleſh, and wee beheld his glory</hi>
(to wit, the glory of the word of God which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for ever) <hi>the glory as of the only begotten ſon
of God, full of grace and truth. And of his fulneſſe all
that beleeve receive grace for grace.</hi> When it is ſaid
that the ſonne of God was made man of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
this implies that he was as truely fleſh of
the womans fleſh, and bone of her bones, as the
firſt woman was fleſh of the firſt mans fleſh, and
bone of his bones. But in this the myſteries of the
firſt womans creation is not finally accompliſhed.
How was it then ſo accompliſhed? In this, that no
ſonnes of men, none that are borne of women
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7898:160"/>
can truely and really become the ſonnes of God,
untill they become fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of
his bones, who was not made the ſon of God, but
was the ſonne of God by nature, his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſonne before all worlds, the light and life of
men. As the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>the word</hi> which in the beginning was
with God, and the ſonne of God, are but titles of
one and the ſame perſon: ſo the <hi>word of life and
the word of God which endureth for ever,</hi> are but Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymall
expreſſions of one and the ſame my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
to wit, of the word being made fleſh, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
viſible and ſenſible unto fleſh. <hi>That</hi> (ſaith
S. <hi>Iohn) which was from the beginning, which we have
heard, which wee have ſeene with our eyes, which wee
have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the
Word of life; that wee declare unto you. For the life
was manifeſted, and we have ſeen it, and beare witneſſe
and ſhew unto you, even that eternall life, which was
with the Father and was manifeſted unto us, 1 Iohn
1.</hi> 1, 2. This life was alwaies with God, but came
not into the world, was not manifeſted to fleſh
and bloud; untill: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the Word,</hi> and ſon of God
was incarnate.</p>
                  <p>3. The ſame Antitheſis, or oppoſition which
the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes betweene the mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and frailety of fleſh, and the immortality or
everlaſting duration of the word of God, the
Pſalmiſt makes betweene his owne miſery and
fading eſtate, and the everlaſting happineſſe of
his Lord God. And from the contemplation of
this oppoſition takes the ſame comfort to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was commanded
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7898:160"/>
to miniſter unto Gods people, and unto Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
<hi>My dayes,</hi> ſaith he, Pſal: 102. 11, <hi>are like a
ſhadow that declineth, and I am withered like graſſe:
but thou O Lord ſhalt endure for ever, and thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
unto all generations.</hi> And againe, <hi>Of old
thou haſt laid the foundations of the earth, and the
Heavens are the works of thy hands: they ſhall periſh,
but thou ſhalt endure, yea all of them ſhall wax old
like a garment, as a veſture ſhalt thou change them,
and they ſhall be changed; thou art the ſame, and thy
yeares ſhall have no end.</hi> That this paſſage of the
Pſalmiſt is literally meant of the eternall God,
the Iews themſelves cannot deny. And that it is
meant of God incarnate, of the ſonne of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in the fleſh, S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt Chapter to
the Hebrews doth aſſure us Chriſtians. For he
alleageth this very place ver. 10. to prove that
Chriſt God and man was farre above all Angells
and principalities, and that after his enthroniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as King, he was to change this world which
was made by him. The very literall meaning of
the Pſalmiſt will enforce thus much, that this
place was to be meant of God, not ſimply or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
but of God incarnate. For the eternall
duration of the Godhead is not meaſurable by
dayes or yeares, but the incarnation of the ſonne
of God, or his duration in the fleſh, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by number of yeares for the time paſt;
yet are his yeares as man to continue without
end, without any decay or diminution of that
nature which he aſſumed. The Pſalmiſt foreſaw
his owne intereſt in the numberleſſe yeares of his
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7898:161"/>
Lord, whoſe happineſſe and immortality was the
only comfort of his miſerable mortalitie. The
ſame comfort the Author of the 103. Pſalme
(whether he were the ſame with the Author of
the 102. Pſalme, or ſome other) takes to himſelfe
from the like contemplation of his owne miſery,
and of the happineſſe of God incarnate. <hi>Like as a
Father pittieth his children, ſo the Lord pittieth them
that feare him. For he knoweth our frame, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
that we are but duſt. As for man his dayes are as
graſſe: as a flowre of the field, ſo he flouriſheth. For the
winde paſſeth over it, and it is gone, and the place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhall know it no more. But the mercy of the Lord is
from everlaſting to everlaſting, upon them that feare
him, and his righteouſneſſe unto childrens children:
To ſuch as keepe his Covenant: and to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
his Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to do them.</hi> Pſal. 103. 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18. For the true interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of this paſſage unto this preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
it is in the firſt place remarkable, that where
in the 13. verſe wee read <hi>Iehovah,</hi> or <hi>the Lord,</hi> the
Chaldee renders it, <hi>The word of the Lord hath pity
on them that feare him:</hi> In the ſecond, that the
mercy of the Lord, or of <hi>the word of God,</hi> verſe 17
is<note n="c" place="margin">Chriſt is called the mercy or gracious Saint of God Pſal. 16. 10. Compare that place with the beginning of the 118. Pſalme, &amp; Pſalm, 136 &amp; others, wherein it is repeated that the mercy of the Lord endureth for ever.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, a word or terme whoſe full
importance cannot bee had from any ordinary
Lexicon, unleſſe it be ſuch as is proper unto Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
For it cannot be underſtood of that mercy
or loving kindneſſe of God which was ordinarily
manifeſted either towards mankinde in generall,
or towards the people of Iſrael in particular. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Novice in the Schoole of the Prophets did
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7898:161"/>
know that this mercy of the Lord was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall.
But what could it availe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this Pſalme to conſider that this mercy
of God had beene manifeſted to his forefathers
before his time, and ſhould bee to poſteritie in
their ſeverall generations after him, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
could it afford unto <hi>the childrens children of
ſuch as feared him,</hi> that this <hi>mercy of God</hi> ſhould
be reſerved for them, only after the ſame manner
or meaſure which their forefathers had taſted, or
had experience of it, and yet complaine of their
miſerable and wretched eſtate for the preſent;
and comfort themſelves only in the expectation
of that abundant mercy which they hoped after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſhould be revealed. The beſt expoſition
upon this place of the Pſalmiſt, or what is in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
meant by <hi>the mercy of the Lord,</hi> or of the <hi>word
of God,</hi> is given by S. <hi>Paul, Titus</hi> the 3. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
<hi>For wee our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
deceived, ſerving divers luſts, and pleaſures,
living in malice and envy, hatefull and hating one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
But after the kindneſſe and love of God our
Saviour toward man appeared, not by workes of
righteouſneſſe which wee have done, but according to
this mercy he ſaved i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, by the waſhing of regeneration,
and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
through Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour: That
being juſtified by his grace, wee ſhould be made heires
according to the hope of eternall life.</hi> Of this mercy
and loving kindneſſe the Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
(as wee ſaid before) had the promiſe, but
without all hope of enjoying the thing promiſed
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7898:162"/>
for the preſent. It was not then the mercy of God
or <hi>Iehovah</hi> conſidered in the Godhead only, but
the mercy of God to be incarnate, to be made
King and Judge of the earth, which did ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
theſe and other Pſalmiſts in their greateſt
diſtreſſes and perplexities, in al w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they had juſt
occaſion to ſay, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> afterwards did, <hi>If in this
life only,</hi> (or in the loving kindneſſe of God, as it
hath been experienced in our dayes) <hi>we had hope,
we were of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 19.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>That this place, though literally meant of
God alone, was yet to be punctually fulfilled in
God incarnate, or in</hi> the Word <hi>made fleſh, beſides
this expoſition of S.</hi> Paul, <hi>the very letter and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of the text doth perſwade us. For the
expected comfort wherupon this Pſalmiſt pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is this:</hi> The Lord hath prepared his throne in the
heavens, and his Kingdome ruleth over all. <hi>And here
againe, whereas we read</hi> the Lord, <hi>the Chaldee
reades the</hi> Word of the Lord hath prepared his
throne. <hi>And in that it was</hi> prepared, <hi>it was not from
eternitie, though after it were prepared, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
from everlaſting to everlaſting, that is (as
we ſay) world without end. And this is that
throne and that Kingdome which</hi> Daniel <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
that God long after his time would erect,</hi>
Daniel, 2. 44. And in the dayes of theſe Kings ſhall the
God of heaven ſet up a kingdome, which ſhall never
be deſtroyed, and that Kingdome ſhall not be left to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people: but it ſhall breake in pieces and conſume all
theſe Kingdomes, and it ſhall ſtand for ever. <hi>And of
this throne you have a moſt exquiſite deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7898:162"/>
by S.</hi> Iohn Revel. 4. 1, 2. After this I looked, and
behold a doore was opened in Heaven, and the firſt
voice which I heard, was as it were of a trumpet talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with me, which ſaid, Come up hit her, and I will
ſhew thee things which muſt be hereafter. And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
I was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was
ſet in heaven, and one ſate on the throne. And round
about the throne were foure and twenty ſeats, and upon
the ſeats I ſaw foure and twenty Elders ſitting cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in white rayment. And they had on their heads
Crownes of gold &amp;c. The foure and twenty Elders
fell downe before him that ſate on the throne, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him that liveth for ever, and caſt their Crownes
before him ſaying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive
glory and honour and power: for thou haſt created all
things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.
<hi>This praiſing of him that ſate upon the throne,
was that wherunto the Author of the 103. Pſalme
did ſolemnly invite the heavenly powers, long
before S.</hi> Iohn <hi>had this viſion. For after he had
ſaid,</hi> the Lord had prepared his throne in the heavens,
and his Kingdome ruleth over all; <hi>it followes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi>
Bleſſe the Lord yee his Angels, that excell in
ſtrength, that do his Commandements, hearkning unto
the voice of his word. Bleſſe yee the Lord, all yee his
hoſts, yee Miniſters of his, that do his pleaſure. Bleſſe
the Lord, all his workes in all places of his Dominion:
Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule. <hi>That which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſaith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>was in its meaſure true of
this Pſalmiſt; he alſo ſaw the day of Chriſt, the
day of his glorious reſurrection, that day wherof
it is ſaid,</hi> thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7898:163"/>
thee, <hi>and did rejoyce in ſoule to ſee it, and his

in the heavenly Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. But the viſion of <hi>David</hi> to this purpoſe in
that Pſalme, which amongſt ſome few others
beares the inſcription of <hi>Michtam, Davids Ieweler
golden ſong</hi> (as ſome would have it,) is moſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
cleare, <hi>Keep me O God, for in thee do I put my
truſt:</hi> that is (as the Chaldee explaines it) <hi>In thy
word have I put my truſt,</hi> or hope for ſalvation.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 1. and ver. 2. <hi>I have ſaid unto the Lord,
Adonai.</hi> And againe ver. 8. &amp;c. <hi>I have ſet the Lord
alwayes before me: becauſe he is at my right hand, I
ſhall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my
glory rejoyceth; my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope.</hi> But
here the Eunuches queſtion unto <hi>Philip</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
it ſelfe, <hi>Of whom ſpeaketh the Prophet this,
of himſelfe or of ſome other?</hi> I can no way brooke
their opinion, who thinke the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes
all this in the perſon of Chriſt, as his figure, but
rather in this, as in many other Pſalmes, and in
the two laſt forecited eſpecially, ſome paſſages
there be which cannot be literally applyed but to
the Pſalmiſt himſelfe, others which cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to any one but Chriſt, that is to God or the
word incarnate: and the 9. verſe <hi>My heart is glad,
&amp;c.</hi> containes a feeling expreſſion of that joy or
exultation of ſpirit, which did poſſeſſe all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
both of <hi>Davids</hi> body and ſoule. But what
was the object of this his exultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the ground
of his joy? He expreſſeth it, ver. 10. <hi>Thou wilt
not leave my ſoule in Hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thy
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7898:163"/>
holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> But the ſame queſtion
here interpoſeth againe; <hi>Doth he ſpeak all this of
himſelfe or of ſome other?</hi> Whatſoever may bee
thought of the former clauſe of that verſe, <hi>thou
wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell</hi> (which as ſome
think) might be meant both of Chriſt and <hi>David</hi>
(though in a different meaſure;) moſt certaine it
is, that the later clauſe, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one to ſee corruption,</hi> was not literally meant of
<hi>David,</hi> much leſſe fulfilled in him, but literally
meant of him alone, and literally fulfilled in him
alone, whom <hi>David</hi> in ſpirit called Lord; though
he then foreſaw he ſhould truly be his ſonne. This
undoubted truth we learne from S. <hi>Peter Acts 2.
29. Men and brethren, let me freely ſpeake unto you
of the Patriarch David, that he is both dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
and his ſepulcher is with us unto this day There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being a Prophet, and knowing that God had ſworn
with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loines, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fleſh, he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on
his throne, he ſeeing this before, ſpake of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt, that his ſoule was not left in Hell, neither
his fleſh did ſee corruption.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul, Acts 13. 36,
37.</hi> more fully and more punctually to our ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions
upon this later clauſe expounds it
thus: <hi>David after he had ſerved his owne generation
by the will of God fell on ſleepe, and was laid unto his
Fathers, and ſaw corruption. But he whom God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
againe, ſaw no corruption.</hi> In this as in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pſalmes the comfort which did ariſe from
the ſweet contemplations was <hi>Davids</hi> owne, or
the Pſalmiſts who foreſaw that great myſtery
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7898:164"/>
whereof we now treat, that the fountaine of their
comfort was Chriſt or God incarnate, who was
to be raiſed from the dead. <hi>David</hi> in this Pſalme
did rejoyce in heart, that albeit he knew his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be like the graſſe that withereth, albeit he
knew his ſoule ſhould be divorced from his body;
yet this divorce he knew (by faith,) ſhould not
be perpetuall, that albeit he could not but expect
his body, his fleſh and bones ſhould rott in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher
as the body and fleſh of his forefathers
to whom he was to be gathered, had done; yet
he foreſaw in ſpirit, that even his body ſhould at
length be redeemed from corruption by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of that holy One, whoſe body, though
ſeparated for a time from his immortall ſoule, was
not to ſee or feele any corruption. Finally though
<hi>David</hi> and other Pſalmiſts forecited, (if others
they were) did perfectly and explicitly foreknow
that they were to die; yet had they as true impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
beleife of that which our Apoſtle explicitly
delivers <hi>Goloſ. 3. 3, 4. That their life was hid with
Chriſt in God, that when Chriſt, who was their life,
ſhould appeare, they ſhould alſo appeare with him in
glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. To the former generall Quaere [in what
ſenſe we are ſaid by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> to be borne of God]
we anſwer; that to be borne of God, is all one with
that of S. <hi>Peter, to be borne of immortall ſeed,</hi> but
what is that immortall ſeed whereof S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith
we are borne againe? That, in one word, is the
fleſh and blood of the ſonne of man, who is alſo
the ſonne of God. So hee himſelfe inſtructs us
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7898:164"/>
                     <hi>Iohn 6. 53, 54, 55. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
yee eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke
his bloud, yee have no life in you. Who ſo eateth my
fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I
will raiſe him up at the laſt day. For my fleſh is meate
indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my
fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in
him.</hi> That is meat and drink indeed which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth
us not to a bodily but to a ſpirituall and
immortall life; which preſuppoſeth an immortall
ſeed. Unto all theſe ends and purpoſes, to our
new birth, to our nouriſhment and growth in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
life, the fleſh and blood of the <hi>Word</hi> or ſon
of God were conſecrated by his ſufferings upon
the croſſe, and by his reſurrection from the dead.
He was, according to his humane nature, both
the Prieſt appointed to obtaine theſe bleſſings;
and to award them <hi>ex officio;</hi> and withall the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
by whoſe participation they are really and
actually conveyed unto all that doe or ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the immortality of ſoule and body.</p>
                  <p>7. But if his fleſh and blood be the ſeed of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie,
how are we ſaid to be borne againe
<hi>by the word of God</hi> which liveth and abideth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
Is this word, by which we are borne, the
ſame with that immortall feed of which wee are
borne? It is the ſame not in nature, but in perſon.
May we not in that ſpeech of S. <hi>Peter by the word</hi>
underſtand the word preached in to us by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
who are Gods feeds men? In a ſecondary
ſenſe we may, for we are begotten and borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by preaching as by the inſtrument or
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7898:165"/>
meanes; yet borne againe by the eternall <hi>word,</hi>
(that is by Chriſt himſelfe) as by the proper and
efficient cauſe of our new birth. Thus much S.
<hi>Peters</hi> word is that place will inforce us to grant
according to the letter. For having before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the word of God (by which we are born
againe) <hi>doth live and endure for ever,</hi> he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<hi>and this is the word which by the Goſpell is
preached unto you. 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 25.</p>
                  <p>8. The Goſpell it ſelfe (taken in the largeſt
ſenſe) is but the declaration of the Evangeliſts
and Apoſtles upon the propheticall predictions
concerning the incarnation, the birth, the death,
the reſurrection and aſcenſion of Chriſt. And
Chriſt himſelfe, who was put to death for our
ſinnes and raiſed againe for our juſtification, is
<hi>the word</hi> which we all doe or ought to preach. The
Goſpell written or preached by us cannot be <hi>that
word,</hi> which by the Goſpell is preached unto us.
This <hi>Word,</hi> in the literall aſſertive ſenſe, can bee
no other then the <hi>eternall word</hi> or ſonne of God
made fleſh, and conſecrated in the fleſh to be the
ſeed of immortalitie. And if wee take the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
not according to the outward letter or bark
but for the heart or ſubſtance of the Goſpell, or
for the glad tidings of life (which is the primitive
ſignification of this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or Goſpell)
that is no other, then the <hi>Word made fleſh,</hi> or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in the fleſh. To this purpoſe ſaith our
Evangeliſt, or rather the Angell of the Lord <hi>Luke
2. 10. Feare not, for behold I bring you good tidings
of great joy which ſhall be to all people:</hi> (this is no
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7898:165"/>
more then the Prophet ſaith, <hi>all fleſh ſhall ſee the
glory of the Lord:) for unto you is borne, this day in
the city of David a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi>
Lord he was long before, and this <hi>Lord</hi> was made
fleſh before that day wherein he was borne, but
firſt manifeſted in the fleſh upon that day, and
manifeſted to be the Saviour of all people or all
fleſh, ſome eight dayes after, yet not then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
made Chriſt untill his reſurrection. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the Goſpell in its prime or principall ſenſe
is no other, or no more then the great myſtery
of godlineſſe which was inwrapt in the volume of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, but not revealed or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
untill the <hi>word</hi> was made fleſh, was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
in the fleſh, and made King and Chriſt.
<hi>Without controverſie,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul 1. Tim. 3. 16.
great is the myſterie of godlineſſe: God was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeene of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
preached unto the Gentiles, beleeved on in the
world, received up into glory.</hi> All theſe teſtimonies
put together amount to this point, that the ſonne
of God manifeſted in the fleſh was <hi>that Word</hi>
which in S. <hi>Peters</hi> language, is preached by the
Goſpell. And if we doe not preach <hi>this word</hi> unto
our hearers, if all our ſermons doe not tend to one
of theſe two ends, [either to inſtruct our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in the articles of their Creed concerning
Chriſt, or to prepare their eares and hearts that
they may be fit auditors of ſuch inſtructions] we
doe not preach the Goſpell unto them, wee take
upon us the name of Gods Ambaſſadors, or of the
miniſters of the Goſpell, more then in vaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:7898:166"/>
9. Beſides all theſe teſtimonies, and others
that might bee alleaged, all moſt undoubtedly
true in the literall aſſertive ſenſe, that the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of godlineſſe, or the joyfull tidings which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
ſeed did expect ſhould conſiſt in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betweene the eternall Word or ſonne of God,
and our fleſh, we have a moſt lively character or
prefiguration (though not aſſertive) in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
word deſigned by the wiſedome of God to
expreſſe the preaching of the Goſpel or joyfull
embaſſage of our everlaſting peace. For one and
the ſame word in the originall doth ſignifie <hi>fleſh,</hi>

according to the uſe of the originall language,
doth properly ſignifie <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is, men or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
indued with life or ſenſe; and being the
root or primitive is not a verb, but a noune. The
firſt verbe that is formed of it doth ſignifie as
much as the Latine <hi>nunciavit</hi> or <hi>nunciare,</hi> to bring
or deliver a meſſage, and is alwayes uſed for ſome
good or joyfull meſſage, and in peculiar for the
preaching of the Goſpell, which is the joyfull
meſſage <gap reason="foreign">

and Prophets did ſolace

to doe the like, in all their perplexities, by aſſured
hope of this great myſtery in the Lords good
time to be revealed: yet the curious fancies of
captious wits have been, and will bee ready to
queſtion, though not the matter or myſtery it
ſelfe, yet the manner of our Evangeliſts expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, <hi>[the Word was made fleſh.]</hi> To be made
fleſh, is to be made a ſubſtance, and the <hi>Word</hi>
which is ſaid to be made fleſh, was more then a
ſubſtance, the everliving eſſence, the life and light
of men, before he was manifeſted in the fleſh.
Doth he ſtill remaine ſo? So we Chriſtians are
bound to beleeve. Yet might the Jew or meere
heathen artiſt have liberty to oppoſe us, they
would find matter of argument, to this or like
purpoſe; whenſoever one ſubſtance is truly made
another, the former ſubſtance ceaſeth to be what
it was before. For the truth of this generall rule,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7898:167"/>
inſtances are plentifull in all ſorts of ſubſtances
which are ſaid to be made what they were not
before:<note place="margin">Cap. 29</note> when one ſimple Elements is made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
when the water becomes a vapour, it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to be water; when the Vapour is made a
cloud, it is no longer a vapour; when the cloud
reſolves into raine, it is no more a cloud: when
of the Elements any third body is made, whether
perfectly or imperfectly mixt, they ceaſe to be
what they were, they loſe both their forme and
names. Nor ſkils it whether one ſubſtance be
made or becomes another which before it was
not by courſe of nature, or immediately by the
finger of God, or by the exerciſe of his miraculous
power. For it was a true miracle, and a great one,
that pure water ſhould be immediately made
perfect wine, and yet the water being made wine
did ceaſe to be what it was before; it was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
a ſimple Element, but a true mixt body. Now
<hi>the Word,</hi> (as all Chriſtians grant) was an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Eſſence, more then a ſubſtance, before it
was made or became fleſh. How then can wee
Chriſtians mainteyne, that it ſtill remaines the
ſame it was, without any reall alteration, or
change, whether ſubſtantiall or accidentall? To
this objection wee reply, as before wee have
done in other caſes, that multitude of inſtances,
how many ſoever, cannot make up a perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
if in any one pretended for grounding
a rule or propoſition abſolutely univerſall, there
be the leaſt diverſitie or diſſimilitude of reaſon.
Every ſuch diverſity or diſparity acquits the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7898:168"/>
in which it is found, for being compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under the rule or law, otherwiſe univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall.
Admitting it then to be univerſally true of
all other ſubſtances or Eſſences in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides;
<hi>Whenſoever one is made or becomes another
which before it was not, that ſubſtance, which is made
another, doth loſe it ſelfe, or ceaſeth to be what it was;</hi>
Yet this univerſall rule will not reach the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
now in debate concerning <hi>the Word's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made fleſh.</hi> The reaſon is plaine, not from the
manner of this miraculous work, but from the
nature or ſupereminency of that everlaſting ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or Eſſence, which was miraculouſly made
fleſh. All other Eſſences or ſubſtances, which are
capable of being made, or becoming what they
were not, are capable of change or alteration in
their ſubſtances. They do not either loſe their
owne names, or ſuffer the names of other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to be put upon them, untill they have put
off their owne natures, or loſt poſſeſſion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The law of nature ties eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liveleſſe ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the laws of Heraldrie ties Nobles or Gentlemen
not to alter their ancient Armes or names, which
they ſeldome do, unleſſe upon conqueſt or ſome
marriage, or alliance, beneficiall or advantagious
to their houſe or Family. But the <hi>Word</hi> of God
which endureth for ever, was and is as unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as God himſelfe: was and is from eternity,
more then all things, <hi>Eſſence, or being it ſelfe.</hi> As
all things were made by him, ſo he might when

he pleaſed, bee made fleſh or man without any
change or alteration in himſelfe, either whilſt all
things were made by him, or whilſt hee were
made this particular. It is then the preheminence
or ſuperexcellency of his nature or Eſſence, which
exempts him from the former generall rule or
pretended induction.</p>
                  <p>2 For the more commodious expreſſion as of
divers other ſupernaturall myſteries or matters
ſpirituall, ſo of this great myſterie eſpecially the
the fitteſt reſemblance which can be made of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
muſt be borrowed not from experiments or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
in matters phyſicall, but from caſes of
civill uſe or conſequence. Mutations accidentall
there may be many, phyſically accidentall in one
and the ſame ſubſtance, without any alteration
in the ſubſtance, in which ſuch change is made:
Yet ſuch changes of accidents properly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
for the moſt part either adde ſome perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the ſubſtance, or detract ſomewhat from it.
But for a perſon already inveſted with honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
names or titles, and with realities anſwering
to them, to inveſt himſelfe with realities or titles
of an inferior rank, is no diſparagement to his
former dignities. Thus many Princes by birth
and of great poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſometimes take the names
or titles of Knights, are ſolemnely made Knights,
created Earles, ſometimes made Gentlemen of
Venice, and ſome Kings of this Land have beene
made free of particular Companies or Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
under their royall juriſdiction, and ſo made
without any impeachement or diminution of their
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:7898:169"/>
royall titles, but only to the grace or advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that order whereof they were made
Knights, or of thoſe Societies and Corporations
whereof they were made free. And thus although
the <hi>Word,</hi> who before the beginning of time was
with God, was truely God, was in the fulneſſe of
time made fleſh, this can be no impeachment to
his Deitie or Divine perſon, but an unſpeakable
exaltatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or advancement of the humane nature
which he took upon him. And herein, we poore
miſerable men (ſo wee would be thankfull for it)
have a preheminence of the Angelicall nature,
in that the ſon of God, God bleſſed for ever, did
vouchſafe to become one of our order and ranke,
in ſuch a manner as he is not of theirs.</p>
                  <p>3 The reſolution of the ſecond Quaere depends
upon another more queſtioned point, which I
have no minde to diſpute, and leſſe to be tyed to
other mens conjectures, or voluntary determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it without warrant of Scripture, or any
certaine deductions from it, warrantable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
The point queſtionable is briefely this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the humane ſoule of our bleſſed Lord was
infuſed into his body immediately upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
which (as the ſacred Text to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion

upon the bleſſed Virgins aſſent unto the

of time the humane ſoule was inſpired into his
body, the Word was not made fleſh before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
man. If otherwiſe, the holy ſeed did after
the conception grow by degrees into a live ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7898:169"/>
reaſonable ſubſtance, though neither after
the ſame manner, nor by the ſame meanes, yet
according to the ſame meaſure of time as other
Infants do. The caſe is unqueſtionable that the
ſonne of God, or the Word, was made fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was made man; For he was not made
man before the inſpiration or creation of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſoule; but even from the very firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his conception, the Womans ſeed was
hypoſtically united to the Word or ſonne of
God. The fleſh and blood which he tooke of the
bleſſed Virgin became the fleſh and blood of the
ſonne of God from the firſt moment of their
aſſumption. Nor can this opinion be juſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with any ſuſpition of errour, or other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
as conteyning nothing which is not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
parallel to that which wee beleeve concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the union of his body with the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in his perſon, after his body was ſeparated
from his ſoule. His body in that interim of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or of its reſt in the grave, was as truely
the body of the ſon of God, as it had beene whilſt
it was living. His ſoule likewiſe was as truely the
ſoule of the ſonne of God during the divorce, as
it was whilſt it retayned union with its body.
And whether the blood which was ſhed from his
moſt pretious body on the Croſſe, were gathered
againe into his veines (a point not to be pryed
into by mortall men) or how ever it pleaſed him
or his heavenly Father to diſpoſe of it; yet I think
I may ſay that not a drop of it but remaines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this day the true blood of the ſonne of God; it

                  <p>4 Some I know there be who think all others
to ſpeake and think unworthily of Chriſt, unleſſe
they grant that his ſoule was not only infuſed
into his body in the firſt conception of it, but
that it was withall endued with all manner
of knowledge which Hee afterwards had. Yet
to binde any man to beleeve or acknowledge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe (the latter eſpecially) is to lay more
upon us then God hath in his written Word or
in the booke of his Creatures tyed us unto, if ſo
theſe men will give us leave to uſe the ſpectacles
of reaſon in reading either booke. For if our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour during all the time he was in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
womb, had the perfect uſe of ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
his condition of life had beene more weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
then in any part of his pilgrimage here on
earth it was; for he was as mortall, and as ſubject
to ſad impreſſions in the womb, as he was in the
ſtrength of his age: and death had beene more
welcome to him then ſuch cloſe impriſonment, if
the excerciſe of reaſon or Contemplation had
beene as free there as it was, when he was endued
with libertie of ſenſe and locall motion. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reaſon I can conceive any man ſhould pretend
either for the infuſion of the reaſonable ſoule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his body, at the firſt conception, or that the
reaſonable ſoule, whether then or at the time
wherein other infants become capable of it, ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
be endued with ſuch a meaſure of actuall or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7898:171"/>
knowledge whilſt he was in his mothers
womb, as afterwards it was, muſt be grounded on
the hypoſtaticall union betweene the womans
ſeed and the word of God. But if any reaſon thus
grounded could infer either part of the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
it would aſwell inferre, that his knowledge
as man, ſhould have beene infinite from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
This I think no Chriſtian wil affirme; for
the perſonall union of the divine nature with the
humane, doth not endow it with the reall titles
of the divine. Otherwiſe, Chriſts ſtrength as man
ſhould have beene infinite from the womb: and
his body ſhould have beene every where. And it
would be leſſe unreaſonable to ſay that his body
is at this day infinite, and his humane nature e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where; then that his wiſdome or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as man, ſhould have beene infinite, or as
great whilſt he was in the womb as now it is. If
the divine nature did not communicate his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to the humane, nor make the ſonne of God
ſo compleat a man for ſtrength of ability of body
from the womb, as at thirtie yeares he was; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
the bounds of my capacitie to imagine,
what reaſon thoſe men have for their opinion,
who think our bleſſed Lord &amp; Saviour did not as
truely grow in wiſdome and knowledge, as he
did in ſtrength or ſtature of body. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is alike literall for both, <hi>Luk. 2. 52. Ieſus
increaſed in Wiſdome and ſtature, and in favour with
God and man.</hi> I make no queſtion but that ſuch as
deny his growth in wiſdome, do this out of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
feare, leſt they ſhould ſpeake or conceive
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7898:172"/>
any thing of Chriſt which might be thought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to derogate from his greatneſſe, or from his
goodneſſe. This feare or zealous care is in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
very good, but hath ſmall ground in this
particular. For were it either well grounded or
well guided, it would rather teach us not to deny
that Jeſus did grow in wiſdome and goodneſſe,
then to be peremptory in contradicting others
which hold the affirmative. Simple <hi>neſcience</hi> can
be no ſinne in any Child nor in any man, unleſſe
it be of thoſe things which he is bound to know.
But <hi>proficiency</hi> in wiſdome and knowledge is in
the ſonnes of men a praiſe worthy perfection,
which I ſhould be as unwilling to deny unto my
Lord and Saviour in his infancy or his youth, as
to rob him now of any royall attributes ſince he
was made King. That he was without all ſtaine
of ſinne, the moſt holy Sanctuary of the moſt
holy and bleſſed God from the womb, I ſtedfaſtly
beleeve: but that he had the ſame meaſure o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

knowledge at his circumciſion, at his preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Temple, which he had and gave proofe
of when his Parents found him in the Temple
diſputing with the Doctors, or no greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of this knowledge at his baptiſme, then he
then had; or as great as his baptiſme, as ſince his
reſurrection and aſcention he hath; I ſhall crave
pardon for making theſe or the like any points
of my beleife. If any man be otherwiſe minded
I grudge him not the libertie of his opinion, but
will confeſſe my ignorance, when he ſhall ſhew
me any expreſſe Scripture, or any deduction out

                  </p>
                  <p>5 It ſufficeth me to beleeve and know that
my Lord was ſo qualified with all grace, even
whilſt he lived in the forme of a ſervant, that he
was alwaies more ready to underſtand, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
whatſoever it pleaſed his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to impart or ſignifie unto him, then chryſtall
is to receive the light of the Sun, or any glaſſe the

in his cradle a docilitie or capacitie, both for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and doing his fathers will, truely infinite in
compariſon of other children, yet this capacitie
was actuated by degrees. This, I take it, is as
much as wee are bound to beleeve concerning
his growth in wiſedome; and this wee cannot

is only, to ſhew how truly, how juſtly, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonantly
to the knowne rules of reaſon in other

ſuch a peculiar union between the ſonne of God,
and the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> that whileſt the ſonne of

(whether we finde them in the Creed, or in the

as defective. But if every reſemblance of this or

well to give a generall prohibition that no man
ſhould attempt to make any. For all will come

within which it is moſt divinely true.</p>

3. The like compariſons ſometimes hold firme
and true only <hi>quoad veritatem, non quoad menſuram
according to the truth, not according to the meaſure of
the ſame truth.</hi> As when we beſeech our heavenly
father <hi>to forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them
that treſpaſſe againſt us;</hi> or when our Saviour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes
us, <hi>to be mercifull, as our heavenly father is
mercifull:</hi> the meaning is, not that the meaſure
of his mercies towards us ſhould be but equall to
our mercy, or kindneſſe towards men our fellow
ſervants: and yet, the meaning of our Saviours
injunction is, that we muſt bee as truly mercifull
and charitable towards others in ſome degree, as
God is infinitely mercifull towards all. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the like compariſons are firme and true <hi>&amp;


quoad veritatem, &amp; quoad menſuram,</hi> both according
to the truth, and the ſame meaſure of truth, but
not <hi>quoad modum,</hi> at leaſt not <hi>quoad modum ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum

true they may be ſometimes according
to the ſame manner, and yet not in all reſpects, or
according to the ſelfe-ſame particular manner.
And ſuch is this compariſon of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> Firſt
it holds <hi>quoad veritatem unionis,</hi> As it is not the
meere inhabitation of the reaſonable ſoule in the
body, but the peculiar union of theſe two parts,
which makes a man: ſo is it not the internall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
or peculiar inhabitation of the Deity in the
manhood, but the true and reall union of theſe
two natures, which makes one Chriſt. Infernall
ſpirits may, by Gods permiſſion, take up their
lodgings in the bodies of men, may be confined
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7898:174"/>
within them, and uſe them as their inſtruments:
yet by ſuch reſidence in them, men neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Divels, nor divels men, nor doe they make
any one realitie, or third thing in part or whole
diſtinct from both.</p>
                  <p>4. The former compariſon doth not hold <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum
omnem modum:</hi> that is, though the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
and humanity of Chriſt be as truly, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and really united, as the reaſonable ſoule
and the humane body are, yet the manner of the
union is herein different. The reaſonable ſoule
and the body being two diſtinct natures, each ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their proper exiſtence, though imperfect and
incompleat, doe by their union make one perfect
compleat nature. Their union is made by phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or naturall compoſition. Now in all ſuch u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
or compoſitions, each part ingredient muſt
abate or loſe ſomewhat; there muſt be a mutuall
faſhioning, or fitting of the one to the other. But
the Deitie or Godhead as it is all things elſe; ſo it
is fitneſſe it ſelfe, and cannot be faſhioned or fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to any creature, as being not ſubject to any
ſhadow of change, or alteration. The creatures
may be faſhioned or fitted to be more or leſſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of his preſence, or participation. But this
participation in what degree, in what manner or
meaſure ſoever it be had, includes no phyſicall
compoſition, or confuſion of natures. Thus much
<hi>Athanaſius,</hi> to prevent all captious exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this ſimilitude, had ſufficiently expreſſed in
the place forecited; <hi>though he be God and man, yet
he is not two, but one Chriſt; One, not by the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7898:175"/>
of the Godhead into fleſh, but by taking of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
into God, One altogether not by confuſion of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but by unitie of perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Some Philoſophers there are and have been,
who although they grant a Phyſicall compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of matter and forme in man, yet they deny
the reaſonable ſoule (the intellectuall part at leſt)
to be the forme of man, or any part of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
compound, which (in their Philoſophy) is
prerequired to the conſtitution of man; not any
proper part of his eſſence or nature. That viſible
live-ſubſtance, wherein the reaſonable ſoule du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her pilgrimage here on earth doth reſide, as
in a walking priſon, is in theſe mens Philoſophy
or Divinity as formally diſtinguiſhed by its meer
organical faculties, or bodily ſenſes, from all other
living ſenſitive creatures, as any of them is from
another. And they are diſtinguiſhed each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
only by the peculiar manner of the ſenſes,
or modification of their organicall faculties. The
reaſonable ſoule, or faculty of reaſon, is in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
rather the Crowne or Diadem, whereby
man excells all other creatures as their King or
Governour, then the Phyſicall forme whereby
he is formally or ſpecifically diſtinguiſhed from
them. According to this opinion there ſhould
be in one and the ſame man two diſtinct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
natures, one bodily phyſicall compound, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with ſenſe and ſubject to mortality, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rationall and immortall. And theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
make one man, not by phyſicall compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or union of matter and forme, but by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7898:175"/>
ſubordination of the ſenſitive Creature unto
the rationall, or of ſenſe unto reaſon, as true, as
firme and reall, as the ſubordination of life is to
ſenſe, or bodily mixture is unto life or vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but not by the ſame manner of ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his philoſophy were of this
mould, his compariſon would be true <hi>quoad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi>
however, leaving the examination of this
opinion to the Schooles, let us examime his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<hi>quoad veritatem &amp; menſuram.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6 Such Philoſophers as grant the reaſonable
ſoule to be a <hi>forme</hi> truely phyſicall, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat
part of mans nature, do not for the
moſt part affirme, that it is propagated from the
parents of our bodyes, but created by God, as the
ſoule of the firſt man was. And yet even theſe
men who deny the reaſonable ſoule to be <hi>ex tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,</hi>
do not avouch that only the bodily part or
fleſh of man is conceived, but the whole man who
conſiſts of a reaſonable ſoule aſwell as of a body.
The full and perfect conception of every living
thing includes not only a preparation of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
ſubſtance for receiving the foule, but beſides
this, the unition of the foule, (whether ſenſitive
only or reaſonable) with its proper body. And
ſeeing the proper nature of man conſiſts eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in reaſon, there can be no perfect concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man, as man, untill the reaſonable ſoule be
ſeated in and united unto the bodily ſubſtance,
fitted or organized for it. Whether that bodily
ſubſtance were before this union endued with
ſenſe or no, is not much pertinent to the point
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7898:176"/>
now in hand. However Philoſophers may diſpute
that caſe, this poſition is proper and philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call:
[Man doth beget man, and woman conceives
man, although the reaſonable ſoule, which is the
principall part of man, do not take its originall
or beginning of being, either from the man that
begets him, or from the woman that conceives
and brings him forth, but immediately from
GOD.]</p>
                  <p>7 This aſſertion likewiſe is Chriſtian and
Theologicall; [The bleſſed Virgin did truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and bring forth Chriſt Jeſus, God and man,
the ſonne of God, and the ſonne of <hi>David:]</hi> albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the Divine nature, which is the excellency
of Chriſt, did not take beginning from her, but
was from all eternitie without beginning, yet not
united to the manhood till the conception
wrought by the holy Ghoſt in the Virgins womb.
though both aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be moſt true, yet the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
of this theologicall aſſertion is more perſpicuous
and firme then the ground of the philoſophers
aſſertion wherewith it is paralleld. Wee Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
may give a better reaſon of our faith and
forme of doctrine, then the Philoſophers can
give of their opinion, or manner of phraſe in this
point. Firſt in the conception of ordinary or
meere men, the bodily ſubſtance, or the materiall
part, hath a diſtinct exiſtence of its owne, before
it be united unto the reaſonable ſoule, and the
reaſonable ſoule likewiſe hath a proper exiſtence
(at leaſt in order of nature if not of time) prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to its vnion with its body. Nor is the union
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7898:176"/>
ſo perfect as to make ſimply but one exiſtence of
both. It is actually one, potentially two, and in the
diſſolution of body and ſoule, they are actually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
there is not then ſo much as coexiſtence,
or exiſtence of the one in the other. But neither
the ſubſtance which the ſonne of God took from
the bleſſed virgin, nor the reaſonable ſoule which
was united unto it, had any proper exiſtence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their union with the divine nature. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
ſubſtance aſſumed by his divine perſon was a
part of the bleſſed virgines individuall nature, and
had its whole exiſtence in her before its aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but by the aſſumption it hath exiſtence whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in him not as a part, but as an Appendix to his
divine perſon. That which the Philoſophers or
Schoole Divines ſay concerning the creation of
the reaſonable ſoule, and its union with mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
is more remarkably true of Chriſts humane
ſoule. The reaſonable ſoule (ſay the Philoſophers)
<hi>infundendo creatur, et creando infunditur,</hi> is created
by infuſion, and is infuſed by creation. Chriſts rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſoule was not in order either of time or
nature, firſt created, then aſſumed, <hi>ſed aſſumendo
creabatur, et creando aſſumebatur,</hi> it was created
whileſt it was aſſumed, and it was aſſumed whilſt
it was created. Whether it were united to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
or fleſh from the firſt moment of their aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is an extravagant to this aſſertion. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
likewiſe which our bleſſed Saviour tooke
from his mother, was not either in order of time,
or of nature, firſt conceived or prepared by any
praeviall diſpoſitions for the divine natures habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7898:177"/>

meant when wee ſay, the fruit of the Virgins
womb was aſſumed by the Sonne of God? This
forme of ſpeech imports thus much at the leaſt;
that the ſon of God, or the divine nature in his
perſon, was to be partaker of fleſh and bloud, as we
ſonnes of men are: So the Apoſtle teacheth, Heb.

fleſh and blood, hee alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part of
the ſame, that through death hee might deſtroy him
that had the power of death, that is, the Devill.</hi> This
participation of fleſh &amp; bloud with his brethren,
is but an expreſſion of the aſſumption. <hi>Verely,</hi> ſaith
the Apoſtle ver. 16, <hi>he tooke not hold of the Angels,
but he tooke hold of the ſeede of Abraham.</hi> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of theſe expreſſions, as likewiſe of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

by him, yet were they not ſo aſſumed, or ſo united
to his perſon, as the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and
is. Nor is he partaker of their nature, or of any
other nature beſides, after ſuch a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

the man Chriſt Jeſus, every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creature is the inſtrument of
God: but al of them ſuch inſtruments
of the divine nature, as the axe or

9. Theſe and the like ſpeculations are neither
unpleaſant nor unprofitable, if ſo the Reader will
not reſtraine the former ſimilitude of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>
only to this kinde of union. But after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to what ſpeciall purpoſes, or what peculiar
ſervices the manhood of Chriſt is the inſtrument
of his divine nature (as the ancient for the moſt
part unanimouſly affirme) by Gods aſſiſtance in
other Articles following, or in the myſticall union
betwixt Chriſt and his members. Thus much in
this place, and for the preſent may ſuffice, that the
perſonall union betweene the divinity and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of Chriſt, (though it be in it ſelfe more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
then comprehenſible or expreſſible,) is
more proper and firme then any union which can
be made by mixture, by confuſion, by compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or compaction of ſeverall natures into one.
But what <hi>Athanaſius</hi> meant in that expreſſion of
<hi>taking the manhood into God,</hi> may (if I miſtake not)
to my preſent purpoſe (which is only to lay the
general grounds of theſe communications of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
which Divines whether antient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
obſerue betweene the divine and humane
nature of Chriſt) be yet further explicated by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
the maine objection that can be made
againſt <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his ſimilitude, or theſe illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it.</p>
                  <p>10. Some haply will object, (and it is all I think,
that can be objected againſt us) that as wee are,
ſuch is our fleſh, ſuch is our bloud. We are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
men, and our fleſh and bloud is by nature on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humane, or the fleſh and bloud of men; but if
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7898:179"/>
the fleſh and bloud whereof the ſonne of God is
partaker bee as truely his, as our fleſh and bloud
is ours, ſhall they not be ſuch as he is, that is, fleſh
and bloud truely divine not humane? This muſt
in no wiſe be granted, otherwiſe the ſonne of God
ſhould not be (as the Apoſtle avoucheth hee is)
partaker with us of <hi>the ſame fleſh and bloud.</hi> The
fleſh and bloud which he aſſumed and was parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of, are as truely humane, as mans fleſh &amp; bloud
are, and of the ſelfe ſame nature that mans fleſh
and bloud are of. And of ſuch fleſh he was to be as
truely, as properly partaker, as we are. And yet it
is neceſſary that the ſame fleſh and bloud which
he aſſumed, be as truely and as properly the fleſh
and bloud of the ſonne of God, (who is by nature
God bleſſed for ever) as our fleſh is the fleſh, or
our bloud the bloud of the ſonnes of men. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
albeit the fleſh and bloud aſſumed by him
had been as truely, and as properly humane fleſh
and bloud as ours is; yet could not the ſon of God
have beene as true and proper a partaker of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
fleſh and bloud as wee ſonnes of men are.
For no party or perſon can as truely and really
participate with another in that which is not his
owne by as perfect right, as it is the others who is
partaker of it with him. So then the fleſh and
bloud of our Saviour Chriſt was truely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Caro humana, non divina; ſanguis humanus, non
divinus,</hi> not divine but humane fleſh and bloud;
and yet withall as truely and properly <hi>Caro Dei,</hi>
and <hi>Sanguis Dei,</hi> the fleſh and bloud of God, as it
was <hi>caro humana, ſanguis humanus,</hi> humane fleſh,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7898:179"/>
and humane bloud: more properly the fleſh and
bloud of God, then the fleſh &amp; bloud of man. For
eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole humanity of Chriſt, aſwell the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſoule as the fleſh was and is the humanity
of the ſon of God. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Acts 20.
28. <hi>hath purchaſed the Church</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>with his
owne proper bloud.</hi> Now if the Church be Gods
owne not by creation only but by true purchaſe;
then the bloud by which hee purchaſed it, was as
truely his owne, as our bloud, or any thing within
us, or without us, which we can owne, is ours. But
was it Gods owne bloud, after the ſelfeſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or meaſure that our bloud is ours? It was not
in every reſpect, or after every manner his owne,
ſo as our bloud is ours; yet his owne by a more
proper, more full, and ſoveraigne title then our
bloud is any way ours.</p>
                  <p>11. Our fleſh and bloud may be ſaid to be our
owne in two reſpects, either as it is a part of our
nature, or an appertinence of our perſon. In this
laſt reſpect the fruit of the Virgins womb was the
ſonne of Gods own ſubſtance, the fleſh and bloud
which hee tooke from her were his after a more
exquiſite manner, or in a fuller meaſure of the
ſame manner, then our fleſh and bloud are our
owne. Or if wee would ſpeake the language of
Philoſophy her ſelfe, rather then of Philoſophers,
or of ſuch as profeſſe themſelves to be her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
though ofttimes, (as wee ſay) a farre off. Our
fleſh, our bloud, our limbes, are ſaid to be our
owne, not ſo much or not ſo properly as they are
parts of our nature, as in that they are either parts
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7898:180"/>
or appurtenances of our perſons. That which is
immediately next or linkt unto our perſon, is by
a more peculiar and ſoveraigne right our owne,
then any things whatſoever beſides wee do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe,
or are Lords of; be it Lands, goods or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
For whatſoever we poſſeſſe, being not thus
annexed unto our perſons, are but externalls, their
poſſeſſion is communicable, their propertie may
be ſo alienated, as others may make as good uſe
of them as wee doe. A man may be wronged in
every thing that is his owne, whereof he is by juſt
title poſſeſſed, but the wrongs done to a man in
externalls, doe not touch him ſo neerely, as the
wrongs done to his perſon, or to any part or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenance
of it.</p>
                  <p>12. That there is a true and reall diſtinction
betweene the natures and the perſons of men, or
betweene things which are our owne by union of
nature, or by union unto our perſons, may thus
be gathered. Every part of our nature is eyther a
part, or an appurtenance of our perſon: but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part or appurtenance of our perſon is not a
part of our nature. A man may ſuffer groſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
wrong without paine or dammage to any
part of his nature, without loſſe of any commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that could be made of that wherein he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
wrong, it being (in it ſelfe conſidered) unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of wrong. As in caſe ſome joynt or part of
a mans body be dead and withered, irrecoverably
deprived of ſenſe, of paine, of vitall motion: it
thereby ceaſeth to be a part of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but it therefore ceaſeth not to be an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7898:180"/>
or an appurtenance of his perſon. He that
ſhould disfigure, mangle, or otherwiſe handle ſuch
a dead number any otherwiſe then the party,
whoſe it is, were willing to have it handled, doth
wrong his perſon in a higher degree than if hee
mangled or maymed his live goods, or cattell: and
yet however he handle it, he puts the living party
to no paine, is being (as it is ſuppoſed) no naturall
or ſenſible part of his body, nor could it have
yeelded any commodity though it had been cut
off before it was disfigured. Offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of this nature
are not to be valued according to the excellency
of the phyſicall complexion or conſtitution of the
bodily part wounded or contumeliouſly handled,
but according to the excellency or dignity of the
partie whoſe fleſh or ſubſtance it is that is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or abuſed; whether it be an entire live part
of his nature, or an appendix only to his perſon,
as being a joynt or member in part maymed or
deprived of ſenſe before. Generally whether we
ſpeake of mens actions or ſufferings undertaken
for our behoofe, to the loſſe of bloud or limbes;
we are not to value the one or other ſo much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the phyſicall propertie, or naturall
worth of the member loſt or damnified, as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the dignity of the perſon which volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
undertaketh ſuch hard ſervices for us. And
thus wee are to rate aſwell the indignities and
paines which our Saviour ſuffered in body by the
Jews or Roman ſoldiers, as the anguiſh of his ſoule
in that great conflict with the powers of darknes,

conſtitution, or exquiſite purity of his ſoule, but
according to the ineſtimable dignity of his divine
perſon, of which, aſwell his immaculate ſoule, as
his undefiled bodie were no naturall parts, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances
only.</p>
                  <p>13 Laſtly, that proper bloud, wherewith God
is ſaid to have purchaſed the Church, was the
bloud of the ſonne of God, the ſecond perſon
in Trinity, after a more peculiar manner then it
was the bloud either of God the Father, or of God
the holy ghoſt. It was the bloud of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or of God the holy Ghoſt, as all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are, by common right of creation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
It was the bloud of God the ſon alone
by perſonall union. If this ſonne of God, and high
Prieſt of our ſoules had offered any other ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for us then himſelfe, or the manhood thus
perſonally united unto him, his offering could not
have beene ſatisfactory; becauſe in al other things
created, the Father and the holy Ghoſt had the
ſame right or intereſt which the ſonne had; hee
could not have offered any thing to them which
were not as truely theirs as his. Onely the ſeede
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or fruit of the virgins womb which
he aſſumed into the Godhead, was by the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made ſo his owne, as it was not theirs, his
owne by incommunicable propertie of perſonall
union. By reaſon of this incommunicable proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the womans ſeede, the ſonne of God might
truely have ſaid unto his Father [Lord thou haſt
purchaſed the Church yet with my bloud:] but
ſo could not the man Chriſt Jeſus ſay unto the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7898:181"/>
ſonne of God, [Lord thou haſt payd the ranſome
for the ſinnes of the world, yet with my bloud,
not with thine owne.]</p>

ſumme or extract of all that hath in this Treatiſe
beene delivered. This is the foundation of faith
as Chriſtian, the radicall article of Chriſtian The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie.
It followes in our Apoſtles Creede, that
<hi>this only ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus our Lord was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the holy Ghoſt, and borne of the Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
The name <hi>Ieſus</hi> was given him at his circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and comes there to be handled. So was not
the name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but as often as the Evangeliſts ſo
inſtyle him before his reſurrection from the dead,
it is by way of anticipation; for he was made <hi>Lord</hi>
and <hi>Chriſt</hi> at his aſcenſion into heaven, though
annointed to his propheticall office at his baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
(from which time he did declare himſelfe by
word and deed to be the Prince of Prophets) yet
not then conſecrated, much leſſe admitted to the
function or exerciſe of his everlaſting Prieſthood:
not then enthronized King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords: theſe royall titles were accompliſhed in
his reſurrection and aſcenſion. The point for the
preſent to be handled is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how the conception and
birth of the ſonne of God, the Lord God of Iſrael,
was foretold or foreſhadowed, and how accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
for the ſubſtance, how manifeſted by the
ſignes of the time, or circumſtances concomitant.</p>
                  <p>2 The conception and birth of the ſonne of
God, with other myſteries which concerne his
perſon and offices, were purpoſely foretold and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7898:182"/>
forepictured from the fall of our firſt parents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the ſacred Canon of the old Teſtament was
finiſhed;<note place="margin">Cap. 31</note> yet not foretold, or forepictured in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame meaſure, or after the ſame manner, in every
age of this long ſucceſſion. The firſt predictions
or repreſentations of theſe great myſteries were
aenigmaticall and implicit, but for the moſt part
unwrapped and branched in ſucceeding ages. The
later repreſentations beare the ſame proportions
to the moſt ancient, that maps of particular coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
beare unto more generall, or Chorographie
unto Geographie. In a map of the whole world
though accurately drawne, wee ſhall hardly finde
any exact proportion of theſe Britiſh Iſlands, no
ſuch diſtinct evidences of the ſeverall provinces
of this Iſland, as are uſually repreſented in a map
of Europe of the ſame quantitie. And it were in
vaine to ſeek ſo diſtinct a ſurvey of every Engliſh
ſhire or County in a map of Europe, as wee have
in our ordinary maps of England: But if wee deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to Chorographical platformes of every ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſhire, every one that knows how to uſe them,
may find the diſtinct place of his birth, breeding,
or dwelling. The firſt and moſt generall map of
myſteries concerning Chriſt, or of the Word to
come, is that often mentioned <hi>Geneſis</hi> 3. ver. 15.
<hi>I will put enmity betweene thy ſeede and her ſeede,</hi> &amp;c.
Yet without ſome further dilatations, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of this promiſe made by the Prophets,
it were impoſſible for the wit of man to diſcover
any true proportion of thoſe great myſteries
which the Evangeliſts relate, although all of them
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7898:183"/>
were conteyned in this, as in their firſt head or
fountain, or as moſt Chorographicall deſcriptions
are, in the Coſmographie of the Univerſe. Very
probable it is, that our mother <hi>Hevah</hi> did from
this promiſe conceive, that the ſeede promiſed
ſhould be <hi>Vir Iehovah,</hi> a man which ſhould be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Lord God. But queſtionleſſe ſhe did not
imagine, much leſſe beleeve, that this man, the
Lord, ſhould be conceived and brought forth of
a pure Virgin, for ſuch ſhe her ſelfe was not when

could the parents of <hi>Noah</hi> imagine that their ſon
ſhould be ſo conceived or borne, although (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good Authors thinke) they miſtooke him as
<hi>Hevah</hi> did <hi>Cain,</hi> for the promiſed womans ſeede;
preſume they might without preſumption, that
the promiſed <hi>Meſsias</hi> was to proceed from <hi>him</hi>
according to the fleſh, but ſeeing <hi>Noah</hi> had more
ſonnes than one, it was not to him or to others
then living diſtinctly repreſented, from what
branch of his ſtock he ſhould proceed; untill <hi>Noah</hi>
by divine inſtinct or inſpiration did bequeath
the birthright unto <hi>Sem;</hi> but <hi>Sem</hi> had many ſons,
and his poſterity was great, and it is not probable
that <hi>Sem</hi> himſelfe did know from which of them
the promiſed ſeede ſhould iſſue, untill the bleſſing
which <hi>Noah</hi> beſtowed on <hi>Sem</hi> was by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
(and perhaps by <hi>Sem</hi> as Gods Embaſſador)
beſtowed on <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto whom the former
myſtery concerning the incarnation of the ſonne
of God, was more diſtinctly repreſented both by
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7898:183"/>
word and fact, then it had beene to any of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.
Hee doubtleſſe did conceive, that the
<hi>ſeed</hi> in whom all the Nations of the world were
to be bleſſed, ſhould be God, the ſonne of God,
be borne after a more miraculous manner then
his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> had beene: but <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed by
<hi>Iſaac</hi> became more numerous then any mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his time had beene, and was divided into
twelue Tribes. In which of theſe twelue Tribes
the promiſed ſeed was to be ſought for, was as
uncertaine, and as undiſtinct, as if wee ſhould
ſeeke for the <hi>topographie</hi> of ſome particular Town
of England in an ordinary Map of Europe. <hi>Iacob</hi>
on his death-bed points at his parentage in this
generality, <hi>(Geneſis 49. ver. 10.)</hi> that hee was to
ſpring out of <hi>Iudah.</hi> But God by his ſpirit directs
the Church to ſeeke him in the Genealogie of
<hi>Ieſſe</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in the Land of <hi>Iudea. David</hi>
himſelfe had a diſtinct repreſentation, that hee
ſhould not be his ſonne only, but that hee who
then was his Lord, ſhould become his ſonne, and
be made <hi>Prieſt</hi> after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech;</hi>
and no doubt but <hi>David</hi> conceived withall, that
this his Lord and <hi>ſonne</hi> ſhould be borne of a <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi>
not begotten by any man; for thus much
the holy Spirit, which ſpake to him, hath literally
charactred unto us in that ſpeech, <hi>Pſa. 132. ver. 11.
Of the fruite of thy wombe will I ſet upon thy
throne, &amp;c.</hi> The ſame myſterie or the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of this promiſe made to <hi>David,</hi> is, more
diſtinctly unfolded by <hi>Iſaiah Cap. 7. ver.</hi> 14. The
Lord himſelfe will give you a ſigne, <hi>Behold the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7898:184"/>
virgin ſhall conceive, &amp;c.</hi> But whether this long
expected ſonne of <hi>David</hi> ſhould proceede from
<hi>Salomon</hi> or any of his race, or from the race or
linage of ſome other ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> this was
not repreſented (for ought wee read) either unto
<hi>David</hi> or <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> and ſure the Author of the 89.
<hi>Pſalme,</hi> (whether <hi>David</hi> or rather ſome later Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet)
was neſcient of this particular, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
or extinction of <hi>Solomons</hi> line was (I

and the accompliſhment of their Propheſies (of

<hi>Ieremiah</hi> deſcribes the place of his
conception more plainely, yet in a farre greater
generality, That hee was to be conceived in the
Land of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as it was divided from <hi>Iudah.</hi>
Yet haply if <hi>Herod</hi> had asked his Scribes and
others, where the King of the Jewes was to be
conceived, it is queſtionable whether they could
ſo clearely have reſolved him of the place of his
conception, as they did certifie him of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
place of his birth. This they learned out
of the Prophet <hi>Micah, Chap. 5. ver.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>3. That of our Apoſtle <hi>Hebrewes 1. ver.</hi> 1. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
verified in reſpect of the article now in

                     </gap>, his very
conception, his birth and actions, as well as the
words uttered by him, have their plaine, and full
language, and if wee take them as ſet downe by

this may referre either to the time of <hi>Iohn

for untill the time of <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverie
out of Egypt, the moneth wherein <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi>
was conceived (which anſweres for the paſt part
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7898:185"/>

was created.<note place="margin">Cap. 32</note> The moneth Abib (which anſwers
unto March with us) became obſervable to the
Iſraelites from their deliverance in that moneth

accompt the firſt in order. In the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the conception of our Lord and Saviour

ſhalt conceive in thy wombe, and bring forth a ſonne,
and ſhalt call his name Ieſus: Hee ſhall be great, and
ſhall be called the ſonne of the higheſt, and the Lord
God ſhall give unto him the throne of his Father Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
When the Angell ſaid, <hi>He ſhall be great, and
his mother ſhall call his name</hi> JESVS, it is implied,
that as yet he was not great, that he had not the
beginning of that greatneſſe which is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.
And may it not be as rightly implied, that
when hee ſaith, <hi>Hee ſhall be called the ſonne of the
higheſt,</hi> as yet he was not the ſonne of the higheſt,
but firſt to brooke the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and then
firſt to be <hi>made</hi> and called the ſonne of God, when
he was become great, and had received the throne
of his Father <hi>David.</hi> But it is not without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7898:186"/>
that the Angell ſaith not, <hi>Hee ſhall be
the ſonne of the higheſt,</hi> nor doth hee ſay, that the
bleſſed Virgin his Mother ſhould beſtow this
name upon him, as <hi>ſhee</hi> did the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
The intent and meaning of the holy Ghoſt in this
place, is, that this fruit of the Virgins womb, who
was to be named <hi>Ieſus</hi> by his mother, from his
circumciſion, ſhould be called the ſonne of the
<hi>higheſt,</hi> not in regard of his future greatneſſe as
man, or as he was the promiſed <hi>ſonne</hi> of <hi>David,</hi>
but by reaſon of his peculiar <hi>aſſumption,</hi> or union
into the perſon of the ſonne of <hi>God,</hi> who was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
Lord before he was conceived, and was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
to be declared the ſonne of God by his
reſurrection from the dead. At which time and
not before, hee tooke the eſpeciall government
of that Kingdome upon him, which had ſo often
beene promiſed to the ſonne of <hi>David.</hi> This
meaning of the holy Ghoſt, the Evangeliſt doth
open unto us, <hi>ver. 33. Hee ſhall raigne over the houſe
of Iacob for ever, and of his Kingdome there ſhall be
no end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Unleſſe this <hi>holy</hi> of <hi>holyes,</hi> who was now to
be borne of the bleſſed virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> had beene
the ſonne of God before this time, hee ſhould in
reaſon be called the ſonne of the holy Ghoſt. For
unto the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> demanding <hi>how this ſhould
be ſeeing ſhee know not a man,</hi> ver. 34. The Angel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, &amp;c.</hi> An
Emphaticall expreſſion of that which we beleeve
in the Creede, <hi>That the holy Ghoſt ſhould worke his
conception.</hi> Now hee who is Author of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7898:186"/>
of any perſon, which before ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
had no exiſtence, is in propriety of ſpeech
to be reputed the Father of the party or perſon
conceived. But this very perſon whom we now
adore under that name or title of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus our
Lord,</hi> being before all Worlds the true and only
ſonne of God, albeit the holy Ghoſt was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of his conception as man (a more principall
cauſe and Author of his conception, then any
mortall Father is of his mortall ſonne:) yet was
not the fruit of the virgins womb to be reputed
the ſonne of the holy Ghoſt, but of him alone
who was the true and only Father of that <hi>perſon,</hi>
unto whom the fruit of the Uirgins womb was
by the operation of the holy Ghoſt perſonally
united. The holy Ghoſt was not then the cauſe
or Author of any new perſon, but onely eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
or betroathed the humane nature of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
(which before had no actuall exiſtence) unto him
who was the <hi>ſonne</hi> of God from eternity. Now
not he that gives, but hee that takes the ſpouſe
given in marriage, is the true huſband. And the
ſpouſe ſo taken, from her eſpouſall, becomes the
daughter not of him that gives her in marriage,
but of the Father of her huſband, with whom
ſhee is now made one fleſh. Thus God the Father
(by this eſpouſall thus wrought by the holy
Ghoſt,) becomes the Father of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> which was now united unto his
<hi>ſonne,</hi> after another manner then before hee had
beene, of any man; and after another manner
then the holy Ghoſt was, or is the Father of the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:7898:187"/>
man <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Chriſt then as God and man is
the only ſonne of God the Father: The ſame
<hi>Ieſus</hi> only as man, is the ſonne of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That the promiſed Meſſias was, according
to the Prophecies, to be the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> is
evident: but by what line all deſcent hee was to
be the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> or by what legall right the
Kingdome of <hi>David</hi> was derived unto him, is not
without queſtion amongſt Chriſtians. <hi>David,</hi> we

and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> by legall right did ſucceed
him in his Kingdome. And <hi>Solomons</hi> heires or
Succeſſours by bodily deſcent had as firme a title
to the Kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> as any other Kings
or Monarchs have to the Crownes and dignities
of their Anceſtors. But whether <hi>Solomons</hi> line by
bodily deſcent, were utterly extinguiſhed before
the conception or birth of our Saviour, is a point
neither much debated, nor agreed upon by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.
If it were extinguiſhed before that time,
yet <hi>Davids</hi> line did not determine with <hi>Solomons.</hi>
And for this reaſon (haply) our Saviour is inſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>the ſonne of David,</hi> not ſo
of <hi>Solomon;</hi> albeit <hi>Solomon was</hi> as true a ſhadow
of him as King, as <hi>David</hi> had beene: And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
Kingdome and raigne a fairer map of his
Kingdome then <hi>Davids</hi> was. And though our
Saviours intermediate Anceſtors, according to
the fleſh from <hi>David</hi> downward, were many, as
S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and more then S. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates: Yet he
did immediatly ſucceede <hi>David</hi> in the Kingdom.
For ſo by the law of moſt Countries, <hi>in caſe</hi> the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7898:187"/>
elder brethrens ſonnes or iſſues faile, the third or
fourth brother ſucceeds as lawfull heire, not unto
his elder brothers, or their children, but to their
Grandfather or firſt donor. Many may be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
heires unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are no imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Succeſſours in lineall deſcent. That <hi>Solomon</hi>
and his line had no ſuch perpetuity beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them by vertue of Gods Covenant with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
as that it might not determine before the
promiſed ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> was exhibited, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that Covenant (as it is exemplified by
the Author of the 89. Pſalme) puts out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
<hi>I have found David my ſervant, with my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oyle have I annointed him.</hi> ver. 20. <hi>He ſhall cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of
my ſalvation. Alſo I will make him my firſt borne;
higher then the Kings of the earth: my mercy will I
keepe for him evermore: and my Covenant ſhall ſtand
faſt with him. His ſeed alſo will I make to endure for
ever, and his throne as the dayes of Heaven,</hi> ver. 26,
27, 28, 29. This laſt he ſpeakes of <hi>Davids ſeede</hi> as
of one, not of his <hi>ſeedes</hi> as of many. For ſo it
followes, ver. 30. <hi>If his children forſake my Law,
and walk not in my judgements, if they breake my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
and keepe not my Commandements; then will I
viſite their tranſgreſsions with the rod, and their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
with ſtripes.</hi> This viſitation with rods and
ſtripes imports more then fatherly chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
true and reall puniſhments. Yea, heavie
judgements upon <hi>Davids</hi> other children accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their deſerts. None are utterly exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Gods heavie diſpleaſure, beſides the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:7898:188"/>
promiſed <hi>ſeede,</hi> or <hi>Davids ſonne</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, whoſe
prerogative is in the next words reſerved by
oath, <hi>Never the loſſe my loving kindneſſe will I not
take from David, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſſe to faile:
my covenant will I not breake, nor alter the thing that
is gone out of my lips,</hi> ver. 33. This is in effect, as if
he had ſaid, however <hi>Davids</hi> other ſonnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
me, I will not repent of that loving kindneſſe
which I promiſed to him; it ſhall be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Davids</hi> ſeede; for in reſpect of things altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or reverſible, whether promiſed for the good
of men, or threatned for their woe, God is uſually
ſaid to repent, but to whatſoever hee ſweares, of
that he never repents. Every event ratified by oath
is either unalterable or irreverſible. <hi>The Lord hath
ſworne,</hi> ſaith <hi>David Pſal. 110. and will not repent,</hi>
that is, he will not change or alter that which hee
hath promiſed. To alter that which was only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
but without oath, is in the phraſe of the
holy Ghoſt (as we uſually render the originall) to
faile or breake Covenant, that is in more proper
language, to reverſe a bleſſing promiſed. Hence it
is added in the next verſe of the 89. Pſalme, <hi>[Once
have I ſworne by my holineſſe, that I will not lye unto</hi>
David] that is, I will not make void my covenant.
<hi>His ſeeds ſhall endure for ever, and his throne as the
Sunne before mee. It ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever as the
Moone, and as a faithfull witneſſe in Heaven.</hi> This is
that throne, and that Kingdome which the Angel
<hi>(Luke 1. 32, 33.)</hi> foretold <hi>ſhould</hi> be given unto the
ſeed or fruit of the Virgins womb. As for <hi>Davids</hi>
other children, or for <hi>Solomons</hi> race, their title to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:7898:188"/>
the temporary Crowne of <hi>David</hi> was at the firſt
but conditional or rather mutable: for every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall
eſtate preſuppoſeth a ſtate in being, but
a ſtate mutable, or reverſible. Such was the ſtate of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> or the heires of his bodie, aſwell unto
the kingdome of Judah as of Iſrael. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Iſrael they utterly loſt in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent.
The next <hi>Quaere</hi> is, whether this their eſtate
unto Judah or Iſrael, which was by originall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
reverſible, were <hi>de facto</hi> utterly reverſed, and
the Covenant (as it concerned them) finally can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled.</p>
                  <p>4 And of this <hi>Quaere</hi> the branches are two,
firſt, whether <hi>Salomons</hi> line were utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
before the returne of <hi>Iudah</hi> from the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh
Captivitie, or in any age before the ſon
of God, and the promiſed ſeed of <hi>David</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in the fleſh? The ſecond, whether in caſe
the utter extinguiſhment of <hi>Salomons</hi> line be a
point doubtfull, or by any authentick Author or
record indeterminable; This line, were not in the
ſame deſperate caſe, for recovering the Kingdom,
that <hi>Elies</hi> race was for regaining the Prieſthood,
from which it was by ſolemne oath depoſed?
That <hi>Solomons</hi> line was utterly excluded from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> the
Jews and Chriſtians for the moſt part agree: And
the tenour of that terrible ſentence againſt <hi>Ieco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah</hi>
(according to the principles acknowledged
by both) will inferre no leſſe. <hi>As I live, ſaith the
Lord, though</hi> Coniah <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Jehoiakim <hi>King
of Iudah were the ſignet upon my right hand, yet would
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:7898:189"/>
I pluck thee thence: And I will give thee into the
hand of them that ſeeke thy life, and into the hand of
them whoſe face thou feareſt, even into the hand of</hi>
Nebuchadnezzar <hi>King of Babylon, and into the hand
of the Caldeans. And I will caſt thee out, and thy
mother that bare thee, into another Country where yee
were not borne, and there ſhall ye dye. But to the Land,
whereunto they deſire to returne, thither ſhall they not
returne. Is this man</hi> Coniah <hi>a deſpiſed broken Idoll?
Is hee a veſſell wherein is no pleaſure? Wherefore are
they caſt out, hee and his ſeed, and are caſt into a Land
which they know not? O earth, earth, heare the
word of the Lord, Thus ſaith the Lord, Write ye this
man childleſs, a man that ſhall not proſper in his dayes:
for no man of his ſeed ſhall proſper, ſitting upon the
throne of David, and ruling any more in Iudah.
Ierem.</hi> 22. 24, 25, 26, &amp;c. This laſt clauſe is (to
mee) a concludent proofe, that the man Chriſt
Jeſus was not of <hi>Ieconiahs</hi> ſeed, becauſe he was to
<hi>ſit upon the throne of David, and to proſper;</hi> yea, to
be the fountaine of all proſperitie to Prince and
people: And hee that will avouch our Lord and
Saviour to have been of the ſeed of <hi>Ieconiah,</hi> will
hardly be able to <hi>fend off</hi> that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction, which
his aſſertion directly includes, not onely to the
Angels promiſe <hi>(Luk. 1. 33.)</hi> but unto the Prophet
<hi>Ieremiah, cap. 23. ver. 5, 6. Behold, the day is come,
ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto David a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
branch, and a King ſhall raigne and [proſper] and
ſhall execute judgment and juſtice in the earth. In his
dayes</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall dwell ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
&amp;c. The man Chriſt Jeſus is in this place (and

of the roote of <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> but no where a branch of

did determine in <hi>Ieconiah,</hi> whom his Uncle <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
did ſucceed for a while in the kingdome of
Judah, but with worſe ſucceſſe. For <hi>Ezekiels</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncement
againſt him, and the Crowne of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
was no leſſe terrible then this of <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
againſt <hi>Coniah: And thou prophane wicked Prince of
Iſrael, whoſe day is come, when iniquitie ſhall have an
end: Thus ſaith the Lord God, Remove the Diadem,

him that is low, and abaſe him that is high. I will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,

                  <p>5 Some of the Prieſtly line after this peoples
returne from Babylon did take upon them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
princely authority, (as the <hi>Maccabees)</hi> but
with more honour for a while, then with good
ſucceſſe for poſterity. Others afterwards did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the like, but were put by it, yet permitted
or authorized by the Romanes to exerciſe the
Prieſtly function, ſome of them executed for their
mutinous aſpiring to the Crowne. Laſtly, when
they became Competitors for the royall dignity,
it was collated upon <hi>Antipater,</hi> and from him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

was borne. But though <hi>Herod</hi> did exerciſe
royall juriſdiction over Judea, aſwel as over other
neighbouring provinces, yet was hee not created
King over Judea; this was no part of his royall
Title beſtowed upon him by <hi>Antonius.</hi> The firſt
ſolemne authorized Title of King of Judah,
from the captivitie of King <hi>Ieconiah</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi>
was that inſcription written upon our Saviours
Croſſe, written by <hi>Pilates</hi> command, ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily,
that the Jews could not get a change or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:7898:191"/>
Pilate</hi> I take it did not in this inſcription intend
the ſcoffe or ſcorn of our Saviour, or of the Jewiſh
Nation, but only the ſtyle, or Title of the crime
for which our Saviour was endited: Hee neither
affirmed nor denyed him to be the King of the
Jews, but that which the world might conceive
was written in jeſt or in ſcoffe, the God of Iſrael
made good in earneſt, by making this Jeſus whom
<hi>Pilate</hi> and the Jews had crucified, <hi>both Lord and

                  <p>6 <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his ſuppoſed Father (in all<note n="*" place="margin">Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our Saviour at his death would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his mother unto S. <hi>Iohns</hi> care, but unto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note> probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie)
was dead before this time of our Saviours

ſo that the whole right unto the Crowne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
which either or both of them had, was by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
deſcent devolved upon this dying man, who
after his great humiliation was to be more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exalted, and in him alone that which was ſaid
by the prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was accompliſhed, <hi>exalt
him that is low, and abaſe him that is high.</hi> And yet
the ſame Prophecy had beene at ſeverall times
verified, or fulfilled in part before. And firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in <hi>Ieconiah,</hi> who after the debaſing of <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
his uncle by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> was exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
other Captives by<note n="*" place="margin">2 Kings 25. 27, 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> ſonne
<hi>Evil-Merodach.</hi> And againe more punctually (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the prophets meaning) in <hi>Zorobabel,</hi>
and others of <hi>Davids</hi> line, after <hi>Solomons</hi> line was
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7898:191"/>
either extinguiſhed or depoſed; but more fully
afterwards in the bleſſed Virgin, as ſhee expreſſes
her thankfulneſſe for it in her ſweet ſong, <hi>Luke 1.
52. Hee hath put downe the mightie from their ſeate,
and hath exalted the humble and the meeke.</hi> Whether
the bleſſed Virgin in her owne right, or <hi>Ioſeph</hi> her
huſbands while he lived, were the next heire unto
the Crowne of <hi>David,</hi> is diſputed by others, unto
whoſe determinations I have nothing to ſay in
this place. Whatſoever right either or both of
them had, was (I take it) derived from <hi>David</hi> by
<hi>Nathan,</hi> not by <hi>Solomon</hi> or his ſucceſſors. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and
<hi>Mary</hi> were heires to the kingdome which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
did enjoy, though not of his ſeede: and ſo
were <hi>Salathiel,</hi> and <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> from whom they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
deſcended.</p>
                  <p>7 But whether her ſonne ſhould be the lawfull
heire of <hi>David,</hi> was no part of the bleſſed virgins
doubt or queſtion to the Angel. But how ſhee
ſhould conceive a ſonne according to the purport
of the Angels promiſe, that ſhe queſtions, <hi>Luke 1.
24. Then ſaid Mary, how ſhall this be, ſeeing I know
not a man?</hi> To omit the idle fancies of ſome, who
would hence collect that the bleſſed virgin had
vowed chaſtitie in ſingle life, as if <hi>I know not a man,</hi>
had beene as much, as <hi>I am reſolved never to know
man;</hi> The truth is, that however ſhee was at this
time eſpouſed unto <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> yet the marriage was
not to be conſummated til ſome competent ſpace
after the eſpouſals, within which time ſhee did
rightly apprehend the conception foretold her
by the Angell was to bee accompliſhed, or rather
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7898:192"/>
from the very time of this preſent dialogue; and
hence ſhee demands, how it was poſſible, that ſhe
ſhould inſtantly conceive, ſeeing ſhe knew not a
man; yet are not theſe words of diſtruſt, they have
no tincture of ſuch incredulitie or ſlow beliefe, as
wee finde taxed in <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Zachariah</hi> father to
<hi>Iohn Baptiſt;</hi> yet were both <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
the wife of <hi>Zachariah</hi> types or ſhadowes of the
bleſſed virgins miraculous conceiving. So were
<hi>Hannah</hi> and <hi>Sampſons</hi> mother. The conception of
all their ſonnes (and they were reſpectively their
only ſonnes) was wonderfull and without the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
courſe of nature; peculiar bleſſings of him
<hi>that maketh the barren to be a joyfull mother of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> parents
had beene petitioners to the Lord of life for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and had their petitions ratifyed, one by the
Preiſt, and others by the Angel of the Lord. But
<hi>Sampſon</hi> was promiſed to <hi>Manoahs</hi> wife by the
Angel of the Lord, without any petition on her
part made to this purpoſe, and promiſed withall
to be a deliverer of his people from the Philiſtins.
And in this particular, or in the maner of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
Annunciation, the birth of <hi>Sampſon</hi> was
a moſt lively type of the birth of our Saviour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
this conception of <hi>Sampſon</hi> was not ſo ſtrange
as that of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> That <hi>Sarah</hi> in her decrepit age
ſhould conceive a ſonne, was a matter incredible,
and unparalleld in any age of the world before or
ſince, yet not properly miraculous. <hi>Through faith,</hi>
(ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Heb. 11. 11.) Sarah received
ſtrength to conceive ſeede, and was delivered of a child
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7898:192"/>
when ſhe was paſt age</hi> (either for conceiving ſeede,
or for bringing it forth conceived, yet both ſhee
did) <hi>becauſe ſhe judged him faithfull who had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
The faith by which ſhee conceived ſtrength
was the gift of God, and the ſtrength which ſhee
conceived by this faith, was ſuch a wondrous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as theſe gifts which are attributed to the
faith of miracles. But <hi>Sarah</hi> having received this
ſtrength by faith, the conception was according
to the courſe of nature, <hi>it was with her after the
manner of women;</hi> not ſo with the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who
became bleſſed by beleeving the Angel: She did
not receive ſtrength to conceive ſeede; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of thoſe things which were foretold by
the Angel were from the Lord himſelfe.<note n="*" place="margin">

ſhee had beleeved, ſhee had not beene eſtabliſhed;</hi> yet
her beleefe did not cooperate with the effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.
That was the immediate worke of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt by marying part of her ſubſtance to the
perſon of the Sonne of God, after a manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to her. There was not firſt a marriage,
and then a conception, nor a conception firſt and

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is well obſerved by divers good wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that S. <hi>Mathew</hi> begins the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie
of our Saviour Chriſt not from
<hi>Adam,</hi> where S. <hi>Luke (ordine retrogrado)</hi>
ends it: but <hi>(ordine recto)</hi> from <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe
the Covenant of the promiſed ſeede was firſt by
oath eſtabliſhed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> line, and afterwards
more particularly in <hi>Davids,</hi> whoſe ſonne and
heire our Saviour was, though ſonne by adoption,
or next heire in reverſion unto <hi>Ieconiah,</hi> who was
the laſt (as theſe Authors think) of <hi>Solomons</hi> line:
the laſt at leaſt that could pretend unto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>David.</hi> And though it be ſaid in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Genealogie according to S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> that
<hi>Ieconiah</hi> begat <hi>Salathiel;</hi> yet this cannot be meant
of a naturall begetting, but of a civil. He was the
ſon of <hi>Salathiel</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe as the holy Ghoſt
uſeth in the ſecond Pſalme, ver. 7. <hi>Thou art my ſon,
this day have I begotten thee:</hi> to wit, unto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Iſrael; if this place be literally to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

ſonne from eternity, but his firſt begotten
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:7898:193"/>
from the dead,<note place="margin">Cap. 33.</note> and ſo made King of Kings and
Lord of Lords. But of theſe points in their due
place.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>The birth of Ieſus Chriſt</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Mathew,</hi>
chap. 1. ver. 18. &amp;c.) <hi>was on this wiſe. When as his
mother Mary was eſpouſed to Ioſeph, before they came
together, ſhee was found with child of the holy Ghoſt.
Then Ioſeph her husband being a juſt man, and not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to make her a publique example, was minded to
put her away privily. But while he thought on theſe
things, behold the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him
in a dreame, ſaying, Ioſeph thou ſonne of David, feare
not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is
conceived in her is of the holy Ghoſt. And ſhee ſhall
bring forth a ſonne, and thou ſhalt call his name Ieſus,
for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes.</hi> In this
narration ſome ſpeciall paſſages are expreſſely the
ſame with the former related out of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> as
that our Saviour was conceived by the holy
Ghoſt of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or in the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
So S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> to denote that the bleſſed Virgin
was no agent in this conception, ſaith, <hi>that which
is conceived in her is of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Chap. 1. ver. 20.</p>
                  <p>This, I take it, is of the ſame character with
that meſſage of the Angel unto the bleſſed virgin
her ſelfe in S. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. chap. ver. 31. <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Behold thou ſhalt conceive in thy womb,</hi> not

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>thou ſhalt be with child and bring forth a
ſonne;</hi> as the Angel ſaid unto the wife of <hi>Manoah
(Iudges 13. 3.)</hi> and to others which beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
or courſe of nature did conceive and
bring forth ſonnes of promiſe. Both Evangeliſts
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7898:194"/>
againe expreſſely tell us, that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was
eſpouſed to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> before the
Angel Gabriel did bring this meſſage unto her;
hereby giving us to underſtand that the works
which the Divell had wrought in our nature
ſhould in this particular (as in many others) be
undone by God, after the ſame way and method
that they were done by this his enemie. The
firſt woman we know did conceive ſinne, whileſt
ſhee was a virgin, at leaſt before ſhee knew her
huſband <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the onely man then on
Earth: for ſhe was a virgin eſpouſed from her firſt
Creation. This firſt woman conceived death by
beleeving the Serpent, and practiſing according
to his Counſaile, before ſhee had conſulted her
huſband. The bleſſed virgin did conceive the
Lord of life by beleeving the Angel Gabriels
meſſage without conſent or adviſe of her betroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
Huſband, who at the firſt ſuſpected her loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie,
but afterwards (admoniſhed by the holy
Ghoſt) did admit of her as his lawfull conſort, did
permit her to enjoy all the priviledges of a wife,
and her ſonne the priviledges of his only ſonne
and heire, without any further knowledge of her
as his wife,</p>
                  <p>3 S. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us the Chronologie of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
birth more diſtinctly then S. <hi>Mathew</hi> doth;
<hi>It came to paſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in thoſe daies, that there went
out a decree from Caeſar Auguſtus, that all the world
ſhould be taxed,</hi> or <hi>booked.</hi> Chap. 2. ver. 1. The exact
year fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the giving of the law, or from the return
of Judah from Captivitie, neither of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7898:194"/>
do meddle with in the ſtory of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
birth; and for this reaſon. I omit them. The
other circumſtances concerning the time wherein
(according to the Romane account) hee was
borne, with the place, were more uſefull for us;
becauſe theſe were, or might have beene, knowne
to all other Nations, not to the Jews only, out of
the Roman Annals. It is agreed by all, that Jeſus
was borne in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and in the
dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> the King. If any be deſirous to
know the exact yeare, wherein he was borne, the
beſt rule for his direction in this ſearch muſt be to
find out the time of that taxe or inrolement, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by S. <hi>Luke</hi> Chap. 2. ver. 1, 2, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now this taxing or <hi>inrolling</hi> was firſt made
when <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Governour of Syria, and that
(as all agree) was either in the beginning of the
42, or in the latter end of the 41, of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Yet
whether this taxing or inrollement of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
capable of ſuch inrollement, were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
or intended before by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> though firſt
put in execution whileſt <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Governour
of Syria, may admit ſome doubt or queſtion: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
wee are to calculate the time of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
birth from the time in which this decree
was put in execution throughout Judea, not from
the time of the firſt deſigne, or intention of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
to have ſuch a taxe or inrolement of all
that were Subjects to the Romane Empire.</p>
                  <p>4 The Spaniſh Nation as well for their civil, as
Eccleſiaſtick Acts did for a long time after they
became Chriſtians, uſe a Computation of yeares
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7898:195"/>
different from all other Chriſtian States or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
For all beſides them (as farre as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved)
begin their Computation from our Lords
incarnation or birth, which was at the ſame time
that this decree of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was put in execution
through Judea. The Spaniards begun their <hi>Aera</hi>
(ſo they call their computation) ſomes 27 yeares
more or leſſe before this time, and as ſundry of
their ancient writers think from that time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> did firſt reſolve upon this taxing and
inrolling of all the families under his juriſdiction,
and that (as they alleage) was firſt thought on, and
ingroſſed at <hi>Tarracone</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> after he had fully
ſubdued the <hi>Cantabrians</hi> and others which had
revolted from him in Spaine.</p>
                  <p>5 But this moſt probable opinion of many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
writers (as others of like nature uſually do)
ſuffers ſome praejudice by impertinent and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
allegations ſought out for the confirmation
of it. <q>Firſt, the writers take it as granted, that the
decree ſet forth by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in Spaine, was for
raiſing a generall <hi>taxe</hi> or <hi>tribute</hi> throughout all
his Dominions, that this tribute was to be paid
in braſſe, a currant coine amongſt the Romanes,
aſwell for the payment of Soldiers, as for the
diſcharge of civil contracts, or mulcts wherein
they were condemned.</q> And from this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which will not be granted them) theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
conjecture that the word <hi>Aera</hi> tooke its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
Hence they call this decree of <hi>Auguſtus, aerea
conſtitutio,</hi> as if the word <hi>Aera</hi> which (in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
is the computation of times or yeares,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:7898:195"/>
were the plurall, (though not warrantable by
<hi>Priſcian)</hi> of the Latine <hi>Aes,</hi> afterwards by common
uſe made a noune ſingular. But this ſuppoſition
it ſelfe, [that the <gap reason="foreign">

Antiquarie, and Chronicler unto <hi>Charles</hi> the
fift. And if his obſervations faile not the Romanes
did not receive their Tribute or Taxes either in
braſſe or gold, but in ſilver only. And becauſe the
impoſition of Tribute or Taxe is alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
to conquered Provinces or people, it is
an opinion in <hi>Sepulveda</hi> his judgement voyd of
probability, that the Spaniards ſhould begin their
computation of time from ſuch a diſtaſtfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
but rather from the immunities or priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did beſtow upon that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For ſo the Jews begin their <hi>Aera,</hi> or compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of time from their joyfull deliverance out
of Egypt, and from the reſtauration by <hi>Cyrus</hi> and
his Succeſſors; as we Chriſtians do ours from the
birth or conception of our Saviour Chriſt. As for
the Latine <hi>Aera,</hi> that <hi>Sepulveda</hi> firſt, and divers
other good writers after him, derive more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
from a miſtake of ancient writers not ſo
well acquainted as they might have beene, with
the abbreviations uſed in the date of publique ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Acts. Now the ancient Spaniards did date ſuch
Acts, (as wee do) by the raigne of our Kings; but
they of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> eſpecially after this manner
<hi>A. E. R. A;</hi> which ſtood for as much as <hi>Annus erat
Auguſti,</hi> (ſuppoſe 20, 30, 40, &amp;c.) But ſucceeding
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7898:196"/>
ages ignorant of this manner of writing, putting
the former ſcattered letters or ſyllables together,
made one entire word of them AERA, or AERA.</p>
                  <p>6. Yet to grant this learned Critick all that he
demands concerning this point, he erres no leſſe
(to my apprehenſion) in his peremptorie nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
inferences, then thoſe Writers whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes,
had done in their affirmative coniectures
concerning the originall of the word AERA, or
the ſuppoſed occaſion of it. His intended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
is that this AERA or computation of time
(which is peculiar to the <hi>Spaniards)</hi> hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> whereof S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeakes (were
it a taxe, or as <hi>Sepulveda</hi> will have it, an inrole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or booking of ſeverall Tribes or Families,
or of particular perſons in every Family) was
projected by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> immediately
after he had ſubdued his rebellious people there,
as preſuming that all the world beſides, (at leaſt
all that did yeeld obedience to the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire)
had beene quiet. But finding oppoſition in
other Countries beyond his expectation, he did
deferre the execution of the former decree untill
all were quiet within the Empire; untill bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
or neighbour Countries had profeſſed
their deſire of peace, or were admitted into a
league of amity with the Romanes. Now this
being done, the decree was firſt put in execution
throughout the whole Empire, at the time (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7898:196"/>
by S. <hi>Luke)</hi> of our Saviours birth. <hi>In thoſe
dayes</hi> (ſaith S. Luke) <hi>there went out a decree from
Caeſar Auguſtus, that all the world ſhould be taxed or
enrolled.</hi> Theſe words <hi>in thoſe dayes</hi> may either
punctually referre unto the dayes betweene our
Saviours conception and birth, or unto ſome
longer time betweene the firſt ſetting forth of
this decree or deſigne of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it. So S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the 2. verſe tells us, that
this taxing or inrolling was <hi>firſt made, when Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
was Governour of Syria, and all went to be taxed
or enrolled every one into his owne Citie.</hi> A thing, I
take it, neither neceſſary nor uſuall among the
Romanes for gathering of publique taxes or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
which might be done either at the place of
their dwellings, or in ſome chiefe Cities wherein
they were enjoyned to pay them. Other chriſtian
Nations begin their AERA or <hi>Computation</hi> of time
from the execution of this decree, which falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the time of our Saviours birth. The Spaniſh
Nation begun theirs from the firſt ſetting forth
or deſigne of this enrolement, which jumps with
the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his gracious Raigne over
them, and their admiſſion into his ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>7. The deferring of the execution of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
upon the occaſions mentioned by <hi>Gerunden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
and other Spaniſh Writers, is moſt agreeable
to the admirable courſe of Gods proceeding in
like caſes; whoſe pleaſure it is, to diſpoſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the projects of greateſt Princes, either quite
contrary to their intentions, or to divert them
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7898:197"/>
from the point at which they levell, unto the
punctuall fulfilling of his will revealed, or the
predictions of his Prophets. Had <hi>Auguſtus</hi> gone
on with his former purpoſe of inrolling all his
Subjects inſtantly after his victorie upon the
<hi>Cantabrians,</hi> there had beene no publique record
that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were of the linage of <hi>David;</hi>
The bleſſed Virgin being at that time according
to the common calculation of her yeares, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,
at leaſt uncapable of the eſpouſalls, or of
inrolement: For (as I take it) the Romanes did
not intend to inroll Children or Infants. Or if in
any yeares intercurrent betweene the beginning
of the Spaniſh AERA, &amp; that point of time which
S. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions, the former decree had taken
effect in <hi>Iudea,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> had not beene
brought forth in the Citie of <hi>David.</hi> For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had <hi>Ioſeph</hi> or <hi>Mary</hi> any other purpoſe or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to viſit <hi>Bethleem,</hi> beſides obedience to the
Emperours decree for their inrolement at the
prime ſeat of their Family, and perhaps for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome head-ſilver, or admiſſion money. But
God in his unſearchable wiſedome devolves the
execution of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> intention or purpoſe upon
this very point of time, to the end it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
upon authentique record, that both <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
the ſuppoſed Father, &amp; <hi>Mary</hi> the undoubted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our Lord and Saviour, (unto both whom
he was the true and lawfull heire) were of the
ſtock &amp; linage of <hi>David,</hi> and that this promiſed
ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> and branch of <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> which had
come into his mothers womb in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> might
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7898:197"/>
come into the world in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> where <hi>David</hi>
was borne, and <hi>Ieſſe</hi> dwelt. It is not probable
that the Romans did regiſter his birth there, yet
this the Lord would have authentically notified
unto the world by the repairing of the wiſe men
from the Eaſt to do their homage unto him there,
and that by the direction of the cheife. Prieſts and
Scribes being conſulted by <hi>Herod</hi> the King. Of the
compaſſe of time in which or of the place from
which theſe wiſe men came to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> in its due
time and place. But our Saviour was borne before
they ſet forth, and borne at <hi>Bethleem</hi> upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
mentioned by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and as S. <hi>Matthew</hi>
intimates, to the end, that the fulfilling of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
concerning his birth might be ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
recorded, as it might leave both Jew and
Gentile without excuſe. That <hi>Bethleem</hi> was the
place deſigned by God for the birth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Meſſias, was a notion cleare and evident
to the chiefe Prieſts and Scribes, at the time
when <hi>Herod</hi> conſulted them. For as then they
had conceived no prejudice againſt the perſon,
birth, or life of our Saviour: Nor had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of their heart wrought any Eclipſe in their
braines or underſtanding: they had their anſwer
<hi>ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nguem. When Herod the King</hi> (ſaith S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
<hi>heard this thing, hee was troubled, &amp;c. And
when hee had gathered all the chiefe Prieſts and
Scribes together</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, hee conſulted them (as
Oracles) where Chriſt ſhould be borne. <hi>And
they ſaid unto him,</hi> (without diſtraction, or ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of ſuffrages) <hi>in Bethleem of Iudaea. For thus
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7898:198"/>
it is written by the Prophet; And thou Bethleem in the
land of Iudah, art not the leaſt among the Princes of
Iudah. For out of thee ſhall come a Governour, that
ſhall rule my people Iſrael.</hi> It is not ſtrange if the
chiefe Prieſts and Scribes were ſo ready with
their anſwers unto <hi>Herod,</hi> ſeeing this prenotion
concerning the place of the Meſſiahs birth, was
knowne unto the vulgar people. <hi>Many of the
people</hi> (ſaith S. John) <hi>when they heard this ſaying,
ſaid, Of a truth this is the Prophet: Others ſaid,
This is the Chriſt. But ſome ſaid, Shall Chriſt come
out of Galilee? Hath not the Scripture ſaid, that
Chriſt commeth of the ſeede of David, and out of the
towne of Bethleem, where David was?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. But how cleare ſoever the meaning of the
Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> in thoſe daies were both to Prieſt
and people: ſome variation there is in the words
of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> from the words of the Prophet, as
they ſtand in the originall: at which, both later
Jewes, and ſome Chriſtians take more offence
then the ancient Jews could have done. And if
this variation were of any moment, or could mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
juſt offence, either to the Jew, to the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
or to the <hi>Church</hi> of God, all the blame were
to be layed upon theſe Scribes and Prieſts, whom
<hi>Herod</hi> in his perplexity did conſult. For S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
in this particular was but the Regiſter of
their anſwer, which hee did record in the ſame
words that they ſolemnely made it. The words
of the Prophet in the originall, as they are now
pointed, runne thus: <hi>And thou Bethleem Ephratah,
though thou be little among the thouſands of Iudah;
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7898:198"/>
yet out of thee ſhall hee come forth unto me, that is to
be Ruler in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>whoſe goings forth have beene from
old, from everlaſting.</hi> Micah 5. 2. The anſwer of
the Prieſts and Scribes, as it ſtands upon record
by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is <hi>verbatim</hi> thus; <hi>And thou Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem
in the land of Iudea</hi> (in clearer diſtinction from
<hi>Bethleem</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Zebulon,</hi> in which Tribe,

their Tribes or Provinces, as wee doe Shires or

Some good Writers, whom our Engliſh follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
ſeeke to ſalve this ſeeming contradiction
betweene the Prophet and Evangeliſt, or that
anſwer which hee relates, made by the chiefe
Prieſts and Scribes to <hi>Herod,</hi> thus; But thou, (or
as for thee) O <hi>Bethleem Ephrata,</hi> though thou be
little to be reckoned among the Seigniories or
thouſands of <hi>Iudea,</hi> yet out of thee ſhall he come
forth unto mee, that is to be Ruler in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.
But this ſquaring of the Prophets words to our
Evangeliſts relation, is ſomewhat harſh and rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the moderne Jew, who ſeekes to frame
his ſteps according to the plaine troden literall
ſenſe. And therefore ſeeing both Chriſtians and
Jews, as well ancient as moderne, agree that the
promiſed Meſſias was to be borne in <hi>Bethleem:</hi>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:7898:199"/>
the variation of the reading in the Prophet, and
in the Evangeliſt ſhould not in reaſon be too
much ſtood upon by either; yet ſeeing wee are
bound to give no offence to the Jew, nor to preſſe
any reading, at which they may ſtumble, being
enclined to trip at every ſcruple; we may (I take
it) with the liking and approbation of <hi>Druſius</hi> (an
exquiſite Hebrician for point of Grammar) and
without the diſlike of any learned Jew, reade the
firſt words of the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation,
thus, And art thou <hi>Bethleem Ephrata</hi>
little, or too little to be reputed among the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities

neither ſo curious nor ſo dangerous as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
[whether theſe words be the collections or
interpretations of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> or whether in this
hiſtoricall relation he were only the Regiſter of
the Angels ſpeech to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> as in the forecited te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony

and Scribes anſwer unto <hi>Herods</hi> demand, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

This good writer is of opinion that the Angel
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7898:200"/>
himſelfe did unfold the true intent and purpoſe
of the holy Ghoſt in that prophecy unto <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
as a principall argument to perſwade him not
to put away <hi>Mary</hi> his eſpouſed wife, but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
her, and her ſonne with the ſame reſpect
and loue, as if the child conceived in her had been
as well his only begotten ſonne as hers. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Angels preſence and manner of ſpeech
did afford abundant ſatisfaction to <hi>Ioſephs</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
thoughts for the preſent; yet to prevent
all future <hi>regrettings,</hi> after the Angels departure
from them (when haply the dreame or viſion
might be partly forgotten, or the truth of it ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected)
it was convenient to acquaint him with
the word of the Lord written long before to the
ſame purpoſe; for that was permanent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all exception or ſuſpition. And ſeeing it was
ſo clearely foretold by the Prophet, that a Virgin
ſhould conceive, and bring forth a ſonne, who
ſhould be a ſigne or pledge of comfort to the
houſe of <hi>David,</hi> it could not ſeeme ſtrange or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that his eſpouſed wife, who,
as he himſelfe alſo, was of the lineage of <hi>David,</hi>
ſhould be the virgin meant by the holy Ghoſt in
that prophecy. S. <hi>Matthew</hi> then did learne the
true meaning of the Prophet by the Angel, and
this meaning of it being avouched by both, there
can be no queſtion amongſt Chriſtians of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent
proofe and efficacie of the prophecy it
ſelfe, as it is alleaged by S. <hi>Matthew.</hi> Wee may not
ſuſpect or thinke that it was fulfilled onely by
way of accommodation, or alluſion, as in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of ſome moderne Divines, divers other
Scriptures are; which yet are ſaid by our Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
to be fulfilled, or for the fulfilling of which,
many events hiſtorically related by them, are ſaid
to be done, or come to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>3 Yet even this moſt pregnant teſtimony of
that grand myſterie of our faith [that Chriſt was
conceived by the holy Ghoſt, and borne of the
virgin <hi>Mary]</hi> is ſhrewdly oppoſed by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne

the Prophet at this time had any wife at all,
though it be apparant that <hi>Iſaias</hi> had been maried
before this time from the third verſe of the 7
Chapter, <hi>[Then ſaid the Lord unto Iſaias, Goe forth

                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:7898:201"/>
a ſonne no doubt lawfully begotten. But if his
mother had beene then living, or if ſhe had beene
<hi>Hagnalma</hi> that <hi>virgin or woman,</hi> in whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
did meane to inſtance in particular, there
ſhould have beene mention of her comming, as

the very circumſtances of time and place,
are particularized moſt exactly.</p>
                  <p>4. Secondly, the Jews object, that if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Chriſt had beene the ſeede here promiſed,
or if the bleſſed Uirgin, or <hi>Ioſeph</hi> her huſband had
knowne thus much, they would have called him
<hi>Emmanuel,</hi> not Jeſus, at his circumciſion; at leaſt,
this ſhould have been his uſuall name. For ſo the

Emmanuel,</hi> whereas the Angel enjoyneth the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to call her ſonne <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third and maine exception, which they
preſſe moſt feircely, is, that the child here promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
(whoſoever were to be his mother) was to be
a pledge of that ſtrange deliverance of <hi>Ahaz</hi> and
his people (within ſome few yeares after) from
the confederacy of Syria and Ephraim, who had
then projected the utter extirpation of the houſe
of <hi>David.</hi> Now every ſigne, is either of ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
event to be exhibited after the ſigne is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or an aſſurance that thoſe things which are
ſaid to be foretold in the name of the Lord, were
ſo foretold by God indeed, not pretended only
by the prophet. If this <hi>Emmanuel</hi> were to be a
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:7898:202"/>
ſigne and pledge to <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his people, that the
Lord would deliver them beyond their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from their preſent Enemies, hee was (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the literall and hiſtoricall purport of the
Prophets words) to be borne before this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was accompliſhed. If he were onely to be a
ſigne or aſſurance that the words which <hi>Iſaias</hi>
ſpake to <hi>Ahaz</hi> were ſpoken by the ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Lord, this might be an undoubted
ſigne to us, or to ſuch as lived about the time of
his birth; it could be no ſigne or aſſurance unto
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> or the people then living, either of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from their Enemies, or that <hi>Iſaias</hi> had
ſpoken to them in the name of the Lord, if they
did otherwiſe queſtion his authoritie. Or to ſay
the very truth, unleſſe the Emmanuel there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
were borne at the time limited by the
prophet, his birth could yeeld no aſſurance unto
us, that <hi>Ahaz</hi> was delivered from the King of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
and Ephraim, or that theſe two Enemies were
cut off within the time limited by the prophet.
All this wee are to beleeve from the hiſtoricall
narration and literall ſenſe of the Prophet, not
from the Evangelicall ſtorie concerning the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
birth of our Saviour; of which if we have
a true hiſtoricall beleife, wee muſt beleeve the
Evangeliſt from the praediction of the Prophet,
or from the parallel betweene the Prophets and
the Evangeliſts words. This inference is good
and ſufficient to ground true beleife [The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
foretold the virgin ſhould conceive and
beare a ſonne; therefore the Evangeliſts allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:7898:202"/>
and hiſtorie is of divine truth] but not <hi>è contra,</hi>
[the Evangeliſt reports that a virgin did conceive
and bring forth a ſonne, <hi>ergò</hi> that which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
had ſaid of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his deliverance from his
enemies, is of like truth and authority.] <hi>Iunius</hi>
therefore with ſome others, conſequently enough
to their owne interpretations of this place, deny
that the birth of the <hi>Emmanuel</hi> here prophecyed
<q>by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> was any ſigne at all of <hi>Ahaz</hi> preſent
delivery, or of the diſaſter of <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah,</hi>
but of a greater and ſtranger deliverance of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah
and Iſrael from their potent enemies in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ages. And that ſeeing the Lord from the
beginning of that kingdome had promiſed to
give the houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſo admirable a ſigne, as
the conception of a <hi>ſonne</hi> by a pure virgin, it was
either hypocriſie or ſtrange incredulity in <hi>Ahaz</hi>
to refuſe a leſſer ſign of his preſent deliverance,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God did ſo freely offer it, as it is ver. 10, 11,
12. <hi>Moreover the Lord ſpake again unto Ahaz, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
ask thee a ſign of the Lord thy God, ask it either
in the depth, or in the height above. But Ahaz ſaid,
I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.</hi> This,
in the prophets conſtruction was, to weary and
vex God, who had proffered this ſigne, But what
ſigne? Any that <hi>Ahaz</hi> would demand for his
preſent ſecuritie againſt the confederacy of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
and Ephraim. And ſeeing hee would not
chooſe a ſigne, the Lord would give him one,
better then hee could have choſen for himſelfe,
<hi>Behold, a virgin ſhall conceive,</hi> &amp;c.</q> But the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:7898:203"/>
                     <hi>Iunius</hi> denyeth it to be any ſigne of that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or aſſurance, for which <hi>Ahaz</hi> was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to aſk a ſigne; hee adds withall, that of this
temporary deliverance <hi>Shear-iaſhub,</hi> whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
was commanded to bring with him, when hee
went to meet <hi>Ahaz,</hi> was the ſigne or pledge. But
herein I cannot aſſent unto him, for <hi>Shear-iaſhub</hi>
was a pledge of their<note n="*" place="margin">See the 10 § of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> returne whom <hi>Pekah</hi> and
<hi>Rheſin</hi> had lately captivated, no ſigne or pledge
of keeping <hi>Ahaz</hi> or <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in poſſeſſion of the
Kingdome. Of all this the Emmanuel here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
was the undoubted ſigne or pledge, if wee
would looke upon the ſacred ſtory, whileſt wee
debate thoſe controverſies with the Jew, or with
others, that differ in opinion from us in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                  <p>5 Not to trouble the Reader with recitall of
other good Chriſtian writers opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this point, or of their expoſitions upon this
place of <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> the reſultance of their confident
conteſtations <hi>pro,</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> is but this. There is more
contention than contradiction betweene them
about the true intent and meaning of the holy
Ghoſt, and of the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>The Jew indeed flatly contradicts us in our
expoſitions of this place, and ſo farre as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
us in the maine point, wee are bound to
maintaine our contradiction to them. But the
extending of this contradiction unto them in all
their expoſitions on this place, &amp; of ſome others,
declare the Jew and us Chriſtians to be two ſons
of one and the ſame Father. The Jew being the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7898:203"/>
elder brother, is carefull to preſerve the map or
terrar of the inheritance bequeathed unto him,
after he hath beene diſinherited. And, frantick as
he is, having the map or terrar, he brags that the
inheritance repreſented in it is wholly his. Wee
Chriſtians one and other being ſeized and in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the inheritance, permit him the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of raving: (as loſers muſt have leave to ſpeake)
But oftentimes while we laugh at him, wee our
ſelves are careleſſe to take a Copie of the terrar,
whoſe ſafe cuſtody the Jew makes cheife matter
of his Religion; although he oftentimes beſlurre
it with fooliſh animadverſions of his owne inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as unſkilfull ſtudents do good bookes which
they underſtand not with impertinent ridiculous
marginall notes or interlineations. But however
we Chriſtians be in poſſeſſion of the inheritance
promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from which <hi>Abrahams</hi>
ſeed according to the fleſh have beene ejected, it
would be no harme to be beholding unto them
for a Copie of the ancient <hi>terrars</hi> of it, I meane,
of the literall ſenſe of divers Scriptures, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyes
eſpecially, and of this moſt admirable
prophecy in particular. The blots and ſtaines
which the Jew hath made, or ſuffered to bee

eaſily be taken out without obliteration of that

ſhould be either <hi>Shear-iaſhub</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
or <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ahaz;</hi> both of them
being borne before this time, as it is evident, the
one from the literall meaning of the Prophet,
the other from the ſacred ſtories of the bookes

rather preſerve then deface the map it ſelfe, and

ſome few yeares, or rather within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of a yeare, from the time of his meeting
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> this is moſt conſonant to the literall ſenſe
of theſe words, <hi>Chap. 7. 16. For before the Child ſhall
know to refuſe the evill, and chooſe the good, the Land
that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings.</hi>
This ſaith the marginall note upon our former
Engliſh, <hi>is not meant of Chriſt, but of any Child.
For before a Child can come to the yeares of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Kings of Samaria, and Syria ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi>
The note is two wayes faulty: Firſt, in
denying this to be meant at all of Chriſt; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in avouching it to be meant of any Child. And
I wiſh the note were extant in our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or in
ſome other language onely, which the Jews for
the moſt part either do not read, or do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.
Yet if this place may be meant not of
every Child, but of any one Child beſides our
Saviour Chriſt; and if the word <hi>Hagnalma</hi> in the
14 verſe according to its ſtrict propriety, do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
a virgin, ſhall we not hence be concluded to
grant, that ſome other virgin beſides the virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> (and before her) did conceive and bring
forth a ſonne? This in no wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e may be granted,
nor any interpretation of any place admitted
from which ſuch impious concluſions as this, may
be inferred. To conceive a ſonne whileſt ſhee
was a virgin, was the incommunicable preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the mother of our Lord. Yet will it not
hence follow that the Prophet by the emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7898:205"/>
character of a virgin <hi>Hagnalma</hi> might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
ſome virgin then preſent, not the Prophets
wife, but rather ſome virgin of <hi>Ahaz</hi> kinred, or
of the houſe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> for whom hee aſtipulates
that within the compaſſe of the yeare following,
ſhee ſhould conceive, and bring forth a ſonne,
not whilſt ſhee was a virgin, but by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a lawfull wife beyond or before her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
                  <p>7. But here ſuch as are otherwiſe minded, or
take this paſſage to be literally meant of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
virgin alone, will reply; What wonder was
it, or what matter worthy the uſhering in with an
<hi>Ecce,</hi> or other like injunction of attention, for her
who was now a virgin, to conceive and bring
forth a ſonne, after the manner that other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
within a yeare after they are maried, uſually
do? But they who thus object, <hi>facilè pronunciant,
quia ad pauca reſpiciunt,</hi> they give ſentence upon
the view of one circumſtance only, when as they
ſhould take a great many more into their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
The virgin thus particularized, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the literall ſenſe of the Prophet, whether
then preſent (as is moſt probable,) or otherwiſe
ſo famouſly knowne, that his words in all mens
apprehenſion then preſent, had reference to her,
might be either for want of yeares, or for ſome
other defects, as unlikely to bring forth a ſonne
within the time limited, as <hi>Sarah</hi> after 90 yeares
age was, more unlikely than the wife of <hi>Manoah,</hi>
or <hi>Zacharias.</hi> However, it farre ſurpaſſed the
skill of Aſtrologers, Phyſitians, of men expert in
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7898:205"/>
naturall Magick, or other kinde of divination
whatſoever, (beſides the divination which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes
from the Father of lights,) to give ſuch
full aſſurance, as the Prophet there doth, that any
woman ſhould conceive within ſuch a compaſſe
of time, or that ſhee ſhould conceive a ſonne not
a daughter, leaſt of all that ſhee ſhould conceive
and bring forth a Sonne, who ſhould deſervedly
brooke the name and title of <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> that is,
to be a pledge of Gods ſpeciall preſence to the
houſe of <hi>David</hi> or land of <hi>Iudah,</hi> or to protect
them againſt their potent enemies, or to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative
ſigne or hoſtage, that before hee
could know how to refuſe the evill and chooſe
the good, the Land, which <hi>Ahaz</hi> abhorred, ſhould
be forſaken of both their Kings; who were now
ready and able (without Gods ſpeciall ayde) to
devoure the Land of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Yet for all theſe and
other like conſequences of <hi>Emmanuels</hi> birth, the
Prophet confidently aſtipulates in the name of
his God; which without a ſpeciall warrant from
him had beene an intolerable preſumption. But
as for <hi>Ahaz</hi> himſelfe, his houſe, and people,
(becauſe they would not beleeve this prediction,
according to the literall tenour,) they were to
be plagued by that Nation in whoſe potencie
they put their truſt; by the ſame enemie, which
the Prophet had foretold, ſhould by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
defeat the preſent miſchievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> againſt <hi>Iudah.</hi> And all
this they ſhould have done, without any future
harme or danger to the houſe of <hi>David</hi> by them,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7898:206"/>
ſo <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his people would have relyed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
upon Gods promiſe, or faithfully accepted
of the ſigne promiſed by his Prophet. But <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
this, they were not eſtabliſhed,</hi> ver. 9. For ſo
the Prophet immediatly after <hi>Ahaz</hi> refuſall of
this ſigne, did threaten <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his people, <hi>ver.
17. The Lord ſhall bring upon thee, and thy people and
upon thy Fathers houſe, dayes that have not come,
from the day that</hi> Ephraim <hi>departed from</hi> Judah:
<hi>even the Kings of</hi> Aſſyria. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe
in that day, that the Lord ſhall hiſſe for the Flye that
is in the uttermoſt part of the Rivers of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and
for the Bee that is in the Land of</hi> Aſſyria. <hi>And they
ſhall come, and ſhall reſt all of them in the deſolate
valleyes; and in the holes of the rockes, and upon
all thornes; and upon all buſhes.</hi> The demerits of
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> and of his people which did deſerve the
denuntiation and execution of the plagues here
threatned, were their too much confidence in
the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and their diſtruſt (hence oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned)
of what the Lord had promiſed by his
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and would have performed by
other meanes than by the ayde of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi>
ſo they would have relyed upon them. Wee do
not reade that either <hi>Ahaz,</hi> or his people did
diſtruſt, much leſſe that they were puniſhed for
their diſtruſt unto Gods promiſes concerning the
comming of the Meſſias in the appointed time,
but for not accepting the ſigne or pledge as well
of his comming, as of their inſtant deliverance
from the danger wherein then they ſtood.</p>
                  <p>8. But what probabilities or juſt preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:7898:206"/>
be there, that any woman who was a virgin
at the time when <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah met, in the
high way of the Fullers field,</hi> ſhould, upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
mentioned, become a married woman, and
conceive a ſonne, according to the time intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Prophet? All this I take it, is more
then probable from the true and literall meaning
of the 1, 2, 3, and 4 verſes of the 8 Chapter, which
are no other then an exegeticall expoſition of
the former prophecie, Chap. 7. verſ. 14, 15, 16. or
a more legall ratification or new aſſumption of
making good the aſſurance, which in the former
Chapter he had given: <hi>Moreover, the Lord ſaid
unto me, take thee a great roule, and write in it with
a mans penne concerning</hi> Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz.
<hi>And I took unto me faithfull witneſſes to record,</hi> Vriah
<hi>the Prieſt, and</hi> Zechariah <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Jeberechiah.
<hi>And I went unto the Propheteſſe, and ſhee conceived
and bare a ſonne: then ſaid the Lord to mee, Call his
name</hi> Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz. <hi>For before the Child
ſhall have knowledge to cry, my father and my mother,
the riches of Damaſcus, and the ſpoile of Samaria ſhall
be taken away before the King of Aſſyria.</hi> The
Child promiſed, <hi>Chap. 7. ver.</hi> 14, and in this place,
according to the true connexion of the literall
ſenſe, is (in my apprehenſion) one and the ſame,
though deſcribed by two names, the one impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
comfort to the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the land
of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and this was given him before his
conception: the later importing the ſudden ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the woes denounced againſt <hi>Syria</hi> and
<hi>Samaria,</hi> and was given him after his conception.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:7898:207"/>
And leſt wee ſhould doubt, whether this <hi>Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz</hi>
were the ſame with the <hi>Emmanuel</hi>
promiſed in the former Chapter, hee is inſtyled
again by the very ſame name, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. unto <hi>ver. 8.
The Lord ſpake unto me againe, ſaying, Forſomuch as
this people refuſeth the waters of</hi> Shiloah <hi>that goe
ſoftly, and rejoyce in</hi> Rezin, Remaliahs <hi>ſonne: now
therefore behold the Lord bringeth up upon them the
waters of the rivers, ſtrong and many, even the
King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and all his glory: and he ſhall come
up over all his channels, and goe over all his banks.</hi>
Againe, that the name <hi>Emmanuel</hi> did literally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Gods peculiar preſence at that time with
his people, not only to deliver them from <hi>Rezin</hi>
and <hi>Pekah,</hi> but from the potencie of the Aſſyrian
in future times, is evidently included in the
9 and 10 verſes. <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves, O yee people,
and yee ſhall be broken in pieces, and give eare all yee
of farre Countries: gird your ſelves, and yee ſhall be
broken in pieces: gird your ſelves, and yee ſhall be
broken in pieces. Take counſell together, and it ſhall
be brought to naught; ſpeake the word and it ſhall
ſtand, for God is with us.</hi> The ſtrange defeat of
the confederacie here foretold, was not to be
expected in the dayes of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> in whoſe times
the Aſſyrian did attempt no great matters againſt
them, but in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Thus much
the Prophets words in the verſes following im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<hi>ver. 16. 17. Binde up the teſtimony, ſeale my
law among my Diſciples. And I will waite upon the
Lord that hideth his face from the houſe of</hi> Jacob,
<hi>and I will looke for him.</hi> This binding up of the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:7898:207"/>
Teſtimony, and ſealing of this Law doth argue
both the Law and teſtimony to have beene of
ſpeciall moment, yet not to be put in execution,
or fully accompliſhed for the preſent. Of the
accompliſhment of both, whether wholly or in
part, the Prophets ſonnes in the interim were
ſignes and pledges, as is imported, <hi>ver. 18. Behold
I, and the Children whom the Lord hath given mee
are for ſignes, and for wonders in Iſrael from the Lord
of Hoaſts, which dwelleth in Mount Sion.</hi> This laſt
paſſage is alledged by the<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 2. 11. &amp;c.</note> Apoſtle, amongſt
others, to prove, that the Lord of Hoaſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
who in the 14. verſe of the 8. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> had
promiſed to be a Sanctuary to his people, was
to participate with them of fleſh and bloud. <hi>Hee
that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified are all of
one. For which cauſe hee is not aſhamed to call them
brethren, ſaying, I will declare thy name unto my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
in the midſt of the Church will I ſing praiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee.</hi> And againe, <hi>I will put my truſt in him.</hi>
And againe, <hi>Behold I and the Children which God
hath given me.</hi> Yet that the 18. verſe of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
the 8, to which our Apoſtle in this place referres
us, was literally meant of the Prophet and his
Children, is too apparent to be denied, nor will it
be ſafe to ſtand upon termes of contradiction thus
farre with the moderne Jew. One of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſonnes was called <hi>Shear-iaſhub,</hi> which by
interpretation is, <hi>The remn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt ſhall returne:</hi> and
of this returne or reſtauration hee was the ſigne
or pledge. The other was called <hi>Emmanuel,</hi>
which being interpreted is, <hi>God with us;</hi> a name
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:7898:208"/>
portending or foretokening Gods ſpeciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
with his people at more times than one.
The impoſition of both names, and their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
were literally fulfilled in the age immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
following, but miſtically fulfilled only in
Chriſt, whoſe comming to viſit his people, was
prefigured by both of them. The full impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
or <hi>abode</hi> of the name <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in our Saviours conception and birth: the
true importance of <hi>Shear-iaſhub,</hi> ſhall be myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
fulfilled, when the fulneſſe of the Gentiles
is come, or when the Jew ſhall be called to be
againe the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>9. Two points only remaine. The firſt how
the prophecie concerning <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
according to the literall ſenſe in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
time; and our reſolution in this point
wee muſt take from the ſacred records of this
theame in the old Teſtament. The ſecond, how
this prophecie was fulfilled according to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
ſenſe; and this wee muſt learne from the
Evangeliſts which alledge the fulfilling of it, and
other unpartiall Writers which relate either cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
or ſignes of thoſe times in which
they wrote: Out of theſe two points the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
betweene the Prophet and Evangeliſts will
of its owne accord, without any anxious inquirie,
or further diſcuſſion, reſult.</p>
                  <p>10 The Hiſtories of the old Teſtament, by
which <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> literall meaning may be beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
are in the 2 of Kings 17, 18. 2 Chron.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:7898:208"/>
28. 16, 17, &amp;c. We have a <hi>conſtat</hi> from the prophet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> himſelfe, Chap. 7. 1, 2. That this prophecy
concerning <hi>Emmanuel</hi> was uttered by him in the
dayes of <hi>Ahaz</hi> King of Judah, and of <hi>Pekah</hi> the
ſonne of <hi>Remaliah;</hi> but in what certaine yeare of
either of theſe two Kings raignes, this revelation
was made to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the matter of it inſtantly
imparted unto King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> is not ſo certaine. Moſt
certaine it is, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> delivered this meſſage
from the Lord to <hi>Ahaz</hi> before the twelfth yeare
of his raigne, for in that yeare <hi>Hoſhea</hi> the ſonne of
<hi>Elah</hi> begun to raigne in <hi>Samaria</hi> over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2
Kings 17. 1. and this was after <hi>Pekah</hi> the ſonne of
<hi>Remaliah</hi> was dead. And though it be not ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
yet moſt probable it is, that the former
prophecy was uttered about the 8 or 9 yeare of
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> or about 3 yeares or ſomewhat more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Pekah,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Remaliah</hi> was ſlaine. One
yeare, or ſomewhat under, we muſt allow for the
conception and birth of the <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> or <hi>Maher-Shalal-haſh-baz,</hi>
and ſome two yeares after untill
he were upon the point or period of time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ordinary Children in thoſe dayes were enabled
to know how to refuſe the evill, and chooſe the
good, that is, to diſtinguiſh between other meats
beſides milke, butter, and honey, and betweene
his parents and other perſons. Before this <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
or <hi>Maher-Shalal-haſh-baz</hi> were thus enabled
to diſtinguiſh betweene meate and meat, or his
parents and other perſons, (but how long before
this time, it is uncertaine) both <hi>Pekah</hi> ſonne of
<hi>Remaliah,</hi> and <hi>Rezin</hi> King of Syria, (according to
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7898:209"/>
the tenour of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> prophecy, and the aſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made by him upon the ſigne profered to
<hi>Ahaz)</hi> were to be deprived of their Kingdomes,
or rather their Land and Kingdomes to be quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of them, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 7. 16. &amp; Chap. 8. ver. 4. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their ruine, and before this revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their ruine was made unto the Prophet
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> they had brought Judah and the houſe of
<hi>David</hi> exceeding low, 2 <hi>Chron. 28. 5, 6, 7, 8. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of
the King of Syria, and they ſmote him, &amp; carryed away
a great multitude of them Captives, and brought them
to Damaſcus. And hee was alſo delivered into the
hand of the King of Iſrael, who ſmote him with a great
ſlaughter. For Pekah the ſonne of Remaliah ſlue in
Iudah, an hundred and twentie thouſand in one day,
which were all valiant men, becauſe they had forſaken
the Lord God of their Fathers. And Zichri, a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
man of Ephraim ſlue Maaſerah the Kings ſonne,
and Azrikam, the governour of the houſe, and Elka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah
that was next to the King. And the Children of
Iſrael caryed away captive of their brethren, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand women, ſonnes and daughters, and tooke
alſo away much ſpoile from them, and brought the
ſpoile to Samaria.</hi> Upon this great diſaſter, or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie
of the people of Judah by theſe two Kings,
the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did name one ſonne of his
<hi>Shear-iaſhub,</hi> as a pledge or token that theſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
ſhould returne againe unto their own Land,
as they did beyond all expectation, from Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.
The hiſtorie is very remarkable both for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and circumſtance, and recorded at large by
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:7898:209"/>
the author of the 2 booke of Chronicles in the
words immediately following the forecited. <hi>But
a prophet of the Lord was there, whoſe name was O ded:
and he went out before the hoſt that came to Samaria,
and ſaid unto them, Behold, becauſe the Lord God of
your Fathers was wroth with Iudah, he hath delivered
them into your hand, and yee have ſlain them in a rage
that reacheth up into Heaven. And now yee purpoſe to
keepe under the children of Iudah and Ieruſalem for
bondmen and bondwomen unto you. But are there not
with you, even with you, ſinnes againſt the Lord your
God? Now heare mee therefore, and deliver the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
againe which yee have taken captive of your
brethren: for the fierce wrath of God is upon you. Then
certaine of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah
the ſonne of Iohanan, Berechiah the ſonne of
Meſhillemoth, and Iehizkiah the ſonne of Shallum,
and Amala the ſonne of Hadlai, ſtood up againſt them
that came from the warre, and ſaid unto them, Ye ſhall
not bring in the Captives hither, for whereas we have
offended againſt the Lord already, yee intend to adde
more to our ſinnes and to our treſpaſſe, for our treſpaſſe
is great, and there is fierce wrath againſt Iſrael. So the
armed men left the Captives, and the ſpoile before the
Princes, and all the Congregation. And the men which
were expreſſed by name, roſe up, and tooke the Captives,
and with the ſpoile cloathed all that were naked among
them, and arrayed them, and ſhod them, and gave them
to eate and to drinke, and annointed them, and caryed
all the feeble of them upon Aſſes, and brought them to
Ieriche, the Citie of palme trees, to their brethren;
then they returned to Samaria.</hi> And ſo no doubt,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:7898:210"/>
thoſe Captives which <hi>Rezin</hi> King of Syria had
carryed to Damaſcus, were ſet at libertie after
the King of Aſſyria had ſlaine <hi>Rezin,</hi> meeting with
<hi>Ahaz</hi> there. But the Edomites, and the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
both ancient Enemies to the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
became <hi>ungues in ulcere,</hi> and kept the wound
open with tooth and nayle, which <hi>Rezin, Pekah,</hi>
and <hi>Zichri</hi> had made, as it is regiſtred 2 <hi>Chron. 28.
17.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For againe the Edomites had come and ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Iudah, and carryed away Captives; the Philiſtines
alſo had invaded the cities of the low Country, and of
the South of Iudah, and had taken Bethſhemeſh and
Ailon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages
thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo
alſo, and the villages thereof, and they dwelt there.</hi>
After theſe wounds which theſe ſeverall enemies
had made in the ſtate of Judah, <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi>
with joynt forces beſeiged Jeruſalem, 2 <hi>Kings 16.
5, 6, 7, 8. Then Rezin King of Syria, and Pekah ſon of
Remaliah King of Iſrael came up to Ieruſalem to war:
and they beſeiged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
At that time Rezin King of Syria recovered Elath to
Syria, and drave the Iews from Elath: and the Syrians
came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day. So Ahaz
ſent meſſengers to Tiglath-Pelezer King of Aſſyria,
ſaying, I am thy ſervant, and thy ſonne: come up and
ſave mee out of the hand of the King of Syria, and out
of the hand of the King of Iſrael which riſe up againſt
mee. And Ahaz tooke the ſilver and gold that was
found in the houſe of the Lord, and in the treaſures of
the Kings houſe, and ſent it for a preſent to the King
of Aſſyria. And the King of Aſſyria hearkned unto
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:7898:210"/>
him: for the King of Aſſyria went up againſt Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
and tooke it, and carryed the people of it Captive to
Kir, and ſlue Rezin.</hi> This unhallowed ſubmiſſion
of <hi>Ahaz</hi> unto the King of Aſſyria, was the very
thing which the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did
diſwade him from, foretelling withall that if he
perſiſted in this purpoſe of caſting out one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
by another, or by the Prince of Divels; the
later would prove worſe than the former. On
the contrary, if <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his people would relye
upon the ſigne which God had given them, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of his immediate aide, both <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi>
ſhould within ſhort ſpace be ruinated without
either preſent aide, or future evill from Aſſyria.
But if they would not beleeve or rely upon him,
although God for his part would performe the
former part of this Prophecie, as it concerned the
death of <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah,</hi> and the captivitie of
Samaria, yet he would bring all the plagues upon
Judah, which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had threatned,
by the hand of Aſſyria, whoſe aid they now
ſought. And yet this preſent <hi>Emmanuel</hi> was to be
a pledge of a ſtrange defeat of the Aſſyrian, after
much miſchiefe done by him as well to Judah as
to Iſrael. For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (ſonne and ſucceſſor unto
<hi>Ahaz)</hi> was inforced to buy his peace of <hi>Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi>
ſucceſſor to <hi>Tiglah-Peleſer</hi> at as deare a rate, as
<hi>Ahaz</hi> had purchaſed the Aſſyrians aid. <hi>Now in the
fourteenth yeare of King Hezekiah, did Sennacherib
king of Aſſyria come up againſt all the fenced Cities of
Iudah, and tooke them. And Hezekiah King of Iudah
ſent to the king of Aſſyria to Lachiſh, ſaying, I have

offended, returne from mee; that which thou putteſt on
me, will I beare. And the king of Aſſyria appointed
unto Hezekiah King of Iudah, three hundred Talents
of ſilver, and thirty Talents of Gold. And Hezekiah
gave him all the ſilver, that was found in the houſe of
the Lord, and in the treaſures of the Kings houſe. At
that time did Hezekiah out off the gold from the doores
of the Temple of the Lord, and from the pillars which
Hezekiah King of Iudah had over-laid, and gave it to
the king of Aſſyria, 2 King 18. 13, 14, &amp;c.</hi> Both

low by the Syrians, by the King of Samaria, by
the Edomites, and by the Philiſtines. From this
extraordinary depreſſion of it, the hopes of <hi>Rezin</hi>

that they confidently reſolved upon the

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:7898:211"/>
In the height of this their confidence, and the

although the particulars be not mentioned in the

of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> that <hi>Herod</hi> had his confederates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and which (aſſoone as
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7898:212"/>

Aegypt, ſaying, Ariſe, and take the yong Child, and his
mother, and goe into the Land of Iſrael: for they are
dead which ſought the yong Childs life.</hi> Math. 2. 19. 20.
This argues there were ſome other that dyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

had ſought the life of Jeſus. In this low eſtate
whereunto the houſe of <hi>David</hi> was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the death of <hi>Herod</hi> and his confederates; the

not the continuance only of <hi>Davids</hi> ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the reſtauration, enlargement, and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

the daughter of <hi>David,</hi> and her huſband, by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

The Angel delivers his embaſſage, moſtwhat, in
the ſame words that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did to <hi>Ahaz, Behold,</hi>
ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, 7. 14. this virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and beare a ſonne, and ſhe ſhall call his name Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel.</hi>
Unto the bleſſed virgin (then preſent) ſaith
the Angel, <hi>Luke 1. 30, 31. Feare not Mary, for thou
haſt found favour with God, and behold thou ſhalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in thy womb, and bring forth a ſonne, and
ſhalt call his name Ieſus.</hi> The impoſition of this
name Jeſus is committed to the care of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin:
ſo was the name of <hi>Emmanuel</hi> to the virgin to
whom the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> directs his ſpeech when
he delivered his meſſage unto <hi>Ahaz.</hi> For in the
originall, the word which S. <hi>Matthew</hi> renders im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſonally
or in the third perſon plurall (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7898:212"/>
(that is according to the Hebrew Dialect, Hee
ſhall be called) is the ſecond perſon ſingular, and
the foeminine, <hi>tu vocabis,</hi> thou Virgin ſhalt call
him <hi>Emmanuel.</hi> This variation of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
from the Prophets preciſe word, is ſuch, as
breedes no vitiation at all, in the reall ſenſe; but
ſuch as reaſon it ſelfe, and rules of Grammar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
in like caſes. The Virgin being (as wee
ſuppoſe) preſent, when the Prophet exhibited
the ſigne unto <hi>Ahaz,</hi> hee was to ſpeake unto her
in the ſecond perſon. But the Evangeliſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the fulfilling of this prophecie, not in the
literall ſenſe onely, but in the myſticall, was to
change the perſon, or to relate it in the third
perſon plurall, which is indeed an imperſonall,
according to the Hebrew Dialect, <hi>Behold a virgin
ſhall bring forth a ſonne, and they ſhall call his name
(that is,</hi> he ſhall be called) <hi>Emmanuel, which is by
interpretation, God with us.</hi>

                     </gap> which is alwayes emphaticall, ſhould
denote the bleſſed Virgin, and ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from one virgin to another. Secondly,
why the name given our Saviour at his circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
was not <hi>Emmanuel</hi> according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſpeech, but Jeſus. To the firſt demand, wee
anſwer, that the originall letter is alwayes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall:
ſometimes a note of demonſtration, or
particularity; and according to this importance,
it referres unto the Virgin then preſent, as if the
Prophet had ſaid, <hi>Ecce, virgo haec, Behold, this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
ſhall conceive, &amp;c.</hi> Sometime it is a note of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:7898:213"/>
Eminencie, and according to this importance, it
referres unto the Virgin of Virgins, the bleſſed
Mother of our Lord, of whom it is meant not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the myſticall, but in the moſt exquiſite li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
ſenſe. To the ſecond we ſay, the impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the name <hi>Emmanuel</hi> had beene requiſite
at our Saviours <hi>circumciſion,</hi> if this prophecie had
bin meant of <hi>Him</hi> only in the literall ſenſe. But in
as much as it was to be fulfilled in <hi>Him,</hi> according
to the moſt exquiſite both literall and myſticall
ſenſe, it was requiſite there ſhould be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
as well in the <hi>ſignificancie</hi> of the
name, as in the thing ſignified by it. Now the
name <hi>Ieſus</hi> imports a great deale more than the
name <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> as will appeare in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. The importance of the name <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
as it referres unto the Childe inſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is applied unto the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
by the Angel in his preface to the Annuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Luk. 1. 28. Haile thou that art in high favour,
the Lord is with thee, bleſſed art thou amongst wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
The Lord was with her in a more peculiar
manner, whileſt the Angell thus ſpoke unto her,
then he had beene with <hi>Gideon</hi> to whom the like
ſalutation was tendred by an Angel, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. 12.
Or with <hi>Iudah,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> or <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
But after the Lord was conceived by her, he was
both with <hi>her,</hi> and with us, after a more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

betweene meates, or cry, My Father,
my Mother. The accompliſhment of this ſigne,
or of the promiſe confirmed by it, is regiſtred in
the ſacred ſtory. For <hi>Pekah</hi> was ſlaine by <hi>Hoſhea</hi>
the ſonne of <hi>Elah,</hi> within two or three yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

was made to the bleſſed Virgin, that her

returned from <hi>Egypt</hi> two yeares after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

which ſought the Childes life, is no where in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

ſtory expreſſed: nor is it to mee certaine
whether <hi>Syria</hi> at that time had a King of their
own, but it is probable they had, ſeeing in S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
time <hi>Aretas</hi> was King of <hi>Damaſcus, 2. Cor.</hi> 11. 32.
Some there be which mention the death of one
<hi>Obedas</hi> whom they make King of <hi>Syria,</hi> who died
about the ſame time with <hi>Herod,</hi> but from what
authority, they expreſſe not. The Evangeliſt
might meane the Roman Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi>
by whoſe favour and potencie <hi>Herod</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned
to tyrannize over the Jews Nation, and
to worke his projects againſt the houſe of <hi>David.</hi>
Some have accuſed <hi>Quintilius Varus</hi> of this great
ſinne, unto whom and to the Legions under his
Governement, the right hand of the Lord of
Hoaſts had reached a more terrible blow, than <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>

ſome few yeares after the butcherie of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
                  <p>14. The ſecond bleſſing whereof the <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi>
was a pledge, whoſe conception had beene
foretold by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> was not exhibited till many
yeares after, and it was this, that Judah and the
houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſhould be more admirably deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the Aſſyrian, when he ſhould beſiege
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> more fiercely then <hi>Rezin,</hi> or <hi>Pekah</hi> had
done. And this was in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for
ſo the Prophet aſſures the people, <hi>that the rod of
Aſhur ſhould be broken as in the day of Midian,</hi> Iſaiah
9. 4. Which is in effect, as if he had ſaid, [The Lord
will be with us after as wonderfull a manner as
he was with <hi>Gideon,</hi> when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was oppreſſed
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:7898:214"/>
by the Midianites.] And ſo it fell out in the
dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that <hi>Senacheribs</hi> mighty Army
was deſtroyed by a more fearefull deſtruction,
then the Midianites had beene by <hi>Gideon.</hi> And
unto this ſtrange defeat of the Aſſyrian, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
words <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9. 4, 5. do referre. <hi>Thou haſt
broken the yoke of his burthen, and the ſtaffe of his
ſhoulders, the rod of his Oppreſſour: as in the day of
Midian. For every battell of the Warrier is with
confuſed noyſe, and garments rolled in bloud: but
this ſhall be with burning and fewell of fire.</hi> Now of
this diſaſter, which befell <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the ſtrange
deliverance of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David</hi> by
it, the <hi>Emmanuel</hi> there promiſed by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was
the pledge or aſſurance, as the Prophet in the
next word intimates, <hi>For unto us a Childe is borne,
and unto us a little one is given, &amp;c. Iſaiah</hi> 9. 6.
That by this Childe the Prophet meant the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel</hi>
mentioned, <hi>Chapter</hi> 7. is acknowledged by
all, even by ſuch, as admit of no more <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuels</hi>
then one, to wit, our Saviour <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But
ſeeing the <hi>Emmanuel</hi> there literally meant, was
given as a pledge or comfort unto <hi>Iudah</hi> in this
particular diſtreſſe, certainely hee was borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, though not borne only as a pledge of
this deliverance, but of a farre greater Deliverer
or Saviour to come, for whoſe ſake alone this
deliverance, and all other of his people from their
enemies (both bodily and ghoſtly) were ſent
from God. And beſt Interpreters take thoſe
words of <hi>Iſaiah, 2. Kings 9. 34. I will defend this
Citie to ſave it for mine owne ſake, and for my ſervant</hi>
                     <pb n="414" facs="tcp:7898:215"/>
Davids <hi>ſake,</hi> to be literally meant not of <hi>David,</hi>
but of <hi>Davids</hi> ſonne, the true <hi>Emmanuel.</hi> But to
returne to the 9. of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> upon that viſion of
that great overthrow of <hi>Senacheribs</hi> Armie, the
Prophet takes his <hi>riſe</hi> to view a greater victory
a more potent Enemie in the ſame place, where
<hi>Senacheribs</hi> Armie was overthrowne, and that
was not neere <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but in the borders of
<hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Napthali</hi> neere to <hi>Libanus,</hi> in that
Country whoſe Inhabitants <hi>Senacheribs</hi> prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour
<hi>Tiglath-Pileſer,</hi> had firſt captivated, and
in the ſame place our Saviour gave his Apoſtles
power over Satan and his Angels, who had his
people in greater ſubjection then the Aſſyrians
had them in the time of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> For hee had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
many of their bodies after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
then any earthly Tyrant could have them in
poſſeſſion. Now when the Prophet foretels as
well the victory of the Angell of the Lord over
the Aſſyrian, as the victory of Chriſts Apoſtles
over Satan, he gives this one ſigne of both, <hi>For
unto us a Childe is borne, and unto us a little one is
given, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe words may referre, both to
the type, and to the antitype in the literall ſenſe:
but immediatly after the light of that great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
which all this while had beene under the
cloude of the literall ſenſe, breakes forth in its
proper native luſtre: For the words following
can be meant of none but Chriſt: <hi>And his name
ſhall be called Wonderfull, Counſellor, the mighty
God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace. Of
the encreaſe of his governement and peace, there ſhall
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:7898:215"/>
be no end: upon the throne of</hi> David, <hi>and upon his
Kingdome to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and with juſtice from henceforth even for ever:
the Zeale of the Lord of Hoaſts will performe this.</hi>
As for the former paſſages concerning the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi>
and <hi>Mahar-ſhalal-haſh-baz,</hi> they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
meant of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his ſonne, and yet are
withall proofes no leſſe concludent againſt the
Jew, no leſſe pregnant teſtimonies of our beliefe
concerning the miraculous birth of our Lord and
Saviour Chriſt, than the teſtimonies laſt cited out
of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9. 6, 7. or of his Godhead, or everlaſting
Kingdome. For however ſuch immediate viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or unvailed revelations of Chriſt, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
in theſe two verſes and in the 53 Chapter, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
addes, were the moſt ſublime kinde of
prophecies, ſuch as few other Prophets beſides
<hi>David,</hi> could ever attaine unto, (theſe having the
like priviledges amongſt the Prophets, that <hi>Peter,
Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> had amongſt the fellow Apoſtles,
permitted to aſcend the Mount with Chriſt, and
ſee the transfiguration or glory of his Kingdom;)
Yet for our inſtruction, predictions of Chriſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically
propheticall, or prophetically typicall, are
moſt admirably concludent (as was premiſed
<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 11. §. 2, 3.</note> before) eſpecially, when the ſame words ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the literall ſenſe fit both the pledge
and the myſterie pledged, or the Evangelicall
myſterie according to the improvement in a
more exquiſite ſenſe, then they did the type or
hiſtoricall event.</p>
                  <p>15. To conclude this parallell betweene the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:7898:216"/>
Evangeliſt and the Prophet, with the contrary
demeanours of <hi>Ahaz</hi> and the bleſſed Virgin, upon
delivery of the like meſſage from the Lord. The
Lord proffers <hi>Ahaz</hi> a ſigne whereſoever, or in
what kinde ſoever he would aſke it: but he will
not aſke it, nor will hee tempt the Lord. <hi>Iſay. 7.
11,</hi> 12. As if not to rely upon the ſtrength of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria,</hi>
had beene to tempt the Lord. Nor will
hee beleeve the Prophet when hee gives him a
ſigne moſt ſutable to the ſignes of that preſent
time. For <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his people had a faire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to beleeve all that the Prophet had
aſſumed to make good, upon the conception and
birth of <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> from the experienced ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
or happy <hi>Omen</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his former ſonne,
whom he named (upon the occaſion fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
<hi>Shear-iaſhab.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The bleſſed Virgin after ſhee had ſeene the
Angell of the Lord, and talked with him, did

by matter of fact. Beſides this Hymne,
the next Evangelicall narration to his birth was
his circumciſion, &amp; impoſition of the name <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
Now, albeit his circumciſion be not mentioned

But was it any where either expreſly foretold,<note place="margin">Cap. 35</note> or
concludently portended by matter of fact, that
the Sonne of God, (God bleſſed for ever) ſhould
be circumciſed? Yes: all this was moſt conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
fore-ſignified, and that in ſuch a peculiar
manner, as cannot exactly be paralleld with any
of the former generall wayes, according to which
the incarnation of the Word, or other articles

to be fore-ſhadowed, or to be fulfilled.
Teſtimony expreſſe and direct, there is none, I
know, that the Sonne of God ſhould be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
and yet the circumciſion of God in the

literally included in the Covenant betweene
God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. 6, 7. <hi>I will make thee

yet the Covenant whereof Circumciſion

leſt Gods ſpeciall favour to this ſonne of promiſe
might exclude <hi>Iſmael</hi> from bleſſings ordinarie;
and hence he preferres this modeſt petition unto
God, <hi>ver. 18. O that</hi> Iſmael <hi>might live before thee.</hi>

rather league this was betwixt God &amp; <hi>Abraham,</hi>
comes to be diſcuſſed in the unfolding of Gods
oath to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; the conſecration of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
ſeed to his everlaſting Prieſthood of everlaſting
bleſſing. The legal covenant (afterwards co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed
by oath,) was now begun &amp; ſolemnized on <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
part, (as ſolemne leagues in thoſe Eaſterne
Countries uſually were,) by effuſion of blood, his
owne, and his families, and ſo to be continued
in his poſterity throughout their generations.
And in as much as circumciſion was the ſigne or
ſolemne ceremony of this mutuall league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed;
it is neceſſarily implyed (by the tenour of the
ſame mutuall Covenant) that God ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
or ſeale the league after the ſame manner,
and to receive the ſame ſigne of circumciſion in
his fleſh, which <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed had done.
Againe, in as much as this league was eſtabliſhed
with <hi>Iſaac Abrahams</hi> ſonne by promiſe; this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
includes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the only ſonne of God who
was to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, ſhould be circumciſed
in his fleſh, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> had beene. And this part of
the Covenant was performed on Gods part in
the perſon of his Sonne at the circumciſion of
the childe <hi>Ieſus.</hi> It was impoſſible that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
ſhould be fully accompliſhed ſo long as
<hi>Abrahams</hi> corruptible ſeede did only beare the
ſeale or ſigne. For it was to be an everlaſting
Covenant: and to ſeale an everlaſting Covenant
with an everlaſting ſeale in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour
according to the fleſh, was a matter as
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:7898:219"/>
difficult, as to imprint a permanent ſtamp or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
upon a ſtreame of running water. This
Covenant could not begin to be in <hi>eſſe,</hi> or beare
a true and ſolid everlaſting date, untill it were
ſealed in the fleſh of the promiſed ſeed. As was
his perſon in whom this Covenant was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
ſuch was the ſeale; and ſuch did the
Covenant thus ſealed, become, truely immortall
and everlaſting, never to be reiterated after it
was once accompliſhed in him, which was not
done, but begun upon the eight day after our
Saviours birth. That which was now begun by
him, and in part ſealed by him, by the ſeale of
circumciſion in his fleſh; was afterwards to be
accompliſhed, and finally ſealed by his bloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
upon the Croſſe. The continuall practiſe
of circumciſion by the Jew (though he be ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and blinde, and perceiveth it not) is unto us
a legible character, and an undoubted viſible
pledge, that God who made this Covenant with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> was to be incarnate, or to aſſume fleſh,
by aſſuming <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; to the end he might
interchangeably ſeale this Covenant in his fleſh.
But ſeeing as well <hi>Abrahams</hi> preſent ſeed as their
Families, were ſtill ſubject to mortality; it was
moſt fitting &amp; requiſite, that circumciſion ſhould
be continued throughout all their generations, in
teſtification of their hope and expectance of the
promiſed ſeed, unto whoſe fleſh the ſeale of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
being once put, the Covenant ſealed
was to ſtand faſt for ever, without reiteration or
addition of any other ſeale. In Him all Gods
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:7898:219"/>
promiſes are yea, and Amen. Whileſt hee was
circumciſed God was circumciſed, and man was
circumciſed; and this Covenant or league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and man, was mutually ſealed by
God and man, with one and the ſame numericall
ſeale. Howbeit, as was intimated before, this
glorious Covenant thus joyntly ſealed up in
him, was not to beare its everlaſting date, untill
it were further ratified, and finally ſealed by his
bloudy ſacrifice upon the Croſſe, unto which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he was initiated by his circumciſion. The
Sacrament of circumciſion was not ſo properly
aboliſhed as changed into the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
and ſo changed by that Commiſſion which
this our everlaſting Prieſt gave to his Apoſtles
and Miniſters after his reſurrection. <hi>Go yee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and teach all Nations baptizing them in the
name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy
Ghoſt,</hi> Math. 28. 19. It was by this new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
ſo changed, that he which now ſeekes to
circumciſe others, or ſuffers himſelfe to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed;
doth but labour as much as in him
lyes to diſſolve, and diſſipate this glorious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
betwixt God and man, thus joyntly ſealed
up in one and the ſame individuall perſon, with
one and the ſame numericall ſeale, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
authentiquely and finally ſealed by the
bloudy ſacrifice of the ſame perſon God and man
vpon the Croſſe. And however the Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
the Sarazens, and Perſians, with other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous
imitatours of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, have run
mad with love of this ceremonie of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:7898:220"/>
ſometimes moſt loathſome and odious to
fleſh and bloud, whileſt it was pleaſing unto God;
yet the practiſe of it, is now more abominable
unto God that gave it for a ſigne of his everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Covenant, than it was pleaſing to him, or
diſpleaſing to men, whileſt the Law of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
was in force. And for this reaſon, S. <hi>Paul</hi>
wiſheth the ſame curſe or puniſhment unto ſuch
as preſſed the neceſſity of circumciſion upon
Chriſts Church, which God himſelfe had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto ſuch as during the time of the Law did
neglect, contemne, or omit it. <hi>The uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
manchilde,</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, Gen. 17.
14.) whoſe fleſh of his fore-skin is not circumciſed,
that ſoule ſhall be cut off from his people.</hi> I would
(ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Gal. 5. 12.)</hi> or as ſome read, <hi>I would
to God they were even cut off that trouble you.</hi> Such
he meanes, and ſuch alone, as did trouble them
by preſſing the neceſſity of circumciſion upon
them, which had beene baptized in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3 That the Heathens were concluded in this
league, the moderne Jew cannot deny. For not
only <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſonnes, but every Male in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
though bought with money, was to receive
the ſigne of this Covenant in his fleſh. But ſaith
the Jew, ſeeing they came into this league by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
circumciſion, what is this to you Gentiles
which will not be circumciſed? The Apoſtle S.
<hi>Paul</hi> hath moſt divinely diſſolved this knot, <hi>Rom.
4.</hi> 10. His words are ſo plaine that they need no
Comment, but onely to adde this circumſtance
which is likely S. <hi>Paul</hi> tooke for granted, when he
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:7898:220"/>
made that excellent Comment upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his
words <hi>Gen. 15. 6. Abraham</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) beleeved in
God, and it was imputed unto him for righteouſneſſe.</hi>
Seeing the Scripture as S. <hi>Iames</hi> tells us, was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
when <hi>Abraham</hi> offred up his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> why
was not this teſtimony of God concerning <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
reſerved to that fact, or at leaſt to <hi>Abrahams</hi>
obedience in circumciſing himſelfe and his ſonne
<hi>Iſaac?</hi> Both theſe facts include a greater meaſure
of beleife in Gods promiſes, than <hi>Abraham</hi> gave
proofe of in the forecited place, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more capable of that praiſe or approbation.
But, if that approbation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith had
beene deferred untill the Covenant of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had beene ſubſcribed unto by <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
Jews might with more probabilitie have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that this righteouſneſſe which God imputes
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> had come by the deeds of the Lawes,
that none but ſuch as are circumciſed could be
partakers of it; Whereas on the contrary, this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
being given unto <hi>Abraham</hi> before hee
was circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed, cuts off the Jews title of boaſting
in circumciſion. This is the ground of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
reaſon <hi>Rom 4. 9, 10. For wee ſay that faith was
reckoned unto Abraham for righteouſneſſe.</hi> How was
it then reckoned? When he was in circumciſion
or in uncircumciſion? Not in circumciſion, but in
uncircumciſion. <hi>And he received the ſigne of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of the faith, which
he had yet being uncircumciſed, that hee might be the
Father of all them that beleeve, though they be not cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumciſed,
that righteouſneſſe might be imputed unto
them alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:7898:221"/>
                     <hi>And againe</hi> Gal. 3. 8. And the Scripture foreſeeing
that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith,
preached before the Goſpel unto Abraham, ſaying, In
thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed. So then they which be
of faith, are bleſſed with faithfull Abraham.</p>
                  <p>4 Againe, God in ſo diſpoſing of times and
ſeaſons that his onely ſonne ſhould be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon the firſt of January, did ſignifie that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
which the Gentiles or Heathens were to
have in this Covenant. For this was the day
wherein the Romanes, in whoſe dominions and
under whoſe government he was borne, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
to <hi>Ianus,</hi> to them a God of peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie;
the day wherein they did mutually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
their ſolemne ſalutations or good wiſhes for
a happy yeare, and for good luck ſake, as wee ſay,
did ſend gifts one to another, as honey and other
like ſweet meats, and coyne, <hi>ut dulces dies anni à
dulcibus rebus auſpicarentur,</hi> as Emblemes of their
good wiſhes for many pleaſant and happy dayes.</p>
                  <p>And whileſt they were thus imployed in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
each other with gifts and mutuall preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of peace and many happy dayes; God gives
his only Sonne unto them (and to them all) who
was the Prince of that peace; the common foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of all that happineſſe, which they could
wiſh one to another. Albeit the Sonne of God
were borne eight dayes before, yet he was given
unto us upon the day of his circumciſion. His
circumciſion was the deſignement or dedication
of him for the ſalvation of mankinde. <hi>Behold</hi>
(ſaith the Angel, <hi>Luke 2. 10) I bring you good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:7898:221"/>
of great joy, which ſhall be to all people.</hi> The
Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> foretold this joy, not only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the birth, but to the circumciſion alſo
of the true Emmanuel. <hi>They joy before thee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the joy in Harveſt, and as men rejoyce when
they divide the ſpoile,</hi> Iſa 9. 3. <hi>For unto us a Childe is
borne, unto us a Sonne is given; and the government
ſhall be upon his ſhoulder, &amp; c,</hi> ver. 6.</p>
                  <p>But ſome there be, who will either denie, or
not beleeve, that our Saviour was circumciſed
upon the firſt of January, becauſe we have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
warrant for this opinion, than the tradition of
the church. But ſome of the ancient &amp; learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did think they had the teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
beſides the tradition of their Ancients. For
ſo they interpret thoſe words of S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,
Iohn</hi> 3. 30. He muſt encreaſe, but I muſt decreaſe;
as if they did containe a ſecret character of the
time wherein <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and our Saviour were
borne; the one upon the longeſt, the other upon
the ſhorteſt day in the yeare. And by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
our Saviour was circumciſed upon the
eighth day of January. For my part I dare not
contradict this kinde of interpretation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
being fully perſwaded that the holy Ghoſt
doth oft-times fore-ſignifie greateſt myſteries as
well by meere character of words, as by words
aſſertive or matter of fact.</p>

(as the Authors of this opinion would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

this derivation,<note place="margin">Cap. 36</note> they would make the <hi>compound</hi>

divine nature, and the letter <hi>Shin</hi> interſerted into
this name, to be an Emblem of the incarnation
or humane nature aſſumed into the unity of the
perſon of the ſonne of God. This Etymologie
or derivation (as the Authors of it imagin) beſt
agrees with the Angels interpretation of the
name <hi>Ieſus</hi> before cited; becauſe <hi>Iehovah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

Whatſoever the opinion be in it ſelfe, the
allegation for confirmation of it, is not conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
For <hi>that,</hi> rightly examined, only inferres,
that <hi>Iehovah</hi> himſelfe, (hee that was eſſentially
God) and none beſides him, was to be our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
or the Saviour of the world. This is a truth
unqueſtionable, yet a truth which will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that whileſt he became the Saviour of the
world, he was to take no other name or title up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, beſides the proper and eſſentiall name of
God, only imbelliſhed with one letter. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> (as wee take it in our Creed)
given to our Saviour by the Angel, muſt draw
its pedegree from the ſame Hebrew <hi>roote</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive,</hi>
from which the name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> given to
others, is derived; yet the branches of the ſame
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:7898:223"/>
roote or primitive, (from any of which the name
<hi>Ieſus</hi> may be aptly alike immediatly deriued) dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
much. Firſt, wee may derive the word <hi>Ieſus</hi>
from the <hi>future tenſe</hi> of the Hebrew <hi>Iaſhang [Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vavit]</hi>
And thus the name in the Hebrew ſhould
be <hi>Iehoſhuah,</hi> whence he whom in our Engliſh we
call <hi>Ioſhua</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nun,</hi> and <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne
of God, ſhould have one and the ſelfe ſame name
in the Hebrew, as they have in the Greeke and
vulgar Latine. According to this derivation all
the prerogatives which <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the ſonne of
God can challenge before <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nun,</hi>
or others which have beene called <hi>Ieſus,</hi> muſt be
deduced only from the matter or manner of the
ſalvation which he beſtowes, not from any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
property or ſoveraignty of name. The ſame
name in the Hebrew is ſometimes read ſhorter,
not <hi>Iehoſhua,</hi> but <hi>Ieſhua,</hi> and from this later con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
name as well the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<hi>Ieſus</hi> is more immediatly and with leſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
derived. This later kinde of writing (or
contraction,) was more familiar among the Jews
in our Saviours time. And for this reaſon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Jews call him <hi>Ieſu,</hi> not in deſpight or moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery
(as ſome great<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus.</note> Clarks have beene perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
but out of an ordinary cuſtome of omitting

better facility of pronouncing. And as <hi>Druſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

notes, the omiſſion of this letter in proper names,
grew in uſe amongſt later Hebricians (ſuch as
lived ſince or about our Saviours time) upon the
ſame occaſions, that moved the ancient Latine
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:7898:223"/>
Fathers, to render the Hebrew <hi>Hoſeang,</hi> not as we
do now, <hi>Hoſeas,</hi> but <hi>Oſe.</hi> Whether we read <hi>Iehoſhua,</hi>
or <hi>Ieſhua,</hi> or <hi>Ieſhu</hi> in the Hebrew, the name in the
greeke or Latine is all one; and the meaning or
ſignification in the Hebrew the very ſame.</p>
                  <p>2 But albeit the name of this our Jeſus may
rightly be derived from the ſame branch of the
Hebrew <hi>Iaſhang,</hi> from which the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> as
it was given to <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nun,</hi> and to <hi>Ieſus</hi>
the ſonne of <hi>Ioſedec,</hi> tooke their originall, yet I
like beſt of their opinion, which derive the name
<hi>Ieſus</hi> (as given to the ſonne of God) not from the
<hi>participle, verbe,</hi> or <hi>adjective,</hi> but from the abſtract
or ſubſtantive <hi>Ieſhugnah,</hi> which is as much <hi>as ſalus

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:7898:224"/>
uſed in thoſe places of Scripture wherein
Salvation by Chriſt is promiſed. As <hi>Iſay 52. 10.
The Lord hath made bare his holy arme in the eyes of
all the Nations, and all the ends of the earth ſhall ſee
the</hi> Salvation <hi>of our God.</hi> And againe <hi>Iſai 56. 1.
Thus ſaith the Lord, keep ye judgement, and do juſtice:
for my ſalvation is neere to come, and my righteouſneſſe
to be revealed.</hi> And <hi>Abakuk</hi> 3. 18. Yet <hi>I will rejoyce
in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my</hi> Salvation, (ſo
our Engliſh,) <hi>or in God my ſalvation, or my Ieſus.</hi>
And againe, <hi>Iſay 49. 6. It is a light thing that thou
ſhouldſt be my ſervant to raiſe up the Tribes of Iacob,
and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael: I will alſo give
thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maiſt be my</hi>
Salvation <hi>unto the end of the Earth.</hi> Inſtantly after
God had ſaved Iſrael out of the hand of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
and drowned the Egyptians in the Sea, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and the Children of Iſrael ſang this ſong unto
the Lord. <hi>Exod 15. 1, 2. Hee hath tryumphed glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly;
the horſe and his rider hath he throwne into the
Sea. The Lord is my ſtrength and ſong, and he is become
my ſalvation,</hi> &amp;c. This deliverance of Iſrael from
the Egyptian thraldome and their ſafe conduct
through the red Sea, was but a type or ſhadow of
a greater deliverance to be wrought by the ſame
God for his people, for which they were to take
up the ſame ſong which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the children
of Iſrael here did; but with ſome additions or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
expreſſions, how the God of their ſtrength
ſhould become the God of their <hi>Salvation,</hi> or
their Jeſus. <hi>And in that day, thou ſhalt ſay, O Lord, I
will praiſe thee; though thou waſt angry with me, thine
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:7898:224"/>
anger is turned away, and thou comfortedſt me. Behold,
God is my ſalvation: I will truſt, and not be afraid, for
the Lord Iehovah is my ſtrength, and my ſong, hee is
alſo my</hi> Salvation. <hi>Therefore with joy ſhall yee draw
water out of the wels of</hi> Salvation. <hi>Iſai</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3.
Though theſe and many other places of the like
obſervation had their true hiſtoricall occaſions,
yet were they not exactly fulfilled according to
their propheticall importance, untill hee fulfilled
them, who was Jehovah, both Lord and God from
eternitie, not by a generall title, but by a diſtinct
and proper name given unto him by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
at his circumciſion. How the name
and office of Chriſt Jeſus, a King and Prieſt, was
both foreprophecied, and reſpectively foreſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
by <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nun,</hi> and by <hi>Ieſus</hi> the
ſonne of <hi>Iehoſedec,</hi> muſt be referred unto his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration,
to be the Prieſt after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 If followeth in the Creed, <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt
who is the only ſonne of God is our Lord.</hi> Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this title [Lord] be interſerted into this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
by way of anticipation, as the other title Chriſt
apparently is, may be doubted. He did beare the
name <hi>Ieſus</hi> from his Circumciſion, as wee do our
Chriſten names from the Font. This was his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
name; the other two were names of office.
<hi>Know yee,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts 2. 36 that that
Ieſu whom yee have crucified, him hath God made
both Chriſt and Lord,</hi> to wit, after they had cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him. Hee was anointed to his Propheticall
office at his Baptiſme, but thereby rather initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:7898:225"/>
to be, then actually made Chriſt and Lord.
Unto theſe two offices of everlaſting Prieſt, and
everlaſting King, hee was not actually anointed,
or fully conſecrated untill his reſurrection from
the dead. Was not then the Sonne of God, <hi>Lord</hi>
before his reſurrection? Yes, being God from
eternitie, hee was alſo Lord from eternity. So we
are taught by <hi>Athanaſius, The Father is Lord, the
Sonne is Lord, and the H. Ghoſt is Lord.</hi> Whoſoever
is truely God, is alſo truely Lord. And in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Lord, as there be not three Gods but
one God ſo there be not <hi>three Lords, but one Lord</hi>
in the bleſſed Trinitie. The Father is the onely
God, the onely Lord; the Sonne is the only God,
the onely Lord; the holy Ghoſt is the onely God,
the onely Lord. But whether this title of <hi>Lord,</hi> as
it is here inſerted in this article of the Creed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
no more, then that the Sonne of God, is the
true and onely Lord, with the Father and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt; or whether it were not before his birth
in ſome ſort peculiar to the Sonne, is a point nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cleare in it ſelfe, nor eaſie to be cleared; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ancient Tranſlators, (eſpecially the
Greeke and Latine) render the three originall
words, <hi>Elohim, Ieh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>vah,</hi> or the name of foure let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(however it be pronounced) and <hi>Adonai</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly
by <hi>Lord.</hi> And yet theſe three words in
the originall have their ſeverall ſignifications or
importances. To omit the word <hi>Elohim.</hi> About
the name of foure letters there is much contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
how it ſhould be pronounced, yet all agree
that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> and eſſence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:7898:225"/>
his moſt proper name, and admits no plurall. The
proper ſignification of the name <hi>Adonai,</hi> is as much
as <hi>Dominus</hi> or Lord.</p>
                  <p>4 The reaſon, as I take it, why the Greekes and
Latines have uſually but one expreſſion of both
names, is becauſe the ancient Hebrews did not
pronounce the name of foure letters; unleſſe it
were in the Sanctuary, or in ſolemne benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Nor did they write it ſo as it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
that is, with any proper vowels, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the vowells of <hi>Adonai,</hi> or of <hi>Elohim.</hi>
Not the Greekes and Latines onely, but the
Chaldee paraphraſe ſometimes reads <hi>Adonai,</hi>
where wee read <hi>Iehovah,</hi> or the name of foure let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And thus it doth not from miſtake of the
Hebrew vowells, which in the time of <hi>Onkelus</hi>
the later of the two Chaldee paraphraſes, were
not expreſt. <hi>And God ſaid to Moſes, I appeared to
Abraham, unto Iſaac, and Iacob, by the name of God
Almighty but by my name Iehovah was I not knowne
to them. Exod.</hi> 6. 3. Or as the Caldee, by the name
<hi>Adonai,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherfore ſay unto the Children of Iſrael,
I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the
burthens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of
their bondage,</hi> &amp;c. Some good writers in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of this place obſerve, that albeit <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> were in high favour with
God, yet they wrought no miracles as <hi>Moſes</hi> the
firſt among the ſonnes of men did. And hence
they infer, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did worke all his miracles
in the power and vertue of this name, whether
<hi>Iehovah</hi> or <hi>Adonai,</hi> which was firſt manifeſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

This was immediately imported in the name

did uſe the name <hi>Adonai</hi> in ſtead of the name of
foure letters, as moſt pertinent and moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
to this purpoſe. For it properly pertaines to
him who is not onely in himſelfe Almightie or

and inheritances; to depoſe greateſt Lords
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:7898:226"/>
and advance meaneſt ſervants. If the name of
foure Letters were to the ancient Hebrews as
<hi>Druſius</hi> with ſome others will have it, ineffable;
this was a true character of his incomprehenſible
nature, which they properly ſignifie. Nor doth
the uſuall ſubſtitution of <hi>Adonai,</hi> for the want of
foure letters want matter of more than gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
obſervation. This practiſe was a literall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
or Character of that which our Evangeliſt
hath expreſt in words aſſertive. <hi>Iohn 1. 18. No man
hath ſeene God at any time: the onely begotten Sonne,
which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared
him.</hi> In this declaration or expoſition of God
(whoſe incomprehenſible nature was charactred
by his ineffable name) made by the Sonne of God
incarnate, there was a greater improvement of
mans knowledge of God, in reſpect of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets had, than
there was in <hi>Moſes</hi> his knowledge of God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>Abrahams, Iſaacs,</hi> or <hi>Iacobs. Moſes</hi> and his
Succeſſors did ſee the performance of that, which
the name of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> or <hi>Adonai,</hi> firſt revealed to
<hi>Moſes</hi> did import, to wit, deliverance from their
bodily Enemies, and in that deliverance they had
a pledge of far greater bleſſings promiſed, which
yet they did not receive. For as our Apoſtle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies
<hi>Heb. 11. 39. Though Moſes amongst others,
through faith, obtained a good report; yet hee did not
receive the promiſe,</hi> that is, the bleſſing promiſed,
nor was the nature of man capable of this bleſſing
promiſed, untill that God, who was firſt revealed
unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> under the name of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> was made
Lord and Chriſt.</p>

6. It had beene a queſtion more worthy of
<hi>Druſius</hi> his paines, then all the queſtions which
he makes concerning the name of foure letters,
whether the name <hi>Adonai</hi> were not in ſome ſort
peculiar to the Sonne of God, or to <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, who
was to be made fleſh. That this name <hi>Adonai</hi>
is ſo peculiar to the Sonne of God as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is, I
dare not affirme. For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth no where to
my remembrance denote any other perſon in the
bleſſed Trinity beſides the Sonne; Whereas the
name <hi>Adonai</hi> is an expreſſion which many times
referres unto the Trinity or Divine nature. And
in this extent it muſt be taken, when it is ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
for the ineffable name of God, unleſſe ſome
ſpeciall circumſtances reſtraine it to the Sonne.
But in many paſſages of the old Teſtament, both
names are expreſt according to their proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants.
And in all theſe places the name <hi>Adonai</hi>
referres only to the Sonne, as the name of foure
letters denotes the Father. As in that 110 Pſalm,
where we read, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord,</hi> it is
in the originall <hi>Iehovah</hi> ſaid unto my Lord <hi>Adoni,</hi>
or <hi>Adonai.]</hi> And in this place the name of foure
letters referres onely to God the Father. But ſo
doth not the name <hi>Adoni</hi> denote either the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or the holy Ghoſt, but the Sonne alone. I
durſt not have beene ſo bold as to have gathered
this generall rule from mine owne obſervation,
unleſſe I had found it excellently obſerved and
proved at large by <hi>Petru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Cha.</hi> 8. It much affected this learned man, as it
will do any that is wiſe unto ſobriety, to ſee how
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:7898:227"/>
moſt of the Ancients, as wel in the Greek as in the
Latine Church, albeit they tooke no notice at all
of any difference betweene theſe two names of
God in the originall, did yet conſtantly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
the name of <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> when
hee is named in the ſame prayer or gratulatory
Hymne with God the Father. But this they
might learne either from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or from the
Apoſtles Creed. For ſo the bleſſing is, The grace
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God,
[not of the Lord God] &amp;c. And ſo in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Creed the title of Lord is appropriated unto
the Sonne of God, not added either to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Almighty, or to the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>7. But in many places of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein both names of God are ſpecified,
the name of <hi>Adonai,</hi> is placed before the name of
foure letters. And thus it happens, ſo farre as I
can obſerve, eſpecially in the ſerious ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or gratulatory expreſſions of Holy men, as
in that ſpeech of <hi>Gideon, Iudges 6. 13. Oh my Lord,
if God be with us, why then is all this befallen us?</hi>
And againe, <hi>Ioſuah 7. 7. Ioſhua ſaid, Alas O Lord
God, wherefore haſt thou at all brought this people
over Iordan &amp;c?</hi> The Evangelicall myſterie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in this forme of prayer or ſupplication is
excellently deciphered by <hi>Maſius</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon this place, with whoſe words gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the tradition or lyturgie rather of the
ancient Hebrewes of the <hi>Cabbaliſts</hi> I conclude

                     <hi>Ioſhua</hi> (ſaith he) calls God by 2 names,
when as chiefe Commander he ſpeaks in
behalfe of all the reſt. The one is <hi>Adonai:</hi>
the other <hi>Iehova.</hi> The former ſetteth out
Gods ruling power: the later hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
(as elſe where I have ſhewed) to
Gods Eſſence. Theſe 2. names often come
together in the moſt fervent prayers of
the Saints in the ſacred Story: as here
they doe. Namely, they inſpired with
the Holy Ghoſt doe, as (I conceive) the
Holy Church doth, praying for all things
from the Father for the Sonnes ſake. For
ſeeing <hi>Adonai</hi> (as I ſaid) hath an eye to
Gods ruling power; it agrees manifeſtly
to the Sonne, and repreſents him to us
by whom as God the Father made the
World; ſo hee ruleth it. In this point
the Diviner ſort of Hebrew Authors cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi> aſſent to us; when they
teach that the name <hi>Adonai</hi> is as it were
the key, by which entrance is opened to
God <hi>Iehova:</hi> that is, to God as it were,
hid in his owne Eſſence: and that it is
the treaſure, in which theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on us by <hi>Iehova</hi> are all depoſited;
And that moreover it denoteth the great
Steward, who diſpoſeth of all, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:7898:228"/>
there is no other way or courſe at
all to come to him; And that therefore
the Church thus begins her holy prayers:

my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.
