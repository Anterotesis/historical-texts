            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

on others; in the close you say, <hi>This makes them uncertain what to
say of infants dying before conversion. Some save them all,</hi> (which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

all; others professe the uncertainty of the thing, whether infants before
their conversion be within the Kingdome of Satan, or that of God.</hi> And
for proof of this last you referre the Reader to the letter <hi>K;</hi> and there you
alledge my words in my <hi>Apology page</hi> 64, 66. which speak not at all of
the uncertainty of the thing you were speaking of, to wit, <hi>the salvation
or damnation of infants dying before conversion,</hi> but the contrary, saying
expresly, That every infant is either in the visible Kingdome of <hi>God,</hi> or of
<hi>Satan,</hi> that is, elect, or reprobate. And for the certainty of the subject, I
conceive neither you nor I, nor any on earth are certain what child
of a Believer is elect, or reprobate. Sure I am Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> in his Sermon

<hi>to be the God of Believers, and of their seed.</hi> Besides, my words in my <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology
page</hi> 64, 66. which you alledge, speak onely of infants belonging
visibly to the Kingdome of the Devil or God; and I still deny that they
belong to either visibly, untill they make their profession, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

believe they are excluded from the Covenant of Grace, remission of sins, the
saving grace of the Spirit, till in the years of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

You are often told in my <hi>Examen</hi> as page 29, 38, 110, 154. and many
more places, that I avow exclusion of infants from baptism upon this ground
mainly, that there is no Institution of it gathered by precept or Apostolical
example, and therefore it is will-worship: As for a command of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
I conceive it is a brogated, and so can be no rule now about Baptism;
and the maintaining that a command of Circumcision sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of any, as being condemned in the first <hi>Councel</hi> by the Apostles, <hi>Acts
15.</hi> 28. &amp; 21. 25. Indeed to shew the weaknesse of Mr. <hi>Marshalls</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thus framed, <hi>The infants of believing parents are within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, therefore they are to partake of the seale of the Covenant,</hi>
which in Mr. <hi>Marshals</hi> language is all one with baptisme: I did say that
I did conceive the antecedent of his <hi>Enthymeme</hi> not true, <hi>Examen</hi> Part 3.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49607:7"/>
Sect. 1. page 39. conceiving that as your practise is, so Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to defend this conclusion; All the infants born of a believer by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
are to be baptized according to ordinary rule, and so I expressed my
selfe in my <hi>Examen</hi> Part 3. Sect. 15. <hi>Exercit.</hi> page 1. and elsewhere, and
then his antecedent must be thus, <hi>All the infants born of a believer are
within the Covenant of grace,</hi> or else his argument is manifestly inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
if we would prove, all infants of believers are to be baptized, because
some onely are in the Covenant of grace. Now I know not how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> meant any other, then the Covenant of saving grace
(of which I have given reasons not yet answered by Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> in my <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen</hi>
page 45. and could adde more if it were needful) and that the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
infants were in the covenant of saving grace in that God hath made
that promise to them. And in this sense I denied this proposition, <hi>All

it so fully in my <hi>Examen</hi> part 3. Sect. 4. that Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> renounc<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

which sense I have proved in my <hi>Apology</hi> Sect. 10. his first argument to be

the chief promises of the New Testament, and the first Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
this is the sign and seal, that the thing signified. The reason proceeds

               <p>Give me leave to tell you that I seldome meet with a passage that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49607:8"/>
hath more absurdity then this of yours. 1. You set not down right the terms of
your own proposition, which are not [<hi>the chief promises of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and the First Sacrament</hi>] but [<hi>having right to the chief promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the New Testament, and having right to the First Sacrament, if
the Lord have not put some impediment to their participation of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>]
as if you had forgotten so soon or could not analyse your own
proposition. 2. You tell us [this is the sign and seale, that the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied]
as if this were the nature of the terms. But what an illogical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
is this? Logicians call a reason from the nature of the terms, when
the terms are included, the one <hi>in Conceptu quidditativo alterius,</hi> so as
that the one cannot be conceived without the other. Now may not the chief
promises of the New Testament be conceived without the first sign and
seale? Did not God make the chief promises of the New and Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before ever any sign or seale was appointed, much more before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme?
Did not God make the chief promise <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>iure</hi> without the
other? If the terms were [having the chief promises of the New Testament,
and having the First Sacrament] yet there is no such connexion from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the terms. Innumerable may have, and have the chief promises of the
New Testament, that have not the first Sacrament, <hi>et vice versa.</hi> Else
you must hold worse positions then the Papists that none but baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have or can have the chief promises of the New Testament, and that
every baptized person hath the chief promises of the New Testament. There
is lesse connexion from the nature of the terms between the having right to
the chief promises of the New Testament, &amp; having right to the First Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the New Testament. For if you meane it of right before God,
thousands may have right in Gods election and covenant with Christ, that
are not in being, that are in their mothers womb, that are yet among in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
uncalled: have these right to the First Sacrament? If you mean it
of right <hi>in facie Ecclesiae</hi> onely, then I grant the proposition is true: but
your Minor hath clean another sense then your words and proofs import you
conceived of it: however this right comes meerly from Gods institution,
which is to be the rule of the Churches judging and administrators action,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49607:9"/>
and that is not from the right to the chief promises, but from profession of
faith arising from Gods will not the nature of the terms. There is no es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
connexion between them <hi>constitutive</hi> or <hi>consecutive,</hi> neither is one
of the definition or essential property to the other: and God hath much
more plainly put a barre against infant-baptisme then infant-communion,
not only in that there is neither expresse precept nor example for it in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
but also the very in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>titution excludes them, appointing it only to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

practise requiring it <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. besides the image of it in all ages of the
Church requiring profession of faith of some for them even in the baptisme
of infants. But you shew the nature of the terms in these words, <hi>This is
the sign and seal, that the thing signified.</hi> By your Logick then if the
chief promises of the New Testament be to be defined you would define
them to be the thing signified by the first Sacrament of the New Testament:
which were to define <hi>ignotum per ignotius,</hi> and by that which is meerly
extrinsecal to it. A promise is an action: the thing signified by the first
Sacrament is not only something to come but also something past as the
death, burial, resurrection of Christ in baptisme <hi>Rom. 6. 3, 4. Col.</hi> 2. 12.
the thing promised is something we are to have, the promise is Gods act,
the first Sacrament the administrators act. How inept a definition is such
a definition in which the <hi>genus</hi> doth not <hi>praedic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>or the whole definition is reciprocal with the <hi>definitum,</hi> besides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defects? But it maybe you meant that it is of the nature of the first

Were this so, you should not rightly argue: for then the right to
the promises should be derived from the seal, not to the seale from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
if the promise be of the nature of the seale, and not <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

absurdly is a seale of the Covenant made the <hi>Genus</hi> in the definition of a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49607:9"/>
sacrament being but a Metaphor, and books and Sermons stuffed with
collections of duties and priviledges about the Sacraments from a meer
Metaphor? A thing I am assured worthy Lamentation when I consider the
trouble it hath brought to many consciences, and disquiet in the Church.
But were it granted that the term, signe or seal were of the nature of the first
Sacrament, how doth it appear that it is the nature of the Sacrament to
signifie Gods promise to us rather then our promise to God? Though I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not but baptisme signifies and in a sense seales Gods promises to us, as
may be seen in my former writings, yet so farre as I am able to discern the
chief and primary use is to signifie our profession and promise to God, and
therefore it is required as our act and duty, and therein we are said to put
on Christ. And why then should we not rather say, that it is the nature
of baptisme to be a sign or seale of our profession, and then we have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
argument from the nature as you speak, from the use, as I would speak,
of the first Sacrament to prove that infants are not to be baptized, then that
they are. The trueth is Sacraments are not signes natural but positive, and so
have no nature to sign or seale but by institution, and therefore there's no
connexion, or right between the Covenant and seal, as they speak, from
the nature of the tenns, but by Gods institution. And therefore Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi>
did more considerately ascribe it to Gods will, then you do to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it
from the nature of the terms, you miscarry as much in that which followes
when you say, <hi>The reason proceeds not from every thing signified to every
sign, but from the chief thing signified to the first sign:</hi> yet before you
expressed the nature of the terms thus, <hi>The one is the sign, the other the
thing signified,</hi> and you give no reason why there should be more connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
between the chief things signified, and the first sign, then the not chief
things signified, and the second, nor do I know by what rule you proceed
in making some promises of the New Testament chief, and some not: It

sealed by Circumcision belonged to <hi>Melchizeck, Lot</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and so
if there be such a connexion between the chief promise and the first seale
they should have been circumcised as well as the Jewes: and it is as strange
to me how you can make the promise of the Messias comming from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

the true knowledge of the circumstances concerning them will not appear
till the day of the revelation of the righteous iudgement of God. <hi>And I

are cited, one of Mr. <hi>Marshals,</hi> which onely declares his own conceit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
another point, that <hi>supposing infant-baptisme a nullity he cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how any in the world should this day be lawfully baptized,</hi> and
another passage out of my <hi>Apology</hi> page 54. which is cited by you maimed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as <hi>Psalm</hi> 91. 11. was cited <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 6. leaving out five lines that come
between [<hi>perplexities</hi>] and [<hi>for besides</hi>] without any <hi>&amp;c.</hi> perverting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the sense, as if the words [<hi>for besides, &amp;c.</hi>] were a reason of that you
cite before, whereas they are a reason of that which I expresse; but you
leave out, <hi>that I do not think an unbaptized person receiving the Lords
Supper is either such a new opinion or practise, as Mr.</hi> Marshall <hi>made it.</hi>
And yet in the words as you cite them, there is no proof of that you charge
me with. There is no mention at all of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and that which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Constantine</hi> is done without any approbation. Nor will it follow
from my determination, that because I say, <hi>if it be stood upon in point of
conscience, so as in no case an unbaptized person is to be permitted to partake
of the Lords Supper, it will of necessity make many superstitious perplexities
in Ministers, and inferre many an unnecessary schisme;</hi> therefore I esteem
baptisme a needlesse rite, that men who are meet to receive it may very
well be without it. This argument (and such I take your proof to be)
I would say, if I may use that Schoole expression any more, is <hi>a baculo ad
angulum.</hi> And yet a man would think you had need of a strong proof to
make men believe that I hold baptisme a needlesse rite, who have suffered
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49607:14"/>
and still suffer very much for my opposing infant-baptisme. But my words
truly understood do inferre the contrary to that you charge me with, sith
they assert baptisme afore the Lords supper necessary to be stood upon in
point of prudence for right order, and intimate the like in point of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
except in some cases. When I consider this dealing with me I cannot
guesse why you should thus abuse me in this so credible a thing, unlesse you
would slily insinuate as if I were of the <hi>Socainians</hi> mind in this, and thereby
help to loade me with the most unbrotherly charge of Socinianizing begun
by Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> in the beginning of his <hi>Defence,</hi> for which the Lord forgive
him and you.</p>

my own confession (which I am sure you did not) you go beyond your line
to judge my secret practises, yea my very thoughts, for carelessenes is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of cares which are thoughts. You say, <hi>I am a very bold man,</hi> but you no
where find in me such boldnesse as this to judge a mans thoughts. You
might do well to remember what is said <hi>Mat. 7. 1. James</hi> 3. 1. But for
the thing you say, <hi>my infant-baptisme according to my arguments must
be null, and as yet it seems I have not received another baptisme.</hi> Let
it be granted <hi>that my infant-baptisme according to my arguments must
be null,</hi> that is as I understand insufficient for the doing of the duty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
baptized according to Christs appointment (which yet you have not so
much as attempted to prove) and that I have not yet received another bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
how doth this prove my carelessenesse of mine own baptisme? For
if it were true indeed that according to my arguments my infant-baptisme
were null, yet if it did not so appear to me (as I confesse I was once doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as my words <hi>Exercit.</hi> pag. 22. shew, conceiving the maine use of
baptisme being a confirming of my profession of Christ, by that right an after
profession might ratify a former baptisme though not every way right,
though I dare not rest upon that conceit) and therefore I did not receive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49607:14"/>
baptisme, that would prove I was not altogether carelesse of my
own baptisme. But what? if I did conceive my infant-baptisme a nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and yet doubted whether any could now be rightly baptized, because
no unbaptized person can give baptism, as Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> professeth in his
<hi>Defence</hi> page 245. or because none can now give the spirit, and therefore
received not baptisme yet, this might free me from your charge of careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my own baptisme. Again if I were resolved that right baptism might
be had notwithstanding these doubts, and were resolved to receive it, but
either waited to see what the <hi>Assembly</hi> would do about examining the point
of <hi>Paedobaptisme,</hi> or the Churches of <hi>New England,</hi> or how I might do
my duty to Christ with least offence to the State, or to my brethren in the
Ministery, and with most satisfaction to my own conscience concerning the
administrator, administration and other circumstances about it, I might be
rather over-careful then carelesse of my own baptism for ought you knew to
the contrary, and consequently your accusation of me might be (as it was)
both rash and false. Will you say the Ministers about <hi>London,</hi> that have
differred adminstring the Lords Supper for many years for want of settled
discipline are carelesse of the Lords Supper? and yet were not you partial
I were more excusable in my action about this thing. But I hope your

separaring from any Church of Christ that is in any other way of discipline

a manifest readinesse to hold communion with all the Churches of Christ
in the things of Christ, and accordingly to shew a real willingnesse to have
communion with any particular Church of Christ according as the hand
of God shall give opportunity, and true seasonablenesse of and for the same.

not moved any more about it. Which I wrote, because I knew that very
many writers both antient and latter do very probably from expresse words
in that place conceive, that <hi>Paul</hi> did rebaptize, whereas there is not any
probability, that any infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Antients (that I know) ever gone about to prove it from any example in

set down my judgement of the thing, whether rebaptizing were lawful or
not, but onely questioned the proofes alledged to make it unlawful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they yielded good arguments. I know there was another argument

it may seeme would the <hi>Assembly</hi> build on it by their omitting it in the

positive things so as to conclude thence any thing to bind us as <hi>uredivino</hi> by
Gods appoinntment. And I conceive they serve for no better purpose,

Sir, what I said, and to what end, I expressed plainly enough in my <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>
page 91. The occasion of printing what I conceived, was a passage
in Mr. <hi>Marshalls Defence,</hi> which he stuffed with all the exceptions he could
thrust in against my person, but answered little or nothing punctually in the
maine points of the dispute, (which praevarication, I may perhaps in time
discover also, in your dispute (chap. 5.) of your ANABAPTISME)
The occasion of speaking in private conference, was, to shew my sensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the misery of the Land, by reason of the present differences, upon
some speech that was moved by some friend of mine, (as I remember,)
when the <hi>Assembly</hi> brought into the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> their <hi>Petitior,</hi>
desiring power to suspend persons from the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> for all scandals,
without restriction; and asserted the <hi>Presbyterian Government,</hi> (unto
which they advised the Parliament,) <hi>to be</hi> jure Divino, <hi>by the will
and appointment of Jesus Christ.</hi> What I spake then, and since printed;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49607:18"/>
was to shew my compassion of my native Countrey like to be ruined, by the
violent asserting things disputable, to be <hi>ure Divino;</hi> and thereby neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitating

doubts; much lesse did <hi>I declare my self a compleate</hi> ERASTIAN,
that is in your sense one that holds with ERASTUS in all things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he differs from BEZA in the disputes between them. For whereas

spared to say, that the Magistrate may in the New Testament (though

the</hi> Erastians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>do oppose not only the institution, but the Lawfulnesse and
agreeablenesse to the word of God of a Church-government distinct from
the civill;</hi> yet you cannot shew that I hold either of these positions. I
confesse I have read ERASTUS his <hi>Theses &amp; Confirmatio thesium;</hi>
but I could not do it so exactly, as I would have done it, if I had had <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's</hi>
book to compare with it. I have read that which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>
disputes against <hi>Erastus</hi> but it doth not satisfy me, in that he dictates ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things without proof, which are most necessary to be proved; and proves
something by the sayings of Authors, that deserve to be examined; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times omits in reciting his Antagonists words, that which is either <hi>most</hi>
or very <hi>material;</hi> and makes not his own answers punctual; which things
Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> also chargeth him with, about another point; besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
incoherent, and imperfect speeches, and inserting things impertinent.
Besides in this dispute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I conceive, Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> doth yield that, which
overthroweth that which he concludeth for. As when in his <hi>Divine right
of Church-government</hi> chap. 4. q. 1. page 223. he hath these words, <hi>It
is evident from the text</hi> Mat. 18. 15. <hi>that Christ speaks of such sins in
a speciall manner committed against me or a particular brother, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49607:18"/>
are within the verge of my power or his to pardor, as not being yet publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scandalous.</hi> which if true, then it can be meant onely of personal inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which alone a private person hath power to pardon, and so is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
how to correct scandals under that notion, which Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi>
contends so much for, in his <hi>Aarons rod blossoming,</hi> book 2. chap. 9.

sect. 2. page 37. and all Logicians acknowledge that an argument <hi>à com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratis</hi>
is but Topical, yea easily overthrown if any disparity be assigned.
And this is enough (though much more may be said) to shew that <hi>Mat.

27. art. 4. to prove, <hi>neither Sacrament may be dispensed by any, but
a Minister of the word lawfull ordained,</hi> the Scripture no where calling
the Sacraments mysteries, but the doctrine of the Gospel; however the
Greek Fathers oft call them so. As for binding, and loosing though I
conceive Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath more exactly disputed this matter in his book
of the power of keyes, chap. 4. then others, yet I conceive it more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to other places in <hi>Matthew</hi> (leaving Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> to justify his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
in his preface to his book of the <hi>Calender of the Jewes</hi> out of the
Talmudists as he conceives fit) as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 4. &amp; 11. 28. besides <hi>Acts
15. 28. Revel. 2. 24. Luke</hi> 11. 46. to draw the Metaphor from bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and loosing burdens, rather then prisoners; which is confirmed in that
the phrase is not [<hi>whomsoever</hi>] but [<hi>what things soever ye shall bind on
earth] Mat.</hi> 18. 18. and this may very well stand with the coherence,
signifying Gods ratifying in heaven the Commands of the Apostles, and the
Church on earth in the matters wherein they are to be obeyed v. 17. and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49607:19"/>
so the binding and loosing belongs not to <hi>vindicative judicature</hi> as by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
but to <hi>Stewardly declarative authority</hi> what is to be done
or not to be done; and consequently proves not juridical Excommunication. I
add that Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> in his <hi>Aarons rod blossoming</hi> book 3. c. p. 412, 413. will
not have binding and loosing by a dogmatical <hi>authoritative</hi> declaration of
the will of Christ here excluded, but proves this sense from <hi>Mat. 28. 20.
Acts</hi> 15. 28. and from the coherence with the 17. v. As for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5.
Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> cha. 9. 4, 5. page 329. denieth not <hi>many learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
to conceive, that delivering to Satan might be a bodily punishment
or conjoined therewith, &amp;c.</hi> yea he addeth, <hi>and the learned</hi> Molineus
<hi>denyeth delivering to Satan to be expounded of Excommunication, and will
have the destruction of the flesh to be some bodily tormenting of his Body
by Satar, and so do sundry of the Fathers, especially</hi> Ambrose, Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,

they may be said to do it, <hi>because they mourned that he

they were gathered together, ver. 4. now the phrase of <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away from them,</hi> compared with those places in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> with
the Apostles speech ver. 5. is more likely to be meant of killing then Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating.
And the putting it, ver. 13. in such an abrupt manner like
to that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 7. doth give great cause to imagine it hath the same
sense. But if it be a command, and be referred to Excommunication with
<hi>the judging them that are withir,</hi> ver. 12. yet it cannot be gathered from
the text that this was the juridical Excommunication contended for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
in some Officers, or the people with the Officers as superiour judges:
but rather by verses 9, 10, 11, 12. precedent, this <hi>judging</hi> and <hi>putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
belongs to every private Christian jointly in a constituted Church, or
severally by themselves. I have read Mr. <hi>Gillespies Aarons rod blossom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49607:19"/>
and I think the strength of all is in the 9. chapter of his 2. book:
in which I doubt whether any of his 21. arguments will prove such a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rensical
Ecclesiastick government, as he contends for. The argument
from two distinct governments, and judicatories to censure vicious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
(in which Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> in his first book seemes to be most elaberate)
in the Jewish policy to prove the like to be among Christians is many
wayes faulty. It will hardly be proved the Priests had peculiar cognizance of
scandalous manners, or that any was kept from the sacrifices for moral
uncleannesse, much lesse that the reason is good, men were kept away for
legal uncleannesse from the sacrifices, <hi>Ergo</hi> much more for moral, or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for legal pollution typifies exclusion for moral in the Christian
Church. You say truly in answer to Mr. <hi>Cotton first part of your Dissuasive</hi>
chap. 7. pag, 172. <hi>There is no argumenting from symbolick types except
where the spirit of God in Scripture appl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es a type to such a signification
and use.</hi> Nor is the Jewish policy a patterne for us. If it were we must
have a Bishop answering to an High Priest, a Parliament consisting of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Nobles, as they had their <hi>Synedrium</hi> at Jerusalem of Priests and
Elders of the People. These arguments cannot stand without asserting
that the Jewish judicial lawes binde still. I have bin the larger in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in some writings especially of your Nation, to be an <hi>Erastian</hi> is now
counted an high crime, and if the <hi>advice of the Assembly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a confession of faith</hi> chap. 30. should be established as a law, assertion
of a Church-government corrective of manners by censures in a juridical
way would be pressed on us as of Divine institution distinct from the Civil
Magistrate, which I conceive it concerns the Assertors better to prove, then
yet appears they have done, or else they will in pressing it on others usurpe
dominion over other mens fiath. But sure in many particulars I am not
of <hi>Erastus</hi> his minde, and therefore you do ill to terme me a <hi>compleate
Erastian.</hi> And though I find not by <hi>Bullingers</hi> and <hi>Gualther's</hi> letters to

Christs, as you, and your fellow-Commissioners did take exception at the

punishment as Excommunication without liberty of Appeale (if by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Assembly of Elders) on ministers and people, even the chiefest, not as
Arbitrators to whom the parties referre the matter, but as Ecclesiastical
Officers to whose judgement they must stand whether they will or no, will be

against whom you pleade may not acquit their Prelacy which they
claime from the dominion you charge them with, out of these texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
as well as you. But in this I do not avow, <hi>there is no such thing as
any censure of Excommunitation,</hi> as you accuse me: yea I do expressely
grant <hi>a social medicinal Excommunication by the whole Church from all

and other places, as in my <hi>Apology</hi> page 93. may be
seen. And I think the Congregational way in this
nearer to the use of Excommunication in Scripture then
the Presbyterian, though I think they misse in two
things. 1. That they make it an act of superiority
and jurisdiction, or, as they speak, of the power of
the keyes in the whole Church over the person censured. 2. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
this power only to that particular congregation of which the offender
is a fixed member, which I conceive common to any other Church or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in another Congregation, and is in effect nothing else but the non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49607:21"/>
which they ascribe to one Church towards another. Nor do I
conceive what other Excommunication Christians could in the primitive
times exercise or did exercise one towards another, when <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> would have excommunicated <hi>Polycrates</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or the

Bishop of <hi>Caesarca</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> holding with <hi>Cyprian</hi> about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization
of persons baptized by heretiques, then this non-communion.
And for the texts <hi>Mat. 16. 19. Mat. 18.</hi> 16, 17, 18. I am not yet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the interpretation I gave in my <hi>Apology</hi> page 91. but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

you charge me with, but onely a declaration of my opinion in point of
prudence, that the not devolving so much jurisdiction (as some desire) on
a Presbytery doth not so much disadvantage the Church, as some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
for reformation of manners, but onely for suppressing the dissenters in
opinion, who are for the most part the most consciencious, and right-hearted;
For usually the ruling Elders are Magistrates, or both teaching and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Elders are chosen and act according to their minde, and serve their
ends. And therefore if the Christian Magistrate be good, there's no great
losse to the Church concerning the reforming of vicious manners, though
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49607:22"/>
he Presbytery have not such power as some desire: if bad, little is done by the
Presbytery. And for errors in opinion they are scarce ever amended by bare
Excommunication, for that (if there be any number of dissenters) doth but u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
produce a schisme, but by teaching and cleering truth with meeknesse
and forbearance one towards another, and a freedome to debate things in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi>
which is, I suppose, the proper use of them, and not to determine
things and impose lawes the persons censured being never heard. This I
said to allay the heate of men in engaging a Kingdome to warre upon such
a cause. But because this is onely a point of prudence from experience I
leave this to be considered by those that are better acquainted with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affaires then I am. The thing you charge me with is no where as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
