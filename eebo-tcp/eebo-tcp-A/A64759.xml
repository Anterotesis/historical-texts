            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had deſigned this ſmall Treatiſe (being the firſt fruits
of my ſtudy in Antiquities) for your honoured Father;
but failing of my purpoſe by reaſon of his death (which
was untimely to his friends, though not to himſelf) I
thought I might not (without being highly injurious)
preſent a thing once devoted to him to any elſe beſides your ſelf, who
as his heir might lay a juſt claime to it, and alſo to my moſt humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
I promiſe my ſelf you will vouchſafe it a kind entertainment,
ſince (I know) both your goodneſſe and your intereſt in the ſubject,
as lineally deſcended from the Princes of <hi>Northwales</hi> (whoſe rights
are therein maintained) are more then ſufficient to oblige you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
The writing of it was upon this <hi>occaſion:</hi> ſome Gentlemen of
<hi>Southwales</hi> being diſſatisfied with <hi>Caradoc</hi> of <hi>Lancarvan's</hi> Hiſtory of
<hi>Wales,</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Dr. Powel,</hi> in regard that therein the Prince of
<hi>Northwales</hi> is held forth to be <hi>Soveraigne</hi> over the other two Princes of
<hi>Southwales</hi> and <hi>Powis,</hi> as being of the elder houſe, thought fit (in order
to the compiling of a more <hi>exact history</hi>) to draw up certain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> of all <hi>Wales</hi> to be in the Prince of <hi>Southwales,</hi>
and to ſend them alſo into <hi>Northwales</hi> to ſee what could be ſaid in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to them, before any further uſe ſhould be made of them. They
were delivered by Sr. <hi>Thomas Canon</hi> late of <hi>Pembrokeſhire</hi> Kt. to Sr.
<hi>John Lloyd</hi> of the <hi>Inner Temple</hi> Kt. and <hi>Sergeant at Law,</hi> who delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them to me above 40 years ago, deſiring I would take the pains to
peruſe and anſwer them as well as I was able. At his intreaty I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
it, and, as you will find, done ſomewhat in it, though in a rude
manner, which I hope will be excuſed in a perſon, whoſe only deſigne
is plainly to ſet forth the <hi>truth,</hi> which ſhews alwaies beſt in its own
proper colours without the elaborate dreſſe and varniſh of <hi>Rhetorick.</hi>
But ſome men poſſibly may object againſt this undertaking of mine,
<pb facs="tcp:99019:3"/>
that it was needleſſe, and that, if it had been to any end, it was no
diſcretion to revive and publiſh an <hi>old Conteſt</hi> long ſince (God be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
happily decided. I confeſſe we have reaſon to bleſſe God for his
mercy to us in our happy eſtabliſhment under <hi>one Monarch;</hi> we may
well ſay we were conquered to our gain, and undone to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<hi>periiſſemus niſi periiſſemus;</hi> But yet it muſt be granted, that it is
no ſmall delight that redounds from the revolving and peruſall of <hi>old
records:</hi> though <hi>Troy</hi> hath for ſeverall ages layn buried in its aſhes,
both its glory and government being quite diſſolved, though the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,
Spartan, Theban,</hi> and other petit <hi>Grecian</hi> Eſtates have long ſince
had their periods, yet we ſtill take a great deale of ſatisfaction in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their ſtories, how they began, grew up, flouriſhed, ſtrove, &amp; decay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed.
Beſides there may be this <hi>good uſe</hi> made of it, viz, that by reflecting
upon our former miſeries and diviſions while we <hi>contended</hi> for <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,</hi>
we may be induced to put the <hi>greater</hi> value upon our <hi>preſent</hi>
happineſſe. Thus having given you an account of the worke, and what
I had to ſay in its defence, I commend it to your protection: and with
my prayers to God for <hi>you</hi> and <hi>your</hi> noble <hi>family</hi> remain, Sir,</p>

entred into and ſeized <hi>Powys</hi> as his inheritance, and that his brethren
might pretend to have portions there by <hi>Gavel-kind</hi> upon the death
of their brother <hi>Mervyn.</hi> But could he carry a principality from all

of others (upon that pretence) whereby to preſerve the general
peace of <hi>Wales:</hi> and partly by forſeiture, for ſpoile that had been
done by the prince of <hi>Northwales</hi> upon his countries of <hi>Cardigan</hi> and
<hi>Yſtradgwy.</hi> This <hi>prince Howel,</hi> as the writers of <hi>Northwales</hi> do record,
was of a goodly behaviour, juſt and diſcreet in his government, and
beloved of men; wherefore he obtained the attribute of <hi>Dha,</hi> which is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99019:9"/>
in Engliſh (the <hi>good,</hi>) whereby it is to be concluded probably, that
his coming to the principality of <hi>Wales</hi> was upon juſt and lawfull
grounds. Likewiſe <hi>Owen ap Howel Dha</hi> his ſon <hi>prince of Southwales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
did ſeize <hi>Northwales</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Cadwalhon ap Jeuaf</hi> for uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
and tyranny, and made <hi>Mredith</hi> his third ſon Prince there,
which, if it had been the ſoveraign ſeat, he would not have permitted
his younger ſon to enjoy it, and to become thereby his ſuperiour. And
in this point the writers of <hi>Northwales</hi> do obſcure the truth with ſome
art by concealing this to be done by the power of the father (<hi>prince of
Southwales,</hi>) and attributing the ſame wholly to the power of a third
ſon, whereas it is evident, that he had neither force nor authority to
perform it, but as his fathers miniſter and ſubject, whom his father
thought good to honour with the fruit of his valour and victory, being
atchieved <hi>propriâ manu</hi> not <hi>proprio marte,</hi> more then the conqueſts of
the famous prince <hi>Edward,</hi> called the <hi>black prince,</hi> whoſe everlaſting
honours they are, but the poſſeſſory right of them was to his fathers
crown. And it is to be obſerved, that as the diviſion of <hi>Wales</hi> by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric
the great</hi> did give the ground of the ſubduing thereof to the
<hi>crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſo it bred theſe preparatives thereunto; firſt the
continuall uſurpation of the Deſcendants of <hi>Anarawd</hi> upon his lawfull
heirs, Inſomuch as for 200 yeares after the diviſion, five of that line
did intermiſſively uſurp the government of <hi>Northwales,</hi> and only <hi>two
lawfull princes</hi> ruled there, and thoſe not paſt 12 yeares, if they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be the iſſue of <hi>Anarawd,</hi> which ſome writers of <hi>Northwales</hi>
do gainſay: in which licentious times one <hi>Aedan ap Blegored,</hi> a meer
private man, neither of the bloud of the Prince, nor of the Nobility,
that any antiquity doth record, intruded into the government, and
held it 12. yeares, untill he was expelled by the <hi>prince of Southwales.</hi>
Secondly it gave the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> opportunity to invade and
weaken all the parts of <hi>Wales,</hi> (who were often called in by the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of <hi>Northwales</hi> to joyn with them againſt the <hi>prince of Southwales.</hi>)
By thoſe occaſions the <hi>princes of Southwales</hi> as ſupreme <hi>lords of Wales,</hi>
&amp; for the generall quiet &amp; preſervation thereof, did ſeize &amp; aſſume
into their hands the government of <hi>Northasales,</hi> wherein ſix of them
ruled the ſaid 200. yeares, which had not they done, the government
in all likelihood had been in that time tranſlated from the race of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99019:9"/>
                  <hi>Roderic the great.</hi> But in the end of thoſe 200 yeares, <hi>Rees ap Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
prince of <hi>Southwales</hi> with great valour and wiſdome did overcome
all theſe long grown evills, and being the <hi>moſt powerfull</hi> prince that was
ſince <hi>Roderic the great,</hi> and <hi>lineal heir to Cadelh,</hi> expelled <hi>Trahern ap
Caradoc</hi> the laſt uſurper of <hi>Northwales,</hi> and placed <hi>Griffith ap Conan</hi>
(who was held to be the lawfull prince of the houſe of <hi>Anarawd</hi>) in the
quiet and ſettled poſſeſſion thereof: which honourable dealing was
very ill requited by <hi>Griffith ap Conan</hi> towards the ſon of <hi>Rees ap Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
in his diſtreſſe, as ſhall be after declared. By all which may appear
the generall care of the <hi>princes of Southwales</hi> over the whole dominion
of <hi>Wales</hi> derived from their ſupreme power, authority, and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For confirmation hereof, it is further to be obſerved, that ſithence
the ſaid diviſion, no <hi>prince of Northwales</hi> did ever rule in <hi>Southwales,</hi>
or by any occaſion did make claime to the principality thereof: and
therefore upon this diſpoſing of the principality of <hi>Northwales</hi> by the

               <p>IT is recorded by <hi>Caradocus,</hi> that <hi>Anarawd</hi> King of <hi>Northwales</hi> made
a road into the country of <hi>Cardigan</hi> &amp; <hi>Yſtradtywi,</hi> the poſſeſſion
of his brother <hi>Cadelh,</hi> but being that the Author alleageth not the cauſe

as thereby forfeiture of Royalty ſhould enſue: and conſidering alſo

                  <hi>Anarawd,</hi> who lived long after, it may ſeem great rigor and tyranny in

did deprive <hi>Idwal's</hi> ſon of his inheritance, for the offence of <hi>Anarawd</hi>
his grandfather, committed many yeares before his birth, not upon
the countries of <hi>Howel,</hi> as you ſay, but of <hi>Cadelh</hi> his father. Therefore
if you hold his coming to <hi>Northwales</hi> to be upon good and lawfull
grounds, it will be your beſt courſe (rejecting offences and forfeitures)
wholly to ſtick to the incapacity of the <hi>heir of Northwales,</hi> by reaſon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99019:10"/>
whereof <hi>Howel</hi>'s coming to <hi>Northwales,</hi> whether it were as being next

of his couſen <hi>Idwal,</hi> foreſeeing perhaps the weakneſſe of his

And in regard of his ſaid regency over the houſe of <hi>Northwales,</hi> and
the right thereunto belonging, I do confeſſe that he was the ſoveraign

rule of <hi>Northwales,</hi> it plainly appears that the right of ſoveraignty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
not to <hi>Southwales.</hi> Moreover <hi>Owen</hi> the ſon of <hi>Howel Dha</hi> was
never ruler of <hi>Northwales,</hi> nor had any action againſt <hi>Cadwalhon ap

to the ſame Author he claimed and enjoyed the right of <hi>Northwales;</hi>
therefore his coming to the rule of that Kindome doth not at all favour

ſix Kings of <hi>Southwales</hi> were, that (as you ſay) aſſumed to their hands
the government of <hi>Northwales,</hi> for <hi>Mredyth ap Owen</hi> was neither king
nor heir apparent of <hi>Southwales,</hi> when he conquered <hi>Northwales:</hi> and
<hi>Howel ap Edwyn</hi> was King of <hi>Southwales</hi> when <hi>Griffith ap Lhewelyn</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook

of <hi>Lhewelyn ap Griffiu</hi> in the raign of <hi>Edward the first,</hi> as the writers of
<hi>Northwales</hi> do alledge: for from the conquering of <hi>Rees ap Theodor</hi> all
the withſtanding of the power of the kings of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> was
termed by them Rebellion and Treaſon, which before alwaies had the
name of War. And thenceforth the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did give Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories
and poſſeſſions in <hi>Wales</hi> to their <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects, and ſo the <hi>Lords
Marchers</hi> began: and thenceforth were the ſtrong Caſtles, and Forts

and by that <hi>ſea</hi> all the reſt of the <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> were brought

And the <hi>kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were ſtayed from the abſolute conqueſt of

that after the diviſion among <hi>Roderic Mawr</hi>'s ſons, the principality

but how truly, I appeale to the judgment of impartiall Antiquaries:
for do but equally conſider whether a Baſtard would offer to diſquiet
his father and Prince, becauſe he intended that his lawfull heir ſhould
ſucceed him in his dominions; or preſume to bandy with the legitimate
heir for his due inheritance; or whether the King of <hi>England</hi> would
maintaine ſuch an execrable quarrell againſt his (naturall) <hi>nephew,</hi> or the
<hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>VVales</hi> againſt their true &amp; legitimate <hi>prince</hi> in a Baſtard's
behalf. Theſe circumſtances might ſatisfy, that <hi>Griffith</hi> was not
only born in wedlock, but alſo the right &amp; proper <hi>prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi>
by inheritance. Conſider likewiſe how <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> called all the <hi>Lords</hi>
and <hi>Barons</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> before him to <hi>Yſtratflur,</hi> and cauſed them to
ſwear to be faithfull ſubjects, and to do homage to <hi>David</hi> his ſon, and
that long before his death; which had been needleſſe and frivolous, if
<hi>David</hi> had been his heir, and <hi>Griff:</hi> his baſtard: conſider I ſay, how

a <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> over the other <hi>two,</hi> viz. <hi>Aberffraw</hi> hath the <hi>Primacy.
Three</hi> princely Tributs are due out of all <hi>Wales,</hi> whereof <hi>Aberffraw</hi>
ought to have from thoſe <hi>two</hi> ſeats, one from <hi>Dinefwr,</hi> which is a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

one being ſtiled of <hi>Powis,</hi> the other of <hi>Cardigan,</hi> for diſtinction's ſake.

Garanir</hi> Lord of <hi>Cantre Gwaelod,</hi> (to wit, that large <hi>Plaine</hi> extending
it ſelf between the Countyes of <hi>Carnarvan, Cardigan,</hi> and <hi>Pembroke,</hi>
long ſince ſwallowed up by the Sea) thus, <hi>Gwaethvoed ap Eunydd,</hi> as
<hi>Lewis Morgannwc</hi> ſaith; but others leaving out <hi>Eunydd</hi> ſay, he was
the ſon of <hi>Cadivor ap Peredur peiſwydh ap Eneon ap Eunydd,</hi> and ſo to

            <p>That <hi>Gwaethvoed</hi> of <hi>Cardigan</hi> could not be the great Grandfather of
<hi>Blethyn ap Cynvyn</hi> &amp;c.] for <hi>Blethyn</hi> was neer of this <hi>Gwaethvoed's</hi> age.
<hi>Caradoc</hi> of <hi>Lancarvan</hi> in his <hi>hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> tells us; that <hi>Blethyn</hi> was
ſlaine <hi>A. D.</hi> 1073. being born, as may be conjectured, about 1023.
ſuppoſing <hi>Angharad</hi> (Prince <hi>Llewelyn ap Sitſyllt's</hi> widow, who was
ſlaine <hi>A. D.</hi> 1021.) to marry <hi>Convyn Blethyn</hi>'s father 1022. Now
<hi>Gwaethvoed</hi> of <hi>Cardigan</hi> could not be ancienter then <hi>Blethyn,</hi> if ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
