            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Had at the appointed time of preaching, the ſame judgment befell me which befell to <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Father of <hi>John Baptiſt Luke</hi> 1, 20. When I thought to have ſpoken unto the people <hi>that waited for mee, and marvelled that I tarried ſo long,</hi> I was <hi>ſtruck dumbe and not able to ſpeak.</hi> And could I conceive it had been done by an <hi>Angel</hi> I ſhould (as a cauſe of it) ſuſpect in my ſelfe the ſin of <hi>unbeleife.</hi> But, as it is, I am conſtrained to uſe <hi>Zacharias</hi> his way of expreſſing my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. On the day of your meeting in the <hi>Temple</hi> I could only <hi>beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> but <hi>remained ſpeechles,</hi> whence you all <hi>perceived</hi> I had <hi>ſeene a Viſion</hi> in the Veſtry: and were not long in ſuſpence what kind of one it was. But <hi>whatſoever it was</hi> I was <hi>tranſported</hi> or carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with it, and am yet <hi>dumb</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>But as the Angell, though he ſtrooke <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſpeechleſſe, yet tooke not away his <hi>writing tables, v. 63.</hi> So I conceive by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that <hi>order</hi> which commands a conſtraint both of my <hi>Tongu</hi> and <hi>Heeles:</hi> I am not interdicted the liberty of <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Paper,</hi> but I may lawfully uſe both without <hi>contempt.</hi>

Alas for the day of the Lord! It is ſo now. Was their no roome for Chriſt in the <hi>Inne, Luke 27?</hi> There is none for him now in the Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Were there <hi>Wiſemen</hi> that <hi>ſought to worſhip him,</hi> and a <hi>Herod</hi> that under pretence of worſhip <hi>ſought to deſtroy him Mat. 2. 1?</hi> It was ſo now: there were that came to Church to <hi>worſhip Chriſt,</hi> and there were that came to apprehend his Miniſters. Was there <hi>a voice heard in Ramah, lamentation and weeping, and great mourning, Mat: 2 18.</hi> There is another <hi>Rachel whoſe child is not,</hi> if the newes of <hi>Cornehill</hi> be true, Doe theſe things cauſe a neceſſity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his <hi>going into Aegipt</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael's quondam bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage Mat: 2 18.</hi> There will I fear (but O the good God prevent that neceſſity) be ſuch another <hi>violence,</hi> to drive us to ſuch another <hi>flight,</hi> Laſtly was that <hi>Herod</hi> not <hi>longliv'd: Mat. 2 19?</hi> I propheſie no <hi>eternity</hi> to the men of his <hi>carriage: Pſalme 55 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beloved, I muſt once more crave your patience, for I muſt leave you and waite upon the Committee. Whome as <hi>Gentlemen</hi> I <hi>reſpect</hi> as in <hi>Authority I Honovr:</hi> as my <hi>Enemies</hi> I <hi>love, bleſſe, and pray for: Mat. 5, 44:</hi> and (that I may performe all the duties I owe upon that ſcore) I ſhal labour to doe <hi>good to:</hi> I muſt tel them that I have read a ſtory of <hi>Tiberious the Emperour.</hi> That <hi>he (upon the relation which Pilate made unto him of our Saviour) had an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and to that purpoſe ſignified his meaning to have Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarath reputed and received among the Roman Gods.</hi> But the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> withſtood it, becauſe that <hi>Honour had been given him by ſuch as never asked their conſents.</hi> But after this I provoke any Hiſtorian to ſhew me where that <hi>great Councel</hi> did ever any act either <hi>Honeſtly, Wiſely,</hi> or like <hi>true Romans:</hi> but were made the <hi>properties</hi> &amp; inſtruments either of the <hi>Caeſars luſts,</hi> or <hi>Souldiers vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies. And</hi> now I wiſh theſe men ſeriouſly to adviſe how much ſhort this inſolence is of the former? When men may not Honor, Miniſters may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57605:3"/>
not preach Chriſt without their Licence under paine of <hi>impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> without <hi>Baile</hi> or <hi>maine priſe.</hi> I ſpeake not this out of Stomack for what I <hi>ſuffer,</hi> but as hartily as I would beg pardon for my ſinns doe I wiſh them a better <hi>exit,</hi> hoping yet they may acquire a better and more glorious concluſion then theſe <hi>diſtempers</hi> can <hi>promiſe</hi> or the Roman Councell had.</p>
            <p>And now I return to give you an account of that which otherwiſe migh ſeem ſtrange. Which is that way of application you ſhal meet with all, reverſ'd upon my ſelfe. I confeſſe it is not uſuall; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed proper for one that ſpeakes to others. But firſt, as it is the Miniſter of Chriſts part to appeare in <hi>innocence</hi> a <hi>Dove, Math: 10 16:</hi> So as the Doves feed their young ones with that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have taken down: ought Preachers to digeſt in their owne breſts, and be <hi>fore-taſters</hi> of that <hi>ſpirituall food</hi> they <hi>divide</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this I had laboured to do. Secondly theſe meditations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now to be <hi>read,</hi> not <hi>heard:</hi> I thought good ſo to diſpoſe them, that each Reader might as I have done ſuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the juice and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them: and by reading as it were engage himſelfe upon the practicall part of them. Vnto both which no way ſo Organicall as prayer. And I doe humbly pray that every Reader may be alſo a Beleever, and have a heart open as well as an eye. For I conceive (with humble reverence) that the Goſpell if it go no further then the eye or eare is <hi>mortiferous</hi> and <hi>deadly,</hi> a <hi>killing letter.</hi> But if it be tranſmitted to the more noble and vitall parts it is <hi>Soveraigne, Food</hi> and <hi>Phyſick, Meat</hi> and <hi>Medicine.</hi> Chriſt in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> may vouchſafe to accept the <hi>Stable</hi> and the <hi>Manger</hi> but comming in the <hi>Spirit</hi> he muſt have a <hi>Temple</hi> to entertaine him. And by ſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we ſhall ſupply what was wanting not at <hi>Bethlem</hi> onely, but at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> alſo. If any of you ſhould be ſo ignorant as not to underſtand what I would be at in all this. I muſt tel you that though I cannot aſſent to the mind of them that would have the obſervation of this feaſt ſuperſtition; yet you that <hi>give place to the Devill Eph: 4. 27.</hi> are more injurious to Chriſt then any, Sinne, ſinne, that is it muſt be taken downe, it was ſinne and the <hi>Devill</hi> that ſnatch'd this bread of life out of your mouths that ſent me to <hi>Priſon Revel. 2. 10.</hi> Can you (knowing what Chriſt is) think to honour Chriſt in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57605:4"/>
of the Nativity and at that ſeaſon ſo ſhufle the cards that ſinne ſhall be Trump in every dealing. Remember <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> muſt be born before <hi>Chriſt</hi> You muſt <hi>Repent</hi> if the <hi>Kingdome of God be at hand</hi> It is certaine that that <hi>Spirit which confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh is of God, 1. Iohn. 4. 2.</hi> and ſo on the contrary the Non confeſſor therof is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> That <hi>Spirit of Antichriſt, verſ. 3.</hi> I remember St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> with a great deale of pains proves every Heretick to be a denyer of the comming of Ieſus Chriſt in the fleſh whatſoever his Hereſie be. But me thinks <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> with much more eaſe and plaineſſe ſhewes that the beſt way to confeſſe Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, is by not <hi>committing of ſinne;</hi> unto which purpoſe he layes that text, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8. &amp; 9. to the forementioned 4. c. 2. v. where in 4, Chapter to <hi>Be of God</hi> is the <hi>Predicate</hi> to this <hi>Confeſſion</hi> as the <hi>Subject.</hi> And in the 3. <hi>Chapter</hi> to be <hi>borne of God</hi> is the <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>not committing ſinne</hi> is the <hi>Praedicate.</hi> So that not to commit ſinne is the remote (and but once remoov'd] definition of the confeſſion of Chriſts Nativiny, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the fleſh. So that the commemoration or confeſſion by way of Obſervation of the Day to the end is not Antichriſtian (they were miſtaken that adviſed the Parliament ſo) But the <hi>Drunkeneſſe</hi> and <hi>Gluttony</hi> the <hi>Luxury &amp; Ryot &amp;c,</hi> Theſe are <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> &amp; ſo far Antichriſtian that where theſe are! Men (even when they would confeſſe) do deny Chriſt Ieſus to <hi>be come in the Fleſh.</hi> And of theſe ſince the ſecular magiſtrate diſtinguiſheth not it behoveth us Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be carefull.

            <p>But to go on: <hi>His Ingreſſe</hi> or coming <hi>into</hi> the world is by ſome record to be threefold.

            <p>And now, Beloved (were it ſuteable to the conſideration of the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> or of my <hi>ſtay</hi> here) I could without any great Travell fixing one foot of the <hi>Compaſs</hi> in the center of this text: with the other fetch in all theſe points (though never ſo vaſt a latitude) within a juſt circumference of without any excentricity. But I had rather make another and more profitable <hi>uſe</hi> of them, whereunto the <hi>review</hi> and <hi>conſideration</hi> doth directly lead me.</p>
            <p>And That is: to admire the Infinite goodneſſe of God in all this, to wretched mankind: Who being in this Earth a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> and a <hi>ſtragler,</hi> without either <hi>freind,</hi> or <hi>acquaintance,</hi> in the midſt of <hi>enemies, dangers,</hi> and <hi>miſcheifes,</hi> many <hi>ſnares,</hi> no ſure <hi>footing.</hi>

               <hi>Sic erat inſtabilis tellus, innabilis unda.</hi> Sin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, Satan bringing great <hi>woe &amp; wrath</hi> to the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of <hi>earth</hi> and of the <hi>Sea.</hi> Such is the mercy of God, toward ſo great his bleſſing <hi>upon</hi> Man (at whoſe hands yet <hi>mankind</hi> had merited no ſuch <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> but rather <hi>curses.</hi>) that whether, he be to be <hi>borne,</hi> or to <hi>grow,</hi> or to <hi>go in,</hi> or to <hi>deale,</hi> or to <hi>encounter with,</hi> or to <hi>dye out</hi> of the world: He hath given his <hi>own ſon</hi> to be, <hi>Duxque comeſque viae et vitae a guid</hi> and <hi>companion</hi> to him of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>way.</hi> And (what ever other men doe thinke of it) when I conſider. That to be <hi>Borne</hi> to <hi>Grow,</hi> to <hi>Live,</hi> and to <hi>Dye,</hi> be things common to mee and my redeemer, I cannot chuſe but cry out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Lord my God ſince in theſe ſtates thou haſt</hi> (ſo far as only nature goes) <hi>faſhioned us alike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let theſe lineaments and parts in me which ſinne hath drawne, and overcaſt with the black coale of guilt be fil'd up with the colours of my Saviour. That through the beauties of his holineſſe (as he glorified thee on earth, ſo) in my life and death I may ſhew forth his praiſes, and vertues who hath called me out of darknes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his marvelous light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57605:7"/>And ſo without hopes of further commerce with them (as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) in this place, I diſmiſſe the latter part of my text &amp; with it the 3. laſt generall branches of the Goſpel Hiſtory of the life of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking my ſelfe to the former part both of the Diviſion, and of the text which ſpeakes of Chriſts <hi>Ingreſſe</hi> into the World, <hi>And the word was made Fleſh.</hi> And therein of his comming in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> only.</p>
            <p>How Chriſt is called the word? If we ſhould ſhew, it would engage us upon a diſcourſe of that other Miſtery of the Trinity unto a <hi>length</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to our preſent buſineſſe: or if we ſhould ſhew how Fleſh is put for our whole nature, &amp; why? It would run us, at this time, out of breath. <hi>I</hi> proceede therefore to the ſubſtance of the words, The Incarnation of Chriſt Jeſus. And therein conſider.</p>
            <p>Firſt the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the two <hi>Natures God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> in this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Secondly the <hi>Conception</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Nativity</hi> or <hi>Birth</hi> of Chriſt of the moſt bleſſed <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to the <hi>Vnion I</hi> have foure things to go through withall: firſt to ſhew the <hi>ſeverall</hi> unions in Chriſt. Secondly, the ſignification of this word <hi>perſon,</hi> Thirdlly the <hi>manner</hi> of the Union, and Laſtly, the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Union: And of the firſt thus much.</p>
            <p>There are in the perſon of Chriſt <hi>three</hi> unions and <hi>ale-immediate,</hi> firſt the union of the <hi>Deity</hi> to the <hi>ſoul:</hi> Secondly the union of the Deity to the <hi>body;</hi> And Thirdly the Union of <hi>body &amp; ſoul</hi> together: the two firſt werenot of <hi>nature,</hi> nor of <hi>merit,</hi> but wholly <hi>ſupernaturall:</hi> And <hi>ſo not ſubject</hi> to <hi>ſeparation</hi> by force of any <hi>natur,</hi> al action or paſſion But the third being <hi>natural,</hi> did leave a place for ſuffering and <hi>ſeparation:</hi> So that when Chriſt <hi>ſuffered</hi> death, the Deity <hi>forſook</hi> neither <hi>ſoule</hi> nor <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> only the <hi>body</hi> was forſaken by the <hi>ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>plurality</hi> of which <hi>ſubſtances</hi> and <hi>Vnions</hi> notwithſtanding, Chriſt muſt be conſidered but as one, that is in <hi>perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Which word that you may underſtand aright: know that it is derived a <hi>perſonando</hi> which is diſtinct ſounding: And is nothing elſe in Logick but what a Noune Subſtantive proper of the ſingular Number is in Grammer (that is) one particular compleate ſubſiſtence, which Logicians call an <hi>Individuum,</hi> but with this differenc. That Perſon is a particular <hi>reaſonable</hi> creature; whereas a particular thing if it be unreaſonable, as a tree, or horſe, &amp;c, is not called a perſon: but by the Schooles a <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> And in this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57605:7"/>
ſence Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>one:</hi> Not in <hi>nature</hi> (for ſo is no man in a ſtrict ſence: for the <hi>ſoule</hi> and the <hi>body</hi> of men, are of two different <hi>natures,</hi> as well as fountaines or beginnings) But in <hi>perſon:</hi> wherein though there may be <hi>aliud et aliud, one</hi> and <hi>another thing,</hi> yet there cannot be <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>alius, one</hi> and <hi>another perſon:</hi> And ſo much for the meaning of the word <hi>perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the manner of this union, we muſt know that things are united or made on many wayes: As 1 <hi>Faedere</hi> by a <hi>covenant,</hi> as Chriſt &amp; the faithfull: And this may make one <hi>body</hi> but not one <hi>perſon.</hi> 2. By <hi>tranſmutation</hi> as Snow and Water, but this makes one <hi>ſubſtance</hi> as well as <hi>ſuppoſitum,</hi> but ſo is not Chriſt. 3. By <hi>aggregation</hi> as many materialls united make an houſe, but this is <hi>violent,</hi> and not <hi>voluntary:</hi> as was Chriſt. 4. By <hi>compoſition</hi> as body and ſoule, make one man being united; but this is <hi>natural,</hi> and ſo is not the union of the Deity to the Humanity in Chriſt. Laſtly therefore by <hi>Aſſumption</hi> and this is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; proper to Chriſt alone. For the cleare avoiding of old and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous hereſies, and errours which have riſen about this Article of our Faith, we conceive it not unneceſſary to deale warily with thoſe <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>words</hi> which we borrow from the Latines in expreſſing our mind in this matter, ſuch as are <hi>Vnion Aſſumption,</hi> &amp;c. As in this <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> ſence. To <hi>Aſſume</hi> and to <hi>Vnite</hi> do equally belong to the ſame <hi>Agents:</hi> But to be <hi>Vnited</hi> and to be <hi>Aſſumed</hi> cannot be praedicated <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually</hi> by the ſame <hi>Subjects:</hi> Concerning the former, it will appeare plainely by and by. For the latter, the difference is thus, To be united may not unproperly be attributed to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> in thus ſpeaking: <hi>God</hi> was <hi>united</hi> to <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>man</hi> was <hi>united</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and with this not a Caviller will find fault: But to ſay (as on the one ſide truely <hi>Man</hi> was <hi>aſſumed</hi> to, and by <hi>God:</hi> ſo on the other) <hi>God</hi> was <hi>aſſumed</hi> to or by <hi>Man</hi> were erroneous in it ſelfe and dangerous in the conſequents. For <hi>Relation</hi> we muſt allow to be in <hi>God,</hi> if we acknowledge a <hi>Trinity</hi> of perſons, but <hi>ſuffering,</hi> we dare not impute, leaſt with it we make him alſo <hi>changeable:</hi> Now to be <hi>Vnited</hi> here, is only a terme of <hi>Relation,</hi> but to be <hi>Aſſumed</hi> is alway a terme of <hi>Paſsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>aſſume</hi> and to be <hi>aſſumed</hi> are words expreſſing, <hi>doing,</hi> and <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and in the preſent matter divide unto us <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man;</hi> God the <hi>Agent,</hi> whoſe part therefore is to <hi>Aſſume.</hi> Man the <hi>Patient</hi> or <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> whoſe it is therefore to be <hi>Aſſumed.</hi> To <hi>Aſſume</hi> as it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded word, ſo it doth ſignifie a double action, the firſt is <hi>taking:</hi>

the ſecond is application, <hi>taking to,</hi> The firſt is caled <hi>principium:</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is called <hi>terminus aſſumptionis.</hi> The firſt belongeth to all the three perſons in the Trinity. As the father did <hi>take</hi> and give the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature</hi> to his Son as he ſaith, <hi>Lo a body haſt thou given me.</hi> So the Son did <hi>take</hi> [<hi>not the nature</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) <hi>but the ſeed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo likewiſe the Holy Ghoſt did (whoſe it was, to <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi> the <hi>nature aſſumed</hi> and by whom alſo we believe it was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) <hi>take</hi> our <hi>nature</hi> in the firſt act. It was taken not <hi>to the</hi> father: nor <hi>to</hi> the Holy-Ghoſt: but <hi>to</hi> the ſecond perſon which is Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the thing aſſumed it is worth our conſideration: 1. <hi>Negatively</hi> to obſerve that when God took our <hi>nature</hi> he ſeparated it from <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>perſonality;</hi> he took not our <hi>ſin</hi> for that was <hi>contrary</hi> to his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> He took not any <hi>perſon</hi> of man at all, for that was <hi>contrary</hi> to his <hi>Vnity,</hi> for ſo there ſhould have been <hi>Two Perſons</hi> in the ſecond perſon of the Trinity. As therefore our nature that was aſſumed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>fulneſſe of grace</hi> from that moſt holy <hi>nature</hi> which <hi>aſſumed</hi> it; So it owes its <hi>perſonal exiſtence</hi> to the <hi>ſecond perſon</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> (having none of its owne) to which it was united. 2. <hi>Poſitively</hi> learn what we meane by our <hi>nature,</hi> for <hi>Nature</hi> in Scripture is ſometimes put for the <hi>corruption</hi> of our nature as Epheſ. 2. 3. but ſo Chriſt tooke not our <hi>nature</hi> unleſſe it were by way of <hi>imputation:</hi> For this is the <hi>Nature</hi> which by the Schooles is alwayes oppoſed to <hi>Grace.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in Scripture it is taken for ſome <hi>part</hi> of nature, as for <hi>Reaſon</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rom: 2: 14: Or for <hi>ſence</hi> only. 2. Pet: 2: 12: Iude. 10. but ſo Chriſt took not our nature, that is <hi>ſome part</hi> of our nature. For that were to fal into the errour of the <hi>Appollinarians</hi> and <hi>Monothelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Nature</hi> therefore we underſtand (not one or ſome) but all the <hi>partt</hi> of nature (whether <hi>eſſentiall</hi> as ſoule and body: or <hi>integrall</hi> as the ſoules faculties and the bodies Members) united; as alſo whatever <hi>flowes</hi> from the <hi>Principles</hi> of nature, as <hi>Growth</hi> from <hi>Vegetation, Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Drinking,</hi> &amp;c from <hi>Sence, Diſcourſe,</hi> and <hi>ſpeech</hi> from <hi>reaſon,</hi> not refuſing the very <hi>infirmities</hi> of nature, as in the Soule <hi>Sorrow, Greife, Anger, Pity Vexation:</hi> in the <hi>will</hi> the <hi>contradiction</hi> of the <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>Phyſicall</hi> part (though with ſubjection too) to the <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative</hi> in the <hi>underſtanding Negative Ignorance.</hi> And in the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirſt, Wearines</hi> and <hi>Weeping, Senſe</hi> of <hi>Pain and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi> Ine breif by nature we meane whatſoever is generall <hi>to</hi> and <hi>in</hi> all men, ſo that it be not <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>ſinne.</hi> For nature is that which grace nor
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57605:8"/>
Sinne nor gives nor <hi>takes away,</hi> but is only <hi>perfited</hi> and <hi>Sanctified</hi> not <hi>added</hi> by Grace; <hi>corrupted</hi> and <hi>vitiated</hi> by <hi>ſinne,</hi> not <hi>extinguiſhed.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that is <hi>naturall</hi> in a man which may be <hi>wel or il</hi> uſed. Grace on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be <hi>abuſed,</hi> Sinne only cannot be <hi>wel employed:</hi> Nature only may be the <hi>weapon</hi> of <hi>unrighteouſneſſe</hi> to <hi>ſinne,</hi> Or the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of <hi>righteouſnes</hi> to <hi>obedience:</hi> By which deſcriptions of nature, it will be no hard mater for an ordinary underſtanding to find out <hi>what</hi> in man was <hi>united</hi> and <hi>aſſumed</hi> to the Deity of Chriſt, in the work and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Incarnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now when a man conſiders the ſeverall immediate unions in Chriſt: and finds the ſupernaturall Vnions of the Deitie inſeparable, even where ſoule and body parts. He begins to be ſenſible of a naturall combate between <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> (I meane) ſoule and body: Yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in an acknowledgement of the faithfullnes of God in Chriſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending all other freindſhip. For look we after <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias, Niſus</hi> and <hi>Eurialus, Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Perithous, Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> and <hi>David, Ruth</hi> and <hi>Naomi,</hi> (the only pair of Woman-freinds I never read or heard of) And we ſhall find theſe come ſhort of the love betweene every man's ſoule and body! and yet theſe two are (in men) ready to fall out one with another to ſee their owne falſeneſſe, diſcovered by the appoſed faithfullneſſe of God. So that the Soul, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth faithles dealing to the body, firſt recounting it's <hi>care, ſtudy, pains, griefe, joy, ſuffering,</hi> for the body; all which were the body away the ſoule might be freed from, as having no back to be cloathed, no belly to be filled, no poſterity to be provided for, no cheekes to bluſh, no nor any ſubjection to corporall ſtrokes, nor temptation to ſinne, and yet how doth this accurſed earth forſake me, (<hi>ſaith the ſoul</hi>) then, when if I am evill (and evill <hi>I</hi> am by conjunction with that too,) I muſt antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate thoſe wofull torments due for ſinne, while that lyes ſteeping in the grave. Or if good (which I am by conjunction with Chriſt) then, when <hi>I</hi> have moſt uſe, and ſhould have moſt joy of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that unnaturaly ſinkes from me, Leaving me (indeed) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy (but alone) the glorified <hi>Manſion</hi> of the <hi>Saints:</hi> wherein is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body of <hi>my Lord,</hi> and <hi>my God,</hi> a moſt bleſſed and beatificall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But wanting a bodily eye to apprehend that fullnes which dwels in him bodily. <hi>I</hi> ſuffer a comparative imperfection which makes me cry out! <hi>How long Lord juſt and true?</hi> Where <hi>I</hi> ow; and without al weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes would and could tender <hi>all worſhip</hi> &amp;c. But all bodily ſervice I

come ſhort of, having (as before) no eye bodily to ſee, ſo [here] no knee to bend, no hand to lift up, no tongue to ſpeak <hi>To the honour of him that ſits upon the throne and the Lamb for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide the body though ſlower, yet fals in heavier in the charg, <hi>and</hi> [like the Moon in the Hebrew Apologue againſt the Sun that would be divorc'd] recriminates thus. The Soul is falſe to me and unkind! For its <hi>care, ſtudy, paines,</hi> &amp;c. are for its owne <hi>Pride,</hi> and arrogancy. For when the ſoule is taken away a winding ſheete, is as good to me, as <hi>Salomans</hi> Wardrobe: a grave as pallace, yea an Vrne, as the Vniverſe! were it not for the ſoules Vanity, nothing more thrifty then the belly, nor more hardy then back, the poſterity nothing, glory or ſham too late, ſtroks unfelt, temptations unaccepted, ſinne unperfited.

If I have done evill it was <hi>caeca obedientia</hi> [and were ſhe a <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſhe by her own doctrin ought to ſuffer alone] ſhe goes but before for a <hi>few more ſtripes</hi> which her knowledge demerits: I my ignorance notwithſtanding ſhall be forced after to the encreaſe of her torment as well as mine? if I have <hi>done</hi> well ſhe anticipates my reward and Crowne and glory, leaving me [unwilling to part with her] a loathing to my freinds, a companion to the Wormes: and brother to corruption; not affording <hi>nec beneficium ſalis</hi> ſo much kindnes as <hi>ſalt,</hi> or a ſearecloth will do me: to keepe me from ſtinking and putrefaction, And here is the regreet of the two dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt freinds nature ever knew Now obſerve how much kinder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanter Chriſt is to both, then either to other: For beſide that he <hi>is</hi> and <hi>does</hi> what ever each of theſe <hi>is</hi> or <hi>doth</hi> to one another, and that not only <hi>per modum efficientiae,</hi> as an Efficient working that good that is in them, but alſo <hi>per modnm eminentiae,</hi> by way of Excellency doing greater things for them both, then they are able to apprehend at preſent.

            <p>On th'other ſide the Body, whoſe eſtate ſeems to be moſt deplored when freinds avoid the ſight of it, the ſoule in whoſe ſervice it is either worn out or wounded to death forſaking it, hath notwithſtanding the <hi>everlaſting armes underneath it:</hi> treaſuring it up for one of his <hi>jewels</hi> in whoſe <hi>ſight the death of the Saints is precious:</hi> For no doubt God who <hi>telleth the wandrings, bottle up the teares, numbreth the haires, and writes in a book all the part</hi> of his ſervants living: Can, &amp; doth (though the grave cauſe all the joints to drop aſunder, the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to engender wormes, and a ſtinch; turnes the pleaſant eye balls, the ſometime ſeat of delight, into a rotten Gelly, dry the braine, conſume the mucles, rack the whole to peices, and then grind it againe to duſt) preſerve each atom, and by a moſt inſcrutable providence, keep every more of that duſt, to the <hi>glorious reſurrection.</hi> And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not comparable in it ſelfe to the glory of the ſoule, yet hath in it an unſpeakeable weight of comfort.</p>
            <p>And therefore O My ſoul though I deſire thee not to be ſo unnatural to caſt of the body!

            </p>
            <p>Secondly when I contemplate the unity of Chriſt's perſon &amp; therein conſider, how near <hi>Man</hi> is brought to God, I am enforced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all promiſed Vnions of God to man <hi>poſſible;</hi> all commanded Vnions of man againe to God <hi>reaſonable.</hi> The promiſed Vnions of God to Man are. 1. <hi>Paſtorall,</hi> He our <hi>ſhepheard</hi> we his <hi>Flock. 2. Oeconomicall,</hi> he our <hi>Maſter,</hi> wee his <hi>ſervants. 3. Conſanguineal,</hi> He our <hi>Father</hi> we his <hi>Sonnes</hi> and <hi>Daughters. 4. Conjugall</hi> he our <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> we his <hi>Spouſe</hi> here, his <hi>hride</hi> in the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> his <hi>Wife</hi> for ever: and the like.</p>
            <p>In the firſt: his call, and our following, declares us one way. In the ſecond: his command, and our obedience one Worke, In the third: his tender care, our dutifull honour, one Generation or Kindred. In the Laſt: his holy deſire, and our chaſt ſubmiſſion, one love.</p>
            <p>And all theſe unions made eaſie even to faith by the Vnity of Chriſt's perſon. <hi>He that gave us his ſonne, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things.</hi> The commanded Vnions, of man to God are, 1. Of <hi>Judgement</hi> that wee, [as he doth] <hi>approve the things that are more excellent.</hi> 2 Of <hi>Will</hi> for election that we (as he doth) <hi>deſire truth in the inward parts,</hi> and this is to <hi>chuſe the better part.</hi> 3. Of <hi>Affection,</hi> that we (as he doth] <hi>hate the evill and love the good:</hi> being <hi>merciful as our heavenly Father is merciful.</hi> 4. Of <hi>Converſation</hi> that <hi>we be holie as he is holie, perfect, as our Father which is in Heaven is perfect, that we purifie our ſelves as he is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this is but to be one ſpirit as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>He that is joyned to the Eord is one Spirit.</hi> And good reaſon! For God requires no more of us then <hi>St Paul</hi> did of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and upon the ſame ground. <hi>Be ye as I am, for I am as ye are.</hi> O yee Sonnes of Men be ye as Gods! And the Children of the moſt high, for the ſonne God is God, yet for your ſakes, became the ſonne of Man. And O my Soule, ſince thou haſt no reaſon to doubt have faith to pray!

            <p>As firſt his <hi>goodnes</hi> is no where ſo manifeſt, as in <hi>him, in whome dwels the fullnes of the god-head Bodily.</hi> The <hi>Beſt</hi> of <hi>Creatures</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had but the <hi>footeſteps:</hi> And at the beſt but an <hi>image</hi> of God in them. But here God <hi>himſelfe:</hi> not <hi>appears,</hi> but <hi>dwells:</hi> not his <hi>back parts</hi> onely, but his <hi>fullnes</hi> in man. Nor is that goodneſſe here <hi>locked,</hi> but <hi>treaſured:</hi> that <hi>of his fullnes we might all receive, and grace for grace, &amp;c.</hi> Or if we take it not only for <hi>holineſſe,</hi> but for <hi>loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe</hi> alſo! Where can we find a <hi>paralell</hi> to the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation.</hi> Wherein that God who even <hi>humbles himſelfe when he daines to behold things done,</hi> not in <hi>Earth</hi> only, but in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> alſo, is pleaſed to communicate <hi>himſelfe,</hi> his <hi>love,</hi> yea and his <hi>very nature</hi> too: not to a <hi>creature</hi> only, but an <hi>earthly</hi> creature: nor ſo only, but to a <hi>ſinfull</hi> nature, to an <hi>enemy;</hi> the Son of his <hi>love,</hi> to the <hi>Children of wrath:</hi> ſo that as the Angel ſpeaking of Chriſt his goodnes in the firſt ſence calls him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>That Holy,</hi> ſo may we in the latter cal him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>That Kind, That loving, That mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull thing,</hi> who hath ſo highly <hi>honoured,</hi> and not deſpiſed the weakneſſe of <hi>his owne workmanſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly his <hi>Wiſdome</hi> is no where more apparent then in Him, <hi>in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge.</hi> And indeed the very Incarnation it ſelfe did reveale the wiſdome of God in the contrivance of mans ſalvation ſo gloriouſly, that if not only <hi>confounded</hi> the <hi>Divells,</hi> and befooled the ſubtill Serpent, (as wee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57605:12"/>
ſhall ſee anon) but even <hi>poſed</hi> the good <hi>Angells</hi> themſelves. Of whom, St. <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifies, that they did? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ſtoope</hi> to <hi>peere</hi> into the myſterie. For as the learned give the reaſon, They could not conceive how man could ever be redeemed; For the <hi>lawes ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi> was ſo <hi>inexorable</hi> that <hi>Man</hi> could not be <hi>quit</hi> but by <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> of infinite value and worth: Now they knew that indeed <hi>Man</hi> could ſuffer: But the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Angells,</hi> could not merit, or <hi>countervaile</hi> the <hi>Lawes rigour,</hi> within any limits of time. Againe they knew that if God <hi>interpoſed</hi> he could add va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; But he could not (his very <hi>eſſence</hi> forbidding it) ſuffer. So that here God <hi>charged his Angells with folly,</hi> who knowing Gods <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of <hi>redemption</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the old Teſtament; yet were non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſ't, and to ſeek in the means. Till God in the fullneſſe of time made knowne the myſtery by the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> together in one perſon, for the accompliſhing of his promiſe and covenant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> and that both in reſpect of the <hi>Law</hi> whoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>iota</hi> and <hi>title</hi> ſtood firmer then <hi>Heaven;</hi> (for the Heavens gave way to the deſcending of Chriſt:) or <hi>earth</hi> (which yeilded and trembled at his reſurrection) But the Law ſtood ſtrong, not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to paſſe till all the <hi>percepts</hi> were <hi>obeyed,</hi> the <hi>propheſies fullfilled,</hi> and <hi>treſpaſſes ſatisfied</hi> for; Not condoning, much leſſe conniving at ſin, though but imputed (and that) to the Son of God; And then wherein (I pray) doth the <hi>ſenerity</hi> of Gods Juſtice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <hi>more</hi> or <hi>equally?</hi> Zaleucus his one eye: And that Heathens ſelfe deſtroying, beſides their cruelty come infinitly ſhort, of this moſt ſtrict, yet aequable Juſtice: And ſecondly in reſpect of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> yeilding and exacting ſatisfaction in the <hi>ſame nature</hi> that <hi>had ſinned;</hi> and then <hi>rendring</hi> the purchaſed <hi>inheritance</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> that had <hi>merited</hi> by <hi>obeying.</hi> And laſtly in reſpect of <hi>Death</hi> it ſelfe who <hi>raigning over all by ſinne,</hi> loſt not its dominion till Chriſt ſpoyled him of it. And that moſt juſtly for <hi>Death</hi> entring upon Chriſt (to whom he had no title by reaſon of the righteouſnes that was in Chriſt) conſidering he was <hi>fleſh,</hi> not knowing that he was alſo the <hi>Lord of life</hi> made a breach upon the <hi>fleſh</hi> of Chriſt, and at laſt <hi>death dyed</hi> (as all things do in their contraries) <hi>in the life of Chriſt.</hi> Having firſt, forfeited his owne tenement by a forcible entry upon another mans poſſeſſion, which gives a good title among <hi>Kings</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57605:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Souldiers</hi> to all things gotten by conqueſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly his <hi>power</hi> which is breifly; more manifeſt in <hi>uniting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature</hi> to the <hi>humane;</hi> then it is in <hi>creating.</hi> Becauſe there is a more <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>infinite</hi> diſtance betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Nothing,</hi> between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> then betwixt <hi>Heaven</hi> and the firſt <hi>Chaos,</hi> betweene <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> then <hi>Emptines</hi> and <hi>Grace:</hi> As alſo more <hi>difficulties</hi> in redemption, then in creation, more <hi>corruptions</hi> to <hi>hinder,</hi> more <hi>Enemies</hi> to <hi>oppoſe</hi> the very <hi>work</hi> and <hi>office</hi> of a Redeemer, and this is the firſt reaſon given by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcene, lib. 3. cap. 1. de orthodoxa fide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That there (in ſome manner) might be a <hi>proportionablneſſe</hi> &amp; <hi>analogy</hi> in the <hi>Mediatour</hi> to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which (if I forget not) is by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> called a <hi>reſponſary Trinity</hi> for as in the Trinity there are <hi>three perſons</hi> in one <hi>eſsence.</hi> So in Chriſt there are three <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in one <hi>perſon:</hi> In the firſt the perſons of the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> are but one eſſence, (<hi>i</hi>) <hi>God,</hi> So in the latter three eſsences, the <hi>word,</hi> the <hi>Soule,</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> are but one perſon <hi>Chriſt</hi> and this is Saint <hi>Auguſtines, lib. 13. de crtniate,</hi> cap. 1.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of the Incarnation that concerne as are two. Firſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of <hi>Evil</hi> from us. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the promoting of our good. To the effecting of both theſe it was neceſſary that the <hi>word</hi> ſhould be made <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> ſhould become the <hi>Sonne of Man.</hi> For (although I confeſſe with Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> that God in his abſolute power could have framed another poſſible meane for the ſalvation of mankind; yet) by that power which is ordinate <hi>to</hi> and equall <hi>with</hi> his will there could be <hi>No other name given under Heaven whereby we ſhould be ſaved,</hi> but only this.</p>
            <p>For if we conſider Sathans power (who now Lords it over ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and enthralled mankind: And by a wofull CATACHRESIS is become the <hi>God of this World</hi>) his power and ſtrength (<hi>I</hi> ſay) not to be overcome no not by the contention of an Arch angel without a <hi>Mittimus</hi> to God [<hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly ſinnes moſt intimate adhearence to the ſonnes of Adam; whoſe vitious habits in us that they might appear (as it were more then accidentall to us, have (by the beſt ſpeaker Gods word) the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our very parts and ſubſtance given to them. Being called <hi>the body of Sinnes, and of death:</hi> our <hi>Members,</hi> yea &amp; our very <hi>Fleſh too:</hi> whoſe crucifying vicinity and tormenting cloſeneſſe, made a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57605:13"/>
Apoſtle make a more miſerable 'EPIPHONEMA crying out [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] <hi>who ſhal deliver me,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thirdly the more then neceſſary Fluxe of ſinfull acts and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions from thoſe vitious habits and corruptions, whoſe violent tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent like a breach of the Sea or the Cataracts of Nilus (though cauſed by nature cannot by the Lawes of nature, or rules of Phyſick, though with the <hi>poore Woman</hi> in the Goſpel <hi>wee ſpend our whole</hi> time and <hi>ſubſtance upon the Phyſitians</hi>) be ſtopped, no nor (with reverence be it ſpoken) by Chriſt himſelfe, without the Fountaine be dryed up by a vertue proceeding from him.</p>
            <p>Or laſtly the ſtrong Sequence of Gods law following <hi>ſinne</hi> inevitably with <hi>Death, malediction</hi> and <hi>curſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Charging upon tranſgreſſours invincibly. That vengeance and thoſe intolerable plagues, which Gods word can be underſtood to denounce, or Gods wrath to inflict. So: that to the removing of theſe malignities there is required the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a God.</p>
            <p>It muſt be more then an Angel that muſt diſenthrone the Divell He muſt be <hi>God that muſt tread Sathan under our feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly it muſt be ſome thing more ſubtill and ſpirituall then any creature whatſoever, that muſt get between us and our luſte even the God in whom we live &amp; move and have our being that muſt <hi>ſeperate our ſinnes from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly it muſt be ſomewhat above nature that muſt hinder ſinnes actions, and cauſe the naturall and moſt fruitefull wombe of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence to miſcary. It muſt be the God of nature, that can make the <hi>fire</hi> not <hi>burne,</hi> the Sea not drown, the <hi>Lions</hi> not <hi>devour, the Sun to go backward.</hi> He alone it is; that can give ſinne <hi>a miſcarying wombe and dry breaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, it muſt be the Law-giver himſelfe: that muſt make the <hi>Fire</hi> no burne, the <hi>Sea</hi> not drown, and <hi>lions of his law</hi> not devoure guilty mankind.</p>
            <p>And all this: yet not to be done in a direct judiciary way without an union, for although Chriſt as God be <hi>ſtronger</hi> then the <hi>ſtrong man</hi> Sathan: Yet the <hi>ſtronger diſpoſſeſſes not the leſſe ſtrong, but by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into his houſe:</hi> Chriſt muſt be incarnate;, that man may not be a Divell incarnate, Chriſts incarnation was an <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> againſt Sathan.</p>
            <p>Againe this only way was it, whereby Chriſt had fairer evidence for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57605:13"/>
his title to man, then Sathan had: for the Divell got in Man from Gods Regiment, (notwithſtanding the right of Creation) by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Man to be of one way, and one work with him (man having as little communion in eſſence and ſubſtance with God, as with the Serpent) but now Chriſt comes with this plea, and defeats him; For though Man and Sathan are of one work, yet are they not of one nature, though they be one way, yet they are not one fleſh: though in this they be one: <hi>both lyars, both deceitfull, both ſinfull:</hi> Yet in this Chriſt and Man agree better, that they be <hi>bone of his bone,</hi> and <hi>fleſh of his fleſh:</hi> And as the Serpent (for this very reaſon) when he ſeparated God and Man in the firſt fall, yet could not nullifie the Marriage of, or divorce <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Nor Sin nor Sathan could <hi>ſeparate them whom God hath put together:</hi> So Chriſt and his Church ſtanding upon the ſame termes, are ſo united, that: <hi>I am perſwaded that neither life nor death,</hi> (life will not, death cannot) <hi>nor Angels nor principalities, &amp;c. ſhall be able to ſeparate from the love of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Rom. 8. 38. 39.</p>
            <p>And ſo what hath bin ſaid of Sathan, is likewiſe to be ſaid of the goods which he is poſſeſſed of, (I meane ſins and plagues though <hi>I</hi> confeſſe in ſome ſence, even Man may be accounted part of his chatrel goods.)</p>
            <p>For ſinne like the Darkeneſſe of night is chaſed about the earth by the <hi>Sunne of Righteouſneſſe</hi> ſtil and only giving place to Chriſt whoſe advancing into our Horizon is the bringing in of the <hi>day of Salvation,</hi> and the driving away of the <hi>Darkneſſe</hi> of <hi>tranſgreſſion:</hi> For al other meanes, whether the <hi>Light of Conſcience, Law of Nature, Counſailes of Men, Rules of Philoſophie, Ingenuity of Education,</hi> yea and the very <hi>Law of God</hi> it ſelfe [that is it's <hi>Letter</hi>] are nothing elſe but Stars and Candlelight; not to drive away the night. But as it were ſo many arguments to prove that there is a night. Things that ſerve rather to ſhew that there is a Heaven and an Earth, then to inable us to enjoy either. And therefore they that doe charitably, acknowledg a poſsibility of ſalvation to the Heathen; which never heard of the Goſpel, ſay that this ſalvation doth accrue unto them from God for Chriſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57605:14"/>
ſake. Man could let in ſinne, but it is Chriſt that muſt expel it, Man could embrace wickedneſſe, but God muſt ſend his Sonne to <hi>bleſſe us by turning us away from our iniquities.</hi> Iſraell <hi>could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelfe.</hi> But it is <hi>God</hi> muſt <hi>helpe.</hi> David needed no guide to <hi>goe aſtray like a loſt ſheepe.</hi> But it is Davids Lord <hi>muſt ſeek and ſave him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly concerning the Lawes rigour, it fully appeares by that which hath been ſpoken already, that it muſt be an <hi>Immanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi> that muſt exonerate the burthen ſatisfie the court of juſtice, arreſt judgment, and take of the ſeargeant: with a <hi>ſuperſedeas.</hi> for an <hi>Execution taken out,</hi> and <hi>not ſerved.</hi> And all this is don by Chriſt as our <hi>Praes and Sponſor</hi> Surety, and Advocate, for the removing of evil from us. And this is the firſt reaſon.</p>
            <p>The: other reaſon concerning man is the promoting of his good which is done ſo many wayes ſo plentifully, that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> after his manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> calls Chriſt incarnate <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, the joy of the <hi>hungry. A cluſter</hi> of <hi>grapes,</hi> ſweete grapes from Gods vineyard the refreſhment of the thirſty ſoule, <hi>O yle of gladneſs.</hi> The health of the ſickly, and <hi>a ſtone cut out of the mountaine without hands</hi> that the negligent may feare. In a word: For the general let that goe for al which <hi>Fulgentius</hi> with fifteene other <hi>Biſhops</hi> more have ſubſcribed concerning this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ar <hi>except the Worde which is God by uniting in a ſingular way mans nature unto himſelfe, had been borne of a virgin a true and perfect man, there ſhould never have been beſtowed upon us (that are borne fleſhly) an Ariſe of a ſpiritual birth &amp;c.</hi> But now what ſweet enterchanges do there paſſe betweene the Lords A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed and mankind: He borrowes our <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and gives us his <hi>Spirit,</hi> takes <hi>Earth</hi> returns <hi>Heaven:</hi> Exchanges his <hi>Peace</hi> for our <hi>chaſtiſement,</hi> his <hi>ſonſhip,</hi> for our <hi>ſervitude,</hi> his <hi>grace</hi> for our <hi>ſinne,</hi> his <hi>crown</hi> for our <hi>curſe,</hi> his <hi>life</hi> for our <hi>death, his joyes</hi> for our <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</hi> In ſum of God he became Man; That wee by communion with him, of men might be <hi>made partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe mans felicity ſtands in enjoying God: Thus fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, hath the Sonne of God bartered Natures ſtates, and goods
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57605:14"/>
with man. His <hi>firſt</hi> nativity from <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> from <hi>Man,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him whoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Firſt</hi> Birth is from <hi>Man,</hi> to have a <hi>Second</hi> from <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly in ſeeing <hi>God</hi> whoſe brightneſſe, dazling al ſinfull ſight, with the <hi>beauty of holineſſe:</hi> Therefore hath the Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> like unto another meek <hi>Moſes put on the vaile</hi> of the fleſh, that by it <hi>boldly we might enter and have acceſſe to the Holy of Holies, to ſee as we are ſeene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thirdly if there be any inhaerent happineſſe [I underſtand the cauſe of it] in man aſwell as ſorrow, it is [but like the <hi>axe among the Prophets</hi> [a tool not fit for their coat] <hi>borrowed,</hi> and that from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For there are three ſeveral <hi>Gifts</hi> which are all of them compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in or ſubordinate to the Incarnation of Ieſus Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the happines of man, in the Scripture called by the name of <hi>Grace:</hi> And diſtinguiſhed by the immediate extrinſecal Giver.</p>
            <p>As firſt the grace of God which is the Father, by which grace, I conceive, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe is ſpecified. <hi>To</hi> which ſence I am enduced, by comparing that of Saint <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 2. 11. to that of St. <hi>Iohn c. 3. v.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Which grace muſt needes be the Spirit, if we conſider the promiſe <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 26. Which is ſomewhere alſo called the <hi>Grace of God, and of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly the <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which is well known to be that frame of holyneſſe in the Saincts, which being diverſified is called the <hi>fruit of the Spirit Gal.</hi> 5, 22 <hi>To</hi> the introducing of which laſt it was neceſſary that the two former ſhould precede. The <hi>Spirit</hi> as the proper fountaine of <hi>holineſſe</hi> and <hi>comfort:</hi> The incarnation as the <hi>Mediam</hi> and Motive of the Spirits miſsion to, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with man: But of this parhaps fully and more clearely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when (if ever) we come to write of Chriſt's <hi>Egreſſe</hi> from the world.</p>
            <p>Laſtly if in Mans felicity we may any way attend to mans actions: Or if there be any ſuch thing beſide the name of it as moral feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Chriſt as incarnate muſt be the procurer of it, which is done
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57605:15"/>
by him: As an Object of our Faith: A Ground of Hope: A cauſe of Love: and a Rule of Operation.</p>
            <p>Two things are required in the object of faith without either of which Faith failes: <hi>Affability.</hi> the Party we beleeve muſt be apt to be ſpoken with Rom. 10. 15. And <hi>Veracitie.</hi> The firſt is denyed, to God though with imputation of fault herein to Mans ſinne on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: according to that <hi>Let not God ſpeake leaſt we die.</hi> The other to man, God is not a Man that he ſhould lie <hi>Let God be true and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man a Lyer.</hi> God cannot be beleeved though true becauſe man cannot abide before his voice. Man cannot be truſted when he ſpeaks for untruths. Now in Chriſt theſe two are united: The <hi>affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of Man Here is our <hi>acceſſe:</hi> The <hi>truth</hi> of God Here the object of our faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly the ground of hope as the moſt plentifull expreſſion <hi>of Gods love,</hi> [<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The cauſe of love, thirdly he is in God to each of us perſonaly in us to God dutifully. <hi>We love him becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly the rule of Operation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In a Rule that men work by Two things are neceſſary: <hi>Rectitude</hi> and <hi>Viſibilicie.</hi> The firſt is in God without the ſecond.

Unles I may take leave to them the neceſſity of Chriſts incarnation to the removing of ſinne, to bring in the expreſsion of a <hi>Learned divine</hi> affirming that <hi>If the whole Heaven were turned into one Sunne: And the whole World into Paradise:</hi> I adde. If all the righteous men that ever were beſide, were compoſed into one Abel: And all the Angells of Heaven into one Seraphin: To make an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal holocauſt they would be inſufficient to expiate any one of theſe many ſinnes whereof wee ſtand guilty before God) Chriſt alone is an al ſuffieient <hi>ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the whole world. Ioh.</hi> 2. 2. But of this ſufficient hath been ſpoken in the fore going reaſons which concerne us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly the reaſons that concerne Sathan are his utter confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and overthrow: And that by man whoſe nature was by him firſt infected, and for ever infeſted: As It was the pride of Satans malignity againſt God that for his ſinne had caſt him out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to wound Gods Honour in the fall of the beſt of his earthly creatures mankind, whome he therefore aſſaulted and overthrew
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57605:16"/>
So it is the praiſe of Gods infinite juſtice, that although he might have immediatly vindicated his owne honour, and avenged <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as wel of himſelfe upon Sathan, in curſing him as he did the poore <hi>Snake</hi> his inſtrument. Yet he would not daigne to cope with him but in Man and therefore he ſent his Sonne in the forme not of man only, but an enthralled man, A ſervant <hi>to deſtroy him that had the power of death that is the divel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly that as Sathan by working upon the frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh deceived the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſo the <hi>Hooke</hi> of the <hi>deity</hi> (it is <hi>St. Hieromes</hi> phraſe) being <hi>Baited</hi> with the <hi>Humaine Nature:</hi> The <hi>Fleſh</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> invited the Great Devourer to bite: And ſo the great taker was taken: The great Devourer, was deceived as we ſhall ſee more in the treatiſe of Chriſts temptations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly (and wherewith I will conclude the argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Divell) this may (<hi>a poſteriore</hi> and by the effect) be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a reaſon of the Incarnation, that Sathan in his promiſes, (though moſt falſe and lying) might not out bid the goodneſſe of, God in his moſt true and reall performances. The greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that even the Tempter promiſed to mankind, (though that in his temptation of Chriſt to worſhip him was a very large lying one) was that to <hi>Eve,</hi> Gen. 3. 5. <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil:</hi> Now he was ſo far from performing it, that he effected the contrary (<hi>like a lyar</hi> as he was, <hi>from the beginning</hi>) which Almighty Gods Irony, verſe 25, will prove (though at firſt ſight it ſeeme to make good the Serpents words) This <hi>I</hi> ſay was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>argeſt promiſe that ever the Divell made with intention (as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the reſt) to deceive.</p>
            <p>This yet was ſomewhat leſſe then the Incarnation did perform. For if we take mankind as comprehended in the Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, it was more then (as God) for it was true to ſay, <hi>Hic homo Deus eſt, this man is God!</hi> Knowing good in himſelfe as God; evil in his burthen as Man: The evil of <hi>ſinne</hi> by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, The evil of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> by a moſt bitter paſſion, Or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide if wee conſider mankind as it is in <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And evill was never ſo objected to view of Men or Angels as it was by the exinanition of a Deity: The humbling of the ſupreme Majeſty of Heaven to become a man to ſuffer the confluence of Gods judgments, and curſes for the expiation of Mans ſinnes.</p>
            <p>And this uſe I muſt for ever make of it, when I am tempted to ſinne by enticing promiſes: I will perſwade my ſelfe to hope, farre more performed for me by Chriſt, then is now For ever was or will be promiſed by the grand worke maſter to ſinners the <hi>Prince of darkenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now when I ſeriouſly weigh theſe reaſons, and thinke to apply them, I can nor hear nor ſee other object but (me thinks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me) <hi>an Heavenly hoſt</hi> a <hi>multitude</hi> of Angels ſinging that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Anthem, <hi>Glory;</hi> Never ſuch glory! <hi>to God on high!</hi> Glory to his <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>mercy!</hi> Glory to his <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Contrivance!</hi> Glory to his <hi>Iuſtice and Severity!</hi> Glory to his <hi>Greatnes &amp; Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> And if two infinites may beare a compariſon I know whether be more <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Chriſt came in a time when God had made <hi>warrs to ceaſe in al Lands,</hi> and indeede he choſe a time fit for his buſineſſe, which was <hi>to reconcile things in Heaven, and things on Earth: Col.</hi> 1 20. Which reconciliation though it was perfected on the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> yet was it articled for, and treated in the Incarnation: <hi>v. 22. And (Ephes.</hi> 2. 14. 15.) Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is our peace who hath made both one, Having aboliſhed in the fleſh the enmity</hi>- In which words J humbly conceive the Apoſtle tyes not his diſcourſe to the abolition of that legal Sanctification of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Nation-where by they were ſeparated from al other people <hi>to be a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to God</hi> only, but intends the Main buſines Chriſt came into the

            <p>Well then let us ſee How the Incarnation is the ground of that dearly wanted bleſſing On Earth; Peace God when he framed the earth hung the happy affaires thereof on two hooks.
