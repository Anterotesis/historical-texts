            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Of the diverſe manner of Ploughs.</head>
               <p>THere are ſeveral makings of Ploughs,
according to the diverſe manner of
Countries; there are Ploughs of Iron
of diverſe faſhions, which is occaſioned
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45382:11"/>
from the diverſity of Grounds and Soyls:
Some are white Clay, ſome red, ſome gravel
chilturn, ſome ſand, ſome barren Earth, ſome
marled, and in many places Heath-ground;
ſo that one ſort of Plough will not ſerve in all
places, therefore it is neceſſary to have diverſe
manner of Ploughs. In <hi>Sommerſet-ſhire</hi> about
<hi>Ciceſter,</hi> the Sharre-beam that in many places
is called the Plough-head, is 4 or 5 foot long,
and it is broad and thin. And that is becauſe
the Land is very tough, ſo as to ſoak the Plough
into the Earth, if the Sharre-beam were not
large, broad, and thin. In <hi>Kent</hi> they have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner of Ploughs; ſome go with wheels,
as they do in diverſe other manner of places,
and ſome will turn the Shell-bred at every
Lands end, and plough all one way. In
<hi>Buckingham-ſhire</hi> are Ploughs made of another
manner, and alſo other manner of Plough-Irons,
the which generally are good and likely
to ſerve in many places, and eſpecially if the
Plough-beam and Sharre-beam were four
inches longer between the Sheath and Plough-tayl,
that the Shell-bred might come more
ſlope; for thoſe Ploughs give out too ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and therefore they are the worſe to draw.
In <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire, Lanca-ſhire, York-ſhire, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge-ſhire,
Lincoln-ſhire, Norfolk,</hi> and many
other Countries, the Ploughs are of divers
makings. But howſoever they are made, they
are well tempered, and go well.</p>

               <head>To know the Names of all parts of the
Plough.</head>
               <p>To inform thoſe young Husbandmen that
are ignorant of the ſeveral names of
ploughs, I ſhall expreſs them as followeth: The
Plough-beam is the longer Tree, above which
is a little bend. The Share-beam is the Tree
underneath; whereupon the Share is ſet. The
plough-ſheth is a thin piece of dry wood made
of Oak, that is ſet faſt in a Mortes to the
ploughs beam, and alſo into the Share-beam,
the which is the Kere or chief band of the
plough. The plough-tayl is that the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
holdeth in his hand, and in the hinder
end of the plough-beam is put a long ſlit made
in the ſame tayl, and not ſet faſt, out that it
may riſe up and go down, and it is pinned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and the ſame plough-tayl is ſet faſt in a
Mortes in the hinder end of the Share-beam.
The plough-ſtilt is on the right ſide of the
plough, whereupon the Reſt is ſet: the Reſt is a
little piece of wood pinned faſt upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the ſtilt, and to the Share-beam
into the further end. The Shelbred is a broad
piece of wood faſt pinned to the right ſide of
the Sheth in the farther end, and to the utter
ſide of the ſtilt in the hinder end: And the
ſaid Shelbred ſhould come over the ſaid Sheth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45382:12"/>
and Senbred an inch, and to go paſt the midſt
of the Share with a ſharp edge to receive and
turn the Earth when the Culter hath cut it.
There are two long ſtands in every plough in
the hinder end, ſet a ſlope between the plough-tayl
and the ſtilt, to hold out and keep the
plough abroad in the hinder end, the one is
longer then the other. The plough-foot is a
little piece of wood which is crooked and ſet
before in a Mortes in the plough-beam, ſet
faſt with Wedges to drive up and down, and
it is a ſtay to order of what deepneſs the
plough ſhall go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The plough-ear is made of
three pieces of Iron, nailed faſt to the right
ſide of the plough-beam. The meaner ſort
have a crooked ſort of wood pinned faſt to the
plough beam. The Share is a piece of Iron,
ſharp before, and broad behind, a foot long,
made with a Socket to be ſet on the further
end of the Share beam, the Culter is a bent
piece of Iron ſet in a Mortes in the midſt of the
plough-beam faſtned with Wedges on every
ſide, and the back thereof is half an inch thick,
and more then three inches broad, made ſharp
before to cut the Earth clean, it muſt be well
ſteeled, which will cauſe the eaſier draught,
and the Irons for to laſt the longer. The
plough-wall is a piece of hard wood, with a
pin put through, ſet in the plough-beam in an
Augure hole.</p>

               <head>Of the tempering of the Ploughs.</head>
               <p>THe knowledge of the tempering of the
Plough is very expedient and neceſſary
for a Husbandman, that he may plough and
turn clean, and make no Reſt-balks. A Reſt-balk
is where the Plough biteth at the point of
the Culter or Share, and cutteth not the
ground clean to the Furrow that was lately
ploughed, but leaveth a little Ridge ſtanding
between, the which breeds Thiſtles and other
Weeds. All theſe Ploughs ſhould have all a
like manner of tempering in the Irons: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
one may temper for one thing in two or
three places, as for deepneſs; the foot is one, the
ſetting of the Culter is another, and the third
is at the Plough-tayl, where are two Wedges
that are called Slote-wedges; the one is in the
Slote above the Beam, and the other is in the
ſaid Slote under the Plough-beam; ſometimes
the Husbandman will ſet both above, or both
underneath; but always let him take good
heed, and keep one general Rule, That the
hinder end of the Share-beam always touch the
Earth, that it may kill the Worms, or elſe it
goeth not truly. The tempering to go broad
or narrow, is in the ſetting of the Culter, and
with the driving of the ſame Wedges, fore-wedge
and hind-wedge, which ſhould be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45382:13"/>
made of dry wood, &amp; alſo the ſetting on of his
ſhare helpeth well, and is a cunning point of
Husbandry, which mendeth and pareth much
ploughing; it muſt lean much into the Furrow,
and the point muſt not ſtand too much up nor
down, nor too much into the Land, nor into
the Furrow. Some Ploughs have a Band of
Iron triangle-wiſe, ſet there as the Plough-ear
ſhould be, that hath three nickes on the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide: and if the Husbandman will have
his Plough to go a narrow Furrow, as a ſide
Furrow ſhould be, then he muſt ſet his Foot-team
in the nick next to the Plough-beam;
and he will go an ordinary breadth, he ſetteth
it in the middle nick that is beſt for ſtirring,
and if he would go a broad Furrow he ſetteth
it in the uttermoſt nick, that is the beſt for
following, the which is a good way to keep
the Brede ſound tempered, but it ſerveth not
the deepneſs: and ſome men have inſtead of
the Plough-foot a piece of Iron ſet upright in
the further end of the Plough-beam, they call
it a Cock, made with two or three nicks, and
and that ſerveth for deepneſs. The Ploughs
that go with Wheels have all a ſtraight Beam,
and may be tempered in the Iron, as the other
are for the breadth; but their moſt ſpecial tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is at the Bolſter, where the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ough-beam
lyeth, and that ſerveth for deepneſs and for
breadth. They are good on even Ground
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45382:13"/>
that lyeth light, but they are far more coſtly
then the other Ploughs. And though theſe
Ploughs be well tempered for one manner of
Ground, that temper will not ſerve for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner of Ground, but it muſt reſt in the
diſcretion of the Husbandman to know when
it goeth well.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Neceſſary things that belong to a Plough,
Cart, or Wain.</head>
               <p>BEfore the Husbandman begins to plough,
he muſt have his Plough well ordered, and
his Plough-Iron, his Oxen, or Horſes, and all
the Gere that belongeth to them, that is to ſay,
Bows, Yokes, Lades, Stickings, Wrethyne
Teams. And before he doth lade his Corn, he
muſt have a Wain, a Capiock, or pair of Sleths,
Wain rope, a Pitchfork. This Wain is made
of divers pieces, that will require great repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that is to ſay, the Wheels, which are
made of Nathes, Spokes, Treſſes, and Dowles,
they muſt be well fettered with wood or Iron,
and if they are Iron-bound, they are much the
better; although they are the dearer at the
firſt, yet at length the Husbandman ſhall find
them better cheap; for a pair of Wheels Iron-bound
will wear out ſeven or eight pair of
Wheels, and go round and light after the
Oxen or Horſes to draw. Howſoever on Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45382:14"/>
Grounds and ſoft, the other Wheels are
better, becauſe they are broader on the ſole,
and will not go ſo deep. They muſt have an
Axletree clout with eight Wain clouts of Iron,
two Limpins of Iron in the Axletree end, two
Axle pins of Iron, or elſe of tough hard wood.
The body of the Wain of Oak, the Staves, the
nether Rathes, the over Rathes, Croſs-ſomner,
the Keys and Py-ſtaves. And if he go with a
Horſe or a Mare to plough, then muſt he have
his Hombers, or Collers, Holmes, whited
Traiſes, Swingleters, and Tog. Alſo a Cart
made of Aſh, becauſe it is light and like ſtuff to
the Wain, and alſo a Cart-Saddle, Back-bands
and Belly-bands, and a Cart-ladder behind
when the Husbandman ſhall carry any Corn,
or other Proviſion. In many Countries there
are Wains that have Cart-ladders both behind
and before. Alſo the Husbandman muſt have
an Ax, a Hatchet, a Hedging-bill, a Pin-auger,
a Reſt-auger, a Hail, Spade, and a Shovel:
many other things are belonging to Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
which will be very coſtly, therefore it
will be neceſſary for him to make his Yokes,
Ox-bows, Stoles, and as many other things as
he can of his Plough-gere.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45382:14"/>
               <head>Whether is better a Plough of Horſes, or
a Plough of Oxen.</head>
               <p>IN ſome places a Horſe-plough is better then
an Ox-plough, that is to ſay, in every place
where the Husbandman hath ſeveral paſtures;
for the Horſes may be teddered or tyed upon
their Leys, Balks, or Hades, whereas Oxen
may not be kept, and it is but in few places
that they are uſed to be teddered. And Horſes
will go faſter then Oxen on even or light
Ground, and quicker in Carriages, but they
are far more coſtly to keep in Winter; for
they muſt have both Hay and Corn to eat, and
Straw for Litter: they muſt be well ſhod on
all four feet, and the Gear that they draw with
is more coſtly then that of Oxen, and will laſt
but for a ſhort time. The Oxen will eat
ſtraw and a little Hay, the which is not half
the coſt that is required for Horſes, neither are
they ſhod. Therefore where the Husbandman
hath ſeveral paſtures to put his Oxen in when
they come from their work, there the Ox-plough
is the better. For an Ox muſt not
endure his work to labour all day, and then
to be put to the Commons, or elſe before the
Herdmen, all night without meat, and to go
to his labour in the morning: But if he be
put in good paſture all night, he will labour
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45382:15"/>
luſtily all the day. Moreover Oxen will
plough in tough Clay and hilly Ground where
Horſes will ſtand ſtill. If any Diſeaſe come
to the Horſe, or the Horſe grows old, bruiſed
or blind, then he will be little worth; and if
any Diſeaſe come to an Ox, that he grows
old, bruiſed, or blind, for a ſmall matter he
may be fatted, and then he is mans meat, and
as good or better then ever he was; whereas
when the Horſe dyes, he is but Carrion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Horſes and Mares to draw.</head>
               <p>A Husbandman cannot be without Horſes
or Mares, or both, and that more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if he go with a Horſe plough, he muſt
have both his Horſes to draw, and his Mares
to bring Colts to uphold his ſtock; the Mares
muſt not bear Sacks, or be ridden upon, or go
Journeys when they are with Fole, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they have gone with Fole twenty
or twenty three weeks, for then then there is
great danger; for if ſhe be then ridden upon
and ſet up hot, ſhe will caſt her Fole, which
will prove a great loſs to him that ownes her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For ſhe will labour and bear when ſhe hath
foaled, and draw when ſhe is with Foal as
well as the Horſe. It is convenient for the
Husbandman to know when his Mare ſhould
be horſed. It is the common ſaying, that ſhe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45382:15"/>
will take Horſe within nine or ten days next
after ſhe hath foaled, but I am not altogether
of that opinion; and if ſhe ſo do, ſhe will not
hold thereto, for that Horſe doth force and
drive her to it: but twenty days after is time
enough to bring her to a Horſe, for otherwiſe
ſhe will not hold to it, except ſhe be very eager
of horſing: and that may be known by her
ſhap, for that will twirl about and cloſe again
many times in an hour. And then bring her
to a Horſe, and let her be with him a day or a
night, and that is ſufficient; for it is better to
keep the Horſe from the Mares, then to go with
them, for divers cauſes, and that more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for that the Horſe ſhall be more luſty, and
more Foals may be got. But that Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that hath many Mares will have too little
leiſure to attend them, but let them go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and happy be lucky. Some men do
hold an opinion, that put a Horſe to a Mare in
the beginning of the Moon, after it be prime,
that he ſhall get a Horſe-foal; others hold the
contrary, that if a Horſe be put to a Mare in the
old of the Moon, he ſhould get Horſe-foals.
I hold that it maketh no matter whether, for
I have proved it, that a Mare is moſt able to
bear the Horſe from <hi>May</hi>-day to St. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mews</hi>
day; for I have had Horſes that have
gone into my Mares both day and night, and
at the foaling time. I have had upon one day
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45382:16"/>
a Horſe-foal, and on the next day and ſecond
a Mare-foal, and on the third and fourth day
next after a Horſe-foal, and on the next day or
ſecond a Mare-foal, and on the third or fourth
day next after a Horſe again, and ſo every
week of both ſorts; whereas by their opinion
or reaſon, I ſhould have fourteen days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Horſe-foals, and other fourteen days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Mare-foals. But of one thing I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that ſome one Horſe will get more Horſe-foals
then ſome other Horſe will do; and
likewiſe a Mare will bear more Mare-colts
then ſome other Mares will do, though they
are horſed both with one Horſe; neither can
I give any reaſon why, except the luſtineſs of
the Natures of both of them are put to it,
whether of them ſhould have the domination.
But if the Husbandman have Mares of divers
colours, let him ſever them in divers parcels,
and let him put to his white Mare a gray
Horſe, and his gray Mare a white Horſe, ſo
that he be not all white-skinned about the
mouth; and to a Mare of colour that hath no
white upon her, a coloured Horſe that hath
much more white on him, and to his coloured
Mare a mean white Horſe of colour main
white. And thus ſhall the Colts be well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured.
And if a white Horſe be put to a
coloured Mare, ſhe ſhall have moſt commonly
ſandy Colt like to an Iron gray, neither like
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45382:16"/>
Sire nor Dam. Howſoever, I have known
many Mares that will have their Colts like the
Horſe that got it, the which is againſt the kind
of Mares; for a man had rather get one good
Horſe then many Mares that are not ſo likely
to prove well.</p>

ſuch other Neceſſaries, that muſt needs be

               <p>IN the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and the beginning

carry out his Dung or Muck, and to lay it upon
his Barley-ground. And where he hath Barley
this year, let him ſow it with Wheat or Rye,

mow all his Lands over at every ſecond fallow.
But that Husbandman that can find the means
to carry out his Dung, and doth lay it upon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45382:17"/>
his Land after it be once ſtirred, it is much
better for him then to lay it upon his fallow,
for divers cauſes: One is, that if it be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his fallow, all that falleth upon the hollow
ridge ſhall do little good; for when it is ridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again, it lyeth ſo deep in the Earth, that
it will not be eaſily ploughed up again, except
that when he hath ſpread it, he will with a
Shovel or a Spade caſt out all that is fallen in
the ridge. And if it be laid upon the ſtirring,
at every ploughing it ſhall meddle the Dung
and the Earth together; the which ſhall cauſe

In ſome places they load not their Dung

<hi>York</hi> and <hi>Rippon,</hi> and that I call better
then upon the fallow, and eſpecially for Barley.
But upon the firſt ſtirring it is beſt for Wheat
or Rye, and that the Husbandmans Dung be
laid upon ſmall heaps nigh together, and to
ſpread it even, and to leave no Dung there as
the Muck-heap ſtood; for the moiſtneſs of the
Dung ſhall cauſe the Ground to be rank e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
And if it be meddled with Earth, it
will laſt the longer, and better for Barley then
for Wheat or Rye, becauſe of Weeds, Horſe-dung
is the worſt Dung that is. The Dung of
all manner of Cattell that chew their Cud, is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45382:17"/>
very good, and the Dung of Doves is beſt, but
it muſt be laid upon the Ground very thin.</p>

let the Husbandman plough it as deep as he can
for to turn the Roots of the Weeds upwards,
that the Sun and the dry Weather may kill
them; for he cannot conveniently plough his
Land, and load out his Dung both upon one

well enough load out his Dung before Noon,
and he may load Hay or Corn in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon

the time for the Husbandman to make his

it ſhould be water-furrowed between the

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45382:18"/>
and if the Lands lye high in the Rigge, and
high at the Raine, and low in the midſt of the

the Raine, as I have obſerved from time to

ſet his Plough three or four foot from the
Rigge, and caſt all the Rigge on both ſides, and
when the Rigge is caſt, let him ſet his Plough
there as he began up to the remainder of the

               <head>To Harrow all manner of Corn.</head>
               <p>WHen the Lands are ploughed, and the
Corn ſown, it will be convenient that
they ſhould be well harrowed, or elſe Crows,
Pigeons, will eat, devour, and bear away the
Corns. It is the cuſtom in many Countries to
have all an Ox-harrow, the which is made of
ſix ſmall pieces of Timber called Harrow-bulls,
made either of Aſh or Oak; they are of
two yards long, and as much as the ſmall of a
mans leg, they have ſhots of wood put thorow
them, like Laths, and in every bull are ſix
ſharp pieces of Iron called Harrow-tyndes, ſet
ſomewhat aſlope forward, and the forma
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45382:18"/>
ſlope muſt be bigger then the other, becauſe
the fore-beam muſt be faſtned to the ſame
with ſhackle or with a Wyth to draw by. This
Harrow is good to break the great Clots, and
to make much mould, and then the Horſe-harrows
to come after to make the Clots
ſmaller, and to lay the Ground even. It is a
great labour and pains for the Ox to go to
harrow, it is more eaſie and better for them to
go to plough two days, then to harrow one
day. It is an old ſaying:
<q>
                     <l>The Ox is never wo,</l>
                     <l>Till he to the Harrow go.</l>
                  </q>
And the reaſon is, becauſe the Harrow goeth
by twitches, and not always after one draught.
The Horſe-harrow is made of five bulls, not
above an Ell of length, and not ſo much ſhot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
&amp; tinded. And when that the Corn is well
covered, then it is harrowed enough: There
are Horſe-harrows that have tindes of wood,
and thoſe are uſed much about <hi>Rippon,</hi> and
ſome other places where he may border ſtones;
for thoſe ſtones would wear the Iron too
ſoon. And thoſe tindes are moſt commonly
of the Ground-end of a young Aſh; they are
more then a foot long in the beginning, and
ſtand as much above the Harrow as beneath.
And as they wear or break, they drive them
down lower; they ſhould be made long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45382:19"/>
that they are uſed, that they may be dry;
for then they will indure and laſt much better,
and ſtick the faſter. The Horſes that ſhall
draw theſe Harrows, muſt be well kept, and
ſhod well, or elſe they will be ſoon tired, and
ſore beaten, that they will not be able to
draw; they muſt have Hombers or Collers,
Holmes writhed about their Necks, Treſſes to
draw by, and a Swingle-tree for to hold the
Treſſes, and a Togewith betwixt the Swingle-tree
and the Harrow. And if the Barley-ground
will not break with Harrows, but be
clotty, it ſhould be beaten with Mauls, and
not ſtraight down; for then the Corn will be
beaten into the Earth. And if they beat the
Clot on the ſide, it will the better break, and
the Clot will be the lighter, that the Corn
may come by the lighter. Some uſe to roll

               <p>WHen the Husbandmen have ſown their

fallow in the latter end of <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> for

beſt that they can to plough a broad Furrow,
and deep, ſo that they turn it clean, and lay it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45382:19"/>
flat, that it rear not an edge, the which will
deſtroy all the Thiſtles and Weeds: For the
deeper and the broarder that it goeth, the more
new mould, and the greater clots ſhall they
have, and the greater clots, the better Wheat;
for the clots keep the Wheat warm all the
Winter, but at <hi>March</hi> they will melt and
break, and fall into many ſmall pieces, the
which is a new dunging and refreſhing the

weeds grow upon the fallows that are fallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for the Plough goeth underneath the roots
of all manner of weeds, and turneth the root
upwards, that they may not grow. And if
the Land be fallowed in Winter time, it will
be far the worſe, for theſe three cauſes: One
is, all the Rain that falleth, ſhall waſt the
Land, and drive away the Dung, and the
good Mould, that the Land ſhall be much the

that a dry <hi>May</hi> coming, it will be too
hard to ſtir in the month of <hi>June.</hi> The third
cauſe is, the weeds ſhall take ſuch root in the

foot and an half to the Perch or Pole,
four Perches to an Acre in breadth, and eleven
Perches to an Acre in length, may be very
well ſown with two <hi>London</hi> Buſhels of Peaſe,
that is but two Strikes in other places; and
if there be the fourth part Beans, then will it
require half a <hi>London</hi> Buſhel more; and if it be
half Beans, it will have three <hi>London</hi> Buſhels,
and more; if it be of Beans, it will have four
<hi>London</hi> Buſhels fully, and that is half a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
becauſe the Beans are great, and grow up
ſtraight, and do not ſpread and grow abroad
as Peaſe do. An Acre of good Beans is worth
an Acre and a half of good Peaſe, becauſe there
will be more Buſhels: And the beſt property
that belongeth to a good Husbandman, is to
ſow all manner of Corn thick enough, and
eſpecially Beans and Barley; for commonly
they are ſown upon rank Grounds, and good
Ground will have the burden of Corn and of
Wood: And as much ploughing and harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath an Acre of Ground, and ſow thereupon
but one Buſhel, and another ſoweth four Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels:
And undoubtedly one Buſhel will not

give ſo much Corn again as the four Buſhels,
though the three Buſhels that be ſowed more
be allowed and ſet apart. And one Buſhel
and a half of white Peaſe or green Peaſe, will
ſow as much ground as two Buſhels of gray
Peaſe, and that is, becauſe they are ſo ſmall,
that the Husbandman need not to take ſo great
a handful. In ſome Countries they begin for

is found to be a good ſeaſon, ſo that they are
ſown towards the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> or

Wheat and Rye. Wheat is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

under: and in ſome places they ſow their
Wheat upon their Peaſe-ſtubble, the which is

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45382:22"/>
fallow; and that is uſed where they make
fallow in a Field every fourth year. In <hi>Eſſex</hi>
they uſe to have a Youth to go in the furrow
before the Horſes or Oxen, with a Bag or a
Hopper full of Corn, and he taketh his hand
full of Corn, by little and little caſteth it in the

howſoever there is much good Corn

two <hi>London</hi> Buſhels of Wheat and Rye

Wheat, and ſome for Rye, and ſome for both,
and upon that good Ground ſow blend Corn,
that is, both Wheat and Rye, which is the
ſureſt Corn of growing good for the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Houſhold. And this Wheat that ſhall
be medled with Rye, muſt be ſuch Wheat as
will ſoon be ripe, and that is flaxen Wheat,
pole-ear'd Wheat, or white Wheat. There
are divers kinds of Wheats: Flaxen Wheat
hath a yellow Ear, and bare, without Anys,
and is the brighteſt Wheat in the Buſhel, and
will make the whiteſt Bread. This Corn will
wear the ground very much; the ſtraw of it is
ſmall, but it grows very thick, and is but ſmall
Corn. Pole-ear'd Wheat hath no Anys, 'tis
thick ſet in the Ear, and it will ſoon fall out;
'tis greater Corn, and it will make white
Bread. White Wheat is like pole-ear'd Wheat
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45382:22"/>
in the Buſhel, but it hath Anys, and the Ear is
four-ſquare, and it will make white Bread.
In <hi>Eſſex</hi> they call flaxen Wheat, white Wheat.
Red Wheat hath a flat Ear, an inch broad,
full of Anys, it is the greateſt Corn, the broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Blade, and the greateſt Straw, it will make
white bread, though it be the ruddieſt of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

Ear, it hath few or no Anys, and it is the worſt
Wheat, except Peck-wheat. Peck-wheat hath
a red Ear, full of Anys, thin ſet, and oft-times
it is flintered, that is to ſay, ſmall Corn
wringeled and dryed; it will not make white
bread, but it will grow upon cold ground.</p>

maketh it to be mellow and rank. And
if a dry ſeaſon comes before <hi>Candlemas,</hi> or
ſoon after, it ſhould be caſt down, and water
furrowed between the Lands, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>March</hi> ridge it up again; ſow in
every Acre five <hi>London</hi> buſhels, or four at the
leaſt: ſome years it may ſo happen that there
is no ſeaſonable weather before <hi>March</hi> to plow
the Barley-earth. The Husbandman as ſoon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45382:23"/>
as he hath ſowed his Peaſe and Beans, then
let him caſt his Barley-earth, and ſhortly after
ridge it again, ſo that it be ſoon before <hi>April:</hi>
And if the time of the year be paſt, then ſow it
upon the caſting. There are three kinds of
Barleys, that is to ſay, Sprot Barley, long Ear,
and Bear Barley: Sprot Barley hath moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a flat Ear, three quarters of an inch
broad, and three inches long, the corners are
very great and white, it is the beſt Barley. Long
Ear hath a flat Ear, half an inch broad, and

Barley, four <hi>London</hi> buſhels are ſufficient for
an Acre: and in ſome Countries they do not

But that Barley generally is never ſo good as

any Corn elſe; for wet ground is good for no
manner of Corn. Three <hi>London</hi> buſhels will
ſow an Acre. There are three ſorts of Oats,
that is to ſay, red Oats, black Oats, and rough
Oats. Red Oats are the beſt, when they are
threſhed they will be yellow in the buſhel;
they are very good to make Oatmeal of.
Black Oats are as great as they are, but they
have not ſo much flour in them, for they have
a thicker Husk, nor do they make ſo good
Oatmeal. The rough Oats are the worſt
Oats, and it quitteth not the coſt to ſow them.
They are very light, and have long tayls,
whereby they will hang each on the other.
Theſe ſeveral kinds of Oats wear the ground
very much, and maketh it as it were quick.
A young Husbandman had need to be careful
how thick he ſoweth all manner of Corn for
two or three years, and to obſerve how it
cometh up, whether it be thick enough or
not; and if it be too thin, let him ſow thicker
the next year; but if it prove well, let him

all manner of Corn, and hath ſmall cods, and
groweth like Muſtard-ſeed. Docks have a
broad leaf, and divers high ſpires, and very
ſmall ſeed in the top. Cockle hath a long
ſmall leaf, and it will bear five or ſix flowers,
purple colour, as broad as a Groat; the ſeed
is round and black, and may well be ſuffered
in bread-corn, but not in ſeed, for therein is
much flour. Drake is like Rye till it begin
to ſeed; it hath many ſeeds like to Fennel-ſeeds,

well be ſuffered in bread, for there is much
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45382:25"/>

proceedeth from Rye. Darnel groweth up
ſtraight like to a high graſs; it hath long ſeeds

moſt commonly when great wet falleth ſhortly

weed, and it doth never appear till the month

groweth moſt in Rye: It is ſomewhat like
Fitches, but that it is much ſmaller; it will
grow as high as the Corn, and with the weight

the Ears of it away: Wherefore I have ſeen
Husbandmen mow down the Corn and it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;

               <head>How to weed Corn.</head>
               <p>THe chief inſtrument to weed Corn, is a
pair of Tongs made of wood, the further
end of them being nicked to hold the weed
the faſter. After a ſhower of Rain it is beſt
weeding, for then they may be pulled up by
the roots, ſo as never for to grow again. If it
be dry Weather, then muſt the Weeder have a
Hook with a Socket upon a little ſtaff a yard
long; and this Hook ſhould be well ſteeled,
and ground ſharp both behind and before;
and in his other hand he ſhould have a forked
ſtick of about a yard long, and with his fork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtick he muſt put the weed from him, and
he putteth the Hook beyond the root of the
weed, and he pulleth it to him, and cutteth
the weed cloſe to the Earth, and with his
Hook he taketh up the weed, and caſteth it in
the Raine, and if the Raine be full of Corn,
it is better to ſtand ſtill when it is cut and
withered; but let him beware that he do not
tread too much upon the Corn, and eſpecially
after that it be ſhot, and when that he cutteth
the weed, that he cutteth not the Corn; and
therefore the Hook ſhould not exceed to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45382:26"/>
above an inch wide. And when the weed is
ſo ſhort, that he cannot with his forked ſtick
put it from him, and with the Hook put it to
him, then muſt he ſet his Hook upon the weed
cloſe to the Earth, and put it from him, and
ſo he ſhall cut it clean. With theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
he ſhall never need to ſtoop to his
work. Dog-fennel, Goldes, Mathes, and Ked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
are bad to weed after this manner, they
grow upon ſo many branches, and are ſo cloſe
to the Earth, and therefore they uſe for the
moſt part to pull them up with their hands:
but let them look well, that they pull not up
the Corn therewithal. As for Tare, no weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will ſerve turn.</p>

ſtraws that he holdeth not in his hand, flyeth
over his head, and are loſt, and alſo it will
pull off the Ears, and that more eſpecially of
the Corns that are very ripe. In ſome places
they will ſhear their Corns high, to the intent
to mow their ſtubble, either to thatch or to
burn; if they ſo do, they have great cauſe to
take good heed of the ſhearers: For if the
Ears of the Corn crook down, or bend to the
Earth, if the ſhearer be not very wary, and put
up the Ear, or he cut the ſtraw, as many Ears as
be under his Hook or Sickle, fall to the Earth,

               <p>LEt the Husbandman ſow his Peaſe upon

then the Peaſe. Howſoever ſome Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are of opinion, that the big and ſtiff
ground, as Clay, ſhould be ſown with big
ware, as Beans: but I am of another mind;
for if a dry Summer come, his Beans will fall
ſhort. And if the ground be very good, put
the more Beans to the Peaſe, and they will
yield the better, when they are threſhed. And
if it be very rank ground, as it is much at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Town-ſide, where Cattel do reſort, that
plough not the Land, until it be ſown; for if
he do, there will come up Kedlocks and other
weeds. But let him ſow it with Beans; for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45382:28"/>
if he ſow it with Peaſe, the Kedlocks will hurt
them. And when he finds a ſeaſonable time,
let him ſow both Peaſe and Beans, ſo that they
are ſown in the beginning of <hi>March.</hi> To
know a ſeaſonable time to ſow, go upon the
Land that is ploughed, and if it ſing or cry, or
make any noiſe under thy feet, then 'tis too
wet to ſow; but if it make no noiſe, and will
bear the Horſes, then ſow in the Name of God.
For the manner of his ſowing, let him put the
Peaſe into the Hopper, and caſt a broad thong
of Leather or Garth-web of an Ell long; let him
faſten it to both the ends of the Hopper, and
put it over his head like a Belt, and ſtand in
the midſt of the Land where the Sack lyeth,
the which is moſt conveniently for the filling of
the Hopper, and let him ſet his left foot before,
and take a handful of Peaſe. And when he hath
taken up his right foot, then let him caſt the
Peaſe from him all abroad, and when his left
foot riſeth, let him take another handful, and
when his right foot, then caſt them from him,
and ſo at every two paces, he ſhall ſow a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

he dare truſt the weather, then let him let it
lye ſo all night, and on the next day let him
turn it again before Noon, and towards the
night make it windrows, &amp; then in ſmall Hay-cocks,
and ſo to ſtand one night at the leaſt
and ſweat, and the next fair day caſt it abroad
again, and turn it once or twice, and then
make it into greater Hay-cocks: and to ſtand
ſo one night or more, that it may unjoyn and
ſweat; for if it ſweat not in the Hay-cocks, it
will ſweat in the Mow, and then it will be
duſty, and not wholeſom for the Cattel. And
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45382:33"/>
when it ſtandeth in the Cocks, it is better for
to load, and more Hay may be loaded at a
loading, and the faſter it will lye; which
Hay cometh of a Graſs called Crow-foot, and
groweth flat above the Earth, and beareth a
yellow flower half a yard high and more;
and hath many knots towards the coat, and it
is the beſt Hay for Horſes and Beaſts, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
much more widdering then any other
Hay, for elſe it will bepiſs it ſelf, and wax hot,
and afterwards duſty. For to know when it is
widdered enough, make a little Rope of the
ſame, that you think ſhould be moſt green,
and twine it as hard together between your
hands as you can, and ſo being hard twined,
let one take a ſharp Knife, and cut it cloſe by
your hand, and the knots will be moiſt, if it
be not dry enough. Short Hay and Ley-Hay
are good for Sheep and other Cattel.</p>

it ſtands in great danger of the wind when it

then let him take his Graft, and cut it on the

               <p>IN the Winter before the Husbandman will

And immediately after it is fallen, let it be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

buds and iſſues out of many branches, and

lop, or crop for his Fire-wood, let him
crop them in Winter (as hath been ſaid) that
the Beaſts may eat the brouſe and the moſs of
the boughs. And alſo the Yves, and when
that they are brouſed and eaten, let him dreſs
the wood, bow it clean, and cut it at every
height, and rear the great wood to the top,
and kid the ſmall boughs, and ſet them an
end; and if he ſhall not have ſufficient wood,
except that he head the Trees, and cut off the
tops, then let him head them three or four foot
above any Timber: and if it be no Timber,
but a ſhaken Tree, or a Hedge-root full of
knots, then let him head it thirty foot high, or
twenty at the leaſt; for ſo far it will bear
plenty of wood and boughs, and much more
then if it were not headed. For a Tree hath
a property to grow to a certain height, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45382:39"/>
when it arriveth to that height, it is at a ſtand,
and groweth no higher; but in bredth and in
concluſion, the top will dye or decreaſe, and
the body thrive; and if a Tree be headed and
uſed to be cropped and lopped at every twelve
or ſixteen years end, or thereabouts, it will
bear much more wood in proceſs of time, then
if it were not cropped, and be more profitable
to the Owner.</p>
               <p>It is the common Cuſtom with ſome to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at the top of the Tree when it is to be ſhred
or cropped, becauſe each bough ſhould lie upon
the other, when that they ſhall fall, ſo that the
weight of the boughs ſhall cauſe them to be
the rather cut down; but that is not the beſt
way, for that cauſeth the bough to ſhave down
the nether part, and pulleth away the bark
from the body of the Tree, the which for the

place, to the hurt of it. And therefore let the

which will much further the Sets in their

ſort.</p>
               <p>The Gardiner having digged and prepared
his Garden into Beds and Borders, I will now
ſhew him, as briefly as I can, the beſt order
and manner for ſetting and ſowing of the
chiefeſt Plants, Herbs, Flowers that are now
moſt in requeſt.</p>
               <p>When he ſets any Herbs, Flowers, or Plants,
he muſt the next day a little moiſten the
ground in the morning, and ſo keep it moiſt
until they be well rooted by watering.</p>
               <p>The beſt watering which is certain (except
his Ground be new made with half Dung) is
to make a hole with the Dibble a little for the
Herb or Plant aſlope to the Root, and ſo to
water the Root under the ground; for water
rotteth and killeth above ground, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he ſows, let him cover it with Earth,
but as thin as he can; for if they be too deep
ſet or ſown, moſt Seeds, Kernels, and ſuch like,
will never come up.</p>
               <p>When he ſets any thing, let him be ſure to
make the Earth very wet, then let him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
half a foot on dry Mould, making it ſo
cloſe (with beating it with the Spade) as he
can, then let him ſet in his Herbs or Plants,
thruſting the Earth very hard to the Root.</p>
               <p>Herbs for works may be watered; but Plants
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45382:41"/>
muſt not be wet above ground, for fear of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>Let him never water but in the morning,
except in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> and then he may water
about four of the clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>For ſetting, ſowing, or planting, it is beſt
when the weather is warm, nor the ground
neither too wet nor too dry at the top, but ſo
moiſt as that it will not ſtick to his ſhoe, as
after a Froſt. And for the time of the Moon,
I hold the ſecond day before the New Moon
to be the beſt for moſt things but for Flowers,
and that a little after the Change or New
Moon.</p>
               <p>The Ground which is to ſow at the Spring,
muſt be digged at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> with good
Dung, and then let him trench the digging.</p>
               <p>The beſt time for ſowing is <hi>February, March,
April;</hi> but for the ſetting of Herbs, <hi>March,</hi>
and the beginning of <hi>April</hi> is beſt: and thoſe
Herbs which ſpring out of the ground in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
muſt be ſet in the month.</p>
               <p>In the middle of <hi>April,</hi> or in the beginning
of <hi>May</hi> (as the Moon ſhall happen to be in the
Wane) let him dig a Ditch about a yard deep,
and lay ſome three quarters of a Load of
Horſe-dung therein, then let him cover the
Dung over a foot thick with good Earth, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Seeds along on the Earth dry, and let
him cover them an inch thick with light
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45382:41"/>
Earth, and every night (until <hi>May</hi> be paſt)
let him cover them with a wet Cloth or ſtraw,
to keep away the Froſt, and uncover them in
the day time: And let him take notice, that
when the Cucumber hath three leaves, he may
then remove them to their other places. The
Pompion ſeeds ſhould be ſet a finger deeper in
the Earth; and the Cabbages ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
when they are a handful high.</p>
               <p>Parſnep ſeeds may be ſown in <hi>October</hi> (in
the Wane of the Moon) but if they prove not,
let him ſow more ſeeds in <hi>February</hi> following.</p>
               <p>Carrots ſhould be ſown at the latter end of
<hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Turneps grow beſt in ſandy Earth, and
ſhould be ſown at that time that Carrots are:
but if they are required in <hi>Lent,</hi> let him ſow
them in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at the Wane of the Moon.</p>
               <p>Onions require a rank fat Ground, half
dung; he muſt ſow them in <hi>February:</hi> He may
alſo ſow Onion and Lettice ſeeds, and Radiſh
ſeeds mingled together in one plot for Sallets,
at the ſame time in a hot Ground: Let him
ſet Onions for Scallions to ſeed in <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Garlick requireth a temperate Ground, not
too rank; and it is good ſetting of it in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi>
and in <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Leeks are for a rank Ground, and ſhould be
ſown in <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Radiſhes require ſuch a Ground as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45382:42"/>
doth; ſow it in <hi>February,</hi> and it will laſt
all the Summer, every month before Woodſeer,
in the Wane of the Moon for fear of ſeeding,
and he ſhall always have them freſh and
young: but after Woodſeer he may ſow them
at any time of the Moon.</p>
               <p>Skerrots muſt be ſet in the Wane, about the
latter end of <hi>September</hi> or beginning of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
For the moſt part all Roots ſhould be
ſown in the Wane of the Moon.</p>
               <p>Lettice ſown in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> will live all Winter;
but if they are ſown in <hi>March,</hi> they will be ſo
bitter, that they cannot be eaten.</p>
               <p>Parſley ſhould be ſown after the beginning
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and it will be freſh in the ſpring all
the year; it loveth the ſhade: The ſeeds of
Parſley and Marjoram will lye ſix weeks in
the ground before they come up.</p>
               <p>Hop may be ſown in ſeeds in <hi>April,</hi> but
they will not laſt: The Roots that are young
are good to ſet, but the ſlips are beſt.</p>
               <p>Marigolds may be ſown in <hi>Auguſt</hi> for the
Spring; he may remove the Plants about two
inches long, and they will grow the bigger.</p>
               <p>Alexander is ſown in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April;</hi> he
may remove the Roots, and they will grow
the next year.</p>
               <p>Borrage and Bugloſs are ſowed in the
Spring, and dye that year.</p>
               <p>Succory or Endive are ſown in <hi>March</hi> or
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45382:42"/>
                  <hi>April,</hi> remove them before the ſpindle, and
they will be the better.</p>
               <p>Pennyroyal, the Roots parted, or the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſet in the ground, will grow.</p>
               <p>Mints, either the Roots ſet, or the branches
being cut in divers places, and ſet in the Earth,
being wet, will thrive.</p>
               <p>Savory ſowed in the Spring, commonly dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
but being removed, it will live in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Time is ſown or ſet in the Spring, both the
ſeeds, ſlips, and roots of it will grow: keep it
from ſeeding, and it will laſt three or four
years.</p>
               <p>Tanſie may be ſowed in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April;</hi>
the Roots being removed, will proſper.</p>
               <p>Bloodwort may be ſowed in the Spring;
its Roots being new-ſet, will laſt long.</p>
               <p>Dandelyon may be ſowed in <hi>March</hi> or
<hi>April;</hi> and may be ordered as the former.</p>
               <p>Carduus Benedictus muſt be ſowed in the
Spring, for it will dye in the Winter.</p>
               <p>Wormwood is beſt to be ſet in the ſlips; it
will laſt three or four years.</p>
               <p>Clary is ſown in the Spring; it ſeeds the
ſecond year, and then dyes.</p>
               <p>Fennel may be known in the Spring and
Fall; he may ſet the Roots, and it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
many years.</p>
               <p>Sweet Marjoram may be ſown in <hi>April,</hi> but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45382:43"/>
it will dye in the Winter; but if it be ſet, the
ſlips will proſper.</p>
               <p>Artichokes proceed of young Plants taken
from the old ſtock: The beſt time to plant
them is in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> two days before
the Full of the Moon (yet ſome plant them in
<hi>Auguſt</hi>) let him ſet no Plants, if he may have
choice, but thoſe that have the bottom-knobs
whole, neither let him pluck any plant from
the ſtock, till it be ſtrong; and if the bottom-knobs
are pulled off, and broken, it will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grow. And when that he would take the
plants from the ſtock, let him dig the Earth
half a foot deep round about the ſtock, then
let him thruſt his Thumbes betwixt the ſtock
and the plant, keeping the bottom whole and
unbroken, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Peaſe and Beans for the Garden muſt have
the ſeed changed every year; if not, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
will be very ſmall, and grow leſs and
leſs; for in three years the great Rounſeval
and great Bean will be no bigger then the
wild ones, let him do what he can to his
Ground, if he ſet or ſow them which grew
there before; and ſo likewiſe it is with
Corn, if the ſeed be not changed.</p>
               <p>If his Peaſe be in <hi>February,</hi> let him ſet them
an inch and an half deep; but if he ſow them
in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> let him ſet them but an inch
deep, but let him be ſure that he ſet them in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45382:43"/>
the Wane of the Moon, ſome ſix or ſeven days
before the Change, or elſe he will have a great
God, and but ſmall Peaſe; and let him ſet
them down eight inches aſunder, and he ſhall
have Peaſe long, and have them often: Let
him ſet them in ſeveral plots, ſome in <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
ſome in <hi>March,</hi> and others in <hi>April:</hi> A
Quart of Peaſe will ſerve to ſet a good plot of
Ground. Peaſe and Beans will proſper well,
being ſet under Trees; and being ſown in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
wet weather, it will be a month or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
before they will appear.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now proceed to give other expert
and certain Rules for ſowing, planting, and
ſetting of the moſt delectable Flowers and
Herbs in uſe, for the adorning of a Summer-Garden,
or a Garden of pleaſure and delight.</p>
               <p>Roſes are of ſeveral ſorts and colours, as
White, Red, Damask, Province, Musk, and
ſweet Bryar, &amp;c. Of all the Flowers in the
Garden, this is the chief for beauty and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
Roſe-trees are commonly planted in a
plot by themſelves (if the Gardine shave room
enough) leaving a pretty ſpace between them
for gathering. Now for him to get and ſet
his plants, he muſt do thus: In the latter end
of <hi>January, February,</hi> or the beginning of
<hi>March</hi> (at the Increaſe of the Moon) go to
ſome old Roſe-trees (but not too old) and the
Gardiner ſhall find long young ſuckers or
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45382:44"/>
branches, which ſprang up from the Root of
the Tree the laſt year, let him dig the hole
deep, that he may cut off thoſe ſuckers cloſe to
the Root (but let him take heed of wounding
the Tree) then let him fill up the hole again
with Earth very cloſe and hard; theſe ſuckers
muſt be young plants for young Trees: If the
ſuckers have too many branches, let him cut
them away, alſo the tops of them, they will
take Root the better: Then where he intends
to ſet them, let him dig holes in good ground,
at the leaſt a foot deep, and ſet them a good
depth, treading in the Earth hard about them,
having a little Trench near them for watering,
till they have taken Root. The Provoſt Roſes
will bear Root the ſame year that they are ſet
in, he may, if he pleaſe, plant Strawberries,
Primroſes, and Violets amongſt his Roſe-trees,
and they will proſper very well.</p>
               <p>Gilliflowers, Carnations, or <hi>July</hi>-flower<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
ſo called, becauſe in <hi>July</hi> they are in their
prime and glory; theſe for beauty and ſcent
are next to the Roſe, they are of ſeveral cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
colours, and ſmell like to Cloves, and
therefore of ſome are termed Clove-July-flowers:
Theſe are to be ſet of young ſlips
without ſhanks, taken from the old Body or
Root; and when that the Gardiner ſets them,
let him leave one joynt (next to the leaf) at
the top of the Ground, ſo that the Ground be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45382:44"/>
above the top of the middle joynt; for if he
ſet any part of the Leaves within the Ground,
the Gilliflowers heads will never prove.
Earthen pots are good, which have holes in or
near the bottom, in which pots let him plant
his Gilliflowers, and in dry weather, twice a
week in the Summer-time ſet them in a Tub
of water, for three hours or more. But let no
water come to the top of the pot, but the
Rain, the pot will ſuck up a ſufficient moiſture
at the bottom-holes: The Gardiner ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
need to take in his pots but in froſty wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Wall-July-flowers uſually growing on
Walls; for they delight to grow in Lime and
Mortar: they will ſometimes ſeem dead in the
Summer, and be green, and bear flowers in
the Winter; they bear ſtore of ſeed, which
he may ſow, and ſet the ſlips: If he will have
them grow upon a Wall, let him dig little
holes betwixt the Bricks and Stones with an
old Knife, and put in the ſeed.</p>
               <p>Tulips are very beautiful Flowers, but have
no ſcent; they adorn a Garden well or a
Houſe, their Roots are all like Onions, which
the Gardiner muſt ſet in <hi>January,</hi> if there be
no Froſt; and after they have done bearing,
about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> let him take up the Roots
out of the Ground, which will be double, and
keep them dry in a Box againſt the next year.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:45382:45"/>
Primroſes, ſo called, as they are the firſt
Flowers in the Spring; they are very ſweet,
growing both ſingle and double: when the
Roots grow too great, part them in two or
three quarters, and ſet them again, though
they be flowered, they will grow.</p>
               <p>Cowſlips are dainty ſweet Flowers, they
alſo grow both ſingle and double; and if the
Roots grow broad, you may ſever them as you
did the Primroſe.</p>
               <p>Harts-eaſe or Panſies, they are in ſhape al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
like a Violet; they ſhed their ſeeds, and
dye, but come thick up the next Spring.</p>
               <p>Lavender is wondrous ſweet, both Leaf and
Flower, good for ſhew; their Roots will grow
double like a Tulip, which being parted muſt
be new ſet.</p>
               <p>Marigolds ſhew pleaſant, and are of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſcent; you may ſow them of ſeeds, or
ſet young plants.</p>
               <p>Daiſies are white, red, or mingled colours,
they make a pretty ſhew in a Garden in the
Spring; their Roots growing too thick and
too broad, are to be parted and new ſet.</p>
               <p>Flower-de-luces alſo make a great ſhew in a
Garden; the Roots are to be ſevered and new
ſet, which being dryed, ſmell ſweet.</p>
               <p>Lillies that are red make a pleaſant ſhew,
but have no ſcent; their Roots grow like Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
double, but bigger, which being parted
and new ſet, will grow again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:45382:45"/>
White Lillies, their Roots are not like the
red; their Roots alſo are to be parted, and
ſet as the red Lilly.</p>
               <p>Crocaſſes muſt be uſed and ſet as the Tulip;
if the Gardiner ſet them in his Borders, they
will make a pretty ſhew in the Spring.</p>
               <p>Lupines proceed from a ſeed ſown in <hi>April</hi>
and <hi>March;</hi> they bear a delicate flower, and
the green leaves are of a ſtrange ſhape; they
bear Cods like ſmall Beans, in which are
ſeed.</p>
               <p>Holy-hocks are white and red; he may
ſow them of ſeeds, or plant the Root.</p>
               <p>Piony muſt have the Roots parted and ſet,
the green leaves ſpread very broad; it beareth
a great beautiful red flower: The ſeed of it muſt
be ſown in the Spring.</p>
               <p>French Mallows make a handſom ſhew;
they are alſo to be ſowed in the Spring</p>
               <p>Saffron flowereth about <hi>Michaelmas;</hi> when
the flowers fade, it is to be ſet of Roots,
which ought to be removed every third year
about <hi>Midſummer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poppy hath a very fair flower, and of a
pretty colour; the ſeed of it muſt be ſowed
in the Spring.</p>
               <p>Batchelers buttons are ſowed in the Spring-time,
or the Roots may be planted.</p>
               <p>Sweet Siſely hath a pleaſant ſcent; he may
ſow the ſeeds, or part the Roots and ſet them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:45382:46"/>
Roſe-Campions may likewiſe be ſowed of
ſeed, or the Roots planted.</p>
               <p>Flower of the Sun groweth very high, and
beareth a great yellow flower, as big as the
crown of a Hat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is openeth and ſhutteth with
the Sun (like the Marigold) the ſeeds muſt be
ſet in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> about a finger deep.</p>
               <p>Strawberries are white, red, and green;
but the beſt Strawberries are gathered out of
the Woods, which have Roots well bearded:
Let him ſet them in <hi>January, February,</hi> or in
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> three inches one from the other, in
the beginning of the laſt Quarter of the
Moon.</p>
               <p>I ſhall next follow the order of the growing
and ſetting of green ſweet Herbs for the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Garden.</p>
               <p>Angelica groweth big and broad, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
long; you may ſow it of ſeeds in the
Spring, and the Roots may be removed after
the firſt year. Lonage groweth much like to
Angelica, and it is to be ordered in the like
manner.</p>
               <p>Anniſeeds are produced of ſeeds ſowed;
they dye the firſt year, and ſo doth Coriander.</p>
               <p>Coaſt-Mary may be ſowed of ſeeds, or
the Roots parted and ſet in <hi>March,</hi> are beſt.</p>
               <p>Featherfew is to be ſowed in <hi>March</hi> or
<hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oculus Chriſti is beſt to be ſowed of ſeeds,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45382:46"/>
or upon any remove of the young plants, and
new ſet them.</p>
               <p>Herb of Grace, or Rue, the beſt way to ſet
it is of ſlips; it is green moſt part of the year,
and thrives beſt in the ſhade: Southernwood
is to be ordered like Rue.</p>
               <p>Dutch-box grows green moſt part of the
year, it is very handſom for Works and Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
he may part the Roots and ſet them.</p>
               <p>Roſemary is a tender Herb, the beſt ſetting
of it is in <hi>April,</hi> or in the end of <hi>March,</hi> the
Gardiner muſt ſet ſuch as have no Bloſſoms,
and as he takes it from the branch; but by no
means let him ſlive it, or tear the ſlips, but cut
them off a little from the body, leaving ſome
few leaves behind on the piece, and then it
will grow again, otherwiſe the body being
hurt, it will never grow.</p>
               <p>Bay-roots will proceed from the Bay-berry,
being ſet in the Spring, or he may plant the
young ſuckers which ſpring from the Root.</p>
               <p>Hony ſuckles or Wood-bine, the Gardiner
muſt get them in Woods or Hedges in the
Fields, but let him dig enough to have their
Roots; prune them, and plant them againſt
the ſide of a Houſe, or a Wall, or Pole, and
they will yield a moſt pleaſant ſhade or a
comfortable ſcent: They muſt be taken up in
<hi>January, February,</hi> or the beginning of the
Spring.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:45382:47"/>
Hedges or Quick-ſets in his Gardens, may
be made either with ſuckers of Goosberry-trees,
Currants, Privet, or Hauthanethorn,
planted in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of the Moon.</p>
               <p>Eglantine or Sweet-Bryar is to be ſet on
ſuckers alſo, and in thoſe months alſo, as the
former; they will grow from the red Hips,
which they bear, but it will be long before
they come to any bigneſs.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Auguſt,</hi> four days after the Change, or
three days before the full Moon, let the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner
cut all his Winter-herbs within an
handful of the ground, then will they get
head againſt the Winter, and it will preſerve
them the better from hard weather; and in
the end of <hi>September,</hi> let him ſift the Earth or
a good mould upon them, to cover the Roots
well, otherwiſe the Froſt and Rain will bear
the Earth from the Roots, that the Herbs will
be in danger of being killed. And ſuch Herbs
as the Gardiner intends to keep againſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
let him cut them often, to keep them
from ſeeding (for ſeeding doth kill moſt Herbs)
by this means they will live the better in
Winter; but let him have a care that he do
but ſeldom cut his Herbs in the Wane of the
Moon.</p>
               <p>To have Flowers great, let him remove
them once a year, the ſecond or third day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45382:47"/>
the full Moon, and ſo plant them in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi>
as in <hi>March</hi> the weather being warm, and
the ground wet, they will grow.</p>
               <p>To dry Herbs for Broths or for Cheſts, he
muſt make uſe of ſet Plats in the Sun in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi>
in their Flowers, as Winter-ſavory, Time,
Marjoram, Pennyroyal, Mints, Balm, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
tops, Marigolds, Lavender, Roſe-leaves,
&amp;c. Let him gather them as he dryes them,
when he ſees the morning fair and hot, and the
Herbs dry.</p>
               <p>The beſt and worthieſt Roots of Herbs, for
the moſt part are to be gathered in apt and fit
ſeaſons and places, when that the leaves are
beginning to fall off, and the fruits and ſeeds
already ſhed, ſo that the ſeaſon be fair: for
done in a nainy day, the Roots will be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the weaker, when they are filled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
moiſture.</p>
               <p>The flowers in like manner are to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
as the Borrage, Bugloſs, and all others
of like ſort, when they are wholly opened, and
before they are feeble, except the flowers of
the Roſe and Jeſamine, which ought to be
gathered for the better and longer keeping,
before that they are much, or rather but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
opened.</p>
               <p>The Leaves and whole Herbs are to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
when that they are come to their
growth and perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:45382:48"/>
The Fruits, and Melons, Cucumbers, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
and Gourds, when they appear yellow,
and are come to their perfect growth and
perfection.</p>
               <p>The ſeeds in like condition are to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
when they are well ripened, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſhed on the Earth; but thoſe that
do remain on the Earth, after the Herbs are
throughly dryed, ought to be rubbed forth
with the hands, and kept unto the time of
ſowing.</p>
               <p>Let the Gardiner remember that ſeeds
ought to be gathered in a clear ſeaſon, and in
the Wane of the Moon.</p>
               <p>And let the Gardiner take this for a general
Rule to be obſerved, That always all thoſe
things that are to be gathered, as the Herbs,
Flowers, Roots, Fruits, and Seeds, that they
are to be gathered in a fair and dry ſeaſon, and
in the decreaſe of the Moon.</p>
               <p>The Herbs which the Owner intends to
keep, are to be pickt, and to be preſerved by
cleanſing; let them be dryed in the ſhade,
the place being open towards the South, not
moiſt, and free from ſmoak and duſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe are to be put in Leather-bags rather
then Canvaſs, the mouths at the hanging up
faſt tyed, or into wooden Boxes of the Box-tree,
to the end that the Herbs may not loſe
their proper virtues.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The beſt way for drying of Flowers, is to
lay them in a temperate place, free from moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
duſt, and ſmoak, and to ſtir them to and

to loſe neither their colour nor their natural

               <p>For the preſerving of Roots, the Gardiner
ought to learn and exerciſe two means; the
one for keeping of them freſh, and the other
for the round Roots, as the Navew, Radiſh,
Carrot, and other like ſorts, for to preſerve
them dry.</p>
               <p>The way and means to preſerve Roots
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45382:49"/>
freſh, is to bury them in a Cellar, in Gravel or
Sand well turned upon them, or in a Garden-ground
reaſonably deep digged, even as he
doth for the Radiſh and Navew in the earth,
that he may enjoy the commodity of them for
the greater part of the Winter: to preſerve
Roots dry, the Gardiner (after the plucking
of the Roots out of the Earth) ought to waſh
them very clean with Conduit or Spring-water,
afterwards to cut away all the ſmall
and hairy Roots; which done, to dry them
in a ſhadowy place, free from the beams of the
Sun, if ſo be that they are ſlender or thin
Rind, as the Roots of the Fennel, Succory,
Parſley, Endive, Borrage, Bugloſs, Sperage,
and ſundry ſuch like: but if the Roots are
thick of Rind, of a groſs Eſſence, and big,
then muſt the Gardiner lay them dry in the
Sun at Noon-day, as the Roots of Gentian,
the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apple, Briony, Rapontick, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locia,
or any others like them.</p>
               <p>All the Field-plants, Flowers, and Roots,
are longer in Nature, but in ſubſtance inferior
to the Garden-plants, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Among wild Plants, thoſe growing on the

               <p>Amongſt all Plants, thoſe are of a ſtronger

               <p>The Herbs which one would uſe for the

Colewort, Endive, Clary, Rocket, Baſil,

               <head>Of Bees.</head>
               <p>IN the keeping of Bees there is little charge,
but they require good attendance to the
time that they ſhall caſt the Swarm. To which
purpoſe it will be convenient that the Hive be
ſet in a Garden or an Orchard, where as they
may be kept from the North-wind, and the
mouth of the Hive towards the Sun. In <hi>June</hi>
and <hi>July</hi> they do moſt commonly caſt, and
they ſhould have ſome low Trees nigh to them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45382:50"/>
before the Hive, that the Swarm may light
upon; and when the Swarm is knit, take a
Hive, and ſplent it within with three or four
ſplents, that the Bees may knit their Combs
unto it, and anoint the ſplents and ſides of the
Hive with a little Honey; and if he have no
Honey, let him take ſweet Cream, and then ſet
a ſtool or a form nigh to the ſwarm, and lay a
clean waſhed ſheet upon the ſtool, and then let
him hold the ſmall end of the Hive down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and ſhake the Bees into the Hive, and
then preſently ſet it upon the ſtool, and turn
the corners of the ſheet over the Hive: Let
him leave one place open, that the Bees may
go in and out; but let him do this quietly; for
he muſt not in any wiſe fight or ſtrive with
them: and let him lay Nettles on the boughs
where they were knit, to drive them from the
place; and then let him watch them all that
day, that they go not away; and at night,
when all are gone up to the Hive, let him take
it away, and ſet it where it ſhall ſtand, and
take away the ſheet, and let him have Clay
ready tempered, to lay about it upon the
board or ſtone where it ſhall ſtand, that no
wind come in; but the board is better and
warmer. Let him leave a hole open on the
South-ſide of three inches broad, and an inch
of height, for the Bees to enter in and out.
And then let him make a covering of Wheat
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45382:50"/>
or Rye-ſtraw to cover, and houſe the Hive
above, and let him ſet the Hive two foot or
more above the Earth upon the ſtakes, ſo that
a Mouſe nor any other Beaſts or Vermin may
come near it. But if a ſwarm be caſt late in
the year, they ſhould be fed with Honey in the
Winter, and laid upon a thin narrow board
or Slate or Lead put into the Hive, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thin board ſhould be ſet before every
Hives mouth, that no wind come in, and to
have four or five little nicks made in the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
that a Bee may come out or go in, and ſo
faſtned, that the wind blow it not down; and
ſo ordered, that he may take it up when he
will. That Hive that is fed, let the mouth of
it be ſtopt clean, that other Bees come not in;
for if they do, they will fight and kill one
another. And let him beware, that no Waſps
come into the Hive; for they will kill the
Bees, and eat the Honey. There is alſo a Bee
called a Drone, which is greater then another
Bee: This Drone will eat the Honey, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nothing, and therefore they ſhould be
killed; it is a common ſaying, that ſhe hath

               <head>How to keep Beaſts and other Cattel.</head>
               <p>IF a Husbandman would keep Cattel well to
his profit, he muſt have ſeveral Cloſes and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45382:51"/>
Paſtures to put them in, the which ſhould be
well quick-ſetted, ditched, or hedged, that at his
pleaſure, he may ſever his biggeſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Cattel from the weakeſt, and eſpecially in
Winter time, when they ſhall be foddered.
And though a man be but a Farmer, and ſhall
have his Farm twenty years, it is leſs coſt for
him, and more profit for him to quick-ſet,
ditch, or hedge, then to have his Cattel go
before the Herdſmen; for let the Husbandman
ſpend in three years as much money as the
keeping of his Beaſts, Swine, and Sheep do
coſt him in the years. Then always after he
ſhall have all manner of Cattel with the tenth
part of the coſt, and the beaſts ſhall like much
the better, and by this means the Herdſman
ſhall have for every beaſt two pence a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or thereabouts. And the Swine-herd
will have for every Swine at leaſt a penny.
Then he muſt have a Shepherd of his own, or
elſe he ſhall never thrive: Then reckon Meat,
Drink, and Wages for his Shepherd, the Herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and the Swine-herds Hire: theſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
will double his Rent, or ariſe nigh to do
ſo, except his Farm be above forty pounds
<hi>per Annum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Now let us compute what theſe
Charges will come to in three years; but let
him lay out as much money in Quick-ſetting,
ditching, and hedging, and in three years he
ſhall be diſcharged for ever, and much of his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45382:51"/>
labour, he and his Servants may do with their
own hands, and ſave much money. And then
hath he every field in ſeverality, and by the
aſſent of the Lord and the Tenants, every
Neighbour may exchange his Lands with the
other. And then ſhall his Farm be twice as
good in profit to the Tenant as it was before,
and as much Land kept in tillage; by this
means the rich man ſhall not over-eat the poor
man with his Cattel, and the fourth part of
the Hay and Straw ſhall ſerve his Cattel better
in a Paſture, then four times ſo much will do
in a Houſe, and leſs attendance, and the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
ſhall like the better.</p>

               <head>To buy fat Cattel.</head>
               <p>IF the Graſier ſhall buy fat Oxen or Kine, let

on the fore-crop behind the ſhoulder, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſee that the Ox have a great God, and the
Cow a great Navel; for then it is very likely
that they are well tallowed. And let him
take heed where he buys any lean Cattel or
fat, and of whom, and where it was bred:
For if he buy out of a better ground then he
hath of his own, that Cattel will not like with
his. Alſo let him look, that there be no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45382:52"/>

there be any Murren or Long-ſaught amongſt

not goutty, neither broken of Hair, of Tayl,
or of Pizzle. If he buys Kine for the Pail, let

good Milk; and let him be ſure that he feed
her Calves well. And if he buy lean Oxen,
let him feed and fat them, the younger they
are, the better they will feed, and ſooner gain

to the Hair, that it ſtare not, and that the Beaſt
lick himſelf, be whole mouthed, and want no
teeth. And though he have the Gout, and be
broken both of Tayl and Pizzle, yet will he
feed. But the goutty Ox will not be driven
far. Let him alſo be ſure, that he have a broad
Rib and a thick Hide, that he be looſe-skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

               <head>To rear Calves.</head>
               <p>IT is convenient for a Husbandman to rear
Calves, and eſpecially thoſe that come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Candlemas</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> for at that ſeaſon
he may beſt ſpare Milk, and by that time the
Calf ſhall be weaned, there will be Graſs
enough to put him into, and at Winter he
will be big enough to ſave himſelf amongſt
other beaſts, with a little favour. The Dam
of the Calf ſhall bull again, and bring another
by the ſame time of the year: but if he ſhall
tarry till after <hi>May,</hi> the Calf will be weak in
Winter, and the Dam will not bull again,
but oftentimes go barren. And if he ſhall
rear a Calf that cometh after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> it
will be coſtly to keep the Calf all the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſon
at Hay, and the Dam at hard meat in
the Houſe, as they uſe in the plain Champion
Countries. And a Cow ſhall give more Milk
with a little graſs and ſtraw, lying without in
a Cloſe, then ſhe ſhall do with Hay and Straw,
lying in a Houſe, for the hard meat dryeth up
the Milk. But he that hath no Paſture muſt
do as he may: but yet it is better for the
Husbandman to ſell thoſe Calves, then to rear
them, becauſe of the coſt, and alſo for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Milk to his Houſe, and the rather the
Cow will take the Bull. If the Husbandman
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45382:53"/>
go with an Ox-plough, it is convenient that
he rear two Ox-calves, and two Cow-calves
at the leaſt to uphold his ſtock; and if he rear
more, it will be the more profitable for him.
It is better for the Husbandman to wean his
Calves at Graſs, then at hard meat, if they
went to Graſs before. And that man that
may have a Paſture for his Kine, and another
for his Calves, and water in them both, may
rear and breed good Beaſts with little coſt.
And if the Husbandman wean his Calves with
Hay, it will make them big-bellied, and they
are the likelier to rot when they go to graſs.
In Winter they ſhould be put in a Houſe by
themſelves, and given Hay over night, and put
in a good paſture in the day time, which will
render them much the better to handle when
they ſhall be Kine or Oxen.</p>

               <head>To geld Calves.</head>
               <p>IT will be a fit time to geld Calves in the old
of the Moon, when they are ten or twenty
days old; for then is leaſt danger, and the Ox
ſhall be the higher, and the longer of body,
and the longer horned. And that may be
thus proved: Take two Ox-calves, both of
them of one kind, one making, and both of
one age, geld one of them, and let the other
go forth, and be a Bull. And put them both
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45382:53"/>
in one paſture until they are four or five years
old, and then ſhall you ſee the Ox-calf far
greater every way then the Bull. There is no
other cauſe of this but the gelding. And if
he geld them not till they are a year old, there
will be the more danger, and he will be leſs of
body, and ſhorter horned.</p>

               <p>IT is leſs damage to a Husbandman to have
his Cow to caſt her Calf, then an Ew to
caſt her Lamb; for the Calf will ſuck as
much milk ere it be fit to be killed, as it is
worth, and of the Ew cometh no profit of the
milk, but the Lamb. Howſoever they uſe in
ſome places to milk their Ews when they have
weaned their Lambs; but that is a great hurt
to the Ews, inſomuch that it will cauſe them
that they will not take the Ram at the time of
the year, becauſe of their leanneſs, but grow
barren. And if a Mare caſt her Foal, that is
thrice ſo much loſs. For if the Foal come of
a good Breed, the loſs is ſo much the greater,
and in a ſhort time the Foal may be ſold for
as much money as would buy many Calves

               <head>What Cattel ſhould go together in one Paſture.</head>
               <p>BEaſts alone, nor Horſes alone, nor Sheep
alone, except it be Sheep upon a very high
Ground, will not eat paſture even, but leave
many in Fees and high Graſs in divers places,
except it be over-laid with Cattel. Therefore
we may the better take notice, that Horſes and
Beaſts will agree well in one Paſture; for
there is ſome manner of Graſs that a Horſe
will eat, that a Beaſt will not, as the Fitches,
Flaſhes, and low places, and all the hollow
Bundes and Pipes grow therein. But Horſes
and Sheep will not ſo well agree, except it be
Sheep to feed; for a Sheep will go on a bare
Paſture, and will eat the ſweeteſt Graſs, and
ſo will a Horſe, but he would have it longer.
Howſoever he will eat as cloſe to the Earth as
a Sheep, but he cannot ſo ſoon fill his belly.
To a hundred Beaſts the Husbandman or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
may put in twenty Horſes. If it be low
ground, and if there be graſs enough, he may
put in an hundred Sheep, and ſo after the rate
the paſture more or leſs: and after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they may feed or eat the Cloſe even, and
leave but few tufts. But if it be high ground,
let him put in more Sheep, and leſs Beaſts, and
Horſes. Milch Kine and draught Oxen will
eat a Cloſe much barer then as many fat Kine
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45382:54"/>
and Oxen. A Milch Cow may have too
much meat; for if ſhe grow fat, ſhe will the
rather take Bull, and give leſs milk: for the
fatneſs ſtoppeth the Pores and the Veins that
ſhould bring the milk to the Paps. And
therefore mean Graſs is beſt to keep her in
a low eſtate. And if a Cow be fat when ſhe
ſhould calf, then is there great hazard of her,
and the Calf ſhall be the leſs; but the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
cannot allow his Draught-Ox too
much meat, except it be the after-mathe of a
low-mown Meadow, for that will cauſe him
to have the Girte, and then he is not ſo fit to
labour. And if there be too much Graſs in a
Cloſe, the Cattel ſhall feed ſo much the worſe,
for a good bite to the Earth is ſufficient; for if
it be long, the Beaſts will bite off the top and
no more, for that is ſweet, and the other lyeth
ſtill upon the ground, and rotteth, and no
Beaſts will eat it but Horſes in Winter: But
theſe Beaſts, Horſe, and Sheep may not be
foddered together in Winter; for then they
ſhould be ſevered, for elſe the Beaſts with
their horns will gore both the Horſes and the
Sheep in their bellies. It will be neceſſary to
make ſtanding Cratches to caſt their Fodder
in, and the ſtaves ſet right enough together
for pulling their Fodder out too haſtily for
ſhedding. And if it be laid upon the Earth,
the fourth part thereof will be loſt: but if he

               <p>THe Murrain proceeds from a rankneſs of
Blood, it appeareth firſt moſt commonly
in the Head; for the Head will ſwell, and the
Eyes wax great, and run with water, and froth
at the Mouth, which are certain ſigns that the
Beaſt is paſt Remedy; for he will not eat after
he hath fallen ſick. The beſt way is to tye
him, and to make a deep pit hard by the place
where he dyeth, and ſo to caſt him in, and
cover him cloſe with Earth, that no Dogs may
come to the Carrion. For as many beaſts as
ſmell of that Carrion, are very likely to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
And then let him take the skin, and
carry it to the Tanners, and ſell it. It hath
been a common charitable Cuſtom, to take the
bare head of the ſame beaſt, and put it upon a
long Pole, and ſet it on a Hedge faſt bound to
a ſtake by the High-way ſide, that every man
that rideth or goeth by that way, may ſee and
know by that ſign, that there is ſickneſs of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45382:57"/>
Cattel in that Townſhip. And the good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Husbandmen in thoſe parts are of opinion,
that this may be a means that the Murrain
may the ſooner ceaſe: when the beaſt is flay'd,
the Murrain will appear betwixt the fleſh and
the skin, and it will riſe up like a Jelly or
Froth an inch deep or more; and the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for the Murrain, is to take a ſmall Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-rod,
and bind it hard about the Beaſts
Neck, and that will cauſe the blood to come
into the Neck; and on the other ſide of the
Neck, there is a Vein that a man may feel with
his finger, then let him take a Blood-Iron, and
ſet it ſtraight upon the Vein, and blood him
on both ſides, and let him bleed the quantity
of a pint, or nigh it, and then let him take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Cord, and it will ſtanch bleeding.
And thus let him ſerve all his Cattel in that
Cloſe or Paſture, and by Gods Bleſſing there
ſhall no more of them be ſick.</p>

               <p>THis ſickneſs will endure long, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by its hoiſſing, the Beaſt will ſtand
much, and eat but little, and grow very hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and thin, and he will hoiſt twenty times in
an hour, but few ſuch do mend. The beſt
Remedy is to keep the Cattel in ſundry places,
and as many as were in company with that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45382:57"/>
Beaſt that firſt fell ſick, to let them blood a
little. There are many Farriers that can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, that is, to cut the Dew-lap before;
there is a Graſs called Fetter-graſs, take that
Graſs, and bruiſe it a little in a Mortar, and
put thereof as much as a Hens Egg into the
ſame Dew-lap, and be careful that it fall not
out.</p>

is put into a Paſture full of rank Graſs,
where he will eat ſo much, that his ſides will
ſtand as high as his Back-bone, and at other
times the one ſide more then the other. When
the beaſt hath this diſeaſe with the ſwelling, he
muſt not be driven haſtily nor laboured. The
ſubſtance of this diſtemper is but a wind, and
therefore he ſhould be ſoftly driven, but not
ſuffered to lye down. I have ſeen a Farrier
take a Knife, and thruſt the beaſt thorow the
skin and the fleſh two inches deep or more, ſix
inches or more thorow the Rigge-bone, that
the wind may come out; for the wind lyeth
betwixt the fleſh and the great Paunch.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45382:58"/>
it by ſwelling in the Head, and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
by the Eyes; for they will run on
water, and cloſe the beaſts ſight, which many
times cauſes them to dye within an hour or
two, if they are not ſuddenly taken in hand.
The cauſe of this diſeaſe is, that there is a
Bliſter riſen under the Tongue, the which
Bliſter muſt be ſlit with a Knife acroſs: when
he hath pulled out the Tongue, let him rub the
Bliſter well with Salt, and take a Hens Egg,
and break it in the beaſts mouth, ſhell and all,
and caſt Salt with it, and hold up the beaſts
head, that all may be ſwallowed down into
the body. But the breaking of the Bliſter is
the great help; let him drive the beaſt a little
about, and this ſhall cure him by the help of
God.</p>

               <p>THere are beaſts that will turn about when
they eat their meat, and will not feed:
'tis a dangerous diſeaſe for them, by reaſon
that they are ſubject to fall in Pits, Ditches,
or Waters. The cauſe of this diſtemper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a Bladder in the Forehead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Brain-pan and the Brains, the
which muſt be taken out, or elſe the beaſt ſhall
never mend, but it will kill him. This is the
Remedy and the greateſt Cure that can be on
a beaſt: Take the beaſt, and throw him
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45382:58"/>
down, and bind his four feet together, and
with his Thumb let him thruſt the Beaſt in the
Forehead, and where he finds the ſofteſt place,
there let him take a Knife, and cut the skin
three or four inches on both ſides between the
Horns, and as much beneath towards the Noſe,
and flay it, and turn it up and down, and pin
it faſt with a pin. And with a Knife cut the
Brain-pan two inches broad, and three inches
long; but let him look that the Knife go no
deeper then the thickneſs of the bone, for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
of the Brain: Let him take away the
bone, and then he ſhall ſee a Bladder full of
water two inches long and more. Let him
take that out, and be ſure that he hurt not the
Brain; and then let him lay down the skin,
and ſew it faſt as it was before, and bind a
cloth two or threefold upon his Forehead, to
keep it from cold and wet, for ten or twelve
days together: thus have I ſeen many cured.
But if the Beaſt be fat, and have good ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
meat upon him, it will be ſafer to kill
him, for there will be but little loſs. If the
Bladder be under the Horn, it is paſt cure.
A Sheep will be troubled with the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper;

               <p>THe Worms lye in the great Paunch of the

kinds of them; the Worm, the Bot, the Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon:
ſome of them are of a ſhining colour,
like a Snake, ſix inches in length, great in the
midſt, and ſharp at both ends. The Horſe
when he is troubled with them, will lye down
and wallow, which is when they feed on him,
his breath will ſtink, &amp; his mouth be clammy.
The preſent Remedy is to give him a quart of
Milk, and half a pint of Honey in it blood-warm;
this will keep them from gnawing of
him, becauſe they will ſuck thereof until they
are ready to burſt: then the next day give him
this Drink, Take a quart of Wort, or Ale
that is very ſtrong, then take a quarter of a
pound of Fern, half a pound of Savin, half a

them together with two ſpoonfuls of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
and as much Chimney-foot, beaten to

to a Horſe; for oftentimes it falleth out, that
many Horſes infected therewith, though they
live, and the diſeaſe ſeemeth to be healed; yet
they are rendred of ſmall or of no uſe. For
my own part, I conjecture the cauſe of this
diſeaſe grows either from abundance of bad
blood, or by a great diſtemper thereof,
through a violent heat changed into a ſudden
cold. To cure this diſtemper, firſt let him
blood on both ſides of the Neck three quarters
at leaſt; for it is moſt certain, that the Liver
which is the fountain of blood, is corrupted,
and ſo ſendeth the ſame into every part of the
body, ſo as to become lothſom to behold;
then give the Horſe this Drink. Take a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
of fair Water, put into it a good handful
of Rue, and a good ſpoonful of Hemp-ſeed,
and a handful of the inner Rind of green El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
bruiſe them in a Mortar together, and let
them ſethe until they are half conſumed, and
being cold, give it to him to drink: ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to let him blood a great quantity in that
Vein which is nigheſt to the ſore place, as you
ſee occaſion. Let his diet be thin, but very
clean and ſweet, then take this following ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Medicine. Of Herb-Grace a handful,

betwixt the skin and the fleſh, and thruſt
it in the nether end of the middle Line, then
tent it with Turpentine and Hogs-greaſe
molten together, and made warm, renewing
it once every day, for the ſpace of nine days;
but remember that after this burning, you
take up the Maſter-vein, which muſt be done
in this manner: Caſt the Horſe upon ſome
ſtraw, then having found the Vein, mark well
that part of the skin that covereth it, and pull
that aſide from the Vein with your left thumb,
to the intent that you may ſlit it with a Razor
without touching the Vein, and cut no deeper
then through the skin, and that longeſt-wiſe
that the Vein goeth, &amp; not above an inch, then
will the skin return again to the place over the
Vein: with a Cornet under-cover the Vein,
and make it bare, thruſt the Cornet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
it, and raiſe it up, and put a Shomakers
thred underneath ſomewhat higher then the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45382:71"/>
Cornet ſtanding, ſlit the Vein long-ways, that
it may bleed, and having bled ſomewhat from
above, then knit it with a ſure knot ſomewhat
above the ſlit, ſuffering it to bleed only from
beneath a great quantity; then knit up the
Vein alſo beneath the ſlit with a ſure knot,
then betwixt theſe two knots cut the Vein
aſunder where it was ſlit, and fill the hole
with Salt, then lay on this following Charge:
Take half a pound of Pitch, a quarter of a
pound of Roſin, a quarter of a pint of Tar,
boil them together, and being warm, anoint
all the inſide of the Joynt, and clap on the
Flocks of the Horſes collar, and turn him to

by the ſtamping or trembling of the Horſe;
taken at the beginning, there are Remedies
enow for them; but let alone too long, they
will eat through the Horſes Maw and kill him.
For Cure, take as much Precipitate (which is
Mercury calcined) as will lye gently upon a
ſilver Two-pence, and lay it on a piece of
ſweet Butter almoſt as big as a Hens Egg, in
the manner of a Pill, then chaſe him a little up

making him faſt for full two hours after, and
it will kill all manner of Worms whatſoever;
yet in the adminiſtration, you muſt be very
careful; for in the Precipitate there is a ſtrong
poyſonous quality, therefore mix the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
quantity with a little ſweet Butter, as
much as Hazel-nut: Before that you lap it
up in the great lump of Butter, it will be the

theſe. 1. The continual diſtilling of Rheum

               <head>Of the Broken Wind, with the Remedy.</head>
               <p>THe cauſe of this dangerous diſeaſe, hath
been but gueſſed at, not truly diſcovered
by any, as not being well underſtood, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
accounted of moſt Horſe-men incurable.
I do intend to uſe my beſt endeavours to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
and explain it: to which purpoſe, I will
divide the ſame into three kinds, every one of
which may be truly termed a Broken Wind,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45382:75"/>
becauſe the breath being drawn very ſhort and
thick, contrary to the original Inſtitution or
Creation, the which is long, cold, and quiet,
for ſo every Creature is by Nature; but when
any accident of violence of the body is uſed in
any of them to a diſtemper, the ſigns thereof
will quickly be viſible, and then every mans
experience telleth him evidently, that he pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and fetcheth breath very ſhort and thick;
I therefore will begin with the Cauſe thereof,
the which rightly underſtood, the Effects can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be hid. Now the cauſes why a Horſe
draws his breath very ſhort, are theſe; as
ſickneſs, great fulneſs, violent exerciſe: but
the reaſon of the cauſe is, for that the Heart
being the only hotteſt part of the body, from
whence the Arteries and Veins do carry the
heat thereof to every part of the body (and
therefore it is truly ſaid to be the Chariot of
Life) when the ſame by ſickneſs, or violence of
exerciſe is choaked, or as it were ſmothered
with too great heat, then do the Lights, being
the Bellows to draw breath, according to that
Office that Nature ordained them unto, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
labour with all violence to draw it, and
cool and comfort the Heart, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all the members and parts of the body, to
fill all the empty corners with Air, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
and in predominant qualities is moiſt;
and when they have drawn ſufficient breath,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45382:76"/>
the drineſs and heat by the moiſtneſs of the
Air is quenched, which being ſo, then doth
the Creature draw breath leiſurely and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not before: but ſo long as the Heart is
oppreſſed by the violent heat of ſickneſs, or by
great fulneſs, or violent exerciſe, the Caves,
Pipes, and paſſages for the breath, are almoſt
ſtopped and choaked up; then do the Lungs
labour extream thick to preſerve the life of
the Creature, which is the Heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſaid to be the firſt thing that liveth,
and the laſt that dyeth: So that all things
which hinder and ſtop the paſſages of the
breath, breaking the natural courſe thereof,
are the only cauſes of a Broken Wind. So
likewiſe the Cure of the Broken Wind muſt
be by removing of the ſtoppings of the Air, and
then the Lungs will perfectly perform their
Office, and the Creature will be freed from
the diſeaſe. The differences of Broken Winds
both in cauſe and effect, are divers, and yet
may be termed Broken; namely, the ſhortneſs
of breath, the Purſick, and Broken-winded.
1. As touching the ſhortneſs of breath, it may
proceed from ſome groſs and tough humours,
cleaving to the hollow places of the Lungs,
ſtopping the Wind-pipes, ſo that the Horſe
cannot eaſily draw his breath; and the ſign
thereof is his coughing often, daily, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently,
without voiding at the Noſe or the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45382:76"/>
Mouth. 2. It may come by haſty running
after drinking, or upon a full ſtomach, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of humours, deſcending into his
Throat or Lungs, by reaſon of ſome violent
heat diſſolving the ſame. And the ſigns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are, continually panting, ſending the ſame
forth very hot at his Noſe, in a wheaſing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
his Flanks beating ſo thick, that he cannot
fetch breath, but by holding his Neck right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
and ſtraight: and this may be truly called
a Broken Wind. The Cure is, to take a cloſe
earthen Pot, and put thereinto three pints of
ſtrong Wine-vinegar, and ſome new-laid
Eggs, with the ſhells unbroken, and four Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-heads,
clean peeled and bruiſed; then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Pot cloſe, and ſet it in ſome warm
Dunghil, and there let it ſtand a whole night,
and the next morning take out the Eggs, but
break them not, then ſtrain the Garlick and
Vinegar through a clean cloth, put thereunto
a quarter of Honey, half a quarter of Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candy,
two ounces of Liquoriſh, two ounces of
Aniſeeds beaten into a fine powder. The
Horſe having faſted all night, in the morning
open his mouth, and put out his Tongue, and
put one Egg into his Throat, and then let go
his Tongue, ſo that he may ſwallow it down,
then pour after it a Horn of the ſaid Drink,
being luke-warm, and ſo all the Eggs in that
manner, and all the Drink being ſpent, bridle

him, and ſtop him, and cloath him very warm,
and let him ſtand four hours, then unbit him;
and if it be in Winter, give him Wheat-ſtraw
but no Hay; and if in the Summer time, give
him Graſs, and for ſome days together Maſhes
to drink, with ſome Sallet-Oyl or Hogs greaſe
in them, and the Horſe will do well, and in
few days be fit for Exerciſe.</p>

not take out the ſheep preſently, but raiſe them

piſs. And let him go amongſt them, to ſee
whether any of them have the Mathes, or be
ſcabbed, and let him ſee and peruſe them three

he that hath a fallow Field ſeparate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

folding of ſheep maketh them ſcabbed, and
breedeth Mathes: and when a ſtorm of ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

would ſet his Fold, and that more eſpecially

thence as they came in, for their going upon
the Ground doth much good: and let the
Shepherd bring his ſheep to the ſtakes, and the
ſheep will rub themſelves on the ſtakes. And
let the Shepherd walk about them till they are
ſet, and ſo order them for two or three nights,

then the Buck goeth to the rut, and ſo would
the Ram. But for the ordinary Husbandman

themſelves. Another cauſe is, he that hath no

let them ſuck as long as the Dams will ſuffer

               <p>IT is neceſſary that a Shepherd ſhould know
what things chiefly rot the ſheep, that he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45382:100"/>
may the better preſerve them. There is a Graſs
called Spearwort, it hath a long narrow Leaf,
like a Spears head, it will grow a foot high, and
it beareth a yellow flower as broad as a Penny.
It groweth always in low places, where the
water uſeth to ſtand in Winter. Another
Graſs is called Penny-graſs, it groweth low,
cloſe to the Earth in Mooriſh Grounds, it hath
a Leaf as broad as Two-pence, but never
beareth flower. All manner of Graſs that
the Land-flood runs over, is bad for ſheep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the ſand and the filth that ſticketh
upon it. All Mooriſh Ground and Marſh-ground
is bad for ſheep. The Graſs that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon Fallows is not good for ſheep; for
there is much of it weedy, and oftentimes it
cometh up by the root, and that bringeth earth
with it: and the ſheep eat both. Mildew-graſs
is very bad for ſheep, and that we may
find out by the Leaves of the Trees in the
morning, and eſpecially of Oaks, take the
Leaves, and put thy tongue to them, and thou
ſhalt taſte like Honey upon them. Therefore
the ſheep ſhould not be let out of the Fold till
the Sun hath the power to dry up the Mildew.
Want of food will cauſe a great Rot amongſt
ſheep; for then they will have neither good
fleſh nor good skins. White Sincles are very
bad for ſheep in Paſtures and in Fallows. There
is another Rot that is called the Pellet,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45382:100"/>
which proceeds from great wet, eſpecially in
woody Countries, where they find a want of
drineſs.</p>

Experimental Directions
FOR
The Right Uſe of the
ANGLE.</head>
               <p>HE that addreſſeth the River for his
pleaſure, muſt be well prepared, as
to the ſetting forth of his Tackle. The
firſt thing he muſt do, is to obſerve the Sun,
the Wind, the Moon, the Stars, and the Wanes
of the Air; he muſt obſerve the Times
and Seaſons to ſet forth his Tackles; to go for
his pleaſure and for his profit. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the Sun proves cloudy, then muſt he
ſet forth his Ground-bait or his Tackles, and
of the brighteſt of his Flies. If the Sun proves
bright, then muſt he put on ſome of the darkeſt
of his Flies. Thus muſt he go to work with
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45382:101"/>
his Flies; light for darkneſs, and darkneſs for
light: he muſt alſo obſerve that the wind be
in the South, for that wind blows the Fly in
the Trouts mouth. But if the weather be
warm, it is indifferent where the wind ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
either with Ground-bait or Menow, ſo
that he can caſt his Bait into the River. The
very ſame obſervation is for night as for day;
for if the Moon prove clear, or if the Stars
glitter in the Sky, there is as ill Angling that
night, as if it were high noon in the midſt of
Summer, when the Sun ſhineth brighteſt, there
is little hopes of any pleaſure. For the petty
<hi>Thames</hi> Recreation of catching of Bleaks, Dace,
&amp;c. as they are ſo generally known of every
young Beginner, I am unwilling to trouble the
Reader with ſuch a trifling Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin, though not without ſome
ſeeming digreſſion, firſt with the taking of
Eels. When the Angler ſtays a night or two,
let him take four or five Lines, ſuch as I ſhall
inform hereafter will ſerve for Pikes of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or fifteen yards long, and at every two
yards make a Nooſe, to hang a Hook armed
either to double thred, or ſilk twiſt: for it is
better then Wyre. Let him bait his Hooks
with Millers-thumbs, Loaches, Menows, or
Gudgins: Let him tye to every Nooſe a Line
baited. Theſe Lines muſt be laid croſs the
River in the deepeſt places, either with ſtones,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45382:102"/>
or pegged, ſo that the Line lye in the bottom
of the River, there will be no doubt of taking
of a diſh of Eels; he muſt alſo have a ſmall
Needle with an Eye, to bait his Hooks; he
muſt make two Flies, the Palmer rubbed with
Silver or Gold, and the <hi>May</hi>-Fly: Theſe are
the ground of all Flies. To make the Palmer
Fly, he muſt arm his Line on the inſide of the
Hook; let him take his Sciſſers, and cut ſo
much of the brown of the Mallards feathers, as
in his own reaſon ſhall make the wings, then let
him lay the outermoſt part of the feather next
the Hook, and the point of the feather towards
the ſhank of the Hook, let him whip it three or
four times about the Hook with the ſame ſilk
he armed the Hook, then make his ſilk faſt:
Let him take the Hackle of the Neck of a Cock
or a Capon, or a Plovers Top, which is the
beſt, and let him take off the one ſide of the
feather, then he muſt take the Hackle-ſilk, or
gold or ſilver thred; and let him make all
theſe faſt at the bent of the Hook, let him work
them up to the wings, every bout ſhifting his
fingers, and making a ſtop, then the gold will
fall right, let him make it faſt: and work up
the Hackle to the ſame place, and make the
Hackle faſt; and let him take the Hook be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
his finger and his thumb, in the left
hand, with a Needle or Pin, part the wings in
two; then with the arming ſilk, as he hath
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45382:102"/>
faſtned all hitherto, let him whip it about as it
falleth croſs between the wings, and with his
Thumb he muſt turn the point of the feather
towards the bent of the Hook; then let him
work it three or four times about the ſhank, ſo
faſten it, and view the proportion. For other
Flies: if he make the grounds of Hogs-wool,
ſandy, black, or white, or the Wool of a Bear,
or of a two years old red Bullock; he muſt
work all theſe grounds upon a waxed ſilk, then
he muſt arm and ſet on the wings, as I ſhewed
before; for the <hi>May</hi>-Fly, let him work the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with ſome of theſe grounds, which will do
very well, ribbed with black hair; he may
alſo work the body with Cruels, imitating the
colour, or with ſilver, ſuiting the wing. For
the Oak-Fly, he muſt make him with orange,
tawny and black for the body, and the brown
of the Mallards feather for the wings.</p>
               <p>To take a Perch, the Angler in the firſt
place muſt take notice that this fiſh feeds well;
and if he lights where they are, they will bite
freely. My opinion is (with ſome more then
ordinary Experience) for to bait with Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms
chopt in pieces over night; let him go
to his ſport in the morning betimes, let him
plum his Ground, gage his Line, and bait his
Hook with a red knotted Worm, or a Menow,
which ſome hold better; let him put the Hook
in at the back of the Menow, betwixt the fiſh
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45382:103"/>
and the skin, that the Menow may ſwim up
and down alive, being buoyed up with a Cork
or a Quill, that the Menow may have liberty
to ſwim a foot off the ground: So doing, the
Angler ſhall not queſtion the profit or pleaſure
of his expended time.</p>
               <p>I do now think it convenient for me to ſhew
my opinion for floating for Scale-fiſh in the
River or Pond: the feed brings the fiſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the Sheep to the Pen. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better in all Anglings for feed, then
Blood and Grains, I hold it better then Paſte;
then let him obſerve next to plum his ground,
Angling with fine Tackles, as ſingle hair for
half the Line next the Hook, round and ſmall
plumed, according to his Float: For the Bait,
there is a ſmall red Worm, with a yellow tip
on his tayl, which is very good; Brandlins,
Gentles, Paſte, or Cadice, which we call Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bait,
they lye in a gravelly husk, under the
ſtones in the River: Theſe are the moſt ſpecial
Baits for theſe kind of fiſh.</p>
               <p>There is a manner of trouling for a Pike
with a Hazel-rod of twelve foot long, with a
Ring of Wyre in the top of the Rod, for the
Line to run thorow: within two foot of the
bottom of the Rod, there is a hole made to
put in a winde to turn with a Barrel, to gather
up the Line, and to looſe it at pleaſure: this
is the beſt manner of trouling. But I am of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45382:103"/>
opinion that I can ſhew a way, either in
Meer, Pond, or River, that ſhall take more
Pikes then any Trouler with his Rod. And
thus it is: Firſt, take a forked ſtick, a Line of
twelve yards long wond upon it, at the upper
end leave about a yard, either to tye a bunch
of Sags, or a Bladder, to buoy up the fiſh, and
to carry it from the ground: the Bait muſt be
a live fiſh, either Dace, Gudgin, Roach, or a
ſmall Trout: the forked ſtick muſt have a ſlit
in the one ſide of the Fork to put in the Line,
that he may ſet his live fiſh to ſwim at a gage,
that when the Pike taketh the Bait, he may
have the full liberty of the Line for his feed. He
may turn theſe looſe either in the Pond or the
River: in the Pond with the wind all the day
long, the more the better: at night let him ſet
ſome ſmall weight, that may ſtay the Buoy, as
a Ship lyeth at Anchor, till the fiſh taketh.
For the River, he muſt turn all looſe with the
ſtream; two or three are ſufficient to ſhew
pleaſure, gaged at ſuch a depth, as that they
will go current down the River, where there
ſhall be no doubt of excellent ſport, if there be
Pikes: for the Hooks, they muſt be double
Hooks, the ſhanks muſt be ſomewhat ſhorter
then ordinary: my reaſon, the ſhorter the
Hook is of the ſhank, it will hurt the fiſh the
leſs, and it muſt be armed with ſmall Wyre
well ſoftned. But I hold a Hook armed with
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45382:104"/>
twiſted ſilk to be better. If you arm your
Hook with Wyre, the Needle muſt be made
with an Eye; then muſt he take one of thoſe
Baits alive (which he can get) and with one of
his Needles enter within a ſtraws bredth of the
Gill of the fiſh, ſo pull the Needle betwixt the
skin and the fiſh; then pull the Needle out at
the hindmoſt fin, and draw the arming tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the fiſh, until the Hook come to lye cloſe
to the fiſhes body: But I hold for thoſe that
are armed with Wyre, to take off the Hook,
and put the Needle in the hindmoſt fin, and ſo
to come out at the Gill; then let him put on
the Hook drawn cloſe to the body, 'twill hurt
the live fiſh the leſs, ſo knit the arming with the
live fiſh to the Line; then let him put off ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Meer or Pond, with the wind, in the
River with the ſtream: the more that he pulls
off in Meer or Pond, he is the likelier to have
the greater pleaſure. There is a time when
Pikes go a frogging Ditches, and in the River
to ſun them, as in <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> there
is then a ſpeedy way to take them, and ſcarce
to miſs one in twenty. The Angler muſt take
a Line of ſix or eight foot, let him arm a large
Hook, of the largeſt ſize that is made, and arm
it to his Line, let him lead the ſhank of his
Hook very handſomly, that it may be of ſuch
a weight, that he may guide the Hook at his
pleaſure: he may ſtrike the Pike that he ſees,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45382:104"/>
with the bare Hook where he pleaſes: This
Line and Hook doth far exceed Snaring. The
beſt ſport to take a Pike, is to take a Gooſe or
Gander, or Duck; take one of the Pikes Lines
I have before deſcribed, and let him tye the
Line under the left wing, and over the right
wing, about the body, as a man weareth his
Belt: turn the Gooſe off into the Pond, where
Pikes are, and there will be pleaſant rare Feats
betwixt the Gooſe and the Pike.</p>
               <p>To take a Carp either in Pond or River, if
the Angler intends to have ſport with ſome
profit, he muſt take a Peck of Ale-grains, and
a good quantity of any Blood, and mix the
Grains and the Blood together, and caſt it in
the place where he meant to Angle; this feed
will gather the Scale-fiſh, as Carp, Tench,
Roach, Dace, and Bream: the next morning
let him be at his ſport very early, plum his
ground, and he may Angle for the Carp with
a ſtrong Line; the Bait muſt be either a red
knotted Worm or Paſte, and he ſhall have ſport
enough.</p>
               <p>The Angler may begin to angle for a Trout
with Ground-baits, in this manner following:
Firſt, he muſt be ſure of a neat taper Rod, light
before, with a tender Hazel top, which is very
gentle, he may Angle with a ſingle hair of five
lengths, one tyed to the other for the bottom
of the Line, and a Line of three-haired Links
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45382:105"/>
for the upper part, and ſo if he have good
Sea-room, he may take the largeſt Trout that
ſwims. He that angles with a Line made of
three-haired Links at the bottom, and more
at the top, may take Trouts: but he that
angles with one hair, ſhall take five Trouts to
the other one; for this fiſh is very quick-fighted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therefore the beſt way for night or
day, is to keep out of ſight. He muſt angle
always with the point of his Rod down the
ſtream; for a fiſh hath not the quickneſs ſo
perfect up the ſtream, as oppoſite againſt him,
obſerving ſeaſonable times. As for Example;
we begin to angle in <hi>March,</hi> if it prove cloudy,
the Angler muſt angle with the Ground-baits
all day long: but if it prove clear and bright,
he muſt take the morning and evening, or elſe
he is not like to do any good; for the times
muſt be obſerved, and truly underſtood: For
when an Angler cometh to the River for his
pleaſure, that doth not underſtand to ſet forth
his Tackles fit for the time, it is as good keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them in the Bag, as to ſet them forth.</p>
               <p>The Angler that doth intend to angle with
the Ground-baits, let him ſet his Tackles to his
Rod, and let him begin at the uppermoſt part
of the Stream, carrying his Line with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
hand, feeling the Plummet running on
the ground ſome ten inches from the Hook,
plumming his Line according to the ſwiftneſs
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45382:105"/>
of the Stream that he angles in; for one
Plummet will not ſerve for all Streams; for
the true Angling is, that the Plummet runneth
on the ground. For this Bait, let him take the
red knotted Worm, which is very good where
Brandlings are not to be had: now that he
may make theſe Brandlings fit to be angled
with, that they may live long upon the Hook,
which cauſeth the ſport. When he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
his Worms out of the Dunghil, he muſt
get the greeneſt Moſs he can find, then waſh the
Earth very clean out of it, then let him have an
Earthen-pot to put his Moſs into it, and let
him put his Worms to the Moſs in the Pot,
and within two days he ſhall find his Worms
ſo poor, that if he bait ſome of them on his
Hook, he ſhall ſee that with throwing them
two or three times into the water, they will
dye and grow white. Now the skill is, when
theſe Worms are grown poor, to feed them
up, to make them fat and luſty, he muſt take
the Yolk of an Egg, ſome eight or ten ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of the top of new Milk, beaten well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a Porrenger; let him warm it a little
until that it curdle, then let him take it off
from the fire, and ſet it to cool; when it is
cold, let him take a ſpoonful, and drop it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Moſs into the Pot, every drop about the
bigneſs of a green Pea, ſhifting his Moſs
twice a week in the Summer, and once in the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45382:106"/>
Winter. Thus doing, he ſhall feed his worms
fat, and make them luſty, that they will live a
long time on the Hook; thus he may keep
them all the year long. This is my true Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
for the Ground-baits, for the running
Line for the Trout.</p>
               <p>The Angling with the Menow, called in
ſome places Pencks, for a Trout, is a pleaſant
ſport, that taketh the greateſt fiſh. The Trout
comes as boldly to the Bait, as if it were a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive-dog
at a Bear: The Angler may uſe his
ſtronger and greater Tackle, and it will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to him in his Angling, to uſe a Line
made of three ſilks and three hairs twiſted
for the uppermoſt part of the Line, and two
ſilks &amp; two hairs twiſted for the bottom next
his Hook, with a Swivel nigh to the middle of
his Line, with an indifferent large Hook.</p>
               <p>Let him bait his Hook with a Menow, he
muſt put his Hook through the lowermoſt part
of his mouth, ſo draw his Hook thorow, then
put the Hook in at the mouth again, and let
the point of the Hook come out at the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Fin, then let him draw his Line, and
the Menows mouth will cloſe, that no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will get into its belly: He muſt angle (as
hath been ſaid) with the point of his Angle
down the Stream, drawing the Menow up the
Stream by little and little, nigh the top of the
water; the Trout ſeeing the Bait, cometh moſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:45382:106"/>
fiercely at it, the Angler muſt give a little
time before he ſtrikes: This is a true way
without Lead; for many times I have had
them come at the Lead, and forſake the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now,
which he that tryes in time will prove.</p>
               <p>My next task will be to inſtruct the young
Angler how to angle with a Flye. Let him
fit himſelf with a Hazel, either of one piece, or
two ſet together in the moſt convenient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
light and gentle: Let him ſet his Line to
the Rod, for the uppermoſt part he may uſe
his own diſcretion; for the lower part next
his Fly, muſt be of three or four haired Links.
If he can attain to angle with one hair, he ſhall
have the more riſes, and take more fiſh; let
him be ſure that he do not over-load himſelf
with the length of his Line: and before that
he begin to angle, let him make a tryal, having
the wind on his back, to ſee at what length he
can caſt his Flye, that the Flye light firſt into
the water; for if any of the Line falleth into
the water before the Flye, it had been better
unthrown then thrown. Let him always caſt
down the ſtream, with the wind behind him,
and the Sun before: it is a great advantage
for him to have the Sun or the Moon before
him. Let him begin to angle in <hi>March</hi> with
the Flye: but if the weather prove windy or
cloudy, there are ſeveral kinds of Palmers that
are good at that time. Firſt is a black Palmer
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45382:107"/>
ribbed with ſilver: the ſecond, a black Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
with an Orange tawny body: thirdly, a
black Palmer, with the body made of all
black: fourthly, a red Palmer ribbed with
gold, and a red Huckle mixed with Orange
Cruel. Theſe Flies ſerve all the year long,
morning and evening, whether windy or clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
weather. But if the Air prove bright and
clear, he may imitate the Hawthorn Fly, which
is all black and very ſmall, and the ſmaller, the
better. In <hi>May</hi> let him take the <hi>May</hi>-Fly, &amp; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
that, which is made ſeveral ways: Some
make them with a ſhammy body, ribbed with
a black hair: others make them with ſandy
Hogs-wool, ribbed with black ſilk, and wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Mallards feather, ſeveral ways, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fancy of the Angler. There is
another called the Oak-Fly, which is made of
Orange-colour'd Cruel, and black, with a
brown wing: another Fly, the body thereof
is made with the ſtrain of a Peacocks-feather,
which is very good in a bright day. The
Graſhopper which is green, the ſmaller Flies
are made of indifferent ſmall Hooks, which
are the better: theſe ſeveral ſorts I have ſet
down, will ſerve all the year long, obſerving
the times and ſeaſons: And let him take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the lighteſt Flies are for cloudy and
dark weather, the darkeſt for bright and light,
and the reſt of indifferent ſeaſons, for which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45382:107"/>
his own judgment, experience, and diſcretion
muſt guide him; ſo that he muſt alter theſe
Flies according to theſe directions. Of late
days the Hogs-wool, of ſeveral colours, the
wool of a red Heiſer, and Bears-wool are made
uſe of, which make good grounds; they are
now very much uſed, and procure very good
ſport. The natural Fly is a ſure way of ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and will catch great ſtore of Trouts with
much pleaſure. As for the <hi>May</hi>-Fly, he ſhall
always have them playing at the River-ſide,
eſpecially againſt Rain. The Oak-Fly is to
be had on the But of an Oak, or an Aſh, from
the beginning of <hi>May</hi> to the end of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> it
is a browniſh Fly, and ſtands always with his
head towards the root of the Tree, very eaſie
to be found. The ſmall black Fly is to be
had on every Hawthorn-buſh, after the Buds
are come forth. The Graſhopper, which is
green, is to be had in any Meadow of Graſs in
<hi>June</hi> or <hi>July:</hi> with theſe Flies, he muſt uſe
ſuch a Rod as to angle with the Ground-bait;
the Line muſt not be as long as the Rod: Let him
withdraw his Fly, as he ſhall find to be moſt
convenient in his Angling. When he comes
to deep Waters that ſtand ſomewhat ſtill, let
him make his Line about two yards long, and
dop his Fly behind a Buſh, at which Angling I
have had very good ſport. The way to make
the beſt Paſte, is to take a reaſonable quantity
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45382:108"/>
of freſh Butter, as much freſh Sheeps Suet, a
reaſonable quantity of the ſtrongeſt Cheeſe he
can get, with the ſoft of an old ſtale white
Loaf: let him beat all theſe in a Mortar, till
they come to a perfect Paſte; and when the
Angler goes to his ſport, let him put as much
on his Hook as a green Peaſe.</p>

               <p>MArle is a very uſeful thing; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it is cold, which is the reaſon
that it ſaddens the Land exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for it is very heavy, and will go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Some Countries yield Marle of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
colours, as 'tis affirmed of <hi>Kent,</hi> wherein is
found both yellow and gray: the blew and red
are counted beſt. To marle together, I hold
not proper; but when you are reſolved to lay
down your Land to graze, be ſure at the laſt
Crop you intend to take (which may be two
or three more after marling) then manure your
Land, for the leſs binding, and the more light,
looſe and open, the more fruitful it is, ſo that
it will produce a gallant Clovery. The firſt
year after you have laid it down upon the
Wheat or mixed Corn-ſtubble, you muſt run
it over again with Dung, and it will pay tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Now the Lands upon which Marle is

Land whatſoever, though never ſo barren, to
which it is natural and nouriſhing, as Bread to

               <head>The beſt way of planting of Trefoyl or Clover-graſs.</head>
               <p>THere are ſeveral ſorts of Clover, I ſhall
only ſpeak of the great Clover that we
fetch from <hi>Flanders,</hi> called Trefoyl, named by
<hi>Cluſius Trefolio majus tertium,</hi> which bears the
great red Honey-ſuckle, whoſe root and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
far exceed our natural Meadow-Clover,
and bears a very ſmall ſeed like Muſtard-ſeed,
not ſo round, but longer like a Bean; the beſt
is of a greeniſh yellow colour, ſome a little
reddiſh; the black, I ſuppoſe, will not do well.
Your Dutch or Low-Country ſeed, or from the
lower parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> is very much of it, but
very hazardous that comes over hither; but
being well choſe there (for the choice is the
Maſter-piece of the work) the tranſporting of
it by Sea is no conſiderable prejudice to it;
but much of it that was ſold in the Seedſmens
Shops in <hi>London,</hi> was either corrupted by the
Dutch before it came thence, or elſe parched
by our drying, or elſe by the Shop-keepers
either mingled with old or new, or keeping it
another year, and then ſelling it for new. The
beſt way of ſowing of this Dutch Seed, muſt
be by mixture of it with Aſhes of Wood, or
Coals courſly ſifted, or with ſome Duſt, or
good Sand, or fine Mould, or any thing elſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:45382:109"/>
that will help to fill the Land, or ſpread well
forth of the Land: and after this I muſt preſs as
the weightieſt thing of this Husbandry, to have
a moſt ſpecial care of the even ſowing of it,
becauſe the wind, though very ſmall, hath
power over this, and therefore you muſt chuſe
as calm a time as poſſibly you can. You may
ſow it upon any Land you intend to graze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
any fair places in a Meadow, or High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
trodden and poached, it will ſoard them:
but the uſual way is thus adviſed; when that
you have fitted your Land by Tillage and
good Husbandry, then ſow your Barley or
Oats, and harrow them in, and after your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
upon the ſame Land, covered over with
ſmall Harrow or Buſh, but ſow not the Corn
as you uſually did; but if you will loſe this
Crop, you may ſow it of it ſelf. The ſeaſon
of it is in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> or in the end
of <hi>March,</hi> if it be likely to be a dry ſeaſon. I
have heard of three Crops, and ſome affirm
that it will bear, two to cut, and one for to
graze; the firſt Crop may be at mid-<hi>May</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to cut, and this Crop is beſt always to be
cut green, and before the ſtalk begin to grow
too big, and begin to dry and wither, unleſs it
be for Seed; therefore as Experience will
teach, it will be beſt to cut it green and young,
and give it to Cattel or Horſe in the Stable;
for if you cut it to keep, it will go ſo near to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:45382:110"/>
as that it will do but little ſervice dry;
yet if being cut young, it will be very good and
ſweet, and either ſeed or give Milk abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and then after the firſt cut, let it grow for
Seed, and herein you muſt be careful, that you
let it grow till it be full ripe, for it will not
be very apt to ſhed; and if it grow to ſeed,
I cannot conceive of what uſe thoſe ſtalks that
are ſo hard and dry can be, unleſs it be for
firing in a dear Country, ſo that the ſeed muſt
be the advance of that Crop only, and ſo it
may well enough, and you may have a good
after-paſture, and may graze it until <hi>January,</hi>
and then preſerve it. But if you would know
when your Seed is ripe, obſerve theſe two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
Firſt, obſerve the Husk when the
Seed appears in it, then about one month after
it may be ripe. Secondly, try the Seed after
it begins to turn the colour, and the ſtalk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to dye and turn brown, it begins to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and being turned to a yellowiſh colour,
in a dry time mow it, and preſerve it till it be
perfectly dry any manner of way, and then
about the midſt of <hi>March</hi> thraſh it, and cleanſe
it from the ſtraw as much as you can; foulter
and beat the Husk again, being exceeding well
dryed in the Sun after the firſt thraſhing, and
then get out what ſeed you can, and after try
what a Mill will do at the reſt, as aforeſaid
more at la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge: But I will give way to any that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:45382:110"/>
can make a better diſcovery. I need not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
a time in <hi>July</hi> or <hi>Auguſt</hi> as beſt to cut
for ſeed, becauſe ſome years and Lands will
ripen it ſooner then others will; therefore
have reſpect to thy ſeed and ſtraw according to
the former directions: but when you are to go
into good ſeed, you muſt graze it upon the
Land, and then be ſure not to let it grow too
rank and high; but if the ſtalk grow big,
Cattel will balk it, and ſtain it more, and it
will not eat up ſo kindly at firſt, nor graze ſo
even afterwards, but exceeding much Milk it
will yield, and feed and nouriſh very well.
But to affirm, as ſome have done, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
to this day, that it will grow on the
barrenneſt Ground that is, as on <hi>Windſor</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
I dare not; I have known that it hath
failed, and I am confident muſt, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great coſt on Husbandry; yet that
very Land well manured and tilled, dunged,
limed, marled, or chalkt, or otherwiſe made
fat and warm, will bring forth good Clover,
and other rich Commodities, as they do in
<hi>Flanders:</hi> the Nature of the Land is good,
but the Spirit of it is too low to raiſe it of it
ſelf. And this is all that is held forth in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of <hi>Brabant</hi> Husbandry, exceeding bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Lands, but well dunged and tilled, and
then clovered, not that it is the barren Land,
but the good and coſtly Husbandry; only the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:45382:111"/>
oldneſs of the Land, and the reſtineſs thereof,
yields more ſpirit to the Grain or Clover by
far, then the tillable Land well husbanded,
and laid down with Clover, will do very well
alſo. The quantity of ſeed for an Acre, as I
conceive, will be a Gallon, or nine or ten
pound, though ſome are of opinion leſs will
ſerve turn. Therefore, as I ſaid before, I ſay your
old Land, be it courſe or rich, as it is, or hath
been diſuſed from Tillage long, is beſt for
Corn, ſo alſo it is the beſt and moſt certain
Land for Clover; and when you have corned
your Land as much as you intend, then to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it to Clover, is the propereſt ſeaſon. This
I ſhall lay down for a general Rule, That
whatſoever Land is neither too rank or fat for
any ſort of Corn, is not too good to clover,
and you ſhall always find it to be the beſt
Husbandry, unleſs you recover the barren
Lands up to a good and rich condition, which
is alſo the far better Husbandry, then to let it
lye pelting and moiling upon poor mean Land
unfatned by ſome ſoils or other; therefore I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
every man to plow up no more then he can
well overcome by his Purſe and Husbandry,
and let the reſt lye till he have brought up the
other, and then as he hath raiſed one part,
take up another, and lay down that to
graze, either with Clover or otherwiſe: and
let him take heed that flatters himſelf to raiſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:45382:111"/>
good Clover upon barren Heathy Land, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then aforeſaid. Let him take notice,
he will pull down his Plumes after two or three
years Experience, unleſs he deviſe a new way
of Husbandary: as to the annual profit that may
accrue thereby, I ſhall a little differ from the
<hi>Flanders</hi> Husbandry, but ſhall affirm, that one
Acre, after the Corn is cut, the very next year
if it be well husbanded, and kind thick Clover,
may be worth twenty Marks, or twenty
pounds, and ſo downwards, as it degenerates
weaker, leſs worth. In <hi>Brabant</hi> they ſpeak of
keeping four Cows Winter and Summer, ſome
cut and laid up for Fodder, others cut and
eaten green; but I have credibly heard of
ſome in <hi>England,</hi> that about one Acre have
kept four Coach-horſes, and more all Summer
long; but if he keep but two Cows, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
enough upon ſuch Lands as never kept
one: But I conceive beſt for us, until we come
into a ſtock of Seed, to mow the firſt Crop in
the midſt or end of <hi>May,</hi> and to lay that up
for Hay, although it will go very near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yet if it grow not too ſtrong, it will be
exceeding good and rich, and feed any thing,
and reſerve the next for Seed; and if we can
bring it up to perfect Seed, if it but yield four
Buſhels upon an Acre, it will amount to more
then I ſpeak of by far, every Buſhel being
worth three or four pound a Buſhel; and then
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:45382:112"/>
after the Math or Eadiſh, that year may be put
up three midling Runts upon an Acre, and feed
them up: all which laid together, will make
up an Improvement ſufficient; and yet this
property it hath alſo, that after the three firſt
years of cloving, it will ſo frame the Earth,
that it will be very ſit to corn again, which wil
be a very great advantage. Firſt to corn the
Land, which uſually yields a far better profit
then graſing, and ſometimes a double profit,
and ſometimes more, near a treble profit, and
then to clover it again, will afford a wondrous
ſtrange advance. And if you conſider one
Acre with the Clover and Husbandry thereof,
may ſtand you the firſt year in twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
the Land being worth no more, which
may produce you yearly (if it thrive well) ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
five, ſix, or eight pounds <hi>per</hi> Acre, nay
ſome will affirm, ten or twelve pounds, or
more.</p>

               <head>Of the Plantation of Hops, and how Land

               <p>HOps is grown a National Commodity:

that they would ſpoil the taſte of Drink,
and endanger the peoples healths, and for
ſome other reaſons I do not well remember<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but petition they did to ſuppreſs them, and had
the Parliament been no wiſer then they, we
had been in a meaſure pined, and in a greater
meaſure ſtarved. This Hop-plantation will
require a large Diſcourſe; but I ſhall contract
my ſelf to the briefeſt diſcovery thereof I can
poſſibly. 1. Chuſe the Land that is beſt for
them, and beſt Sets to plant withal. 2. The
beſt manner of planting them and husbanding
of them, until they are fit for ſale. 3. The
profit and advantage that will accrue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
I ſhall afterwards, as plainly as I can, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.
4. Deſcribe the manner of its growth
thus; it comes up with ſeveral ſprouts like
Aſparagus, runs up and climbs upon any thing
it meets withal, bears a long ſtalk, hairy, and
rugged Leaves, broad like the Vine, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
hang down by cluſters, ſet as it were with
ſcales yellowiſh, called in High Dutch <hi>Lupullus,</hi>
in Low Dutch <hi>Hopſſem,</hi> and in Engliſh <hi>Hop.</hi>
It is offenſive upon this account, hot in the firſt
degree, ſtuffs the head with the ſmell, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
uſe it not too much; yet the Leaves open
and cleanſe. The beſt Land is your richeſt
Land, it muſt be a deep Mould, that which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
near the Rock, the Poles cannot be ſet
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:45382:113"/>
deep enough to ſtand firm; it ſhould be a
mixt Earth that is compounded of Sand and a
little Clay, but much ſolid Earth, a ſtrongiſh
Land laid dry and warm, will bear the
weightieſt Hops. A barren Mooriſh wet Soil
is not natural to Hops; but if this be laid very
dry, and made very rich with Dung and Soil,
it may do reaſonable well. The Hop-Garden
ſhould ſtand warm, that it may be preſerved
from North and Eaſt winds, rather by Hills
then Trees, as near your Houſe as may be, and
that Land you determine for your Hop-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
lay as level and as ſquare as you can; and
if it be rough and ſtiff, it will do well to be
ſowed with Hemp, Beans, or Turneps before;
but in what ſtate ſoever it be, till in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Winter, make uſe of the Plough or
Spade, and this not only the year before, but
every year as long as you uſe it; and the more
pains and coſt you beſtow, the more profit, and
is the nearer to you, reſemble the <hi>Flemming</hi> in
his Hopping. And for your Sets and good
Roots, to procure them, you muſt go to a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
orderly kept, where the Hops are of a
good kind, all yearly cut, and where the Hills
are raiſed very high, for the Roots will be
greateſt, be ſure to buy choice Sets; they may
coſt ſix a hundred in ſome places, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you may have them for the taking up:
leave your Husbandry orderly, their Hills well
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:45382:113"/>
dreſt. You muſt chuſe the biggeſt Roots you
can find, ſuch as are three or four inches about,
and the Set nine or ten inches long, and have
three joynts in a Root. Take heed of wild
Hops, they are only diſcerned by the Root and
ſtalk. The unkindly Hop that likes not his
ground, ſoil, or keeping, comes up green and
ſmall in the ſtalk, thick and rough in the leaves
like Nettles, much bitten with a black Fly,
but it deſtroys not the Hop, but ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures
it. The manner of planting as ſoon as
your Roots are got, is either to ſet them ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
or lay them in ſome Puddle, or bury
them in Earth; but leave them not in Water
above twenty four hours: Then begin to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
your Hills with a Line, tyed with knors
and threads thereto; the due diſtance had
need to be eight foot betwixt, becauſe then
you make the fewer and bigger Hills, the Sun
comes about them. Let the Poles reach not
one another, that ſo it may be plowed yearly
the more eaſily, otherwiſe it muſt be digged,
ſome ſay ſeven foot, and others ſay ſix foot, as
one lately accuſtomed manner is. And I am
confident there is moſt advantage by thin
planting: but that I leave to each mans Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
Your hole under the knot of your
Line, had need be a foot ſquare and deep,
then if you can have the wind South or Weſt
it is beſt; if not, go on, having made many
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:45382:114"/>
holes; but be ſure to take the month of <hi>April</hi>
for the work, and take two or three of your
Roots, as a great old Gardiner affirmed to
me, by which they will yield green Sciens or
white Buds, and will have ſmall beards grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out. Joyn your Sets together even in the
tops, and ſet them altogether bolt upright,
and there hold them in their place, till you
have filled the hole with good Mould, and ſet
low, but juſt as the tops may be level with the
ground, and then after they muſt be covered
thick with fine Mould; be careful you ſet not
that end downwards which before grew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which you may know by the bad grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upwards, and let no part of the dead ſtalk
remain upon the uppermoſt joynt thereof; then
preſs down the Earth hard to the Roots. Some
will ſet them every one at a corner of the foot
of the Line, which I rather incline to, becauſe
they have room, and ſtand round: But if you
plant late, and have green ſprings upon them,
then be careful of not covering the ſpring; but
to ſet more Plants, leſt ſome ſhould fail, and
in a bigger hole, round about the ſame ſet
eight, ſome ſay ten or more, which is thought
tedious. Now at this time you need make no
Hills at all there, as aforeſaid. Poultry muſt be
kept from thence for ſcratching, the Gooſe more
eſpecially, or any things that are miſchievous.
Now for poling, if your diſtance be three
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:45382:114"/>
yards, or eight foot, then four Poles are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
elſe three will ſerve, but I incline to
ſix or ſeven foot diſtance, and four Poles, and
as many this year as any. Elder Poles are very
good, taper, and rough, and ſuitable to the
Hops deſire. The time of cutting your Poles
is in <hi>December</hi> or in <hi>November,</hi> and then dreſs
them, and pile them up dry; if you leave
ſome Twigs, it will not do amiſs. For
length fifteen foot is well, except your Ground
be very rich, or your Hills exceedingly height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d;
or if they grow too thick, your Poles
need to be the longer. The Hop never ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
kindly, until it reach higher then the Pole,
and returneth a yard or two; for whilſt it is
climbing, the branches that grow out of the
principal ſtalk, grow little or nothing. Let
your Poles be ſtrong nine inches above the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
they will ſtand the faſter: 150 Poles
make a Load, which may be worth a little
more then ordinary Wood, a few will ſupply
the ſtanding ſtock. In ſetting your Poles, lay
all to each Hill you intend to ſet, which ſpeeds
the work When your Hops appear, as you
diſcern where your principal Root ſtands, then
ſet to poling, having a Crow of Iron to make
entrance for the Pole: but if you ſtay longer,
then you will be more ſubject, either by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

flying. Your foot of the Pole muſt be
ſet a foot and a half deep, and within two or
three inches of the principal Root: but if your
Land be rocky, then you muſt help your ſelf
by making your hill higher to ſtrengthen your
Poles, for which you ſtay the longer; leſt that
you bury your Sciens, your Poles of each hill,
leave them rather outward one from another,
and then with a Rammer ram them outward,
and not inward. If a Pole ſhould break, take
away the broken Pole, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ye the top of
thoſe Hops to a new Pole, then winding it
with the Sun a turn or two, ſet it in the hole;
but if you take a ſtake, and tye it to without
wreſting the Wyers of it, you may do well to
piece it; but if it be broken at the nether end,
ſhove the Pole in again; and if your Poles
break in the pulling, or will not be drawn, by
reaſon of the drought or hardneſs, you may
make a pair of Pinſors of four five foot
long, with an Iron running Hook upon them,
and with a Block laid under upon the top of
the hill, and ſo coleweigh up your Poles, the
mouth thereof made hollow. And for laying
up your Poles, the uſual way is to tye two and
two together in the top, being ſet in ſix op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
hills, and lay ſome Hop-bands upon the
three hills under your Hop-poles, and ſo draw
your tops near together, or farther off, as you
ſee cauſe. When your Hops are grown two
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45382:115"/>
foot high, bind up with a Ruſh or graſs
your binds to the Poles, winding them about
the Poles as often as you can, and winde them
according to the courſe of the Sun, but not
when the dew is upon them: your Ruſhes ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Sun will grow tough. Now you
muſt begin to make your hills, and for that
purpoſe get a good ſtrong Ho, of a good broad
bit, and cut or ho up all the graſs, in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
betwixt your hills, and therewith make
your hills with a little of your Mould, but not
with ſtrong Weeds, and the more your hills
are raiſed, the better, the larger and the
ſtronger grows the Root, and the bigger will
be your Fruit, and from this time you muſt be
painful in raiſing your hills, and clearing your
Ground from Weeds. In the firſt year ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
not one Scien, but ſuffer them all to
climb up the Poles, and ſhould you bury the
Springs of any one of your Roots, it would
dye, ſo that the more Poles are required to
nouriſh the Spring. But after the firſt year,
you muſt not ſuffer above two or three ſtalks
to grow up to one Pole, but pull down and
bury all the reſt; yet you may let them grow
four or five foot long, and then chuſe out the
beſt for uſe. As ſoon as your Pole is ſet, you
may make a Circle how broad your hill ſhall
be, and then hollow it, that it may receive the
moiſture; and not long after proceed to the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:45382:116"/>
building of your hills. Where you begin, and
where your Hops are higheſt, there begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and pare again, and lay them to your
Hops, but lay the out-circle higheſt to receive
moiſture, and be always paring up, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the heap, and with ſome Mould until the
heap comes to be near a yard high; but the
firſt year make it not too high, and as you paſs
through your Garden, have a forked Wand
in your hand to help the Hops that hang not
right. Now theſe hills muſt the next year be
pulled down, and dreſſed again every year.
Some, when their Hop is eleven or twelve foot,
break off the tops, which are better then they
which have their Pole ſo long as the Hop runs:
But if that your Hop by the midſt of <hi>July</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
not to the top of the Pole, then break off
the top of the ſame Hop; for then the reſt of
the time will nouriſh the branches, which
otherwiſe will loſe all, it being no advantage
in running up to the ſtock, or increaſe of the
Hop. Now we come to the gathering of
them; about St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Day Hops blow,
and at <hi>Lammas</hi> they bell: But when your
Hops begin to change colour, it is a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Michaelmas,</hi> but long before ſome will
turn, change, and grow ripe, which howſoever
the beſt way will be to pull them, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to ſhed; they are called Midſummer-Hops.
Let them not grow till the other be
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:45382:116"/>
ripe, and as ſoon as the ſeed of the reſt begins
to change, then get Pullers amain, and as many
as you can, taking a fair ſeaſon; and note,
you were better to gather them too early then
too late. Therefore for neatneſs ſake, pull
down four hills ſtanding together in the midſt
of your Garden, cut the Roots, pare the ſame
Plot level, throw water on it, tread it, ſweep
it, and make it fat, wherein the Hops muſt
lye to be pickt. Then begin and cut the ſtalks
cloſe by the tops of the Hills, and cut them
aſunder that grow one into another, with a
long ſharp Hook, and with a Fork take them
down; you may make them Fork and Hook,
one apt Inſtrument with which you may ſhove
off all from the Pole, and carry it to the place,
and pick them off from the Pole. Straight fine
Poles are beſt for this way, but cut no more
ſtalks then you can carry away in the ſpace of
one hour afore-hand; for either the Sun or
Rain will offend them when they are off of the
Pole, they muſt all ſtand round the floor, and
ſpeedily ſtrip them in Baskets; for it is not
unwholeſom, though ſome ſmaller Leaves fall
amongſt them. Clear your floor twice a day,
and ſweep it, and if the weather be unlike to
be fair, they may be carried into the houſe in
Blankets, but uſe no Linnen, it will be ſtained
to the purpoſe. And if you pull them upon
Poles, then lay them upon forked ſtakes, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:45382:117"/>
diſpatch them, be careful of wet, leſt they ſhed
their ſeed, which is the marrow of them, and
carry out your ſtraw, and ſo depart your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
till <hi>March,</hi> unleſs it be to bring in Dung.
Lay on ſome in the Winter to comfort and
warm the Roots, your old Dung is beſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
none then not rotten. And in <hi>April</hi> help
every hill with a handful or two of good
Earth when the Hop is wond upon the Pole;
but in <hi>March</hi> you will find, unleſs it hath been
tilled, all Weeds. But if you have pulled
down your hills, and laid your Ground as it
were level, it will ſerve to maintain your hills
for a long time: but if you have not pulled
down your hills, your ſhall with your Ho as it
were undermine them round, till that you
come near to the principal, and take the upper
or younger Roots in your hand, diſcerning
where the new Roots grow out of the old Sets,
but cut no Roots before the beginning of
<hi>March</hi> or end of <hi>April.</hi> The firſt year of
dreſſing your Roots, you muſt cut away all
ſuch as grew the year before within an inch of
the ſame, and every year after cut them as
cloſe to the old Roots. Thoſe that grow
downward are not to be cut, they are thoſe
that grow outward, which will incumber
your Garden. The difference betwixt old and
new eaſily appears: You will find your old
Sets not increaſed in length, but a little in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:45382:117"/>
and in few years all your Sets will be
grown into one, and by the colour alſo, the
main Root being red, the other white: But if
this be not yearly done, then they will not be
perceived; and if your Sets be ſmall, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in good Ground, and the hill well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the new Roots will be greater then the
old; if they grow to wild Hops, the ſtalk will
wax red, pull them down, and plant new in
their places. As for the annual charge of the
Hop-Garden after it is planted, the dreſſing
the Hills, the Allies, the hoing them, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them, and tying to the Poles, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Hops, is uſually done for forty ſhillings
an Acre, together with pulling, drying, and
bagging by the day. And ſo I proceed to the
drying of them, which may be upon any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Kilne, with any Wood that is dry, but
not too old, or elſe good ſweet Rye-ſtraw will
do well, but Charcoal beſt of all. They muſt
be laid about nine or ten inches thick, and
dryed a good while on that ſide, and then
turned upſide down, and dryed as much on
the other ſide: about twelve hours will dry a
Kilne full, which muſt be followed night and
day, then laid up in a cloſe Room upon a heap
together for a month, if your Markets will
give you way to frume and forgive again:
when the ſtalk begins to be brittle, and the
leaf alſo begins to rub, then the Hop is dryed
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:45382:118"/>
ſufficiently, but tread them not while they are
hot, it will tread them to duſt, and then either
againſt <hi>Sturbridge</hi>-Fair, or what other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
you provide for, you may bag them up
cloſe and hard, either to 200 a Quarter. And
ſo I come to my next Particular, to ſhew you
the profit of them: One Acre of good Hops
may poſſibly be worth at a good Market forty,
fifty, ſixty pounds; an Acre may bear eleven
or twelve hundred weight, poſſibly ſome have
done more, many ten, but grant but eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
they may ſometimes be worth not above
one pound four ſhillings the hundred, and
ſome other times they have been worth twelve
or fourteen pound a hundred, and uſually once
in three years they bring money enough. It
is uſually a very good Commodity, and many
times extraordinary, and our Nation may
aſcribe unto it ſelf, to raiſe the beſt Hops of
any other Nation. There's an old Saying:

               <head>Of the Myſtery of Saffron, and the way of
planting of it.</head>
               <p>THere is another very rich Commodity
wherein our Nation hath the Glory, and
yet it is a very Myſtery to many Parts of it;
they know not whether ſuch a thing grows in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45382:118"/>
                  <hi>England;</hi> and yet none ſuch ſo good grows in
the World beſide that I have ever heard or
read of, and that is Saffron. It is a moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and wholeſom thing, and if it take right,
it is very advantagious and coſtly for price: It
hath its ebbings and its flowings, as all other
things have. I ſhall briefly give you the ſtory
of it: Good Land that is of the value of 20 <hi>l.</hi>
an Acre, being well husbanded, tilled, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or worſer Land being well manured,
and brought to perfect Tillage, will ſerve the
turn; but the better, the better for the work.
The ſeaſon is about Midſummer, when it is to
be ſet, that being the ſeaſon when they uſually
take up, or draw their Sets or Roots, and old
ſtore, when they may be had, and no time
elſe. The Land being brought into perfect
Tillage, the beſt way is to make a Tool like a
Ho in operation, but as broad as ſix of them,
and with that they draw their Land into ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
open as it were a Furrow about two or
three inches deep, and there place their Sets or
Roots of Saffron about two or three inches
aſunder (which Roots are to be bought by the
Strike, ſometimes dearer, and ſometimes cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and are very like to Onions, an Onion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an inch and a half over) and as ſoon as
they have made one Furrow all along their
Land from one end to another, then they, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that it is ſet, begin in another, and draw
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:45382:119"/>
that which they raiſe next to cover this, and
ſo they make their Trench, and cover the
other; they keep one depth as near as may be,
which Ranges or Furrows are not above three
or four inches diſtance, that ſo a Ho of two or
three inches diſtance may go betwixt them to
draw up the Weed, which being ſet and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
it may come up that Summer, but it
dies again; yet it lives all Winter, and grows
green like Chives or ſmall Leeks. And in the
beginning of Summer it dyeth wholly, as by
the blade of it is as to appearance; let one
come and take a Ho, and draw all over it, and
cleanſe it very well, and then will come up the
Flower without the Leaf. In <hi>September</hi> the
Flower of it appears like Crocus that is blew,
and in the middle of it come up two or three
Chives which grow upright together, and the
reſt of the Flower ſpreads broad, which Chives
is the very Saffron, which you may take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
your fingers and hold it, and caſt away
all the reſt of the Flower, and reſerve that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſo they pick it, and they muſt pick it
every morning early, or elſe it returns back
into the body of it, to the Earth again, until
the next morning, and ſo from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for a months ſpace it will bear Saffron.
You muſt get as many Pickers as may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it before it ſtrike in at the very nick in
the morning. It will grow to bear a Crop,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45382:119"/>
and then it muſt be taken up, and planted new
again, and then it will yield good ſtore of Sets
to ſpare, which cannot be had any other way.
It muſt be taken up at <hi>Midſummer,</hi> and then
ſet as aforeſaid. And when that you have got
your Saffron, then you muſt ſet it a drying, and
that you muſt do, make a Kilne of Clay, not
half ſo big as a Bee-hive, and very like it will
be made with a few little ſticks and Clay, and
ſerve excellently well for this ſervice. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fire of Charcoal will ſerve to dry it, but it
muſt be very carefully tended. Three pound
of wet Saffron will make one of dry. An
Acre of Land may bear fourteen or fifteen
pounds of Saffron, if very good: but if ſeven
or eight pounds, it will do the work, and one
Acre of it will be managed with no great
charge. I do not believe it can come to 4 <hi>l.</hi>
an Acre, it hath been ſold from 20 <hi>s.</hi> a pound
to 5 <hi>l.</hi> a pound. It is an excellent advantage,
and brings in at worſt a ſaving bargain, but it
may poſſibly be worth 30 or 40 <hi>l.</hi> an Acre;
but if it come to 7 or 8 <hi>l.</hi> it loſeth not. The
Saffron-Country is on one ſide and Nook of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſome part of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> at <hi>Saffron-Walden,</hi>
and betwixt that and <hi>Cambridge</hi>
hath very much of it in their Common-fields:
And truly theſe Lands are but of a middle
worth. I have ſeen as rich Lands again in
many Parts of <hi>England;</hi> but it is, as I believe,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:45382:120"/>
Loamy Ground, and of a little ſaddeſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
It will require to be laid dry and
ſound, and the Land it ſelf muſt be very ſound
and wholeſom.</p>

               <p>I Proceed to another National Commodity,
in the Plantation whereof we exceed all
other Nations, and that is Liquoriſh, our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Liquoriſh, as we call it, being far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Spaniſh Liquoriſh, or any other. The
planting of it few underſtand, and fewer pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.
That I may be open and full in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of it, I ſhall under two or three Heads
formalize what I intend to expreſs. 1. To
diſcover the beſt Land to bear it. 2. The
beſt way I can find practiſed to plant it. 3. The
profits and advantages of it. The beſt Land
to raiſe your Liquoriſh upon, is your richeſt
you can get or make, your warmeſt you can
find out, the ſoundeſt and the dryeſt that is
poſſibly to be had, of a very deep ſoil; you
muſt dig and prepare your Land before you
ſet, and it muſt be digged three Spades deep,
and two or three ſhovelings at the leaſt, laid as
hollow and as light as may be: You muſt
have it digg'd out of natural Land, if it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rich Land indeed, that it will feed an Ox
in a Summer; it is the beſt for eight pence a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:45382:120"/>
Rod at <hi>London,</hi> forty Rods make a Rood,
which is a quarter of an Acre, which comes to
about 4 or 5 <hi>l.</hi> an Acre, and this is the main
charge of all for three years, there is no more,
unleſs it be a little hoing, which rids off of the
hands very faſt; I believe it will not coſt above
20 <hi>s.</hi> an Acre more in all the three years, both
in ſetting, and all the dreſſings of it, beſides
the Sets and Land: the Sets being doubly tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
worth your money. Sets have been ſold
for 2 <hi>s.</hi> the hundred; but if your Land be
not freſh old Land, or extraordinary rich, and
as rich as your beſt Gardens are, it muſt be
made ſo with Soils and warm Manures. Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung
is excellent to be intrenched into the
Earth, it both warms and lightens it, and
makes it fit for this ſervice. About <hi>London</hi>
are very ſerviceable Lands for it, and ſo is any
dry Soil whatſoever, where it is rich enough
and deep; that which bears this well, will
alſo bear your Moulder Weed, that rich Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.
Having digged and prepared your
Land, you may proceed to the planting of it,
and therein you muſt endeavour to get the beſt
Sets you can, and from the beſt and largeſt
ſorts of Liquoriſh. The beſt Sets are your
Crown-ſets or heads got from the very top of
the Root a little ſhived down; be careful of
this, of very ſound Land; for how ſoon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you come to water, your Liquoriſh will
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45382:121"/>
check and run not one inch further: and having
procured your Sets, your Ground being caſt
into Beds of four foot broad, all along your
Plantation, from one end to another with a
long Line, you may lay down a Set at every
foot along the Line, which Line may have
knots and threds at every foot, if you will be
ſo exact, and then a man may come with a
Tool made a little flattiſh, or roundiſh, of the
bredth or bigneſs of a good Pickforks-tayl,
about half a yard long, with a Crutch at the
over-end, and ſharp at the nether, and that
thruſt into the ground, it being made of Wood
or Itch: but if flat, an Iron will do beſt, and
open the hole well, and put in the Set, and
cloſe a little Mould to it, and ſo you may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
an Acre very quickly in the ſetting of it,
and if it ſhould prove a very dry time, you
muſt water your Sets two or three days at the
firſt, until that you ſee that they have recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their withered waneneſs, and then the firſt
year you may plant your Garden with Onions,
Radiſhes, or any Sallet-herb, or any thing
that roots not downward; and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it would be better too, becauſe it will
prevent ſome weeding, and for the ſecond, it
muſt be hoed and kept from Weeds too, and
a little the third; but one thing be very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of, in the taking up, and ſudden ſetting
of thy Sets, as ſoon as took up, ſet again: but
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45382:121"/>
if you fetch from far, then as ſoon as taken up,
put a little Mould, and poſte them away by
Horſe-back, and get them into the ground as
ſoon as poſſibly; the delay of ſetting ſpoils
many thouſand Sets. The ſeaſons of planting
is in the months of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March:</hi> you
may the ſecond year take ſome Sets from your
own ſtock, but be very curious thereof: but
the third year you may take what you pleaſe,
and in the taking of the Liquoriſh up, the beſt
ſeaſons for which is <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi>
there will run from every Maſter-root a Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
which runs along the over-part of the
ground, which hath little Sprouts and Roots,
or Sciens, which will yield excellent Sets, if
they be cut three or four of them in every Set,
which may be about four or five inches long,
which is alſo to be planted, and is as good as
the Crown-ſet; alſo if it be any thing a moiſt
time, you may take ſlips from the leaf or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and ſet them, and then ſome of them
will grow; but they may be ſet betwixt the
other to thicken, leſt they ſhould fall. The
third Particular, is the profit and advantage
that may be made thereby, which is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable;
but it is alſo ſubject to the ebbings
and flowings of the Market. It muſt be taken
up in Winter, and muſt be ſold as ſoon as
taken up, leſt it loſe the weight, which it muſt

Cloth of ſo many ſorts, and fine Linnen, when
we have Hemp and Flax enough of our own?
I ſhall now proceed to a brief Deſcription of
the way of raiſing it. As for the Seed of it,
that is familiarly bought and ſold in all places
in the ſeaſon; but the beſt Seed is your bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
which you may try by rubbing of it in
your hand; if it crumble with rubbing, it is
bad; but if it ſtill retains its ſubſtance and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
it is good. The beſt Land for it, is that
which is ſandy, or a little gravelly, ſo it be very
rich, and of a deep ſoil: As for your cold
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:45382:122"/>
Clays, they are not fit for it, the very beſt
Land can be pickt for it is but good enough.
The quantity that is to be ſowed upon our
Statute Acre, is three Strikes or Buſhels, and
harrowed with ſmall Harrows, the which after
the Land is made exceeding fine, as the fineſt
Garden; then in the beginning or middle of
<hi>April,</hi> is the time they ſow it: ſome ſow it
not till the end of <hi>April:</hi> But if it be any thing
a kindly year, the earlier the better, and ſo
preſerved exceeding choicely at firſt, for fear
of Birds deſtroying of it, as you ſee in many
Countries. Be careful that Cattel never bite
it, nor lye upon it, for they will deſtroy it.
The ſeaſon of getting it, is firſt about <hi>Lammas,</hi>
when a great part of it will be ripe, it may be
about one half, that is, a lighter Summer-Hemp
that bears no ſeed, and the ſtalk grows
white and ripe, and moſt eaſily diſcernable,
which is about that ſeaſon to be pulled forth
and dryed, and laid up for uſe, or watered and
wrought up as all good Houſewives know,
which you muſt pull as neatly as you can from
amongſt all the reſt, leſt you break it; for
what you break, you utterly deſtroy, and then
you muſt let the other grow for ſeed until it
be ripe, which will be about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> or a
little before: when ſeed and ſtalk are both
full ripe, and you come to pull them, you bind
up in bundles as much as a yard-hand will
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:45382:123"/>
hold, which is the Legal meaſure; but for
your ſimple or Summer-Hemp, that is bound
in leſſer bundles, as much as may be graſped
in both your hands; and when your Winter-Hemp
is pulled, you may ſtock it up, or barn
it, any way to keep it dry, and then in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the year, thraſh it, and get out the ſeed,
but ſtill preſerve your Hemp till you ſet to the
working of it, which inſtead of breaking and
tawing of it, as they do in moſt parts, there
they altogether peel it, and no more, and ſo
ſell it in the rough: But I leave all at liberty
for that, whether you peel or dreſs it up by
Brake or Tewtaw. As for the Seed an Acre
will bear, is two or three Quarters, and it is
uſually ſold for about a Mark a Quarter,
ſometimes ten ſhillings. If good Hemp, then
ſtore of ſeed, elſe not; but in many and moſt
Parts of the Nation, it is ſold for about four
ſhillings a Buſhel: Your fimbled-Hemp is
not worth above half ſo much as the other;
ſometimes it is ſubject to Weeds, to Carlock,
and Muckle-weed, which muſt be weeded;
but the beſt way to deſtroy them, is to let your
Hemp-Land lye one year fallow: I only ſpeak
of <hi>Holland,</hi> the cheapeſt place for it, and the
firſt fountain of it: But generally throughout
the Nation, it is of far more worth and value.
The richer your Land is, the thinner; the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the thicker you muſt ſow. One Acre of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:45382:123"/>
good Hemp may be worth 5, 6, 7, or 8 <hi>l.</hi> an
Acre, and ſold as ſoon as pulled or gathered;
but if it be wrought up, it may come to 8, 9,
10, or 12 <hi>l.</hi> or more: it is a common thing in
uſe, every one knows the manner of working
it to Cloth.</p>

               <p>FLax, as I may call it, is a Root, or roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of advantage, upon the proſperity
whereof, thouſands of people in good, honeſt,
and laborious Callings, are maintained; for
the profit accruing thereof, i both general and
particular. For the Land capable of raiſing
good Flax, is any ſound Land, be it in what
Country ſoever it will, if the Land be good,
either earthy, or mixed of Sand or Gravel, and
old Land; it is beſt, that hath lain long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plowed,
it had need come up to the value of a
Mark, or near twenty ſhillings an Acre to ſow
Flax upon, within a mile of <hi>London;</hi> and yet
in moſt Counties of <hi>England,</hi> I know as good
and as kind Land for that Husbandry, as any
other, and at <hi>London</hi> they have Workmen
dearer too, and yet can raiſe (though they give
ſo dear) a very conſiderable profit. There is
excellent Flax about <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> 'tis
ſaid the beſt Thred in <hi>England</hi> is made of it;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45382:124"/>
one Acre of good Flax may maintain divers
perſons to the compleating of it to perfect
Cloth; conſider how many Trades are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
thereby. 1. The Flax-Land muſt have
the ſame Husbandry of plowing and ſowing,
as Lands have for Corn; there's the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
buſineſs, ſometimes, yea many times
weeding too, then pulling, ſtitching, and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then repelling, and laying up, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the ſeed, then watering is either on the
ground or in the water, then drying of it up,
howing of it, then breaking and towtawing of
it, then better helling and dreſſing it up, then
ſpinning of it to Yarn or Thred, then weaving
it, and bleaching, and then it returns again to
the good Houſwives uſe, or Sempſter, and then
to the weaving and uſage; and all theſe a dozen
good Callings. 2. For the carrying on of
this deſign, and making the beſt of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
I will here give you the beſt and
moſt profitable way of planting of it, that is
diſcovered. As for the Land, let it be good,
and well ploughed, both ſtraight and even,
without balks, and in due ſeaſon, about the
beginning of <hi>March,</hi> or latter end of <hi>February:</hi>
and as for the Seed, the true Eaſt Country-ſeed
is the beſt, although it coſt very dear, one
Buſhel of it to ſow, is worth ten Buſhels of our
own Country-ſeed; but the ſecond Crop of
our own, of this Country-ſeed, is very good,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:45382:124"/>
and the third indifferent, but then no more;
but again to your beſt Seed: the quantity of
it is about two Buſhels of it upon an Acre at
leaſt, ſome ſow a Peck more; but I conceive
two may be enough, but of our Seed it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
half a Strike more then of the Eaſt
Country-ſeed: Our Flax-men in former days
did not ſow above half ſo much, or little
more; but now Experience hath brought us
to this pitch. The ſeaſon of ſowing it, is a
warm ſeaſon, in the latter end of <hi>March;</hi> but
in the warmer parts, as <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
mid-<hi>March</hi> may do well; but in colder
parts, as down towards <hi>Warwick-ſhire</hi> and
<hi>Worceſter-ſhire,</hi> the beginning of <hi>April</hi> may be
early enough; and if there ſhould come a very
wet ſeaſon, you muſt take care of weeding it
alſo, that it grow not till it be over-ripe, leſt
the ſtalk ſhould blacken or mildew; yet to its
full ripeneſs you muſt let it grow, the which
you may perceive, both by the hurle, and by
the ſeed. Some will ripen earlier, and ſome
later; but againſt it be ripe, be ſure to have
your Pluckers to fall in hand with plucking of
it, and then tye up every handful, and ſet
them upright one againſt another, like a Tent,
till they be perfectly dry, then get it all into
the Barn. It is indifferent whether you rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it, or take off the boles of it, as ſoon as you
bring it home, or when you intend to uſe it.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:45382:125"/>
As for your watering of it, whether in the
Water or upon the Land, that I ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
determine; but thus much I ſay,
that both may do well, and he that gets ſtore,
will find uſe of both, becauſe of the one you
make uſe as ſoon as your Flax is pulled, and
then you need not ſtand ſo curiouſly upon the
drying of it; but after you have got your ſeed,
you may water it, and the watering of it opens
and breaks the hurle the beſt; but then you
muſt be careful of laying up your ſeed, that it
heat not, nor mould, and that which you wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then, get it forth upon your Graſs-land,
and ſpread it thin, and turn it to preſerve it
from mildewing, and keep it ſo until you find
the hurle be ready, and willing to part from
the Core, and then dry it up, and get it in for
uſe. And for the drying of it, a Kilne made
on purpoſe is beſt, ſo that you be careful of
ſcorching it, this will make a greater riddance
of the ſame, and to them that have great ſtore,
Sun-drying will never do the feat, though it
may do well for a ſmall quantity, or the Flax
of a private Family. As to the working of it,
you muſt provide your Brakes and Tewtaws
both, the one, that is, the Brake which bruiſes
and toughens, the Hurle and the Tewtaw that
cuts and divides out the Core; if you uſe the
Tewtaw firſt, it may cut your well-dryed Flax
to pieces; yet both do well, but uſe the Brake
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45382:125"/>
firſt. It will coſt the Workmanſhip of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
three or four pounds an Acre, to bring
it up to Sale: It lyeth much upon the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
hand, and therefore far more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
by how much the more it raiſeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
for ſo many people to live by. Where
Wages are great, it comes off the hardeſt; yet
where it is carried on to the purpoſe, people
ſtock hard that want Work, and becauſe of
conſtancy, will work on eaſie terms, or elſe
how could they poſſibly do good of it at
<hi>London,</hi> or near about it, where they work at
double Rates? but there I have ſeen the beſt
Flax I ever ſaw. Laſtly, the benefit that may
be made thereby, an Acre of good Flax may
be worth upon the ground, if it be the Eaſt-Country-ſeed,
ſeven or eight, yea, poſſibly ten
or twelve pounds, yea, far more, the charge
whereof, beſides the ſeed until it be ripe, may
not be above ten ſhillings an Acre, which if
you work up to be fit to ſell in the Market, it
may riſe up to 15 or 16, or near 20 <hi>l.</hi> in the
Market; but to bring it ſo high as 30 <hi>l.</hi> as in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> I dare not ſay. But an Acre of our
Country-ſeed, will hardly come up to above
three pounds or four, unleſs very good indeed,
to which if it amount unto, and no more upon
the Land, it will make a good advancement
of it, which it may be, Land, and Seed, and all
Charges, may come to about fifteen or ſixteen
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:45382:126"/>
pounds an Acre, the ſeed not being worth
above two ſhillings a Strike.</p>

               <p>THe planting of Coal-ſeed, or Rape-ſeed,
is another excellent good means for the
Improvement of Land: this Coal-ſeed hath
been of late days in good eſteem. And it is
moſt eſpecially uſeful upon your Marſh-land,
Fen-land, or upon your new recovered Sea-land,
or any Lands that are very rank and fat,
whether Arable or Paſture. The beſt ſeed is
the biggeſt, the faireſt ſeed you can get, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dry, and of a pure clear colour, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the beſt Onion-ſeed. It is to be had in
many Parts of this Nation; but <hi>Holland</hi> is the
Center of it, from thence uſually comes your
good ſeed. The ſeaſon of ſowing it, is about
<hi>Midſummer,</hi> you muſt have your Land plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
well, and laid even and fine, then you may
ſow it, about a Gallon of ſeed will ſow an
Acre, the which ſeed muſt be mingled, as afore
was directed about the Clover, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that you may ſow it even, and not upon
heaps. The even ſowing of it is very difficult;
it grows up exceedingly to great Leaves, but
the benefit is made out of the ſeed eſpecially.
You may ſow it either upon the Lay, Turfe,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:45382:126"/>
or Arable, and both may do well; but your
Arable muſt be very rich and fat, having made
your Ground fine and fit to ſow it. The time
to cut it, is when half the ſeed begins to look
brown, you muſt reap it as you do Wheat,
and lay it upon little Yelms, two or three
handfuls together till it be dry, and that very
dry too, about a fortnight will dry it, it muſt
not be turned or touched, if it be poſſible, for
fear of ſhedding the ſeed, that being the chief
profit of it: It muſt be gathered in ſheets, or
rather a great Ship ſail Cloth, as big as four
or ſix ſheets, and ſo carried into the Barn ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on purpoſe, or that place on purpoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to thraſh it that day; you may have
ſixteen or eighteen men at a Floor, four men
will thraſh abundance in a day. I have heard
that four men have thraſhed thirty Coume in a
day. The ſeed is uſually worth 16 <hi>s.</hi> a Coume,
that is, four ſhillings a Buſhel, ſometimes more,
and ſometimes leſs. It will, if exceeding
good, bear ten Coume upon one Acre, and
raiſe a good advance upon your Lands. It is
a Commodity will not want of Sale, the
greater the Parcel is, the better price you will
have. It is uſed to make the Rape-Oyl, as
we call it. The Turnep-ſeed will grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
it, and it will make good Oyl alſo,
you may ſell a thouſand pounds worth together
to one Chapman: It is beſt to be planted by
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:45382:127"/>
the Water, or near it. It cannot be too rank,
the Eadiſh and Stubble will exceedingly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Sheep in Winter. It hath another excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
property, it will fit the Land ſo for corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for Wheat it may produce a Crop as
good, or better then it ſelf, and for Barley
after it. The charge of the whole Crop, I
conceive may come to betwixt 20 or 30 <hi>s.</hi> an
Acre, and a good Crop may be worth 5, 6, 7,
or 8 <hi>l.</hi> an Acre; the leaſt is a very good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
becauſe it will do excellently well,
if well ordered, and a kind ſeaſon upon the

the eaſie charge of the raiſing of it, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:45382:127"/>
the hardneſs of the Land upon which it grows,
is of incomparable advantage. For firſt it
will grow upon very indifferent Land, not
worth above ten Groats or half a Crown <hi>per</hi>
Acre; yea, as ſome affirm, the verieſt hilly,
barren, chalky, light Land, not worth twelve
pence <hi>per</hi> Acre will carry it, and bear it to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good purpoſe; but unto ſo barren Lands,
I will not give encouragement, unleſs where
there is little or none better; but in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Land, ſo it be of a very dry, warm
nature, it will do very well. And ſecondly,
it will coſt but a little the managing, it requires
no tillage at all, no harrowing, it being to be
ſowed where you ſow your Barley or Oats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Husbandry, without any other addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
unleſs you draw a Buſh over it, or a
Roul, either of which is ſufficient to cover it
after you have ſowed it. The difficult piece
in the managing hereof, is the very ſowing of
it, that is, that it may be ſowed even; for the
ſeed being ſo very ſmall, will require both
skill and an even hand to ſcatter it: Some ſow
it by taking it with one finger and the thumb;
others with the two fore-fingers, but neither
of theſe do I affect as the beſt way, becauſe
they cannot ſpread ſo well as they may with
their whole hand: I therefore preſcribe a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Aſhes, Lime, fine Earth, or ſome
ſuch thing as will beſt ſuit with the weight of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:45382:128"/>
the ſeed; for could you find out that which
agreed both in weight and bigneſs, then out
of all queſtion, none like to that to ſow it
withal. A Gallon of this ſeed will ſow an
Acre, which had need to every quart of ſeed
to have two Gallons of ſome of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.
It muſt be often ſtirred together, leſt
that the ſeed ſink to the bottom, and ſow that
part thicker then the other, and then caſt it
out at Arms-end at as good an even a compaſs
as you poſſibly can. This ſeed thus ſowed,
may grow up amongſt the Corn, and yet be
no prejudice, becauſe it groweth not faſt the
firſt Summer; but after the Corn is cut, it
muſt be preſerved. And the next Summer
you ſhall receive through Gods Bleſſing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Crop: you muſt be exceedingly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in the ripening of it; if you let it grow
too long, your ſeed will fall out; if not long
enough, your ſeed will not be perfect, nor
your ſtalk neither, and therefore obſerve both
the turning of the ſeed, and the ripening of the
ſtalk; for I cannot tell you which of either
will admit of a diſpenſation, and as ſoon as
ever you perceive it to grow up to perfect ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
you muſt down with it, that is, pull it as
you do your Flax up by the Roots, and bind it
in little handfuls, and ſet it up to dry in little
filches or ſtitch, until both ſeed and ſtalk be
dry, and then carry it away carefully, as that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:45382:128"/>
ſeed be not loſt, lay it up dry, and ſo keep it
as you ſee cauſe for a good Market; for it is
to be ſold for the Dyers uſe, who ſometimes
will give a very good price, but at all times
ſufficient profit, and go far to buy it, from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhillings an Acre, to twelve pounds an
Acre, ſome ſay more; you may barn it up,
and keep it, and the ſeed together until
<hi>March,</hi> and then you may get out the ſeed by
laſhing and whipping of it forth upon a Board
or Door, which reſerve for ſeed: the ſeed is
ſometimes ten ſhillings a Buſhel, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more or leſs, as the Market riſes or falls,
it coloureth the bright yellow, and the Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-colour.
The Stalk and Root are both
uſeful, and muſt go together to the Dyer.
The charges of ſowing, and all things till you
come to pulling, is not above one ſhilling,
whipping and banning may come to four ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
more; the ſeed may be worth half a
Crown, ſo that all Charges and Rent of the

ſixfold; if worth ſix pound <hi>per</hi> Acre, eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,

Colours more: A Woaded colour is free
from ſtaining, excellent for holding its colour,
nay, ſad-holding colour muſt be woaded. It
hath been one of the greateſt Inrichments to
the Maſters thereof, until our late Wars, of
any Fruit the Land did bear. It is called
<hi>Glaſtum</hi> or Garden-Woad, by the Italians cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Guedo,</hi> in Spaniſh and in French <hi>Paſtel,</hi> in
Dutch <hi>Wert,</hi> and in Engliſh <hi>Woad</hi> or <hi>Wade.</hi>
It hath flat long Leaves like <hi>Reben Rubrum;</hi>
the ſtalk is ſmall and tender, the Leaves are of
a blewiſh green colour. The ſeed is like an
Aſh-key or ſeed, but not ſo long, little blackiſh
Tongues. The Root is white and ſimple. It
is a very choice ſeed to grow and thrive well;
it beareth a yellow Flower, and requires very
rich Land, and very ſound and warm, ſo that
very warm Earth, either a little gravelly, or
elſe ſandiſh will do exceeding well; but the
purer, warmer, ſolid Earth is beſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:45382:129"/>
rich Land, and though it ſhould be
mixed with a little Clay, it will do well, but
it muſt be very warm. There is not much
Land fit for this deſign in many Countries,
eſpecially your hardeſt Wood-land parts, you
have in many of your great, deep, rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
many Hills and Hills-ſides good Woad-Land,
when the bottom-ground will do no
ſervice; but your chiefeſt is your home Corſe,
or leſſer Ground lying near, and bordering
about the Towns. Your beſt and naturalleſt
Parts in <hi>England</hi> for Woad, are ſome Parts of
<hi>Worceſter-ſhire, Warwick-ſhire,</hi> Southward,
<hi>Oxford-ſhire, Gloceſter-ſhire, Northampton-ſhire,
Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> ſome Parts of <hi>Rutland, Redford-ſhire,</hi>
and <hi>Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> and ſome other
places here and there: All theſe Parts have
ſome admirable Woad-land in them. The
Land muſt be ſound, and at above twenty
ſhillings an Acre to graze in at leaſt, or elſe it
will not be worth the woading. And to plow
and ſow Woad, it may be worth as much
more as to graze, yea, ſometimes more, if it
be extraordinary rich Soil, and Trading good.
And whereas ſome write, that it undoeth the
Land, I anſwer as I judge in my own Breaſt,
that in regard it is ſo often cut, and groweth
ſo thick, and is ſo often weeding, that it muſt
needs do ſo, as I believe all Corn doth draw
out ſome of the Spirit thereof; but no more
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:45382:130"/>
then other Grain, if it could be ſo oft cut to
grow again. Thus much I can ſay of it, that it
prepares the Land exceedingly for Corn, and
doth abate of the ſtrength and ſuper-richneſs,
or rankneſs therof, which Corn would not well
endure; for I am ready to maintain, that the
richeſt Land is not beſt for Corn: For though
the one may overburden, and be ſo rank; yet
the other may bear as much to the Strike, and
for goodneſs your middle-land beareth the
Bell away for Corn, in my opinion. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with the uſe of Woad, I muſt do
theſe three things. 1. Shew you how the
Land muſt be prepared and ſowed. 2. Shew
you how it muſt be ordered, when that the
leaf muſt be cut, and how ordered after the
cutting of it. 3. And laſtly, how it muſt be
tempered and ſeaſoned to make the beſt Woad
for uſe and profit: But before I proceed, I
muſt inform you, that this Commodity is not
to be played withal, as you may do with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh
and Saffron, &amp;c. to make Experiments
of a little parcel, but a man muſt of neceſſity
ſet forth and forward ſo much ſtock, and land,
and ſeed, as may keep one Mill or two at work
to make it into perfect Woad. It is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a great quantity, and carrying on a
great ſtock that makes this work, and will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it on to profit and credit: Some have as
much under hand, as will work ſix or eight
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:45382:130"/>
Mills. The charge of it is exceeding great in
the management of it, and as well it payeth
for all charges, as any Commodity I know
of. The Ground muſt be of old Land, as
aforeſaid, and a tender Turſe, and muſt be
exceeding choicely plowed; if very hilly, they
muſt be caſt, and well caſt, that you caſt forth,
lye not high to raiſe the Furrow: they uſually
plow outward, or caſt all their Lands at the
firſt plowing, and having broke the Ground
with a Harrow, then they ſow it, and ſow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four Buſhels or Strikes of an Acre, which
done, then cover it, and harrow it very well
and fine, and pick out the Clots, Turfes, and
Stones, and lay it on the hollow places of the
Ridge in heaps, as is the uſual cuſtom: But
now I ſhould rather chuſe to take a little Cart
with one Horſe, and as the Boys and Children
pick them up, caſt them into the Cart, and
carry them into ſome flank and hollow place,
and lay them down to rot, or elſe mend ſome
barren place, becauſe they loſe a good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of Land, and ſo of Wood too, which
otherwiſe might be as good as the reſt, and is
now, by reaſon of the times, not worth ſo
much. The Land that is loſt is very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
in regard it is ſo good of it ſelf, and the
ſtock ſo good and rich that is ſowed upon it,
that all even Ground had need be regained,
that poſſibly may be. 2. I am to ſhew you
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45382:131"/>
how it is to be husbanded, and when the Leaf
muſt be cut, and how uſed, and how oft, &amp;c.
After the Land is ſowed, and that it begins to
come up, as ſoon as any Weed appears, it
muſt be weeded, yea, it may be twice weeded,
or more, if it requires before it be ready to cut;
but if it be ſpecial good, and come thick, and
cover the Ground well, it will ask the leſs
weeding: to them that are exerciſed in this
ſame Service, and have their Work and Work-folks
at command, they will have it weeded
for eight pence an Acre, and ſometimes leſs:
as ſoon as the Leaf is come to its full growth,
which will be ſometimes ſooner, ſometimes
later, as the year is dryer or moiſter, more
fruitful or leſs, which when you perceive at the
full ripeneſs, ſet to cutting of it off. As ſoon
as ever it is cut, your Mills being prepared,
and great broad Fleaks, ſo many as may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Crop prepared, and planted upon
Galleries or Stories made with Poles, Fir, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or other Wood; your Mill is uſually
known, a large Wheel both in height, and
bredth, and weight doth beſt, it is a double
Wheel, and the Tooth or Ribs that cut the
Wood, are placed from one ſide of the Wheel
to the other, very thick, wrought ſharp and
keen at the edge, and as ſoon as the Woad is
cut, and comes out of the field, it is to be put
into the Mill, and ground one Kilne full after
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:45382:131"/>
another as faſt as may be; the juyce of the
Leaf muſt be preſerved in it, and not loſt by
any means, and when it is ground, it is to be
made in balls round, about the bigneſs of a
Ball, without any compoſition at all, and then
preſently laid one by one upon the Fleaks to
dry, and as ſoon as dried, which will be ſooner
or later, as the ſeaſon is, they are to be taken
down, and laid together, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and more put in
their places: But becauſe all the circumſtances
will be too tedious to diſcourſe, and the work
is no common work, and very many not well
verſed therein, I will rather adviſe you to get
a Workman from the Woad-works, which
can carry it on artifically, rather then to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the experimenting of ſo great Work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Words and Rules. Good Woad may yield
in a plentiful year five, or poſſibly ſix Crops,
yea, ordinarily four, and yet ſometimes but
three: but the Winter Crop is of good worth,
excellent for Sheep, conceived good againſt
the Rot, and alſo it will maintain them well,
and it will contain them in good heart, and
ſtrengthen them till ſowing time again. The
time of ſowing is in the beginning and end of
<hi>March.</hi> And thus when you have cut all your
Crops one after another till Autumn, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
ſeaſon will not ripen it again, and your
Mill is at leiſure, then you muſt proceed to the
third Particular, which is to the ordering and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45382:132"/>
ſeaſoning of it, and working it up to uſe,
which muſt be done in the manner following:
You muſt ſet your Mills to work again, to
grind it all over, and then ſeaſon it up, and ſo
you may make it ſtronger or weaker, as you
ſhall ſee occaſion. There is ſo much difference
betwixt Woad and Woad, that the Dyers,
though ſo experimental, will hardly buy you
any parcel till they have experimented it in
colouring; and therefore for me to preſcribe
a Rule upon ſuch uncertainties, I hold it not
ſafe, the Woad-man that uſes to make up three
or four ſorts of Woad, will make it up as he
intends to friend a Cuſtomer. The firſt years
tryal will put you into ſufficient Experience:
As the Woad yields many Crops, ſo each Crop
is worſe then the other; the firſt Crop is beſt,
the ſecond next, the third much worſe, the
fourth far worſe then that, and the fifth worſt
of all; if you get a fifth, but that is not uſual,
four Crops is ſufficient, and ſometimes you
muſt be content with three, and as the firſt
Crop is uſually (in a good year) ripe by the
midſt of <hi>June,</hi> ſo will the ſecond be uſually
ripe in one month after that, and ſo every
month, or thereabouts, each Crop will be
ready, and if the latter end of the year prove
kind, then you muſt expect a Crop the more.
Now to know when the Woad is ripe, and to
take it in the very ſeaſon, is a fundamental
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:45382:132"/>
piece, which is when the Leaf is come to a full
growth, and retains its perfect colour and
lively greenneſs, then with all your might ſet
ſo many hands to cutting of it, as that it
do not fade, or wax pale or wan, before you
have cut your Crop; for then it will begin to
be over-ripe, and the leſs ſap and marrow of
it drinks in again, and will not yield ſtore of
juyce, which is the ſpirit of it, and beſt of the
Woad. The Woad-man ſeaſons the two
firſt Crops together, and ſome ſeaſon the
third by it ſelf, and the fourth by it ſelf,
ſome put the three firſt Crops together,
which makes the worſer Woad, but the very
Virgin-Woad is the firſt and ſecond, and
the better they deſire to make it, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
they compound it, not confounding it
with divers ſorts. The manner of ſeaſoning
is thus; after every Crop is cut, grinded, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and dryed, as dry as poſſibly it can be,
and laid up in the Ball every Crop by it ſelf,
then you muſt take the firſt and ſecond Crops,
and grind them all over again together, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
as you pleaſe, but they muſt be then
wrought as duſt, as it were, in the Mill, and
ground very well the firſt and ſecond Crop, or
ſo much as you will make of your beſt ſort of
Woad, and ſo laid upon the floor in a heat or
Couch, and then you muſt mix it with water,
and turn it over, and mix it again, and turn it
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:45382:133"/>
over, and give it ſo much water as that it will
be ſoakt throughly, however you may over-ſoak
and drown it, and that will be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to it: It muſt be turned in the Couch
once for three or four weeks together, and
then every other day once for about a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
and then twice a week, till it comes to a
right colour. At the firſt many men muſt be
imployed, carrying water as hard as they can,
till it be wet and well ſoaked, and that you
may know the better how to temper it aright,
you ſhall find it heat exceedingly in the Couch,
which you muſt look to keep in a moderate
condition, which over-heating you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
with turning, that it over-heat not by
any means; it may grow ſo hot, as you can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
abide your hand in it, but not to exceed
that heat: and how to know its ſeaſons kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſo will in time come to perfect rich
Woad; you muſt obſerve that it will alter
and change divers times: firſt it will hoar,
mould, and froſt, and ſmell exceeding ſtrong,
and then it will in a little time abate thereof,
and grow towards a black colour, and then it
will hoar and mould again, and change a little
whitiſh, and after this ſecond change, it will
come to a perfect black, which the brighter
and clearer colour, the better. This muſt be
the Winters work, and it will be good for
cold weather, and when it is thus wrought,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:45382:133"/>
and comes to its colour, then you may lay it
up, or heap it up, to lye for a Sale, putting
divers Poles into each heap to the bottom, to
open and keep it cool, and you muſt be ſure it
take not heat again; and thus all your ſorts of
Woad muſt be ſeaſoned one after another, and
eſpecially all ſuch that you can dry that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
but to tell you how to chuſe the beſt
Woad, is ſcarce in the power of the Woad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who can but gueſs at it from that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
he hath in the mixing of it; but it muſt
be tryed by the Dyers, who, as we ſaid, uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do ſo before they buy it. I ſhall end with
the advantages thereof, which are very great.
And firſt it is National, in that it ſets many
poor on work. It is the ſtaple and chief of
the Dyers Trade, layeth a foundation for all
enduring and holding Colours, and much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
Land in the Rent, it doubles or more,
and in the uſage of it upon this Husbandry,
trebleth or quadrupleth it, and many times
more: And then ſecondly, it is perſonally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious,
the beſt Eſtates that have been got
in all our rich upland Countries, have been got
by it: at ſome ſeaſons, and when they have a
right Crop and good Markets, it will amount
to as much more; it hath been ſold from 20
to 30 <hi>l.</hi> the beſt Woad, and back again down
to 6 <hi>l.</hi> a Tun.</p>

               <p>ANd ſo I deſcend to my third Dyers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
in relation to Dying or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring,
and that is to the ſtory of Madder, that
colours the rich and beſt ſolid red. It is now
very rarely planted in Gardens, and in ſome
ſmall Plots of Ground, and it amounts to the
very great advantage of the Planters that ſet
and ſell forth by the Roots they draw to vent
to the Apothecaries, and medicinably to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
they make a moſt exceeding value of
the Lands beyond all credence: ſome have
made, as I have been informed, after the Rate
of three hundred pounds an Acre in three
years, for ſo long as it grows before it come
unto perfection; and others that have ſold it by
whole Sale a parcel together at the worſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
to a hundred and ſixty pounds an
Acre, and ſome have out of ſmall Plots of
Gardens, made more then I have or will here
affirm; and however this being a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Fruit, and ſuch a one as that the plenty
thereof will not much abate the Market, or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Trade being ſupplyed herewith from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas, that the Erection of ſuch a
Plantation as may bring it forth wrought up
and fitted to the Dyers uſe, and ſo to be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to our ſelves within our ſelves. It would
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:45382:134"/>
be a good deſign to the Nation, as it imploys
ſo many hands to bring it to perfection. It
turns Land to as great an advantage as any
Seed or Root that is capable to receive it, and
needs no more fear want of Markets for the
venting of it, than we need for Wool that
Staple-Commodity of the Nation. I ſhall
proceed to the Deſcription of it. There is but
one kind of Madder which is manured and ſet
for uſe; but there are many things like there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
as Gooſe-graſs, ſoft Cliver, Ladies-Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,
Woodroof, and Croſswort: all which
are like to Madder-leaves, and are thought to
be wild kinds thereof. It hath long ſtalks or
trailing branches diſperſed upon the ground,
rough, and full of joynts, and every joynt ſet
with green and rough Leaves, in manner of a
Star; the flowers grow at the top of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
of a faint yellow colour, after which
comes the ſeed round and green: the Root
creepeth far abroad within the upper Cruſt of
the Earth, intangling one Root into another,
and when it is green and freſh, the Root is of a
reddiſh colour, it is ſmall and tender, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and runs into the ground, juſt like an
Ivy along a Houſe or Tree. It is a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of much value, Patentees ſtrove hard for
it, and Patents were gained about it in the late
Kings days. For the making out of a good
Plantation, I muſt obſerve theſe three things.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:45382:135"/>
1. Shew you what it comes of, how to plant
it and preſerve it. 2. How to get it and uſe
it, to bring it to ſaleable Madder. 3. The
benefit and advantage of it will be National
and Perſonal. Although it bear a ſeed, yet
that ſeed comes not to perfection, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be planted from the Sets that are to be
got from the Madder it ſelf, and they are to be
bought in many Gardens in <hi>London,</hi> who keep
up that Plantation for the advantage of ſelling
their Sets, and Roots Phyſically to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
only; all the skill is to diſtinguiſh of
the goodneſs thereof: And for the diſcovery
thereof, firſt know the ſeaſon of getting or
rather drawing them, which is in <hi>March</hi> and
<hi>April,</hi> yea, as ſoon as they are ſprung forth of
the ground two or three inches long, then you
muſt be careful to get Sets rooted; every Set
having ſome ſuckers, or ſpinies of Root going
out of them: they muſt be ſlipped from the
main Root, and theſe Sets as ſoon as ever took
up, put into ſome Basket with a little Mould,
and poſted to the place where they are to be
ſet, the ſooner, the better; and then your
Ground being very rich, it cannot be too rich
for this Commodity, however it muſt be of a
warm and a very deep Soil, and digged two
or three Spades graft depth, and two ſhovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
alſo, raked and laid even and level, and
then by ſtraight Lines trod out into long Beds
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:45382:135"/>
about one foot broad from one end of your
Work unto the other, and ſet about one foot
aſunder every way; and if it be a dry Spring,
they muſt be kept with watering, until they
recover their fading wane condition. You
may begin to dig your Ground in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and along all Winter, till the very day
of ſetting, and then you muſt keep it with
weed and hoing, until it have got the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Weeds, and then it being a Weed
it ſelf, will deſtroy all others. One Rod of
Ground is worth ſeven pence a Rod digging;
or if very dry ſtrong Ground, eight pence,
but ſix pence the beſt. You may ſow ſome
early Sallet-herbs, as Radiſh or Onions, of
ſuch things as will be ripe betimes, among it.
The firſt year good weeding is the beſt preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
unto it, and in your ſetting them by a
little Line, one goeth before, and layeth every
Set in his place, and another comes, and with
a broad Dibble made for the purpoſe, thruſts
down a deep and open hole, and puts in the
Set, and for the nouriſhing of it, in caſe any
dye, you muſt plant new in the room of it, for
the time of the growing of it, until that it
come to perfection, is three years: The firſt
year you may take off ſome few Sets here and
there, but that is ſomewhat dangerous; for
that year, it muſt be kept with hoing a while
alſo, then the ſecond year you may take up
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:45382:136"/>
Sets as faſt as you will, and almoſt as many as
you will, leaving but as you do in the crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of an Oak, the bough for the drawing up
of the ſap out of the Root, being ſo thick and
ſtrong in the ground, that nothing will almoſt
decay it. If then you can get it for the uſe of
the Drugſters and the Apothecaries, and the
Sets to plant again; in the taking up of every
Root, there will be one runner which hath
little buds on it, which may be divided and
cut into a fingers length, each planted with
one bud out of the ground ſet upright, which
makes very excellent good Sets, one Runner
will make many Sets; but theſe Sets cannot
be got up until the Madder be taken away:
And having thus preſerved it until it come to
a good Crop, having curiouſly dryed it as you
do your Hops, to a juſt and perfect gage of
drought. There is a Myſtery, that is, ſo pare
off the husks, that it may, if it be poſſible, as
the Wheat is ground, be flaked, or flayed, that
it may go all one way, which ſort they call the
Mull-Madder, is little worth, not above nine
or ten ſhillings a hundred; and then you muſt
take out the ſecond ſort, called the number O,
which is the middle Rind, and is not worth ſo
much as the third ſort called the Crop-Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by one ſixth part, and this Crop-Madder
is the very heart and pith of it inclining to
yellow; this is leſſer in quantity, but little,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:45382:136"/>
better in quality by far. Sometimes the beſt
Madder is worth 8 or 9 <hi>l.</hi> a hundred, and the
number O is worth 6 <hi>l. 6 s. 8 d.</hi> ſometimes it
is not worth above 4 or 5 <hi>l.</hi> a hundred. Some
Dyers uſe of this Commodity above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pound a week a man. Now as it is planted
in Gardens, unſpeakable advantages are made
thereby, and ſhould it hold a proportion when
it comes to be made up, and compleated to
the Dyers, it would prove the richeſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
that I know ſowed in <hi>England.</hi>

Heroick Exerciſe;

            <div type="chapter">
               <p>BEfore I enter into the unfolding of the
Parts of this Art, I do think it fit to
ſhew the Natural Inſtinct and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
that ought to be in every perfect Rider.
He muſt be a perſon void of fear; for the true
properties of his fortitude ſhould be to guide
his moſt noble Nature, through hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
things, to the attaining of the end of his
Heroick deſires, becauſe the perfection of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good undertaking conſiſteth in this, that it
be done by a ſtaid and conſtant reaſon without
raſhneſs. And becauſe every Rider is a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Creature, he therefore ought to be able
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:45382:137"/>
to yield a conſtant reaſon without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
as not ſubject to any prejudice of the
Inquirer, for that he only teacheth by reaſon
for what he doth, an inherent property pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to man; yet it cannot be truly ſaid, that
every reaſonable man is a perfect Rider, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every man hath not attained to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Art, and therefore unable to teach,
<hi>Num quod nemo didicit, nemo docere poteſt,</hi> for
no man can teach what he hath not learned.
And though it may be confeſſed, that every
good beginning cometh unto us by Nature;
yet the growth and progreſs thereof we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto by Precepts of Reaſon, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
by knowledge and practice: For
Nature without Knowledge is blind, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
without Nature falls ſhort, and Practice
without the former is imperfect.</p>
               <p>From hence it proceeds, that unleſs Nature,
Art, and Practice be conjoyned, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be a good Rider, to be able to know
how and when to help his Horſe, the only
principal things required in a Rider that is
inriched with Nature, Art, and Practice; and
yet if he be ſo qualified, and beſtow all his
labour and skill upon a Jade, let him aſſure
himſelf he ſhall <hi>Oleum &amp; operam perdere,</hi> but
loſe his labour. For although every Horſe be
a ſenſible Creature, moved by ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as things proper to his Nature, and taketh
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:45382:138"/>
his inſtruction by Speech, as man inſtructeth
man, which is either by incouragement, or
cheriſhing him when he doth well, or by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
him when he reſiſteth his Diſcipline;
yet nevertheleſs when a Jade begins to be
taught, and proceeds with a continual perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
therein, yet ſhall he never attain the
perfection of Action, becauſe all Art muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Nature of the Horſe, which to content
and pleaſe, is the end of the whole Art: but
where contrary Natures are, there of neceſſity
muſt be contrary workings, and then muſt
needs enſue contrary effects; for every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
worketh according to its Nature. For
amendment whereof, the ignorant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Rider proceedeth to violence, which
the Nature of the Horſe abhorreth, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation;
for then his Riding becometh grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and painful, ſo that he knoweth not what
to do, no more then an untowardly Scholar
by whipping to ſay his Leſſon delightfully;
and were it granted, that the Horſe were of a
good diſpoſition to yield all obedience to the
moſt skilful Rider, yet ſhall he never attain to
any perfection of Action, becauſe Nature hath
not ſhaped nor given him aptneſs fit for ſuch
a purpoſe, no more then a natural Fool by
Education can attain unto true Wiſdom. And
yet very few Riders neither have nor do truly
judge hereof; for that nothing is more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:45382:138"/>
in all their Writings and Actions, then
proviſion and means to make perfect that
which is moſt imperfect by Nature, as though
they had never learned that Art can never
overcome the neceſſity of Nature: wherefore
I deſire all ſuch as wiſh and deſire to be good
Riders, firſt to examine their own natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
Secondly, to learn to know the
true and perfect ſhape of Horſes. Thirdly, the
natural Cauſes of their goodneſs and badneſs.
Fourthly, to be taught by an underſtanding
Maſter, and not to begin without his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Fifthly, to practiſe, and always to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the reaſon of his Practice, then ſhall he
ſee what a Hand-maid all Art is to Nature;
then ſhall he diſcern in the beholding of the
actions of the perfect ſhaped Horſe to be eaſie,
quick, and ready according to his perfection
of Nature, as true qualities bred and brought
forth by Nature, not by correction, but with
all mildneſs and gentleneſs voluntarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
the which all true and natural Riders
will and ought altogether to cheriſh, ſeeing all
Horſes do in that beautiful form, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
doth expreſs, when he deſires to appear
moſt comely and juſt in his Pace, juſt in his
Trot, juſt in his Gallop, juſt in his Carriere,
juſt in his Head, juſt when he ſtandeth ſtill,
juſt in union with the will of the Rider, his
Head and Neck will be ſo juſtly and rightly
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:45382:139"/>
placed, of ſuch ſtaidneſs, and his Mouth of
ſuch a ſweet and perfect compoſure, as it ſeems
as if Nature ſtrove to ſet forth her own glory:
All which ſome call Natural, and not ſo much
Accidental in a perfect and a true ſhaped
Horſe.</p>
               <p>It remaineth now to diſcourſe of thoſe things
which moſt principally are required by the Art
for the true performance of ſuch Actions, as
Art requireth either for helps, corrections, or
cheriſhings, for reducing the Horſe to perfect
Action, fit for the moſt gentile uſe of man.</p>
               <p>For he that knoweth how to correct and
cheriſh a Horſe in his due time, is, and ſo
ought to be accounted, the moſt grounded in
this Art, the which cannot in a ſmall time ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be attained or performed; and therefore
for the true attaining thereof, I wiſh that none
undertake the ſame, as I ſaid before, but by
the direction of an expert Maſter, leſt it be ſaid
to him, as <hi>Timotheus</hi> the beſt Player on the
Flute of his time, who when that he took a
Scholar, uſed to demand of him, Whether he
had made an entrance into that Play; which
if he had, he took a greater reward by half,
then he did of them that knew nothing, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That his pains were greater to take from
him what was unskilfully taught him, then in
teaching that which was good to ſuch as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
nothing at all thereof. The things
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:45382:139"/>
that are principally to be uſed for helps, are,
as hath been ſaid, corrections and cheriſhings,
which may be contained in theſe three Heads,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Voice, the Hand, and the Leg; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Voice by words of Art helpeth, and
with mild, meek, and gentle words cheriſheth,
but by loud and taunting terrifieth and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth.
The Hand (being the Inſtrument of
Inſtruments) upon the true uſe whereof the
ground of the Art reſteth, by the temperate
and ſweet ſtay thereof, it helpeth: by claw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or gentle putting the Horſe, it cheriſheth,
and by correcting or ſtriking, frighteth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the Hand by the ſtroke, jerk or ſound of
a Rod or Wand, is ſometimes very uſeful, it
often helpeth by practiſing mildly and gently
with it, clawing and ſcratching the Horſe, it
incourageth and cheriſheth him; but by
ſtriking him too hard, correcteth to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.
Again, the hand with a Bridle in
ſlacking it, eaſeth and cheriſheth him, and by
drawing it hard, oppreſſeth and correcteth
him, by the guiding thereof, it governeth a
Horſe, as a Stern doth a Ship, which in all
motions and actions anſwereth to that motion
which the hand moveth. The Leg, when it
gently provoketh with the Calf, helpeth; the
Spur alſo by gentle means helpeth, and when
there is a juſt occaſion by hard ſtrokes corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:45382:140"/>
ſo as to bring a Horſe to true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and perfection of action, he is to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
helped, and cheriſhed; he is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
or helped, to the end he ſhould not erre,
therein is great knowledge required: he is
chearfully to be cheriſhed for his well doing,
to accompliſh which knowledge, Reaſon and
Experience are required, whereby appeareth
how every good Rider ought to be qualified;
of which, namely, the Voice, the Hand, and
the Leg. Before I come to ſpeak of Action,
wherein the true underſtanding hereof is moſt
proper, I do propoſe to give a little further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and firſt of the Voice. When you
mind to help your Horſe therewith, it muſt be
with a moſt mild and chearful one, as to ſay,
Hey, Hey, Hola, Hola, ſo Boyſo, Hup, Hup,
enough, enough, no more; and many ſuch
like: but a correction is clean contrary, which
is with a terrible thundering Voice, as Villain,
Traitor, and many ſuch like, whereas we in
cheriſhing, the moſt mild and ſweet Voice is
uſed, as my good Boy, ſo my good Boy, with
an inclination of bending your body to him,
and ſuch like incouragements; ſo as alſo the
ſound of the Voice is to be uſed, as well as a
Voice pronounced, by giving a Chirk with
the Tongue, which may be called Clacking,
in pronouncing whereof, the tip of the Tongue
ſtriketh the roof of the mouth, as it doth in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:45382:140"/>
making the ſuppoſed ſound drawing near the
Greek word <hi>Clognus,</hi> and ſo alſo there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſound of the Voice to be uſed, as Hay,
Hay. The next is the Hand, which, as I ſaid,
is the Inſtrument of Inſtruments, in the true uſe
and government whereof, is the ground of the
whole Art; and as for the Bridle and the
Rod, they are but dead and ſenſeleſs Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
without all uſe, when they are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the right uſe, of the temperate and
ſteddy hand bearing up a firm moderate ſtay,
neither too much ſlacking, nor too much
drawing in; every good Horſe cauſeth a true
and a juſt rain, a juſt bearing, a juſt ſtaidneſs,
with a light and ſweet mouth in all actions:
ſo as whatſoever the Horſe doth, is both eaſie,
ready, and perfect, and being done with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
muſt of neceſſity be beſt done, becauſe
it beſt pleaſeth both Man and Horſe, neither of
them being moved to any perturbation, grief,
or pain: And as for the Rod and Wand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inſtruments only for the hand, how and
when they are to be handled, offered, uſed, or
not uſed. And for the Bridle which the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
properly call <hi>Il Manico del Timone,</hi> the
handle of the Stern: we ſhall for the preſent
paſs them by.</p>
               <p>The third thing is the Leg, wherein the uſe
of the Calves of the Legs, the Heels, the Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup,
and the Spur are to be handled. I ſhall,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:45382:141"/>
to avoid repetition and all manner of tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
refer them alſo to their proper place. And
I ſhall for the preſent divide this our immediate
Concernment into certain preſcript general
Grounds or Rules, to follow which, the Rider
ſhall find of daily uſe in teaching the whole
Art to his Scholars and Horſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when the expert Rider beginneth to
teach a young Scholar, let him follow the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the diſcreet Schoolmaſter, that teacheth
Children to write, who inviteth them with
his gentle uſage to the Pen, Paper, and Ink,
and in a moſt mild and civil manner, teacheth
them how to uſe their arms and hands,
and how to hold their Pens; and then how to
make the firſt Letter, the which when the
Scholars attempt, though it be very bad; yet
in reſpect of the infancy of their knowledge,
and willing minds to do better, they are not
only commended, but rewarded for doing ſo;
the Scholars being thus encouraged, deſire to
go on to be taught to make many Letters, and
then after in a gentle and ſlow manner, he
teacheth them perfectly how to joyn their
Letters. Even ſo ſhould your Scholars be
taught in Riding, and young Horſes in their
beginning to be taught, whereby all their
actions might bring delight and admiration to
their Beholders. For mild teaching, ſlow,
teaching not too much; for a Horſe may be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:45382:141"/>
wearied with too long teaching at one time,
but giving him often breath, high keeping in
courage, often rewarding, cheriſhing, great
familiarity, no change of the Rider till he be
perfect, no change of Bit, no rough Bit, no
cutting or galling of his Noſe or Mouth, but
gentle feeling, no beating or whipping, no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
no paſſion, but with all manner of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
delight, maketh the Horſes actions more
then wonderful, becauſe Nature hath a natural
love to it ſelf, and an innate hatred to all
things that are enemies to the ſame, which is
plainly teſtified by that natural Sympathy and
Antipathy, which may be obſerved in all
Creatures, as the Lamb which never had Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the Wolves cruelty; yet at the firſt
ſight of him, doth tremble and flye for fear.</p>

               <p>SEcondly, that the Rider never doth correct
his Horſe, but when gentle means and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
will not prevail; for no doubt but that
he will willingly yield by gentle means, if it
be ſenſible to him, what, how, and when to
do: but that Horſe that will not be moved by
gentle means, let the Rider aſſure himſelf he
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:45382:142"/>

who, as he was the wiſeſt man that ever was,
or ſhall be, ſo did he keep more Horſes then
any King, that Hiſtory mentioneth, who ſaith,
That an untamed Horſe becometh fierce: but
if he offend, in the inſtant time that he erreth,
correct him; wherein how many do offend,
all mens Eyes are witneſſes, beholding the
common Horſe-breakers and ignorant Riders
to miniſter horrible and moſt violent Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
when the Beholder cannot ſo much as
ſee a cauſe, nor himſelf expreſs a reaſon, but
errour evermore taketh that for truth which is
falſe: So as it plainly appeareth, that when

been truly taught, <hi>Solomon</hi> would have him in
that inſtant time puniſhed for that errour, but

and fit for the Rider to teach, put on a
Head-ſtall or a Canetſane over his Noſe, with
a pair of ſtrong Rains, but ſo looſe and eaſie
for his Noſe, as may neither hurt nor abate of

in a moſt gentle manner ſet a Saddle upon

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:45382:143"/>
leaving the near Stirrup-leather almoſt
half a hole longer, than the right Stirrup; and
although that the Horſe be gentle, yet becauſe
he hath a new Maſter and Rider not known
unto him, being neither aſſured of himſelf,
nor of that his Rider would have him do, ſo
as that it may be truly ſaid, that he is not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
but that he is troubled in mind: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to keep him from fear and perturbation, I
would have a quiet and ſtaid Horſe alſo ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
to be rid before him, and then bring
them both to the Block; but the old Horſe
firſt, and then the Colt, at which time let the
Rider uſe all the mild and gentle words to the
young Horſe, making the Rains of the Bridle
even and juſt, holding them in his left hand
not ſtiff, nor altogether remiſs or looſe; and
as ſoon as he is mounted on his Back, let him
ſet quietly there a while, leſt any ſudden mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould breed any perturbation in the
Horſe, and until the Rider have ſetled himſelf
in the Saddle, his Noſe directly anſwering the
Horſes fore-top, betwixt his Ears, his Legs
hanging ſtraight down, neither thruſting down
the Toe, nor lifting up the Heel, but with his
foot with ſuch evenneſs in the Stirrup, as if he
ſtood upon the ground, the Stirrup-leathers ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhort then long, winding his Toes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
nearer to the Horſes ſide, then the Heel,
holding the Rains even and juſt with his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:45382:144"/>
Creſt, even with the point of the Withers, a
little above the Main, with his Thighs and
Knees cloſe to the Saddle, and his feet reſting
in the Stirrup in due place, not too far thruſt
into the Stirrup, with an upright and ſtraight
body, his Ridge-bone anſwering the Ridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
of the Horſe, ſo as the Horſe and Rider
may ever ſeem to be of one body in all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
during which time, let the Rider claw
the Horſe with his hand, to remove from him
all fear or hard conceit of his Riding: that
done, let him go forward to paces fair and
ſoftly, and ſtay again, making much of him,
and ſo pace ſoftly and quietly to the place
where the Rider intendeth to tread out a
Ring; all which muſt be done by the Rider
boldly and without fear, and as he muſt be
thus uſed in going forward, ſo muſt he be uſed
in treading and pacing out of the Ring in ſome
new-plowed Ground, that is moſt deep of
Mould, where firſt let the old Horſe enter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two Furrows, ſo far as the Rider may
have ſpace enough and Mould enough, and
follow with the young Horſe cloſe to him,
which will cauſe him the more willingly to
go, becauſe he is directed and guided by the
old Horſe, by which means he ſhall not be any
way diſcouraged: then let the old Horſe (the
young Horſe following) enter on the right
hand, overthwart the Furrows, and tread out
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:45382:144"/>
twice together a round Ring, containing in
circuit about 30 paces, and being come about
the ſecond time where he began, let him tread
out the like Ring on the left hand, and after he
hath gone twice about, let him begin again on
the left hand, and ſo continue until he have
gone four times together about the left Ring,
and the right ſix times; that done, let him go
fair and ſoftly out of the Furrow where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
about 30 or 40 paces, and there ſtand
ſtill, keeping his head and his body right in
the path, remembring always to have ſome go
by, to ſignifie his true performance, and to
help, if need be; and then let him go very
gently back from the place he came, and there
let the Rider alight, and make much of him,
by coying him, and giving him a little Graſs,
Hay, or Bread in his mouth, to procure and
win Love: and thus let him be uſed two days
with a Horſe before him, and after him. Let
him then lead and begin himſelf, to tread and
pace the Ring in this gentle manner, for the
ſpace of ten days, keeping a temperate, ſtaid,
and fine hand upon the Rains, with a ſweet
feeling ſtay, carrying his Forehead as Rams
do when they go to fight, whereby he ſhall not
only rein well, but bear his head ſtaid and
light; and when that he knoweth what to do,
and that for the ſame he is always cheriſhed,
he will ſtrive to do it faſter: Through the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:45382:145"/>
Riders continual keeping of his hand ſteddy,
the Horſe will do it with a wonderful pride
and delight, by giving him liberty; but a too
haſty treating of the Horſe, will work the clean
contrary.</p>
               <p>In the pacing of the Ring, the Rider muſt
not carry any over-hard hand, to dull the
ſenſe; but ſo temperately, that the feeling
may be always freſh, otherwiſe by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
by much galling his Noſe, whereof he
would willingly have eaſe; to avoid the ſame,
he will ſet his Head and his Neck awry, the
true uſe whereof is that ſtanding in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
juſt and ſtraight with his body, the Rider
moves him gently to go forwards, and in the
very motion, turns him on the right hand, by
drawing very ſoftly the right Rain ſhorter
with his right hand, lower under the Pommel
of the Saddle, whereunto if he yield (as no
doubt but he will) eſpecially having trod the
ſame before, let the Rider preſently make
much of him, neither drawing nor ſlacking the
Rain: at which time, for his doing both for
the eaſe of the Rider and the Horſe, if need
ſhall be, let ſome skilful perſon (but his Keeper
were moſt fit) come on his right ſide to his
fore-ſhoulder, and thruſt him in by little and
little, and the Rider alſo by the Calf of the
right Leg, and the Clack of his Tongue to be a
help to make him go forward, if the Horſe be
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:45382:145"/>
ſuch a one as I have deſcribed, he will do it;
but if he ſhould not in the very motion of the
turn, then let the Rider draw the Rain with
his hand, as before, whether it be on the right
hand or on the left: all which muſt (as hath
been ſaid) be done by gentle dealing, ſo as
that the Horſe may hope for reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
whereby he will be ready to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
his Rider will: But if he be a rammage
Jade (as I ſaid before) and of an evil diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Nature, for my own part I eſteem him
not of any worth, not fit to be kept. Having
ſpoken of Pacing of the Horſe in the Ring, it
followeth, that after the ten days are expired,
the Horſe be taught to trot the Ring, which
he muſt begin in a ſlow and gentle Trot, as he
was in the firſt beginning of pacing, increaſe
his Ring-turns by two and two every day,
until he make ten turns for the left Ring, and
twelve for the right, which will augment his
ſwiftneſs, whereof he ſhould be reſtrained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he be moſt perfect, and then he will do it
with the greateſt grace and pride that may be
imagined, which is the true property and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of all Art, evermore to affect and effect to
perfection; during which time of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Trotting, he muſt not be ridden with
a Wand, nor wear any Bit, until he be moſt
perfect in his Trot, ſtop and turn well on both
hands, and not by any means ſuffered to gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:45382:146"/>
until that he can alſo perfectly advance.
By taking this courſe he will be juſt in his pace,
juſt in his trot, with a ſtaid hand and neck, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chief luſtre and goodneſs that Nature
and Art affordeth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when you begin to trot the
Ring, be ſure that at the firſt he be moved
thereunto, as gently and quietly as you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
and ſo every action whatſoever, upon a
reſtrained, temperate, and firm hand, with a
ſweet Stay, and with a true Rain, that is, that
his Noſe be juſt under his Forehead, neither
too much out, nor too much in, which is the
juſt placing and ſetling of his head, which will
make him to have a pleaſant mouth, when he
cometh to wear the Bit, in which conſiſteth
the chief point of Horſemanſhip, becauſe he is
ſo to be maintained in all his actions, the
which is moſt eaſie to be done, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
if the Horſe be of perfect ſhape and
ſpirit; but if he ſhould make reſiſtance, for
that he is either rammage or evil broken, then
trot him ſwiftly with quickneſs of Voice, Rod,
and Spur; for the time of his trotting is the
fitteſt time to make him forget his toys, and to
attend his way; and if all this will not help,
then ſpare not to gallop him; and if this fails,
then be ſure he will be a Jade from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the end; for a Horſe of a good temper
and perfect ſhape, can never be of ſo bad a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:45382:146"/>
I ſhall now next diſcourſe, how to make the
Rider perfect in ſtop, after he hath ended the
number of his Ring-turns, which is to trot his
Horſe right out in the middle Furrow betwixt
the Rings, until that he come to the place of
ſtop, and there to make a pretty ſtay, keeping
his body right in the path, wherein if his whole
body or any part ſtand overthwart, ſeek not at
firſt through your too much paſſion to correct
him for the ſame; but let a Foot-man direct
him to ſtand right in the path, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by thruſting in that part that ſtandeth
out of order, or that he may cauſe the Horſe to
go further in the ſame path, and ſtop him,
holding that Rain ſtraighter on that ſide,
whereon he moſt forceth his head, then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the other, which will inforce him to
keep right; which when he yieldeth, ever che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
him, and after it will be good to trot and
ſtop him on a ground that is a little ſteepy,
which ſomething falleth, and immediately
riſeth: but when he is perfect, then he may
do it on a ground that is very ſteep: But to
teach him to go back, the Rider muſt (as I
have ſaid) keep a firm ſtaid hand upon him
with ſome liberty, and then gently ſtriking
him on the Neck with his Rod, in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of time ſay, Back, Back: but if he refuſe,
let a Foot-man with his Rod gently ſtrike him
on the knees, and ſo by the gentle pulling in of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:45382:147"/>
his hand, and fair means, win him, and when
he yieldeth, cheriſh him.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed how to ride a Horſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Wand, Bit, or Spur, I will now ſhew
the Rider how to manage all three, together
with the true uſe of the hand upon the Bit, one
of the chief and only principal points of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.
Firſt therefore, when he rides with
a Wand, let him take it very warily, that the
Horſe be not frighted therewith, and to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Horſe thereof, preſently after he hath
received it, toy and ſcratch him about the neck
with the end thereof, and for the carrying of
it, it muſt be carried in the right hand, with
the point upright, and when that he muſt uſe
it, let the point fall cloſe unto him, as occaſion
ſhall require; but in his management of it, let
him lay his hand upon his right Thigh, and
and his hand croſs the Horſes Neck, and when
he is almoſt ready to turn on the left hand, let
him lift up his hand and Rod, and hold the
point right forth on the right ſide againſt his
Eye, and as he changeth turns, ſo let him
change his Rod on the one ſide and on the
other: but if his Horſe will not turn on the
ſide he would have him, let him ſtrike him on
the contrary ſide; and when he is any way
diſordered, let him carry his Wand on the
contrary ſide; and when he would have him
carry his fore-part right, ſtrike him gently on
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:45382:147"/>
the ſhoulder or fore-legs, and when he would
have him lighten behind, ſtrike him on the
Rump and Hanches: and thus much for the
uſe of the Wand, as occaſion ſhall ſerve.</p>
               <p>Now for the uſe of the Bit, which is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
only guided and directed by the
hand, and becauſe the ground of the Art of
Riding dependeth only upon the right uſe and
true government of the hand, being guided by
reaſon and diſcourſe, ſo as the Horſe in all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and actions, is, and ought to anſwer to
that motion.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, let the Bit that he firſt bit
his Horſe withal, be gentle and pleaſant; yet
ſo that the gentleneſs cauſe him not to deſpiſe
the Rider, nor the hardneſs drive him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair;
for you muſt underſtand, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
always preſuppoſeth reaſon, and reaſon
ſenſe, and ſenſe reaſon: all which conſiſt in a
true mediocrity, and therefore amongſt the
moſt learned Precepts that were written in the
Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in Greek, this was in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, Nothing too much.</p>
               <p>For if he preſs him with the Bridle, if he
carry his head well, yet muſt he preſently eaſe
his Bridle-hand, and make much of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſheweth himſelf obedient to him; and
whenſoever he doth any thing well, and with
delight, the Rider muſt be very careful not to
vex him, but ever ſo to win him, that he may
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:45382:148"/>
be willing to pleaſe him. So likewiſe when he
bears a firm hand with a ſtay, that thereby the
Horſe doth bring in his head, and yield to his
hand; yet he muſt ſhorten the Rains of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
till his head be ſetled in its due place, that
is, as hath been ſaid, neither to carry his head
too much out, nor too much in, &amp; ſtill to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him in the form of his doing; yet that it
exceed not mediocrity or temperature, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
light on the head with a ſweet mouth.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewed the Rider, that it muſt
be done by keeping this order, I proceed: Let
him ſtay his Horſe temperately with an even
hand, as his reſiſtance ſhall require, without
giving any other liberty, then with his Rod to
ſtrike him gently upon the bowing of his
Neck, provoking him mildly with the Spur on
that ſide on which he moſt wryeth his But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock,
to the end that he may go juſt, until he
draw back one of his fore-feet, which if he
do, make much of him, and then ſtay a while,
and do the like, drawing away the Bridle;
for the former cheriſhing will make him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
and then will he go lightly back
with both the fore-legs, when he is touched
on the Neck with the Rod, ſaying with a loud
Voice, Back: at which Voice, with the feeling
of the Rod, and drawing of the Bridle, he
will go back to the Riders deſire; and always
after when he is out of the due and true way
upon the Bridle, let him do the like, that is, to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:45382:148"/>
go back in form aforeſaid. And although
ſome diſorder be committed, let not the Rider
deſpair; for he ſhall find him eaſily won to a
good mouth, by this uſe of a temperate and a
firm hand, which is the mediocrity of ſlacking
and drawing, which is properly named a ſweet
Stay, which the Italians call <hi>Dolce Appoggio,</hi>
making him light upon the hand, champing
the Bit with great pleaſure, and a ſtaid head in
due place, the true tokens whereof are juſt
Rains: ſtaid, and a light Come-head with
pleaſure on the Bit, being properties inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in every perfect ſhaped Horſes actions: But
becauſe it may ſeem very difficult to have a
continuance of perfection in any action, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is common upon ſtop, or ſtanding
ſtill, to be in order; yet perhaps upon motion
he will leave playing upon the Bit, and bear
up the head, eſpecially upon the main Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere,
which proceeds from a want of true
knowledge, how to maintain and continue the
hand juſt and firm with a ſweet ſtay, ſo that
he may take pleaſure on the Bit; and therefore
how to maintain a Horſe both in furious and
quiet doings, is to be conſidered of. If then
that at any time he make any diſorder, note it
diligently, then ſtay him, and make him go
backward, as you did before; for in going
back, he will bring himſelf to his right order
again, then preſently make much of him, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:45382:149"/>
forthwith move him forwards; ſo muſt he be
uſed in treading of the Ring, firſt gently upon
the Pace, upon the Trot, and upon the Gallop,
in practiſing whereof, he muſt preciſely obſerve
that it be done with a temperate, ſtaid, and
firm hand, otherwiſe he will gape, thruſt his
Tongue upon his Bit, or over the Bit, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himſelf, thruſt his head out ſuddenly,
pluck in diſdainfully, or elſe ſhaking or moving
of his head one way or other, to be freed from
the preſſing of the intemperate hand, which is
to him violence, and contrary to Nature, the
which Art ſhould evermore labour to pleaſe.
The true form and practice of drawing the
Bridle, is alſo to be learned, which is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mounted in the Saddle, let the Rains be
drawn equal; and if the Horſe know not the
Bit, then let the Bit be very ſlack, and let the
R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der hold the Rains in his left hand, with
the little finger and Ring finger between, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Pommel of the Saddle, as near the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as he can ſcarcely perceive, the which he
muſt not remove until he feel the Horſe to ſtay
upon the Bit, and there hold him without
ſtaying or further drawing, until he perceive
whether the head ſtand in the true form;
which if it be not, then let him a little yield
his left hand again, and ſtanding ſo a pretty
while, bring his left hand to his former place
again, where the Horſe made his firſt ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:45382:149"/>
the Bit; then let him draw his Rains with
his right hand ſomewhat more through the
left hand, as before, but ſo little and gently,
as ſcarcely to be perceived; for ſo muſt all the
motions of the hand be, and then keep it ſtaid
and firm a pretty while; and if he yield,
though very little, let him keep his hand ſtill at
one ſtay, neither ſlackning nor drawing it,
whereby he will feel the eaſe that he hath got
by yielding of it, and then preſently make
much of him. But if it ſo happen that the
Rains fall ſlack, let him not remove his left
hand, as before; for they muſt not be ſlack
until they ſtay again upon his right hand,
whereunto whenſoever he yieldeth, make
much of him, continuing ſtill in this ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to ſollicite him, till his head be in its due
place: after which time, if he bear not light,
let his Rider ſtrike him gently upon his Knees
of his fore-legs, to make him to go back,
whereby he will bring in his head, and then
will the Bit move, and his hand find eaſe; but
let him be very careful at that inſtant, to keep
his hand ſo firm, as that he neither ſlack nor
draw in, to the end that he may feel and retain
the eaſe of his own motion of yielding, which
willingly he will not loſe, it being delightful
to his Nature, but take ſome pleaſure to ſtir the
Bit in his Mouth, and go backward withal
with it, which when the Rider finds out being
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:45382:150"/>
won, with obſervation of good order, he may
be brought to a more continual perfection.
Thus I have ſhewed the Rider ſo much of the
Art as may help him: but if the Nature of the
Horſe be oppoſite and repugnant, as in the
greateſt number of Horſes, it is, as I have ſaid
before, to no purpoſe; however for a time he
may ſeem to be taught, yet queſtionleſs it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be of any continuance.</p>
               <p>1. Therefore let the Rider obſerve, that
when he is teaching of his Horſe herein, or any
other Leſſon, that he do not trouble him with
any other thing at that time.</p>
               <p>2. That he do not ſuffer any one to ride
him, until he be perfected by himſelf in ſuch
Leſſons as he taught him, leſt he ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
by the diverſity of Teachers, and their
manner of teaching.</p>
               <p>3. That when he is brought to a juſt ſtay of
head, and an aſſurance of the Bit, that then his
Rider is to maintain him therein to a fulneſs
of perfection.</p>
               <p>4. When he is out of order, then let him
ſtay him, and make him go back, as before was
mentioned.</p>
               <p>5. When he is in order, as we have often
expreſſed, make much of him, and not ſtay
long, but with a firm hand gently put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his pace again.</p>
               <p>6. If he continue in good order, cheriſh
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:45382:150"/>
him, guiding his body with a pleaſant and
gentle motion of the Calves of your Legs,
move him to do it more expeditiouſly, which
if he be of a good Nature, he will ſpeedily
perform; always remembring to keep a firm
hand, unleſs he bring in his head.</p>
               <p>7. If his Trot continue not lightly upon
your hand, ſtay him, and cauſe him to go
back, which will bring him in order again, and
then gently put him into his pace, and ſo to
his Trot, as before; which being well done,
cheriſh and delight him with all the ſweetneſs
that you may, ſo that the Rider may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in his love thereby, and guide him by
ſome leading Line, and give him a little Graſs
or Hay out of your hand, tickle, ſcratch him,
and ſpeak to him moſt loving words, which
will make him at his next Exerciſe to do all
to his Riders greateſt content, and within
twenty days or thereabouts, he will pace and
trot in ſuch order, as that the Rider may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
afterwards trot him moſt ſwiftly in the
Ring or in the Manage.</p>
               <p>8. In his ſwift Trot, by all means keep
your true ſeat and firm hand, ſo that he loſe
not that excellent grace and form preſcribed;
but do not gallop him, till he be juſt perfect in
his ſwift Trot, and then out of that Trot, to
put him to a ſwifter and quick Gallop in the
large Rings, even to the ſtop: but beware
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:45382:151"/>
that you draw not your hand haſtily to you
but by a little ſway of your body, back &amp; hand
together, and ſway your hand there, until he
retreat a ſtep or two, and there ſtay him, and
ſuffer him not to go forwards, &amp; at that inſtant
make very much of him, and ſo let your hand
and body re-aſſume the ſame place again.</p>
               <p>9. I dare to aſſure the Rider of the right
uſe of what hath been ſaid, and of the ſucceſs
thereof. Therefore let him follow his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and continue it: Let him pace his Horſe
overthwart ſome deep fallow, as faſt as he can
for half an hour, but ſuffer him not to trot,
keep his hand in a firm and temperate ſtay, as
before; and if he find his head in due place,
his carriage light and pleaſant upon the Bit, he
may aſſure himſelf that he hath gained the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the hand, and the true uſe thereof
for the teaching and making of his young
Horſe; wherein obſerve, that if he be of the
perfect ſhape, his head will be in the due place,
and light upon the Bit without Art.</p>
               <p>I now intend to diſcourſe a little of the
Horſe that is already taught, and brought to
perfection: with him the expert Rider hath
ſmall uſe of a Rod, or any other help, but to
keep his true, juſt, and perfect ſeat, becauſe his
Horſe, by the leaſt token of Bridle or Spur,
will do all things in ſuch time and meaſure, as
the Beholders will judge the Man and Horſe to
be but one body, one mind, one will; and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:45382:151"/>
therefore how the Rains ſhould be carried, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and uſed, is the only thing to be ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The Rains he muſt hold in his left hand,
placing the little finger and the Ring-finger
betwixt the two Rains, and the Thumb cloſe
upon the Rains, ſo as that the hand remove
not from the Creſt of the Horſe; for by the
motion of the hand, it is ſignified to the Horſe
which way you would have him turn, and
ſlacking it on the other: the order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
whereof hath been, and is yet diverſly uſed
of the beſt Horſemen, and therefore I leave it
to every mans uſe, as he findeth it to be moſt
fit: But in the running of the Tilt, where the
Horſe neither doth nor can turn, the Rider
muſt not draw the Bridle towards the Tilt,
but only ſtrain the Rain that is next the Tilt,
to make him carry his head towards the
ſame.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the true ſhape and goodneſs of
the Nature of the Horſe is it that Art attendeth
and worketh upon; in thoſe Horſes the Rules of
Art have perfection with continuance, ſo as
that the Horſe that is of perfect ſhape of body,
ſhall not indanger wind, or limb, or defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of body.</p>
               <p>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Next his perſon ſhall never be in peril by
rearing or running away.</p>
               <p>3. Nor ſhall the Rider ever be grieved
with heavy bearing upon his head, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:45382:152"/>
form all with great delight: neither ſhall he
need Canetſale, Muſrole, Martingale, or ſuch
like, but only falſe Rains.</p>
               <p>4. And laſtly, this teaching will manifeſt
the difference betwixt the true knowing and
ignorant Riders, which will be perceived by
the very Horſes doings; the Horſe doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and expreſs himſelf moſt beautiful, and
thereby renders the expert Rider and the
Horſe to appear moſt nobly, with ſuch delight
to the Beholders, that they will ſeem to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
with it: all which is attained by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
taking of time with moderation and
temperance, which is little regarded, and of
very few, who will rather chuſe to ride out of
order, and that with ſuch extremity of Spur
and Rod, that for want of breath they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
many ſtrange diſorders, whereby the poor
Horſe is moſt cruelly tormented, having no
other to ride him but one without diſcretion,
a mad man. After your Horſe hath perfectly
learned ſwiftly to trot, and to ſtop, as well
to go back, then ought he to be taught right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to advance, which is by lifting up his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet
juſt and even together, like to a Goat,
ſomewhat above the ground, and ſo to let
them fall even and juſt, twice or thrice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the true doing whereof ſtill cauſe him
to make a juſt and perfect manage, and a ready
and true turn: For the attaining whereof, trot
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:45382:152"/>
him gently forty or fifty foot in ſome plain
way, then give him a juſt ſtop, which he will
truly perform, becauſe hath perfectly learned
the ſame. Let him always keep a perfect, ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and pleaſant hand on the Bridle, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
with a mild voice ſay, Hup, Hup, ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him at that inſtant with his Wand on the
right ſhoulder, and alſo on both the Calves of
his Legs together, but ſpur him not, if poſſibly
without it he will advance, the which with a
little labour and patient teaching, no doubt
but he will attempt to do twice or thrice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which if he do, then in that inſtant let
his Rider make much of him (although he did
it very meanly) then let him pauſe a little
time, and give him breath, and trot him
again in the ſame manner the like diſtance of
ground, and as before, ſo gently uſe him again:
but if he do not better every time he is taught,
he muſt be ſtill ſollicited, until that he do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and then after that he can in plain ground
perfectly advance, then reach him gently upon
the hanging knole of a Hill, to bring him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to ſtop, and run ſliding upon his But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks
or hinder Legs, which is very handſom,
beautiful, and graceful for Manage and Turn;
and therefore let him do it before he is taught
any other Leſſon, and then he will do it upon
a ſoft Trot, upon the ſwift Trot, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon a ſoft Gallop, and not before; but
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:45382:153"/>
never upon a ſwift Gallop, until that he be
perfect both in Turn and Manage. If he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
too high, and not juſt and even, with a
good grace as he ought, then may the fault be
ſpeedily found, and eaſily amended by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
correcting him with one even ſtroke
over his Legs, the Wand again ordered and
conveyed out of his fight, with a ſweet ſtaid
hand on the Bridle: few ſuch tryals will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
and perfect what is amiſs in the
Horſe.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome appoint many helps for
Horſes that are harder to turn on the one ſide
then on the other (although I do confeſs their
general deſire is more apt to the left hand then
to the right) yet to a Horſe of good Nature
and perfect ſhape, a little Art will ſpeedily
teach him to teach others: but if he be a Jade,
one may as ſoon teach an Aſs to play upon a
Harp.</p>
               <p>It now remaineth to ſhew, when to make
the half Turn and the double, the Chambetta,
the Manage, to paſs a ſwift Carriere, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The next Leſſon for him to learn, after he is
perfect in thoſe I have ſet down, as I promiſed,
is to make a true and a juſt half double Turn,
which ſhould be in this manner. Firſt, when
the Rider hath gently trotted, ſtopped, and
advanced his Horſe the length of a ſhort Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:45382:153"/>
let him teach him gently and mildly to
make the half Turn (beginning always on the
right hand) that is, for the Rider to turn him
with the help of his left Leg, that his head
may ſtand that way, which before his Tayl
ſtood, which is called a Half Turn, becauſe he
maketh his half Circle: but if in the Turn he
ſet his head that way it ſtood at the firſt, that
is a whole Circle, and therefore called a Whole
Turn: But let him firſt do the half Turn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
which muſt be done by helping him with
his Voice, and Calf of his Leg, and not at firſt
by any means to have him ſpurred, if he can
otherwiſe be brought unto it; becauſe a Spur
is a correction, which is not to be uſed but at
that inſtant time when he hath committed
an errour, and not when he remaineth igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in what he do; by which means undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
being a ſenſible Creature, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his errours and offences, whereby with
little correction he will eaſily amend any fault.
Let the Rider never go about to make him
deſpair, but continually incourage him; for
having formerly attained a perfection of a
juſt, even, and ſwift Trot in the Rings (the
very true ground of all other Leſſons) he will
eaſily turn on the right hand, ſetting his head
that way that his Tayl ſtood; the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perfectly attained, then let the Rider cloſe
it up with another half Turn on the ſame
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:45382:154"/>
hand, with the preſcribed help, ſetting his
head and all his body in the ſame way it was
at the firſt; then give him breath, and make
much of him, then make him do as much on
the left hand, with thoſe other preſcribed
helps, and ſo change from hand to hand, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
always on the right.</p>
               <p>1. In the doing whereof, obſerve whether
he bring on the contrary Leg orderly.</p>
               <p>2. That he do it after the firſt bound of
advancing, and after the ſecond or third
bound.</p>
               <p>3. That after he is perfect in doing the
whole Turn, that the Rider make him to do
it ſwiftly and roundly, without ſtop or ſtay of
the half Turn, and ſpeedily in the cloſing of
every whole Turn, and in as narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
as may be.</p>
               <p>4. That the Rider (as hath been ſaid) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
on the right hand, and end on the right.</p>
               <p>5. After he is perfect, as aforeſaid, give
him on each hand three whole Turns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
let the firſt be very fair and ſoftly, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the right hand, and ending on the
right; in performing whereof, the Rider muſt
always help him with his Tongue, his Rod,
and his Leg, by which continual uſe, before he
teacheth him any other Leſſon (which ſhould
never be done, unleſs he be perfect in the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he is learning, ſo that the Rider ſhall in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:45382:154"/>
the end, with diſcreet and temperate teaching,
bring him to an admirable perfection, keeping
time and meaſure, that the one be not ſwifter
then the other; if either, the laſt, which for
the moſt part is as ſpeedy and perfect.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed to the Managing thereof,
the true ſignification whereof is to be rightly
underſtood by ſuch as intend to be expert in
Horſemanſhip; for <hi>ignoratis terminis ignoratur &amp;
Ars,</hi> to be ignorant of Terms is to be ignorant
of the Art: I take it to be a compound word
of the word <hi>Manus</hi> and <hi>Ago</hi> (the hand in this
Art being the Inſtrument of Inſtruments) doth
guide and govern the Horſe to every action,
and therefore may fitly be ſaid, <hi>Manu agere,</hi> or
as the Italians properly call it <hi>Manegiare,</hi> which
is as much as skilfully to handle. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the Rider ſhall exerciſe the Horſe
perfectly and gracefully in his place, trot, ſtop,
advance, double, or ſingle turn, gallop, leap,
capriole, cornet, aſſault, or whatſoever the
hand being the principal <hi>Actor</hi> or <hi>primus motor,</hi>
may truly and aptly be called Manage; which
cannot ſo rightly be done without the general
knowledge of the practice of the Precepts of
the whole Art.</p>
               <p>And although many worthy Horſemen have
and do only reſt and rein Managing to Gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to bring a Horſe to and fro one ſelf
ſame path, by a half reſt, whole reſt, and when
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:45382:155"/>
the Rider manageth with a half reſt, cauſing
the Horſe at the end of every managing path,
after he hath ſtopt, to advance twice together,
and at the ſecond bound to turn and reſt one
bound: doth not the Rider therein exerciſe
the Trot, the Stop, and the Advance, and the
Turn which he formerly learned, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſame manner? or when he manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the whole reſt, by turning him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon the ſtop, without any carryance
or reſt at all, which only is moſt common with
us in <hi>England;</hi> and yet the managing of the
half reſt is moſt neceſſary for the attaining of
perfection: doth not the Rider keep and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Horſe in one path, one place of ſtop,
making him to keep his ground, and therein
carry his Head, his Neck, his Legs, and his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
juſt, cloſing his Turn roundly, and in a
narrow room, with the true time and meaſure
in every action, as hath been taught? How
then can Managing be properly referred to
one only action, when it is the perfect acting of
every Action and Leſſon he hath learned?
wherein when the Riders Horſe is moſt ready
and perfect, he may increaſe the often doing of
his Leſſons as he will, and make an alteration
of his Turns and Exerciſes, to find out the
truth of his obedience; and when the ſame are
firſt artificially and then exactly performed,
then may the Rider be truly ſaid to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Manager.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:45382:155"/>
Now are to be ſhewed, what are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
things that are to be obſerved in the true
Managing of a Horſe.</p>
               <p>He is taught his Manage with a ſoft Trot,
and not with a Gallop: my reaſon is, becauſe
thereby he may be at the firſt ſenſible of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
what to do, and how to do, and that
gracefully, by the bowing of his Houghs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
by turning round with the Chambetta,
which is by holding up the fore foot on the
ſide he ſhould turn, whilſt he brings over the
contrary Leg, and ſetteth it not down until he
have cloſed his Turn, ſo as hereby he ſhall
carry both his fore-feet above the ground, not
trailing upon the ground, which is diſgraceful.
When the Rider teacheth his Horſe (which is
after he can ſtop well) let him advance before,
and turn readily on both hands, then with a
ſoft Trot come to the place of ſtop about 20
paces in length, and make him advance twice
together, and at the ſecond bound turn him on
the right hand, as hath been ſaid, you muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
begin, helping him, ſo that by bowing of
his Houghs behind, he move his forepart order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then immediately in a gentle manner trot
him back to the place you came from, and
then there after he hath made his ſtop, at the
ſecond bound of his advancing turn on the left
hand, obſerving the like order, until the Rider
have gone ten or twelve times, and at laſt
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:45382:156"/>
cauſe him to advance twice together. And
thus much for the half reſt, which is to advance
thrice, and at the third bound to turn; but
be ſure he be perfect in one Leſſon before you
teach him another.</p>
               <p>In all the Riders managings, let his body
ſtill accompany his Horſe with a good grace;
and when he hath very perfectly learned his
Manage on the ſoft Trot, he may manage him
with a Gallop, giving him on each hand one
ſingle Turn; and a little before he is turned,
let the Rider hold his Wand on the contrary
ſide, whereby he ſhall know on what ſide to
turn; and at the ſtop, let the Rider make him
to advance, either with his Voice, Rod, or
Spur, always being careful to give him breath,
evermore beginning with a gentle Gallop, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
that he be perfect. But I wiſh the Rider ſo
to uſe and exerciſe his Horſe, that he may be
long Maſter of ſo good and ſo perfect a Horſe,
and not to ſpend or ſpoil him in a little time,
in teaching him needleſs toys, as ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Horſemen uſe to do.</p>
               <p>After the Horſe is perfect in ſuch Leſſons as
have been formerly taught, and is grown to
full and perfect ſtrength, then let the Rider
begin with him with a ſhort Carriere in a
fair ſandy way, and with a lively Voice put
him forward, forcing him to run ſwiftly,
roundly, and ſmoothly, with a ſteddy hand,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:45382:156"/>
and lightly to ſtop himſelf on his Buttocks;
then let him turn him on the left hand, and
ſoftly pace him to the other end of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere
path, and there ſtop him, and turn him
again to the right hand, and ſo leave off, and
reſt him. And as this paſſing Carriere or
ſwift Gallop muſt never be done or taught, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Horſe be, as hath been ſaid, moſt perfect
in all the Leſſons; ſo muſt it be done very
ſparingly and ſeldom, as once in a month at
the moſt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Capriole and Cornetti.</head>
               <p>THe difference betwixt theſe two is, that
the Capriole or Goats-leap is always in
going forwards, and the Cornetti ſtill in one
place. Theſe are to be learned &amp; taught by one
order, but neither of them wil be well learned,
&amp; therefore never exactly done, unleſs the Horſe
be very perfect to ſtop, which muſt be by much
bending of the Elbow of the hinder Houghs,
or Heels of the Horſe. Now the Cornetti may
in ſome ſort reſemble the dancing of a Bear at
a ſtake; for when he danceth and pranceth up
and down in one place, lifting his fore-feet
even and juſt together, ſeeming to turn, if he
might be ſuffered; which is never well done,
unleſs the Horſe be juſt and ſteddy of head
and body, bowing the Hams of his hinder
Legs, as if he would fit or ſlide on his But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks.
And the Capriole is in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but ſtill going forwards, ſeeming as
though he would yark behind by advancing
his Rump, but doth not; and as he doth it
forwards, ſo will he do it backward and ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
               <p>Now the Rider need not to teach his Horſe
either of theſe, until, as hath been ſaid, he be
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:45382:157"/>
perfectly exerciſed in thoſe Leſſons formerly
mentioned, becauſe theſe Leſſons are only
learned by ſtopping and advancing; the which,
if he have once perfectly, and have long practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
then trot him ſundry days upon ſome
hanging ground, and upon the Knole of the
Hill on the ſame ground, make him to advance
twice together at the end of the two paces, all
the length of the Hill downwards, ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
to cheriſh him when he doth well, to
give him breath, that all his performances may
be done with delight. And if he be helped
with the word ſaying, Hup, and by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Rod, by ſtriking him on the fore-part of
the ſhoulder, he will go from ſtop to ſtop, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
both the fore-feet and hinder Loyns,
with time and meaſure, as often as the Rider
pleaſes, and in ſuch a juſt, even, and ſtaid
manner, as will be very pleaſant to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe I would not have the young
Rider to begin any Leſſon, but by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a perfect Maſter, and in that courſe to
continue; ſo muſt the young Rider endeavour
with himſelf to know the reaſon of all his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
and therefore muſt be ſure to be preſent
at the Exerciſes of the moſt skilful Horſemen;
&amp; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, let his foot tread often upon
their threſhold. Let him be acquainted with
the moſt expert Practitioners, and when he is
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:45382:158"/>
able rightly to judge and to make a true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt good and bad; then let him
practiſe as often as he can, and never doubt
with good advice to become a perfect Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ſo as to be able to teach whatſover is fit
for a Horſe to do, and a young Gentleman to
know.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Short infallible Rules to be obſerved and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by every Horſeman.</head>
               <p>1. DO not gallop your Horſe before that
he can ſtop well.</p>
               <p>2. Do not run him before he can ſtop in his
Gallop.</p>
               <p>3. Do not ſwiftly gallop him before that he
can ſtop.</p>
               <p>4. Do not make him a Runner before he be
ſix or ſeven years old.</p>
               <p>5. In all his doings, from the beginning to
the end, keep his Rains true, and his head ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
for this Rule is the foundation of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rules.</p>
               <p>6. In the morning early, when that he is
empty, before he eat any thing, teach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
him until he be perfect; and after, twice
or thrice in a week is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>7. In all his teaching and exerciſe, do them
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:45382:158"/>
moderately and temperately, and leave him
always after the well doings of his Leſſons,
both in breath, and with a good mouth.</p>
               <p>8. After he is perfect in his Leſſons, let the
Rider exerciſe him not always in one place,
neither let him confine him to a juſt and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
inſtant of time.</p>
               <p>9. In the managing of his Horſe, let him
not gallop him ſwiftly at the firſt, but with a
ſoft Pace, and ſeldom with a Gallop.</p>
               <p>10. In correcting of his Horſe for an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
let him correct him even in that inſtant
of time when he erred, and not otherwiſe; and
when he had done well (as hath been often
ſaid) let him be ſure to make much of him, and
cheriſh him.</p>
               <p>Theſe following Rules muſt be obſerved
afterwards, when he is ready in all his Leſſons,
and in the greateſt perfection of all his
ſtrength; for before that time they do not
much concern him.</p>

            <head>A true and brief way of Planting
and Ordering of all ſorts of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,
either Apple, Pear, Plum, or
Cherry, according to the Experience
of the Author; being never before
Publiſhed.</head>
            <p>THe principal occaſion that moved me
to write this ſmall Treatiſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Orchards, was, becauſe very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of my Country-men are ſo moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
cheated and abuſed by buying ſeveral ſorts
of Trees of our Nurſery-men, which having
bought, are ſo much deceived in their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
of raiſing an Orchard to ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
growth and benefit in a ſhort time, by
buying Trees of the ſaid Nurſery-men, which
hath proved ſo prejudicial to the Nation, that
thouſands might have enjoyed the benefit
of their labours in Planting of Orchards, had
they not been deceived in their Trees, beſides
the great charge and uncertainty of their
growing. Now I ſhall briefly ſhew you how
all ſorts of people are abuſed in buying Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Pear, and Cherry-Trees (but as for all
ſorts of Peaches, Nectellings, Apricocks, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:45382:160"/>
all ſorts of ſuch kinds of Fruit, they can bring
them up far better then any other, they having
both, and giving them extraordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
ſo it is not convenient to ſhew the way
of raiſing of them) which is thus: A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
or Country-man, Farmer, or any other
having provided his Piece of Ground, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring
and enriching it with good ſtore of
Soil (for I ſuppoſe no body is ſo ignorant to
plant without his Ground be well enriched)
his next thing (as hundreds before him have
done) is to inquire out a good Nurſery, which
no queſtion but he may find very good, but
he will find it bad enough before he hath done
with it, or elſe he will ſpeed better then his
Neighbours or the Author of this hath done
before him, who having provided his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of ſeveral ſorts of Trees, comes to the
Nurſery-man, and deſires to let him ſee ſuch
and ſuch Trees as are written in his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
which the Nurſery-man willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms.
The Gentleman having viewed, marks
them, and likes them exceedingly, agrees for
300 or 400, according as his Piece of Ground
will take up; and are, queſtionleſs, very good
Trees, ſtraight, handſom, and beautiful to the
Beholder: but when he comes to take them
up, they ſtand ſo exceſſive cloſe, that two
thirds of the Roots are ſpoiled, and the Trees
being in extraordinary proof, that by ſuch
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:45382:160"/>
time they come into the Country, the Trees
are ſo withered and bruiſed, that not one in
ten comes to perfection: And further, the
Trees that you buy of theſe Nurſery-men come
out of ſuch a very rich Soil, that when they
come to be planted in the Country-mans Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,
pine away to nothing; and after ſix
years ſtanding, have been forced to plant them
afreſh, to his loſs of time, great charges, coſt,
and trouble. But ſtill they run on, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to be deceived, and are of this opinion,
that thoſe Trees out of the Nurſery, being
four or five years grafted, will turn to an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
far ſooner then any other way of Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But I ſhall ſhew you the true way of
Planting and Ordering your Orchards, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pear, Plum, Cherry, or Apple-Orchards,
with little or no charge, and yet ſhall be an
Orchard much ſooner and better, and not
come to the twentieth part which will accrue
by buying the Trees out of the Nurſery, as the
Author hath proved by Experience.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place you muſt ſeek out, if you
can poſſible with convenience, ſuch a Piece of
Ground that leanes towards the South, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Hill riſing towards the South, that the
Sun may caſt his beams to the root of every
Tree through the whole Orchard, which if it
be upon an exact Level it cannot. Let the
Ground be good by Nature, if you can; if
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:45382:161"/>
not, you muſt enrich it by ſoiling it, which
will be no loſs, conſidering the ſeveral Crops
it will bear after it is planted. Now having
found out a place fitting for the purpoſe, caſt
up a high Ditch, and well quick-ſet it, that ſo it
may grow up with your Trees, to defend them
as they grow up, if not quick-ſetted before.
Now having found out your Ground, and well
fenced it, you muſt conſider what kind of
Ground it is, whether black Mould, Clay,
Gravel, ſandy or mamſie Ground: according to
the Nature of the Ground, you muſt get ſuch
Fruits as may proſper therein accordingly to
the ſeveral Soils; which five ſorts many times
happen in an Acre of Ground. I ſhall begin
with the Clay-ground; all ſorts of Winter-Apples
do abundantly delight in a Clay-Ground,
being very well ſoiled and made
rich: and I have obſerved, that your Winter-Apples,
as Pepins, Pearmains, Gilliflowers,
Cunnings, and Harvey-Apples, which if you
have them of the beſt bearing ſort growing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Clay-Ground well chalked, have been
larger, firmer, and have endured two or
three months longer then that ſame ſort of
Apples growing upon a Gravel or ſandy
Ground. Your next Ground is your mamſie
or chalky Ground, which brings forth a very
lovely ſweet Apple, but not ſo big as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet far ſweeter, and will keep full as
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:45382:161"/>
long, being fit for all ſorts of Winter-Apples,
and Summer-Pears, and Winter-Pears. Your
next Ground is your ſandy Ground, which is
only fitting for Summer-fruit and Cherries,
which to make them thrive, you muſt well
chalk and dung, at leaſt a yard round from the
bodies of the Trees, and a foot deeper then
the Tree ſtands. Thoſe Apples that love ſuch
a kind of Ground, are your Lerding, French
Pepin, Higthnig, Robbers, and all other
Summer-Apples and Pears, and your Duke-Cherries,
and ſeveral others which will not
laſt beyond <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> yet are true bearers and
excellent. Your next is your gravelly Ground,
which will bear excellent Fruit, being well
ordered, until the Trees have taken good
root. You muſt dig the Ground above a
yard round from the body of the Tree, and
dung it very well, that ſo the Tree may gain
good ſtrength, and bigneſs of root before it
come to touch the Gravel, that ſo meeting
with the Gravel, it may not ſtand at a ſtay,
when it comes to root in the Gravel, and then
there is no doubt, but it will anſwer your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
Your next ſort is your black
Mould, which is the beſt, and will bear all
ſorts of Apples, Pears, Plums, and Cherries,
with little help; I do not mean your black
ſort of heathy Mould, which hath neither
heart nor goodneſs, but to be cut up in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:45382:162"/>
and well dryed, will make good fires in
Winter. Now having found out your Piece of
Ground, and ordered according to directions,
meaſure your Ground, and ſo contrive to ſet
the Row of Trees full South, at what diſtance
you think moſt convenient, according as you
do you intend the Trees ſhall be ſuffered to
grow in bigneſs, after your firſt Row is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which muſt be ſet at ſuch a diſtance, that
you may plant one between every four Trees,
which will make a fifth. Now having made
you underſtand the charge and deceit of your
Nurſery-trees, how they pine away coming
out of ſo warm a place, and ſo rich a Soil, into
ſuch a barren place; for make your Orchard
as rich as you can, it is barren Ground to your
Nurſeries; for otherwiſe how could a man
maintain his Wife and Children out of two or
three Acres of Ground, if it were not extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
good? Therefore when your Ground
is provided, and made fit, imploy your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
or Servants to gather you ſo many do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of Crab-ſtocks, Pear-ſtocks, or Cherry-ſtocks,
about three foot long, or thereabouts,
according as it beſt pleaſes the Planter to have
them out. See your Crab-ſtock and the reſt
be in good proof, and not old decayed ſtock,
but green, and as clear without knots as you
can; let them not exceed in bigneſs above
three inches about. Now having conſidered
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:45382:162"/>
your Piece of Ground, what ſort of Land it is,
ſet it according to directions: having ſo done,
buſh up every Tree, and lay ſome muckle Dung
to every one about half a yard round, do not
cover your Tree too deep in Mould, three inches
above the Root is enough; for if you cover
them too deep, a good ſhower of Rain will
not reach the Root. This muckle Dung keeps
the Roots moiſt and warm, and kills all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Weeds that would grow about the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Tree. After they have ſtood one year
open the Buſhes, and prune all the Shoots off
that ſtand a foot below the top, leave not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
three or four at moſt, and then you may
put in Sheep, Calves, or Beaſts: But if it be
well manured, you may plant Garden-Beans
or Peaſe, according as you find the Ground in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.
If your Orchard lye ſloping, as is
beſt, then make a Trench to lead to every
Tree; you need not have many great Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but two or three, and the reſt ſmall, and
ſo you may water your whole Orchard for
the firſt year or two without any trouble.
When the Trenches are made, you ought to
let your Crab-ſtock Pear of Cherry ſtand
three years at the leaſt before you graft, and
two before you bud; for you will find they
will bring forward your Graff more in one
year then in two. You may graff according
as you ſee the Stock to proſper: be ſure to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:45382:163"/>
have your Graffs of the beſt ſort of Fruit-Trees,
and of good Bearers; for ſome ſorts
bear fair Apples, but very few.</p>
            <p>When your Trees are graſſed according to
your mind, of all ſorts of choice fruits, then at
the Fall of the Leaf view all your Trees, and
ſtop up the cleft where the Graft was, put in
ſome Pitch to keep the Rain out, and then it
will be cloſed ſoon after, and the Tree grow
the firmer. When your Grafts are two years
ſhoot at fartheſt, prune them all, and not ſuffer
any to grow croſs one another, eſpecially in
the middle of the Tree. If you find ſome to
ſhoot up ſtraight upright, hang a little ſtone at
the end of the boughs, but one Spring, and
you will make them grow how you pleaſe.
Thoſe that grow ſtraight upright are ſeldom
good Bearers, if they be ſuffered to grow;
therefore you may remedy it at the firſt: But
when they are grown too old, they will not
be half ſo plyable. When they begin to bear,
do not ſuffer them to bear above three or four
Apples or Pears, but pull them off; for if you
ſuffer them to bear too much at firſt, it will
put a ſtop to the Trees growth. This I think
is direction enough for any reaſonable man
to order his affairs.</p>
