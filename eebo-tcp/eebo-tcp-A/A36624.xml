         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THese Miscellany Poems, are by many Titles yours. The first they claim from your accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of my Promise to present them to you; before some of them were yet in being. The rest are deriv'd from your own Merit, the exactness of your Judgment in Poetry, and the candour of your Nature; easie to forgive some trivial faults when they come accompanied, with countervailing Beauties. But after all, though these are your equitable claims to a Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from other Poets, yet I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Bribe in the case, which is your particular liking of my Verses. 'Tis
<pb facs="tcp:48936:5"/>
a vanity common to all Writers, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value their own productions; and 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me to own this failing in my self, than the World to do it for me. For what other Reason have I spent my Life in so unprofitable a Study? Why am I grown Old, in seeking so barren a Reward as Fame? The same Parts and Application, which have made me a Poet, might have rais'd me to any Honours of the Gown, which are often given to Men of as little Learning and less Honesty than mv self. No Government has ever been, or ever can be, wherein Time-servers and Blockheads will not be uppermost. The Persons are only chang'd, but the same juglings in State, the same Hypocrisie in Religion, the same Self-Interest, and Mis-mannagement, will remain for ever. Blood and Mony will be lavish'd in all Ages, only for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of new Faces, with old Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. There is too often a Jaundise in the Eyesof Great Men; they see not those whom they raise, in the same Colours with other Men. All whom they affect, look Golden to them; when the Gilding is only in
<pb facs="tcp:48936:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their own distemper'd Sight. These Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, have given me a kind of Contempt for those who have risen by unworthy ways. I am not asham'd to be Little, when I see them so Infamously Great. Neither, do I know, why the Name of Poet should be Dishonourable to me; if I am truly one, as I hope I am; for I will never do any thing, that shall dishonour it. The Notions of Morality are known to all Men: None can pretend Ignorance of those Idea's which are In-born in Mankind: and if I see one thing, and practise the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I must be Disingenuous, not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a clear Truth, and Base to Act against the light of my own Conscience. For the Reputation of my Honesty, no Man can question it, who has any of his own: For that of my Poetry, it shall either stand by its own Merit; or sall for want of it. Ill Writers are usually the sharpest Censors: For they (as the best Poet, and the best Patron said), when in the full perfection of decay, turn Vinegar, and come again in Play. Thus the corruption of a Poet, is the Generation of a Critick: I mean of a
<pb facs="tcp:48936:4"/>
Critick in the general acceptation of this Age: For formerly they were quite another Species of Men. They were Defendors of Poets, and Commentators on their Works: to Illustrate obscure Beauties; to place some passages in a better light, to redeem others from malicious Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: to help out an Author's Modesty, who is not ostentatious of his Wit; and, in short, to shield him from the Ill-Nature of those Fellows, who were then call'd <hi>Zoili,</hi> and <hi>Momi,</hi> and now take upon themselves the Venerable Name of Censors. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Zoilus,</hi> nor he who endeavour'd to defame <hi>Virgil,</hi> were ever Adopted into the Name of Criticks by the <hi>Ancients:</hi> what their Reputation was then, we know; and their Successours in this Age deserve no better. Are our Auxiliary Forces turn'd our Enemies? Are they, who, at best, are but Wits of the Second Order, and whose only Credit amongst Readers, is what they obtain'd by being subvervient to the Fame of Writers, are these become Rebels of Slaves, and Usurpers of Subjects; or to speak in the most Honourable Terms of
<pb facs="tcp:48936:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, are them from our Seconds, become Principals against us? Does the Ivy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the Oke, which supports its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? What labour wou'd it cost them to put in a better Line, than the worst of those which they expunge in a True Poet? <hi>Petronius,</hi> the greatest Wit perhaps of all the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet when his Envy prevail'd upon his Judgment, to fall on <hi>Lucan,</hi> he fell himself in his attempt: He perform'd worse in his Essay of the Civil War, than the Authour of the <hi>Pharsalia:</hi> and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Errours, has made greater of his own. <hi>Julius Scaliger,</hi> wou'd needs turn down <hi>Homer,</hi> and Abdicate him, after the possession of Three Thousand Years: Has he succeeded in his Attempt? He has indeed shown us some of those Imperfections in him, which are incident to Humane Kind: But who had not rather be that <hi>Homer</hi> than this <hi>Scaliger?</hi> You see the same Hypercritick, when he endeavours to mend the beginning of <hi>Claudian,</hi> (a faulty Poet, and Living in a Barbarous Age;) yet how short he comes of him, and substitutes such Verses of his own, as deserve the <hi>Ferula.</hi> What a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb facs="tcp:48936:7"/>
has he made of <hi>Lucan,</hi> that he rather seems to Bark than Sing? Wou'd any but a Dog, have made so snarling a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? One wou'd have thought, he had Learn'd Latin, as late as they tell us he did Greek. Yet he came off, with a <hi>pace tuâ,</hi> by your good leave, <hi>Lucan;</hi> he call'd him not by those outrageous Names, of Fool, Booby, and Blockhead: He had somewhat more of good Manners, than his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, as he had much more Knowledge. We have two sorts of those Gentlemen, in our Nation: Some of them proceeding with a seeming moderation and pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, to the Dramatick Writers of the last Age, only scorn and vilifie the present Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, to set up their Predecessours. But this is only in appearance; for their real design is nothing less, than to do Honour to any Man, besides themselves. <hi>Horace</hi> took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, of such Men in his Age: <hi>Non Ingeniis favet ille, Sepultis; nostra sed impugnat; nos nostraque lividus odit.</hi> 'Tis not with an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate intention to pay Reverence to the Manes of <hi>Shakespear, Fletcher,</hi> and <hi>Ben John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> that they commend their Writings, but
<pb facs="tcp:48936:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to throw Dirt on the Writers of this Age: Their <hi>Declaration</hi> is one thing, and their Practice is another. By a seeming venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Fathers, they wou'd thrust out us their Lawful Issue, and Govern us them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, under a specious pretence of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. If they could compass their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, what wou'd Wit and Learning get by such a change? If we are bad Poets, they are worse; and when any of their woful pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come abroad, the difference is so great betwixt them and good Writers, that there need no Criticisms on our part to decide it. When they describe the Writers of this Age, they draw such monstrous figures of them, as resemble none of us: Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Pictures are so unlike, that 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent we never sate to them: They are all Grotesque; the products of their wild Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, things out of Nature, so far from being Copy'd from us, that they resemble nothing that ever was, or ever can be. But there is another sort of Insects, more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous than the former. Those who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly aim at the destruction of our Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Church and State. Who allow no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:48936:6"/>
to their Country-Men, either of this or of the former Age. These attack the Living by raking up the Ashes of the Dead. Well knowing that if they can subvert their Original Title to the Stage, we who claim under them, must fall of course. Peace be to the Venerable Shades of <hi>Shakespear,</hi> and <hi>Ben Johnson:</hi> None of the Living will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to have any competition with them: as they were our Predecessours, so they were our Masters. We Trayl our Plays under them: but, (as at the Funerals of a <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour,) our Ensigns are furl'd, or dragg'd upon the ground, in Honour to the Dead; so we may lawfully advance our own, afterwards, to show that we suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: If less in Dignity, yet on the same Foot and Title, which we think too, we can maintain, against the Insolence of our own Janizaries. If I am the Man, as I have Reason to believe, who am seemingly Courted, and secretly Undermin'd: I think I shall be able to defend my'self, when I am openly Attacqu'd. And to shew besides, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers only gave us the Rudiments of a Stage, which they never
<pb facs="tcp:48936:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
finish'd. That many of the Tragedies in the former Age amongst us, were without Comparison beyond those of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides.</hi> But at present, I have neither the leisure nor the means for such an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. 'Tis ill going to Law for an Estate, with him who is in possession of it, and enjoys the present Profits, to feed his Cause. But the <hi>quantum mutatus</hi> may be remember'd in due time. In the mean while I leave the World to judge, who gave the Provocation.</p>
                  <p>This, my Lord, is, I confess, a long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, from <hi>Miscellany Poems</hi> to <hi>Modern Tragedies:</hi> But I have the ordinary Excuse of an Injur'd Man, who will be telling his Tale unseasonably to his Betters. Though at the same time, I am certain you are so good a Friend, as to take a Concern in all things which belong to one who so truly Honours you. And besides, being your self a Critick of the Genuine sort, who have Read the best Authours, in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, who perfectly distinguish of their several Merits, and in general prefer them to the Moderns, yet, I know, you judge

for the <hi>English</hi> Tragedies, against the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> as well as against the <hi>French, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> of these latter Ages. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is a vast difference, betwixt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing like <hi>Perault,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>French</hi> Poets, against <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt giving the <hi>English</hi> Poets their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted due, of excelling <hi>AEschylus, Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi> and <hi>Sophocles.</hi> For if we or our greater Fathers, have not yet brought the <hi>Drama</hi> to an absolute Perfection, yet at least we have carried it much farther than those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Greeks;</hi> who beginning from a <hi>Chorus,</hi> cou'd never totally exclude it, as we have done, who find it an unprofitable incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, without any necessity of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it amongst us; and without the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of establishing it here, unless it were supported by a Publick Charge. Neither can we accept of those Lay-Bishops, as some call them, who under pretence of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stage, wou'd intrude themselves upon us, as our Superiours, being indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Judges of what is Manners, what Religion, and least of all, what is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry and Good Sense. I can tell them in
<pb facs="tcp:48936:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
behalf of all my Fellows, that when they come to Exercise a Jurisdiction over us, they shall have the Stage to themselves, as they have the Lawrel. As little can I grant, that the <hi>French</hi> Dramatick Writers, excel the <hi>English:</hi> Our Authours as far surpass them in Genius, as our Souldiers Excel theirs in Courage: 'Tis true, in Conduct they surpass us either way: Yet that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not so much from their greaterKnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as from the difference of Tasts in the two Nations. They content themselves with a thin Design, without Episodes, and manag'd by few Persons. Our Audience will not be pleas'd, but with variety of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, an Underplot, and many Actours. They follow the Ancients too servilely, in the Mechanick Rules, and we assume too much License to our selves, in keeping them only in view, at too great a distance. But if our Audience had their Tasts, our Poets could more easily comply with them, than the <hi>French</hi> Writers cou'd come up to the Sublimity of our Thoughts, or to the difficult variety of our Designs. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, I dare establish it for a Rule of
<pb facs="tcp:48936:8"/>
Practice on the Stage, that we are bound to please those, whom we pretend to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain: And that at any price, Religion and Good Manners only excepted. And I care not much, if I give this handle, to our bad Illiterate Poetasters, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their <hi>SCRIPTIONS</hi> as they call them. There is a sort of Merit in delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spectatours; which is a Name more proper for them, than that of Auditours: Or else <hi>Horace</hi> is in the wrong, when he commends <hi>Lucilius</hi> for it. But these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places I mean to Treat at greater lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: In the mean time, submitting that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I have said, to your Lordship's Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, or your Censure, and chusing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Entertain you this way, as you are a Judge of Writing, than to oppress your Modesty, with other Commendations, which though they are your due, yet wou'd not be equally receiv'd, in this Satirical, and Censorious Age. That which cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Injury be deny'd to you, is the easiness of your Conversation, far from Affectation or Pride: not denying even to Enemies, their just Praises. And this, if I wou'd dwell
<pb facs="tcp:48936:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on any Theme of this Nature, is no vulgar Commendation to your Lordship. Without Flattery, my Lord, you have it in your Nature, to be a Patron and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of Good Poets, but your Fortune has not yet put into your Hands the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of expressing it. What you will be hereafter, may be more than guess'd, by what you are at present. You maintain the Character of a Nobleman, without that Haughtiness which generally attends too many of the Nobility, and when you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with Gentlemen, you forget not that you have been of their Order. You are Marryed to the Daughter of a King, who, amongst her other high Perfections, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from him a Charming Behaviour, a winning Goodness, and a Majestick Person. The Muses and the Graces are the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your Family. While the Muse Sings, the Grace accompanies her Voice: even the Servants of the Muses have sometimes had the Happiness to hear her; and to receive their Inspirations from her.</p>
                  <p>I will not give my self the liberty of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther; for'tis so sweet to wander in
<pb facs="tcp:48936:10"/>
a pleasing way, that I shou'd never arrive at my Journeys end. To keep my self from being belated in my Letter, and tiring your Attention, I must return to the place where I was setting out. I humbly Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to your Lordship, my own Labours in this Miscellany: At the same time, not arrogating to my self the Priviledge, of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing to you, the Works of others who are join'd with me, in this undertaking; over which I can pretend no right. Your Lady and You have done me the favour to hear me Read my Translations of <hi>Ovid:</hi> And you both seem'd not to be displeas'd with them. Whether it be the partiality of an Old Man to his Youngest Child, I know not: But they appear to me the best of all my Endeavours in this kind. Perhaps this Poet, is more easie to be Translated, than some others, whom I have lately attempted: Perhaps too, he was more according to my Genius. He is certainly more palatable to the Reader, than any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wits, though some of them are more lofty, some more Instructive, and others more Correct. He had Learning enough to make him
<pb facs="tcp:48936:10"/>
equal to the best. But as his Verse came easily, he wanted the toyl of Application to amend it. He is often luxuriant, both in his Fancy and Expressions; and as it has lately been observ'd, not always Natural. If Wit be pleasantry, he has it to excess: but if it be propriety, <hi>Lucretius, Horace,</hi> and above all <hi>Virgil</hi> are his Superiours. I have said so much of him already, in my Preface to his Heroical Epistles, that there remains little to be added in this place. For my own part, I have endeavour'd to Copy his Character what I cou'd in this Translation, even perhaps, farther than I shou'd have done; to his very Faults. Mr. <hi>Chapman</hi> in his Translation of <hi>Homer,</hi> professes to have done it somewhat paraphrastically; and that on set purpose; his Opinion being, that a good Poet is to be Translated in that manner. I remember not the Reason which he gives for it: But I suppose it is, for fear of omitting any of his Excellencies: sure I am, that if it be a Fault, 'tis much more pardonable, than that of those, who run into the other extream, of a litteral, and close Translation, where the Poet is confin'd
<pb facs="tcp:48936:11"/>
so streightly to his Author's Words, that he wants elbow-room, to express his Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. He leaves him obscure; he leaves him Prose, where he sound him Verse. And no better than thus has <hi>Ovid</hi> been serv'd by the so much admir'd <hi>Sandys.</hi> This is at least the Idea which I have remaining of his Translation; for I never Read him since I was a Boy. They who take him upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, from the Praises which their Fathers gave him; may inform their Judgment by Reading him again: And see, (if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Original) what is become of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Poetry, in his Version; whether it be not all, or the greatest part of it evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. But this proceeded from the wrong Judgment of the Age in which he Liv'd: They neither knew good Verse, nor lov'd it; they were Scholars 'tis true, but they were Pedants. And for a just Reward of their Pedantick pains, all their Translations want to be Translated, into <hi>English.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I Flatter not my self, or if my Friends have not Flatter'd me, I have given my Author's Sense, for the most part truly: for to mistake sometimes, is incident to all
<pb facs="tcp:48936:11"/>
Men: And not to follow the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatours alwaies, may be forgiven to a Man, who thinks them, in the general, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy gross-witted Fellows; fit only to gloss on their own dull Poets. But I leave a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satire on their Wit, till I have a better opportunity, to shew how much I Love and Honour them. I have like wise attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to restore <hi>Ovid</hi> to his Native sweetness, easiness, and smoothness; and to give my Poetry a kind of Cadence, and, as we call it, a run of Verse, as like the Original, as the <hi>English</hi> can come up to the <hi>Latin;</hi> As he seldom uses any <hi>Synalephas,</hi> so I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to avoid them, as often as I cou'd: I have likewise given him his own turns, both on the Words and on the Thought: Which I cannot say are inimitable, because I have Copyed them: and so may others, if they use the same diligence: But certainly they are wonderfully Graceful in this Poet. Since I have Nam'd the <hi>Synalepha,</hi> which is the cutting off one Vowel, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before another, I will give an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it, from <hi>Chapman's Homer</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:48936:12"/>
lyes before me; for the benefit of those who understand not the <hi>Latine Prosodia.</hi> 'Tis in the first Line of the Argument to the First <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Apollo<hi>'s Priest to th'</hi> Argive <hi>Fleet doth bring,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There we see he makes it not the <hi>Argive,</hi> but th' <hi>Argive,</hi> to shun the shock of the two Vowels, immediately following each other. But in his Second Argument, in the same Page, he gives a bad Example of the quite contrary kind:
<q>
                        <l>Alpha <hi>the Pray'r of</hi> Chryses <hi>Sings:</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>The Army's Plague, the Strife of Kings.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these word <hi>the Armies, the</hi> ending with a Vowel, and <hi>Armies</hi> beginning with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vowel, without cutting off the first, which by it had been th' Armies, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a most horrible ill-sounding-gap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those Words. I cannot say, that I have every way observ'd the Rule of this <hi>Synalepha,</hi> in my Translation; but wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I have not, 'tis a fault in sound: The
<pb facs="tcp:48936:12"/>
                     <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> have made it an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Precept in their versification; thereinfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the severe Example of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets. Our Countrymen have not yet Reform'd their Poetry so far; but content themselves with following the Licentious Practice of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> who though they sometimes use <hi>Synalepha's,</hi> yet make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty very often, to sound one Vowel upon another; as <hi>Homer</hi> does, in the very first line of <hi>Alpha.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 'Tis true, indeed, that in the second line, in these words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>Synalepha</hi> in revenge is twice ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd. But it becomes us, for the sake of <hi>Euphony,</hi> rather <hi>Musas colere severiores,</hi> with the <hi>Romans;</hi> than to give into the looseness of the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have tir'd my self, and have been sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd by the Press to send away this Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; otherwise I had expos'd some other faults, which are daily committed by our <hi>English</hi> Poets; which, with care and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, might be amended. For after all, our Language is both Copious, Significant, and Majestical; and might be reduc'd into
<pb facs="tcp:48936:13"/>
a more harmonious sound. But for want of Publick Encouragement, in this <hi>Iron Age,</hi> we are so far from making any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in the improvement of our Tongue, that in few years, we shall Speak and Write as Barbarously as our Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding my haste, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to tell your Lordship, that there are two fragments of <hi>Homer</hi> Translated in this <hi>Miscellany;</hi> one by Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> (whom I cannot mention without the Honour which is due to his Excellent Parts, and that entire Affection which I bear him;) and the other by my self. Both the Subjects are pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; and I am sure my Friend has added to the Tenderness which he found in the Original; and, without Flattery, surpass'd his Author. Yet I must needs say this in reference to <hi>Homer,</hi> that he is much more capable of exciting the Manly Passions, than those of Grief and Pity. To cause Admiration, is indeed the proper and adequate design of an Epick Poem: And in that he has Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd even <hi>Virgil.</hi> Yet, without presuming to Arraign our Master, I may venture to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that he is somewhat too Talkative,
<pb facs="tcp:48936:13"/>
and more than somewhat too digressive. This is so manifest, that it cannot be deny'd, in that little parcel which I have Translated, perhaps too literally: There <hi>Andromache</hi> in the midst of her Concernment, and Fright for <hi>Hector,</hi> runs off her Biass, to tell him a Story of her Pedigree, and of the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Death of her Father, her Mother, and her Seven Brothers. The Devil was in <hi>Hector,</hi> if he knew not all this matter, as well as she who told it him; for she had been his Bed-fellow for many Years together: And if he knew it, then it must be confess'd, that <hi>Homer</hi> in this long digression, has ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given us his own Character, than that of the Fair Lady whom he Paints. His Dear Friends the Commentators, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail him at a pinch, will needs excuse him, by making the present Sorrow of <hi>Andromache,</hi> to occasion the remembrance of all the past: But others think that she had enough to do with that Grief which now oppress'd her, without running for assistance to her Family. <hi>Virgil,</hi> I am confident, wou'd have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such a work of supererrogation. But <hi>Virgil</hi> had the Gift of expressing much
<pb facs="tcp:48936:14"/>
in little, and sometimes in silence: For though he yielded much to <hi>Homer</hi> in Invention, he more Excell'd him in his Admirable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He drew the Passion of <hi>Dido</hi> for <hi>Eneas,</hi> in the most lively and most natural Colours that are imaginable: <hi>Homer</hi> was ambitious enough of moving pity; for he has attempted twice on the same subject of <hi>Hector</hi>'s death: First, when <hi>Priam,</hi> and <hi>Hecuba</hi> beheld his Corps, which was drag'd after the Chariot of <hi>Achilles;</hi> and then in the Lamentation which was made over him, when his Body was redeem'd by <hi>Priam;</hi> and the same Persons again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail his death with a Chorus of others to help the cry. But if this last excite Compassion in you, as I doubt not but it will, you are more oblig'd to the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slatour than the Poet. For <hi>Homer,</hi> as I observ'd before, can move rage better than he can pity: He stirs up the iras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible appetite, as our Philosophers call it, he provokes to Murther, and the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God's Images; he forms and equips those ungodly Man killers, whom we Poets, when we flatter them, call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes;
<pb facs="tcp:48936:14"/>
a race of Men who can never enjoy quiet in themselves, 'till they have taken it from all the World. This is <hi>Homer</hi>'s Commendation, and such as it is, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Peace, or at least of more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Heroism, will never Envy him. But let <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> contend for the Prize of Honour, betwixt themselves, I am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied they will never have a third Concurrent. I wish Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> had the leisure to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate him, and the World the good Nature and Justice, to Encourage him in that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Design, of which he is more capable than any Man I know. The Earl of <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> two the best Judges of our Age, have assur'd me, that they cou'd never Read over the Translation of <hi>Chapman,</hi> without incredible Pleasure, and extreme Transport. This Admiration of theirs, must needs proceed from the Author himself: For the Translator has thrown him down as low, as harsh Numbers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper <hi>English,</hi> and a monstrous length of Verse cou'd carry him. What then wou'd he appear in the Harmonious Version, of one of the best Writers, Living in a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:48936:15"/>
Age than was the last? I mean for versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the Art of Numbers; for in the <hi>Drama</hi> we have not arriv'd to the pitch of <hi>Shakespear</hi> and <hi>Ben Johnson.</hi> But here, my Lord, I am forc'd to break off abruptly, without endeavouring at a Compliment in the close. This <hi>Miscellany,</hi> is without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute one of the best of the kind, which has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been extant in our Tongue. At least, as Sir <hi>Samuel Tuke</hi> has said before me, a Modest Man may praise what's not his own. My Fellows have no need of any Protection, but I humbly recommend my part of it, as much as it deserves, to your Patronage and Acceptance, and all the rest to your Forgiveness.</p>

                  <p>HAving formerly Printed two Parts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scellany Poems, they were so very kindly receiv'd, that I had long before now En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to obtain a Third, had I not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ever since the Publishing of the Second been Solliciting the Translating of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and <hi>Persius.</hi> Soon after the Publishing of that Book I waited upon several Gentlemen to ask their Opinion of a Third Miscellany, who encourag'd me to endeavour it, and have considerably help'd me in it.</p>
                  <p>Many very Ingenious Copies were sent to me upon my giving publick notice of this Design; but had I Printed em all, the Book wou'd have swell'd to too great a bulk, and I must have delay'd the Publishing of it 'till next Term: But those omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, shall upon Order from the Authors be restored;
<pb facs="tcp:48936:16"/>
or if the Gentlemen will be pleas'd to stay 'till next year, I shall take it as a favour to insert them in another Miscellany, which I then intend, if I find by the Sale that this proves as Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the former.</p>
                  <p>Several Reasons encourage me to Proceed upon the endeavouring a Fourth Volume: As, That I had assurance of many Copies from Persons now out of <hi>England;</hi> which, though not yet arriv'd, I am confident will be sent in a short time, and they come from such Hands, that I can have no reason to doubt of their being very much esteem'd.</p>
                  <p>I would likewise willingly try if there could be an Annual Miscellany, which I believe might be an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diversion to the Ingenious. By this means care would be taken to preserve ev'ry Choice Copy that appears; whereas I have known several Celebrated Pieces so utterly lost in three or four years time after they were written, as not to be recoverable by all the search I cou'd make after 'em.</p>
                  <p>I was for some years together possest of several Poems of Sir <hi>Carr Scrope</hi>'s, written with his own Hand, which I in vain of late strove to recover; for as I forgot to whom I lent 'em, so I believe the Person to whom they were lent does not remember where they were borrowed: But if the present Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessour of them reads this, I beg their being return'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:48936:16"/>
If I should go on with the Design of an Annual Miscellany, after I have procur'd some Stock to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon, I will give Publick Notice of it. And I hope the Gentlemen who approve of this Design, will promote it, by sending such Copies as they judge will be acceptable.</p>

                     <l>Needless was written Law, where none opprest:</l>
                     <l>The Law of Man, was written in his Breast:</l>
                     <l>No suppliant Crowds, before the Judge appear'd,</l>
                     <l>No Court Erected yet, nor Cause was hear'd:</l>

                        <l>His writhen Shell he takes; whose narrow vent</l>

                     <l>THE Fame of this, perhaps, through <hi>Crete</hi> had flown:</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Crete</hi> had newer Wonders of her own,</l>
                     <l>In <hi>Iphis</hi> chang'd: For, near the <hi>Gnossian</hi> bounds,</l>
                     <l>(As loud Report the Miracle resounds)</l>
                     <l>At <hi>Phoestus</hi> dwelt a man of honest blood:</l>
                     <l>But meanly born, and not so rich as good;</l>
                     <l>Esteem'd and loy'd by all the Neighbourhood.</l>
                     <l>

Who to his Wife, before the time assign'd</l>
                     <l>For Child-birth came; thus bluntly spoke his mind.</l>
                     <l>If Heav'n, said <hi>Lygdus,</hi> will vouchsafe to hear;</l>
                     <l>I have but two Petitions to prefer:</l>
                     <l>Short pains for thee; for me a Son and Heir.</l>
                     <l>Girls cost as many throws, in bringing forth:</l>
                     <l>Besides when born, the Titts are little worth.</l>
                     <l>Weak puling things, unable to sustain</l>
                     <l>Their share of Labour, and their Bread to gain.</l>
                     <l>If, therefore, thou a Creature shalt produce</l>
                     <l>Of so great Charges, and so little Use,</l>
                     <l>(Bear witness Heav'n, with what reluctancy,)</l>
                     <l>Her hapless Innocence I doom to dye.</l>
                     <l>He said, and tears the common grief display</l>
                     <l>Of him who bade, and her who must obey.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Yet <hi>Telethusa</hi> still persists to find,</l>
                     <l>Fit Arguments to move a Father's mind:</l>

T' extend his Wishes to a larger scope;</l>
                     <l>And in one Vessel not confine his hope.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Lygdus</hi> continues hard: her time drew near,</l>
                     <l>And she her heavy load cou'd scarcely bear:</l>
                     <l>When slumb'ring, in the latter shades of Night,</l>
                     <l>Before th' approaches of returning light,</l>
                     <l>She saw, or thought she saw, before her Bed</l>
                     <l>A glorious Train, and <hi>Isis</hi> at their head:</l>
                     <l>Her Moony Horns were on her Forehead plac'd,</l>
                     <l>And yellow Sheaves her shining Temples grac'd:</l>
                     <l>A Mitre, for a Crown, she wore on high:</l>
                     <l>The Dog and dappl'd Bull were waiting by;</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Osyris,</hi> sought along the Banks of <hi>Nile;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>The silent God; the sacred Crocodile:</l>
                     <l>And, last, a long procession moving on,</l>
                     <l>With Timbrels, that assist the lab'ring Moon.</l>
                     <l>Her slumbers seem'd dispell'd, and, broad awake,</l>
                     <l>She heard a Voice, that thus distinctly spake.</l>
                     <l>

My Votary, thy Babe from Death defend;</l>
                     <l>Nor fear to save whate're the Gods will send.</l>
                     <l>Delude with Art, thy Husband's dire Decree;</l>
                     <l>When danger calls, repose thy trust on me:</l>
                     <l>And know thou hast not serv'd a thankless Deity.</l>
                     <l>This Promise made; with Night the Goddess fled:</l>
                     <l>With joy the Woman wakes, and leaves her Bed:</l>
                     <l>Devoutly lifts her spotless hands on high;</l>

                     <l>'Twas of the beauteous Kind: and brought to light</l>
                     <l>With secresie, to shun the Father's sight.</l>
                     <l>Th' indulgent Mother did her Care employ;</l>
                     <l>And pass'd it on her Husband for a Boy.</l>
                     <l>The Nurse was conscious of the Fact alone:</l>
                     <l>The Father paid his Vows, as for a Son.</l>

                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48936:59"/>
And call'd him <hi>Iphis,</hi> by a common Name</l>
                     <l>Which either Sex, with equal right may claim.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Iphis,</hi> his Grandsire was; the Wife was pleas'd,</l>
                     <l>Of half the fraud, by Fortune's favour eas'd:</l>
                     <l>The doubtful Name was us'd without deceit,</l>
                     <l>And Truth was cover'd with a pious Cheat.</l>
                     <l>The Habit shew'd a Boy, the beauteous Face</l>
                     <l>With manly fierceness mingl'd Female grace.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Now thirteen years of Age were swiftly run,</l>
                     <l>When the fond Father thought the time drew on</l>
                     <l>Of settling in the World, his only Son,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Ianthe</hi> was his choice; so wondrous fair</l>
                     <l>Her Form alone with <hi>Iphis</hi> cou'd compare;</l>
                     <l>A Neighbour's Daughter of his own Degree;</l>

                     <l>They soon espous'd; for they with ease were joyn'd,</l>
                     <l>Who were before Contracted in the Mind.</l>
                     <l>Their Age the same, their Inclinations too:</l>
                     <l>And bred together, in one School they grew.</l>
                     <l>Thus, fatally dispos'd to mutual fires,</l>
                     <l>They felt, before they knew, the same desires.</l>
                     <l>Equal their flame, unequal was their care;</l>
                     <l>One lov'd with Hope, one languish'd in Despair.</l>
                     <l>The Maid accus'd the ling'ring days alone:</l>
                     <l>For whom she thought a man, she thought her own.</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Iphis</hi> bends beneath a greater grief;</l>
                     <l>As fiercely burns, but hopes for no relief.</l>
                     <l>Ev'n her Despair, adds fuel to her fire;</l>
                     <l>A Maid with madness does a Maid desire.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>And, scarce refraining tears, alas, said she,</l>
                     <l>What issue of my love remains for me!</l>

How wild a Passion works within my Breast,</l>
                     <l>With what prodigious Flames am I possest!</l>
                     <l>Cou'd I the Care of Providence deserve,</l>
                     <l>Heav'n must destroy me, if it wou'd preserve.</l>

                     <l>Some usual Evil for my punishment:</l>
                     <l>Not this unkindly Curse; to rage and burn</l>
                     <l>Where Nature shews no prospect of return.</l>

                     <l>That <hi>Iphis</hi> lives, that I my self am free</l>
                     <l>From shame and punishment, I owe to thee.</l>
                     <l>On thy Protection, all our hopes depend:</l>

                     <l>Her tears pursu'd her words; and while she spoke</l>
                     <l>The Goddess nodded, and her Altar shook:</l>
                     <l>The Temple doors, as with a blast of wind,</l>
                     <l>Were heard to clap; the Lunar Horns that bind</l>
                     <l>The brows of <hi>Isis,</hi> cast a blaze around;</l>
                     <l>The trembling Timbrel, made a murm'ring sound.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Some hopes these happy Omens did impart;</l>

Not much in fear, nor fully satisfi'd;</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Iphis</hi> follow'd with a larger stride:</l>
                     <l>The whiteness of her Skin forsook her Face;</l>
                     <l>Her looks emboldn'd, with an awful Grace;</l>
                     <l>Her Features and her Strength together grew;</l>
                     <l>And her long Hair, to curling Locks withdrew.</l>
                     <l>Her sparkling Eyes, with Manly Vigour shone,</l>
                     <l>Big was her Voice, Audacious was her Tone.</l>
                     <l>The latent Parts, at length reveal'd, began</l>
                     <l>To shoot, and spread, and burnish into Man.</l>
                     <l>The Maid becomes a Youth; no more delay</l>
                     <l>Your Vows, but look, and confidently pay.</l>

                     <l>From <hi>Faunus</hi> and the Nymph <hi>Symethis</hi> born,</l>
                     <l>Was both his Parents pleasure: but, to me</l>
                     <l>Was all that Love cou'd make a Lover be.</l>

The Gods our Minds in mutual Bands did joyn;</l>
                     <l>I was his only Joy, as he was mine.</l>
                     <l>Now sixteen Summers the sweet Youth had seen;</l>
                     <l>And doubtful Down, began to shade his Chin:</l>
                     <l>When <hi>Polyphemus</hi> first disturb'd our Joy;</l>
                     <l>And lov'd me fiercely, as I lov'd the Boy.</l>
                     <l>Ask not which passion in my Soul was high'r,</l>
                     <l>My last Aversion, or my first Desire:</l>
                     <l>Nor this the greater was, nor that the less:</l>
                     <l>Both were alike; for both were in excess.</l>
                     <l>Thee, <hi>Venus,</hi> thee, both Heav'n and Earth obey;</l>
                     <l>Immense thy Pow'r, and boundless is thy Sway.</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Cyclops,</hi> who desi'd th' AEtherial Throne,</l>
                     <l>And thought no Thunder louder than his own,</l>
                     <l>The terrour of the Woods, and wilder far</l>
                     <l>Than Wolves in Plains, or Bears in Forrests are,</l>
                     <l>Th' Inhumane Host, who made his bloody Feasts</l>
                     <l>On mangl'd Members, of his butcher'd Guests,</l>

Yet felt the force of Love, and fierce Desire,</l>
                     <l>And burnt for me, with unrelenting Fire.</l>
                     <l>Forgot his Caverns, and his woolly care,</l>
                     <l>Assum'd the softness of a Lover's Air;</l>
                     <l>And comb'd, with Teeth of Rakes, his rugged hair.</l>
                     <l>Now with a crooked Sythe his Beard he sleeks;</l>
                     <l>And mows the stubborn Stubble of his Cheeks:</l>
                     <l>Now, in the Crystal Stream he looks, to try</l>
                     <l>His Simagres, and rowls his glaring eye.</l>
                     <l>His Cruelty and thirst of Blood are lost;</l>
                     <l>And Ships securely sail along the Coast.</l>

                     <l>The Prophet <hi>Telemus</hi> (arriv'd by chance</l>

                     <l>Who mark'd the Tracts of every Bird that flew,</l>
                     <l>And sure Presages from their flying drew,)</l>
                     <l>Foretold the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> that <hi>Ulysses</hi> hand</l>
                     <l>In his broad eye, shou'd thrust a flaming Brand.</l>

The Giant, with a scornful grin reply'd,</l>
                     <l>Vain Augur, thou hast falsely prophesi'd;</l>
                     <l>Already Love, his flaming Brand has tost;</l>
                     <l>Looking on two fair Eyes, my sight I lost.</l>
                     <l>Thus, warn'd in vain, with stalking pace he strode,</l>
                     <l>And stamp'd the Margine of the briny Flood,</l>
                     <l>With heavy steps: and weary, sought agen,</l>
                     <l>The cool Retirement of his gloomy Den.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>A Promontory sharp'ning by degrees,</l>
                     <l>Ends in a Wedge, and over-looks the Seas:</l>
                     <l>On either side, below, the water flows;</l>
                     <l>This airy walk, the Giant Lover chose.</l>
                     <l>Here, on the midst he sate: his Flocks, unled,</l>
                     <l>Their Shepherd follow'd, and securely fed.</l>
                     <l>A Pine so burly, and of length so vast,</l>
                     <l>That sailing Ships requir'd it for a Mast,</l>

He weilded for a Staff; his steps to guide:</l>
                     <l>But laid it by, his Whistle while he try'd.</l>
                     <l>A hundred Reeds, of a prodigious growth,</l>
                     <l>Scarce made a Pipe, proportion'd to his mouth:</l>

                     <l>And watry Plains, the dreadful hiss resound.</l>
                     <l>I heard the Ruffian-Shepherd rudely blow</l>
                     <l>Where, in a hollow Cave, I sat below;</l>
                     <l>On <hi>Acis</hi> bosom I my head reclin'd:</l>

                     <l>Erect as Alders, and of equal height:</l>
                     <l>More wanton than a Kid, more sleek thy Skin</l>
                     <l>Than Orient Shells, that on the Shores are seen.</l>

                     <l>More grateful to the sight, than goodly Planes;</l>
                     <l>And softer to the touch, than down of Swans;</l>

                     <l>Like them fallacious, like their Fountains cold.</l>

                     <l>Immoveable and fixt in thy disdain;</l>
                     <l>Rough as these Rocks, and of a harder grain.</l>

                     <l>YOU have oblig'd the <hi>Brittish</hi> Nation more</l>
                     <l>Than all their <hi>Bards</hi> cou'd ever do before:</l>
                     <l>And (at your own Charge) Monuments as hard</l>
                     <l>As Brass, or Marble, to your Fame, have rear'd.</l>
                     <l>For as all Warlike Nations take Delight</l>
                     <l>To hear how their brave Ancestors cou'd fight,</l>
                     <l>You have advanc'd to Wonder their Renown,</l>
                     <l>And no less Vertuously improv'd your own;</l>

That 'twill be doubtful, whether you do write,</l>
                     <l>Or they have acted, at a Nobler height.</l>
                     <l>You (of your Ancient Princes) have retriev'd</l>
                     <l>More than the Ages knew in which they liv'd;</l>
                     <l>Explain'd their Customs, and their Rights anew,</l>
                     <l>Better than all their <hi>Druids</hi> ever knew:</l>
                     <l>Unriddled those dark Oracles as well</l>
                     <l>As those that made'em, cou'd themselves foretell.</l>
                     <l>For as the <hi>Brittains</hi> long have hop'd in vain,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Arthur</hi> wou'd come to Govern them again:</l>
                     <l>You have fulfill'd that Prophesie alone,</l>
                     <l>And in your Poem plac'd him on his Throne.</l>
                     <l>Such Magick Power has your prodigious Pen,</l>
                     <l>To raise the Dead, and give new Life to Men;</l>
                     <l>Make Rival Princes meet in Arms, and Love,</l>
                     <l>Whom distant Ages did so far remove.</l>
                     <l>For as Eternity has neither past,</l>
                     <l>Nor future, <hi>(Authors</hi> say) nor first, nor last;</l>

                     <l>It were defect in Judgment to go low'r;</l>
                     <l>Or stoop to things so pitifully lewd,</l>
                     <l>As use to take the Vulgar Latitude.</l>

'Tis well; you're witty Persons both, say I;</l>

                     <l>The fairest Jewel in the <hi>English</hi> Crown.</l>
                     <l>Happy in famous Dangers in the Field,</l>
                     <l>Happy in Courts which brightest <hi>Beauties</hi> yield.</l>
                     <l>Oh Prince! whose Soul is known so justly great,</l>

First, the rich Oar refin'd, then did allay,</l>
                     <l>Stampt thee his own, not shuffl'd thee away.</l>
                     <l>With wonder thus we all thy temper prize,</l>

                     <l>Like the cool <hi>English,</hi> who approach their Fate</l>
                     <l>With awe, and gravely first with Death debate.</l>
                     <l>They kindle slowly, but when once on Fire,</l>

                     <l>Whose Vertues shine, but so as to be born,</l>
                     <l>Clear as the Sun, and gentle as the Morn.</l>
                     <l>Whose brighter Eyes like lambent Glories move,</l>
                     <l>And ev'ry glance wounds like a Dart of Love.</l>
                     <l>How well, oh Prince, how nobly hast thou fought,</l>
                     <l>Since to thy Arms the Fates such <hi>Beauty</hi> brought!</l>

Methinks I hear thee in thy Nuptial Bed,</l>

                     <l>Pains I remember now with vast delight,</l>
                     <l>Well have I brav'd the thund'ring <hi>French</hi> in fight,</l>
                     <l>My hazards now are Gains, and if my Blood</l>
                     <l>In Battel mix and raise the vulgar Flood,</l>

                     <l>Like <hi>Balm</hi> shall heal the Wounds when I return.</l>

                     <l>Must go, the Prince for <hi>Holland</hi> does declare,</l>
                     <l>Call'd to the Business of Important War.</l>
                     <l>Go then, if thy Departure be agreed,</l>
                     <l>Your Friends must weep, your Enemies shall bleed.</l>

                     <l>And if in Poets minds, those vaster Souls,</l>
                     <l>Where all at once the vast Creation rouls,</l>
                     <l>To whom the Warriour is as much oblig'd,</l>
                     <l>As to Relievers Towns that are besieg'd.</l>
                     <l>(For Death would to their Acts an end afford,</l>

                     <l>Calm as the Prince, and as the Princess kind.</l>
                     <l>The World, why should not Dreams of Poets take,</l>
                     <l>As well as Prophets who but dream awake?</l>
                     <l>I saw them launch, the Prince the Princess bore,</l>
                     <l>While the sad Court stood crowding on the Shore.</l>
                     <l>The Prince still bowing on the Deck did stand,</l>
                     <l>And held his weeping Princess by the hand.</l>

Which waving oft, she bid them all farewell,</l>

                     <l>To Heav'n the Care; in Tears his Eyes wou'd swim,</l>

                     <l>My little Love! her Sighs she did renew,</l>

                     <l>At their first call the singing <hi>Mermaids</hi> come,</l>

                     <l>WE Love and Hate, as restless Monarchs fight,</l>
                     <l>Who boldly dare invade another's Right:</l>
                     <l>Yet when thro' all the dangerous toils they've run,</l>
                     <l>Ignobly quit, the Conquests they have won;</l>
                     <l>Those <hi>charming hopes</hi> that made them valiant grow,</l>
                     <l>Pall'd with Enjoyment, makes them Cowards now.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Our Passions only form our Happiness,</l>
                     <l>Hopes still enlarge, as Fears contract it less:</l>
                     <l>Hope with a gaudy Prospect feeds the Eye,</l>
                     <l>Sooths every sense, does with each wish comply;</l>
                     <l>But false Enjoyment, the kind Guide destroys,</l>
                     <l>We lose the Passion in the treacherous Joys.</l>

Like the gay Silk-worm, when it pleases most,</l>
                     <l>In that ungrateful Web it spun, 'tis lost.</l>

                     <l>Fruition only cloys the Appetite,</l>
                     <l>More does the Conquest, than the prize delight:</l>
                     <l>One Victory gain'd, another fills the mind,</l>
                     <l>Our restless Wishes cannot be confin'd.</l>
                     <l>Like boisterous waves, no settl'd bounds they know,</l>

                     <l>We're charm'd with distant views of happiness,</l>
                     <l>But near approaches make the prospect less.</l>
                     <l>Wishes, like painted Landscapes, best delight,</l>
                     <l>Whilst distance recommends them to the sight:</l>
                     <l>Plac'd afar off, they beautiful appear,</l>
                     <l>But show their course, and nauseous colours, near.</l>

                     <l>With eager arms his swelling bags he prest,</l>
                     <l>And expectation only made him blest:</l>
                     <l>But when a boundless Treasure he enjoy'd,</l>
                     <l>And every wish was with fruition cloy'd:</l>

                     <p>Hector<hi>'s Body, (after he was slain) remain'd still in the Possession of</hi> Achilles; <hi>for which,</hi> Priam <hi>made great Lamentation.</hi> Jupiter <hi>had pity on him, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48936:126"/>
sent</hi> Iris <hi>to comfort and direct him, after what manner he should go to</hi> Achilles<hi>'s Tent, and how he should there ransom the Body of his Son.</hi> Priam <hi>accordingly orders his Chariot to be got ready, and preparing rich Presents for</hi> Achilles, <hi>sets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the</hi> Grecian <hi>Camp, accompany'd by no body but his Herald</hi> Idaeus.

                     <l>With Solemn pace, into <hi>Achilles</hi> Tent.</l>
                     <l>Heedless, he pass'd through various Rooms of State,</l>

                  <l>WHen Factious Rage to cruel Exile, drove</l>
                  <l>The Queen of <hi>Beauty,</hi> and the Court of Love;</l>
                  <l>The Muses droop'd, with their forsaken Arts,</l>
                  <l>And the sad <hi>Cupids</hi> broke their useless Darts.</l>
                  <l>Our fruitful Plains to Wilds and Desarts turn'd,</l>
                  <l>Like <hi>Edens</hi> Face when banish'd Man it mourn'd:</l>
                  <l>Love was no more when Loyalty was gone,</l>
                  <l>The great Supporter of his awful Throne.</l>
                  <l>Love cou'd no longer after <hi>Beauty</hi> stay,</l>
                  <l>But wander'd Northward to the verge of day,</l>
                  <l>As if the Sun and He had lost their way.</l>

But now th' Illustrious Nymph return'd again,</l>
                  <l>Brings every Grace Triumphant in her Train:</l>
                  <l>The wondring <hi>Nereids,</hi> tho' they rais'd no storm,</l>
                  <l>Foreslow'd her passage to behold her form:</l>
                  <l>Some cry'd a <hi>Venus,</hi> some a <hi>Thetis</hi> past:</l>
                  <l>But this was not so fair, nor that so chast.</l>
                  <l>Far from her sight flew Faction, Strife and Pride:</l>
                  <l>And Envy did but look on her, and dy'd.</l>
                  <l>What e're we suffer'd from our sullen Fate,</l>
                  <l>Her sight is purchas'd at an easie rate:</l>
                  <l>Three gloomy Years against this day were set:</l>
                  <l>But this one mighty Sum has clear'd the Debt.</l>
                  <l>Like <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Dream, but with a better doom;</l>
                  <l>The Famine past, the Plenty still to come.</l>
                  <l>For Her the weeping Heav'ns become serene,</l>
                  <l>For Her the Ground is clad in cheerful green:</l>
                  <l>For Her the Nightingales are taught to sing,</l>
                  <l>And Nature has for Her delay'd the Spring.</l>

The Muse resumes her long-forgotten Lays,</l>
                  <l>And Love, restor'd, his Ancient Realm surveys;</l>
                  <l>Recalls our <hi>Beauties,</hi> and revives our Plays.</l>
                  <l>His Wast Dominions peoples once again,</l>
                  <l>And from Her Presence dates his second Reign.</l>
                  <l>But awful Charms on her fair Forehead sit,</l>
                  <l>Dispensing what she never will admit.</l>
                  <l>Pleasing, yet cold, like <hi>Cynthia</hi>'s silver Beam,</l>
                  <l>The Peoples Wonder, and the Poet's Theam.</l>
                  <l>Distemper'd Zeal, Sedition, canker'd Hate,</l>
                  <l>No more shall vex the Church, and tear the State;</l>
                  <l>No more shall Faction civil Discords move,</l>
                  <l>Or only Discords of too tender Love:</l>
                  <l>Discord like that of Musick's various parts,</l>
                  <l>Discord that makes the harmony of Hearts,</l>
                  <l>Discord that only this dispute shall bring,</l>
                  <l>Who best shall love the Duke, and serve the King.</l>

Thou mak'st the <hi>Beauties</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> known,</l>

                     <l>Thy Lines have heighten'd <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Majesty,</l>

                     <l>Thy charming Verse, and fair Translations show</l>
                     <l>How thy own Lawrel first began to grow;</l>
                     <l>How wild <hi>Lycaon</hi> chang'd by angry Gods,</l>

                     <l>Nor Age, nor Sickness interrupt thy Song:</l>
                     <l>Then may we wondring read how Human Limbs,</l>

                     <l>Of those rich Fruits that on the Fertile Mould</l>
                     <l>Turn'd yellow by degrees, and ripen'd into Gold:</l>
                     <l>How some in Feathers, or a ragged Hide</l>
                     <l>Have liv'd a second Life, and different Natures try'd.</l>
                     <l>Then will thy <hi>Ovid,</hi> thus transform'd, reveal</l>

                     <l>Their Charts some eminent Cape, or Mountain tell,</l>
                     <l>And all the rest but Blanks and Cyphers fill;</l>
                     <l>So we at distance gloomy <hi>Persius</hi> view'd,</l>

Till mighty <hi>Dryden</hi> ventur'd first on Shoar,</l>
                     <l>And the dark unknown Region did explore:</l>

                     <l>Bright and perspicuous, as he is severe:</l>

                  <l>To tune the Lyre, and strike the sounding String:</l>
                  <l>Good Kings are number'd with Immortal Gods,</l>

                  <l>There happy, and Supremely blest,</l>
                  <l>With Mighty <hi>Jove,</hi> his Sire, does feast.</l>
                  <l>See how with Majesty Divine,</l>
                  <l>And dazling Glory, his bright Temples shine:</l>
                  <l>He now an equal God, by Gods is Crown'd,</l>
                  <l>While Golden Harps and Trumpets sound,</l>
                  <l>And to his Health the <hi>Nectar-Bowl</hi> goes round:</l>

                  <l>Not rugged Mountains, nor untrodden Snow,</l>
                  <l>Rivers by Floods increast, no raging Sea,</l>
                  <l>Nor adverse Winds can ever make him stay,</l>
                  <l>When <hi>Love</hi> commands, and <hi>Beauty</hi> leads the way.</l>
                  <l>Souldiers and Lovers, with a careful Eye,</l>
                  <l>Observe the motions of the Enemy:</l>
                  <l>One to the Walls makes his approach in form,</l>
                  <l>Pushes the Siege, and takes the Town by Storm;</l>
                  <l>The other lays his close to <hi>Celia</hi>'s Fort,</l>
                  <l>Presses his point, and gains the wish'd-for Port:</l>
                  <l>As Souldiers, when the Foe securely lies</l>
                  <l>In Sleep and Wine dissolv'd, the Camp surprise</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:48936:159"/>
So when the jealous to their rest remove,</l>
                  <l>And all is husht,—the others steal to Love:</l>
                  <l>Uncertain is the State of Love and War,</l>
                  <l>The vanquish'd rally, and their loss repair,</l>
                  <l>Regain the ground, and rout the Conquerour.</l>
                  <l>You then, who think that Love's an idle fit,</l>
                  <l>Know, that it is the exercise of Wit:</l>
                  <l>In flames of Love the fierce <hi>Achilles</hi> burns,</l>
                  <l>And quitting Arms, absent <hi>Briseis</hi> mourns:</l>
                  <l>From the Embraces of <hi>Andromache</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Went <hi>Hector</hi> arm'd for War and Victory:</l>
                  <l>As <hi>Agamemnon</hi> saw <hi>Cassandra</hi> pass</l>
                  <l>With Hair dishevell'd, and disorder'd Dress,</l>
                  <l>H'admir'd the <hi>Beauties</hi> of the Prophetess:</l>
                  <l>The God of War was caught in th'act of Love;</l>
                  <l>A Story known to all the Court above:</l>
                  <l>Once did I pass my hours in sloth and ease,</l>
                  <l>Cool Shades, and Beds of Down cou'd only please;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:48936:160"/>
When a commanding <hi>Beauty</hi> rais'd my mind,</l>
                  <l>I left all little trifling thoughts behind,</l>
                  <l>And to her Service all my Heart refign'd:</l>
                  <l>Since, like an active Souldier, have I spent</l>
                  <l>My time, in toils of War, in <hi>Beauties</hi> Tent;</l>
                  <l>And for so sweet a pay all dangers underwent:</l>
                  <l>You see, my <hi>Atticus,</hi> by what I prove,</l>
                  <l>Who wou'd not live in Idleness,—must love.</l>

                  <l>Under the Figure of a Swan, betray'd;</l>

                  <l>That rural Fair, admir'd by all the Swains;</l>
                  <l>So fair was You, so much in Love was I,</l>
                  <l>I ran to the extreams of Jealousie,</l>
                  <l>Fear'd Eagles, Bulls, and every shape that <hi>Jove</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Had e're transform'd himself into, for Love:</l>
                  <l>Now free from Love or Fears, my Mind's at ease,</l>
                  <l>Nor does that <hi>Beauty</hi> any longer please:</l>

This humour, you may say, is wondrous strange,</l>
                  <l>And ask the reason of this sudden change;</l>
                  <l>Once, when your undesigning Heart was kind,</l>
                  <l>Fair was your Face, and perfect was your Mind;</l>
                  <l>But now the slighter <hi>Beauties</hi> of the Skin</l>
                  <l>Do yield to the prevailing Vice within:</l>
                  <l>Love is a Child, who uses no deceit,</l>
                  <l>Nor wears he Cloaths to cover any cheat,</l>
                  <l>Accepts no bribes;—why for a wretched Fee</l>
                  <l>Shou'd you then prostitute his Deity?</l>
                  <l>Make <hi>Venus</hi> to her Son serve every day,</l>
                  <l>And drudge i'th' meanest Offices, for pay?</l>
                  <l>They're softly bred, and wou'd not work, but play:</l>
                  <l>The Whore, to whom each Purchaser has right,</l>
                  <l>Forces for gain decaying appetite,</l>
                  <l>Yet there's a Bawd to whom the Spoils accrue;</l>
                  <l>She fain wou'd shun what you by choice pursue:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:48936:161"/>
These sordid ways the very <hi>Brutes</hi> reprove,</l>
                  <l>Who by their practice teach you how to love;</l>
                  <l>The lusty Bull his Female does enjoy,</l>
                  <l>Nor can a bribe their mutual Loves destroy:</l>
                  <l>Woman alone rejoyces in the Spoil,</l>
                  <l>And makes advantages of every smile,</l>
                  <l>Rates at her pleasure the high-priz'd delight,</l>
                  <l>And Men must purchase every happy night;</l>
                  <l>Yet does she meet him with as much desire,</l>
                  <l>And no less fierce and raging is the fire;</l>
                  <l>Since with an equal pace our passions move,</l>
                  <l>Why shou'd one buy, and th' other sell in Love?</l>
                  <l>Why, since the pleasures mutual, shou'd it be</l>
                  <l>To you advantage, and a loss to me?</l>
                  <l>The way is infamous a Witness takes,</l>
                  <l>Who of his Perjury a living makes;</l>
                  <l>So for the raising of a low Estate</l>
                  <l>To set your <hi>Body</hi> at a common rate!</l>

                  <l>That same inimitable White and Red,</l>

                  <l>Oft wou'd she swear by those persuasive Eyes;</l>

In vain are fear'd, are but the tricks of Law,</l>

                  <l>AS Seamen, Shipwrack'd on some happy Shore,</l>
                  <l>Discover Wealth in Lands unknown before;</l>
                  <l>And, what their <hi>Art</hi> had labour'd long in vain,</l>
                  <l>By their Misfortunes happily obtain;</l>
                  <l>So my much envy'd Muse, by storms long tost,</l>
                  <l>Is thrown upon your hospitable Coast,</l>
                  <l>And finds more favour by her ill success,</l>
                  <l>Than she cou'd hope for by her Happiness.</l>

Once <hi>Cato</hi>'s Vertue did the Gods oppose;</l>
                  <l>While they the Victor, He the Vanquish'd chose:</l>
                  <l>But you have done what <hi>Cato</hi> cou'd not do,</l>
                  <l>To chuse the Vanquish'd, and restore him too.</l>
                  <l>Let others still Triumph, and gain their Cause</l>
                  <l>By their Deserts, or by the <hi>World's Applause;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Let Merit Crowns, and Justice Lawrels give,</l>
                  <l>But let me happy by your Pity live.</l>
                  <l>True Poets empty Fame, and Praise despise,</l>
                  <l>Fame is the Trumpet, but your Smile the Prize:</l>
                  <l>You sit above, and see vain Men below</l>
                  <l>Contend, for what you only can bestow:</l>
                  <l>But those great actions, others do by chance,</l>
                  <l>Are, like your <hi>Beauty,</hi> your <hi>Inheritance:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>So great a Soul, such sweetness join'd in one,</l>
                  <l>Cou'd only spring from Noble <hi>Grandison:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>You, like the Stars, not by Reflection bright,</l>
                  <l>Are born to your own Heav'n, and your own light;</l>
                  <l>

Like them are good, but from a <hi>Nobler</hi> Cause,</l>
                  <l>From your own Knowledge, not from <hi>Nature</hi>'s Laws.</l>
                  <l>Your Pow'r you never use, but for Defence,</l>
                  <l>To guard your own, or others Innocence:</l>
                  <l>Your Foes are such, as they, not you, have made,</l>
                  <l>And Vertue may repel, tho' not invade.</l>
                  <l>Such Courage did the <hi>Ancient Heroes</hi> show,</l>
                  <l>Who, when they might prevent, wou'd wait the blow:</l>
                  <l>With such assurance as they meant to say,</l>
                  <l>We will o'recome, but scorn the safest way.</l>
                  <l>What further fear of danger can there be,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Beauty,</hi> which captives all things, sets me free?</l>
                  <l>Posterity will judge by my success,</l>
                  <l>I had the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poet's happiness,</l>
                  <l>Who, waving Plots, found out a better way,</l>
                  <l>Some God descended, and preserv'd the Play.</l>
                  <l>When first the Triumphs of your Sex were sung</l>
                  <l>By those old Poets, <hi>Beauty</hi> was but young,</l>

                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:48936:171"/>
And few admir'd the native Red and White,</l>
                  <l>Till Poets drest them up, to charm the fight;</l>
                  <l>So <hi>Beauty</hi> took on trust, and did engage</l>
                  <l>For Sums of Praises, till she came to <hi>Age.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>But this long growing Debt to Poetry</l>
                  <l>You justly (Madam) have discharg'd to me,</l>

                  <l>New life to my condemn'd and dying Muse.</l>

Our Poets their fled Parts mày draw from hence,</l>
                  <l>And fill their windy Heads with sober Sense.</l>
                  <l>When <hi>London</hi> Votes with <hi>Southwark</hi>'s disagree,</l>
                  <l>Here they may find their long lost Loyalty.</l>
                  <l>Here busie Senates, to th' old Cause inclin'd,</l>
                  <l>May snuff the Votes their Fellows left behind:</l>
                  <l>Your Country Neighbours, when their Grain grows dear,</l>
                  <l>May come and find their <hi>last Provision</hi> here:</l>
                  <l>Whereas we cannot much lament our loss,</l>
                  <l>Who neither carry'd back, nor brought one Cross;</l>
                  <l>We look'd what Representatives wou'd bring,</l>
                  <l>But they help'd us, just as they did the King.</l>
                  <l>Yet we despair not, for we now lay forth</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Sybill</hi>'s Books, to those who know their worth:</l>
                  <l>And tho the first was Sacrific'd before,</l>
                  <l>These Volumes doubly will the price restore.</l>
                  <l>Our Poet bade us hope this Grace to find,</l>
                  <l>To whom by long Prescription you are kind.</l>

He, whose undaunted Muse, with Loyal Rage,</l>
                  <l>Has never spar'd the Vices of the Age,</l>
                  <l>Here finding nothing that his Spleen can raise,</l>

                  <l>GAllants, a bashful Poet bids me say</l>
                  <l>He's come to lose his Maidenhead to day.</l>
                  <l>Be not too fierce, for he's but green of <hi>Age;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And ne're, till now, debauch'd upon the Stage.</l>
                  <l>He wants the suff'ring part of Resolution;</l>
                  <l>And comes with blushes to his Execution.</l>
                  <l>E're you deflow'r his Muse, he hopes the Pit</l>
                  <l>Will make some Settlement upon his Wit.</l>
                  <l>Promise him well, before the Play begin;</l>
                  <l>For he wou'd fain be cozen'd into Sin.</l>
                  <l>'Tis not but that he knows you mean to fail;</l>
                  <l>But, if you leave him after being frail,</l>
                  <l>He'll have, at least, a fair pretence to rail;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:48936:173"/>
To call you base, and swear you us'd him ill,</l>
                  <l>And put you in the new Deserters Bill:</l>
                  <l>Lord, what a Troop of perjur'd Men we see;</l>
                  <l>Enow to fill another Mercury!</l>
                  <l>But this the Ladies may with patience brook:</l>
                  <l>Their's are not the first Colours you forsook!</l>
                  <l>He wou'd be loath the <hi>Beauties</hi> to offend;</l>
                  <l>But, if he shou'd, he's not too old to mend.</l>
                  <l>He's a young Plant, in his first Year of bearing,</l>
                  <l>But his Friend swears, he will be worth the reering.</l>
                  <l>His gloss is still upon him: tho 'tis true</l>
                  <l>He's yet unripe, yet take him for the blue.</l>
                  <l>You think an <hi>Apricot</hi> half green is best;</l>
                  <l>There's sweet and sour: and one side good at least.</l>
                  <l>Mango's and Limes, whose nourishment is little,</l>
                  <l>Tho' not for Food, are yet preserv'd for Pickle.</l>
                  <l>So this green Writer, may pretend, at least,</l>
                  <l>To whet your Stomachs for a better Feast.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:48936:174"/>
He makes this difference in the Sexes too,</l>
                  <l>He sells to Men, he gives himself to you.</l>
                  <l>To both, he wou'd contribute some delight;</l>
                  <l>A mere Poetical Hermaphrodite.</l>
                  <l>Thus he's equipp'd, both to be woo'd, and woo;</l>
                  <l>With <hi>Arms</hi> offensive, and defensive too;</l>
                  <l>'Tis hard, he thinks, if neither part will do.</l>

                     <hi>LOVE</hi>'s Antidote.</head>
                  <l>WHen I sigh by my Mistress, and gaze on those Eyes</l>
                  <l>Where all-conquering Love in Garrison lies.</l>
                  <l>When her Nose I commend with a true <hi>Roman</hi> bend,</l>
                  <l>And run on in Flattery World without end:</l>
                  <l>On her ample high Forehead, and her little soft hand,</l>
                  <l>To which, if compar'd, the best Ivory is tann'd:</l>
                  <l>On the words which with Grace from her Rosie Lips flow,</l>
                  <l>And such Harmony make, as was ne're heard below,</l>
                  <l>Then she bridles the Pride, and swells with Disdain,</l>
                  <l>And slights her <hi>Adorer,</hi> now fast in her Chain.</l>
                  <l>With Scorn in her haughty looks, and in her words Thunder,</l>
                  <l>Then drunken with Love do I reel to the <hi>Wonder:</hi>
                  </l>

Then with three or four Glasses my languishing passes,</l>
                  <l>And off slides the Load, Love lays on his <hi>Asses.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Then I swear I'le for ever keep out of the scrape,</l>
                  <l>Love's Soveraign <hi>Antidote</hi> is the blood of the Grape.</l>

The certain Seasons of the Year to know</l>
                  <l>Great <hi>Jove</hi> has taught us, and from whence they flow,</l>

                     <hi>Droughts, Rains,</hi> and <hi>Winds</hi> their certain <hi>Signs</hi> forego,</l>
                  <l>Those Messengers of Fate fly to provide the way,</l>
                  <l>To give the Signal of a gloomy Day.</l>
                  <l>The Moon her Tokens constantly fulfils,</l>
                  <l>And with her <hi>Beams</hi> points out th' approaching Ills.</l>
                  <l>Her waining Orb puts on a various Form</l>
                  <l>To give the Sign of an impending Storm.</l>
                  <l>When South Winds rise the Herdsmen justly fear,</l>
                  <l>And seek a Shelter when the Tempest's near.</l>
                  <l>First from a gentle blast the Winds arise,</l>
                  <l>Whose Infant Voice in whisp'ring Murmurs flys,</l>
                  <l>Then with loud Clamours fills the troubled Skies.</l>
                  <l>By small degrees advanc'd, it stronger grows,</l>
                  <l>Till every Point each other does oppose.</l>
                  <l>Then through the jarring Zones it frets and roars,</l>
                  <l>And lifts the swelling <hi>Billows</hi> to the Shores.</l>

Vast watry Mountains rowl upon the Sand,</l>
                  <l>And angry Surges beat the trembling Land.</l>
                  <l>A harsh, shrill noise the ecchoing Caverns fills,</l>
                  <l>And strikes the Ear from the resounding Hills;</l>
                  <l>Whose <hi>Reverend Tops,</hi> with aged Pine-trees crown'd,</l>
                  <l>Rock with the Wind, and tremble with the sound.</l>

                  <l>The frightned Native of the troubled Waves</l>
                  <l>His long accustom'd Habitation leaves.</l>
                  <l>Now born aloft a winged <hi>Army</hi> soar</l>
                  <l>To seek for safety on a calmer Shore.</l>
                  <l>The More-Hen, conscious of the Tempest near,</l>
                  <l>Plays on the Sand, and so prevents her fear.</l>
                  <l>The Hern forsakes his ancient marshy <hi>Bed,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And tow'rs to Heav'n while Clouds bedew his head.</l>
                  <l>Sometimes he's met by a descending Star,</l>
                  <l>Which warns the Tempest rushing from afar.</l>

                  <l>It cuts the Shadows with a Train of Light,</l>

                  <l>And quits the thund'ring Regions of the North:</l>
                  <l>When East and West in distant Poles conspire,</l>
                  <l>Uniting Rage, to swell the Deluge higher,</l>
                  <l>With rapid Streams the full-charg'd Chanels flow,</l>
                  <l>Collecting Forces as they farther go.</l>
                  <l>Th' unruly Tide no sturdy <hi>Banks</hi> controul,</l>
                  <l>O're unknown Plains the furious Torrents rowl.</l>
                  <l>The Reapers mourn to see the Deluge bear</l>

                  <head>THE LIFE OF Fracastorius.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FRacastorius</hi> was descended from the <hi>Fracastorian</hi> Family of great Antiquity in <hi>Verona.</hi> He seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only to rival the Fame of <hi>Catullus</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> who had long before made that City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd, but to have very far exceeded all his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, for Learning and Poetry. His Parents were <hi>Paulo-Philippus Fracastorius,</hi> and <hi>Camilla Mascarellia,</hi> both of great Reputation. He was so well educated by his Father, that he gave early proofs of a great Genius, so that in his Childhood all men conceived hopes of an extraordinary man. Nor was Providence wanting to give him a signal Testimony, forasmuch as when he was an Infant in the Arms of his Mother, a sudden Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest arising, in which the Mother was struck dead by
<pb facs="tcp:48936:260"/>
Lightning, the Child received no harm. He was sent for literature while very young to <hi>Padua,</hi> where even in that Age with indefatigable labour, he opened his way to that height of Glory which he afterwards attained: After the initiatory Arts he applied himself to the secrets of distinct Sciences, but infinitely delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Mathematicks, in all, assisted by a Memory equal to his Ingenuity. After several years spent in Philosophical studies under the Tutorship of <hi>Peter Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponatius</hi> of <hi>Mantua;</hi> he devoted himself by the dictates of his Genius to Physick, with such resolution and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that in the School disputations, not only his fellow Students, but most experienc'd Doctors, were sensible that he was designed by Providence for great Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Accordingly they then gave him the honour of the Pulpit, which had never before been permitted to any person till they had perfected their studies, and were arrived to the years of Manhood. This School being dissolv'd by the breaking out of the War, while he had thoughts of returning to his Countrey (his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being then dead) he was on honourable conditions invited by <hi>Livianus,</hi> General of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces, and a noble Patron of Wit, to the College <hi>Forojulien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> &amp;c.—and lodged in the same apartment of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Naugerus</hi> and <hi>Johannes Cottac,</hi> two excellent Poets. He had not long resided here before he published Verses on every extraordinary Occasion that happened, which were received with such general applause throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> that their fame has to this day stifled the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of his Companions. Having afterwards accompanied <hi>Livianus</hi> through many Wars, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral being at last overthrown and taken Prisoner by the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Abdua;</hi> he returned late into his native
<pb facs="tcp:48936:260"/>
Countrey, where in the general devastation he found his Patrimony almost utterly destroyed.</p>
                  <p>He marry'd, but was soon unhappy in the loss of two Sons, whose untimely Death he bewailed in a most passionate Elegy. He was low of Stature, but of good bulk, his Shoulders broad, his Hair black and long, his Face round, his Eyes black, his Nose short and turning upwards by his continual contemplation of the Stars, a lively air was spread over his Countenance, that displayed the Serenity and Ingenuity of his Mind. He affected a quiet and private life, as being a Man free from abmitious desires; contenting himself with a moderate fortune, and placing his happiness in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his knowledge. He was cheerful though frugal at his Table, having a constant regard to his health; his Wit being always the best part of his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. He was notwithstanding sparing in his Speech, and affecting no vanity in his Dress: he was never cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious of other Mens performances, but always glad of an occasion to commend; for which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly celebrated by <hi>Johannes Baptista</hi> in a noble E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigram. He spent his time in curing the diseased, a divine Power seeming always to attend his endeavours, above the sordid desire of gain, and thought himself best rewarded in the health of his Patient. By these means he contracted many friendships, and had (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly) no Enemy.</p>
                  <p>He was not only esteemed for his skill in his own Countrey, but was sought to by foreign Princes in desperate sickness, for which though vast rewards were offered, he brought nothing home beside their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p>In his leisure he diverted himself with reading Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, at which time <hi>Polybius,</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi> were never
<pb facs="tcp:48936:261"/>
out of his hands. He sometimes relieved his Studies with Mathematicks and Musick, and made no <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mall performances in Cosmography. He was much alone, yet always employed; and though by reason of his backwardness to discourse, he seemed of a Saturnine Temper, yet none were more chearful and pleasant when entred into Coversation. He performed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by his exact knowledge of Herbs and Simples, by searching the best Books of the Ancients. That most excellent Antidote called <hi>Diascordium,</hi> was of his preparing; we are likewise beholding to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for specifying many useful Herbs, of which the Ancients had left uncertain description. The Age in which he lived saw nothing equal to his Learning, but his honesty. In his retreat from the City, while the Pestilence raged, he found leisure to compose the following Poem, a work of such elegance, that <hi>Sana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarius</hi> freely acknowledged it to excell his own, <hi>De partu Virginis,</hi> that had cost him above twenty years labour and correction. His Treatises in Prose and efforts of Poetry are too numerous to be recited on this occasion.</p>
