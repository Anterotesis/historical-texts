         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS the Countrie have offered to Maſter <hi>Burrell</hi> and his Aſſociates, for the drayning of the great Levell in the ſixe Counties aforeſayd, and for the maintenance of the worke, beeing done, the quantitie of 80000 Acres, of which he offereth to ingage vnto the Countrie but 10000 Acres for the maintenance of the worke.</p>
            <p>Wee offer, that if the Countrie will or can allott the ſayd proportion of 80000 Acres to us, we will undertake to drayne the ſayd Levell, and will ingage 15000 Acres, and a rent of 4 <hi>d.</hi> the Acre out of the whole 80000 Acres amounting to 1333 l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> for the maintenance of our worke, and will give to every Cottager, whoſe houſe ſhall happen to ſtand upon any part of the Land allotted to us, the ſumme of foure pounds towards the erecting of a new houſe, in ſome other part of the Common.</p>
            <p>But becauſe we conceiue it very difficult (if not impoſſible) to apportion, and ſet out a certaine number of Acres, out of ſo many and various particulars, as muſt neceſſarily be conteined in ſo great a quantitie of ground, unleſſe the ſame ſhould be taken only out of the Commons, and the ſeueralls ſpared, which we cannot conceiue reaſonable, we therefore propound as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. FIRST, whereas by the Lawe, the Commiſſioners of Sewers have no power to make a bargaine for any Compoſition of Land, till a taxe be ſet, and not paid, at the day appointed: We deſire that a taxe of tenne ſhilling be laid upon every Acre of land, that lyeth under the high-water-marke, or is annoyed with freſh or ſalt water, or ſhall receive benefit, or eaſe by drayning within the Levell; to which lowe demand we are deſcended, for the eaſe of the Countrie, which taxe muſt be paid at a day certaine, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the hands of ſuch as the Commiſſioners ſhall thinke fit to keepe it, the Vndertakers to have proportionably thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch parts and proportions of the ſaid ſurrounded grounds, as they ſhall from time to time drayne; PROVIDED that the ſayd part be firſt adiudged drayned, and exceed the quantitie of 100000 Acres.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SECONDLY, For ſo much of this taxe, as ſhall not be paid at the day appointed; we deſire of the worſt Land, one halfe; Of the ſecond ſort, one third part; Of the third ſort, one fourth part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIRDLY, Whoſoever ſhall thinke fit, to redeeme ſuch part or proportion of his owne Lands, being ſeverall, as by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners ſhall be allotted to the Vndertakers, ſhall (if he deſire it) adventure ſeven ſhilling for every Acre of his Land, cha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ged with the ſayd taxe of tenne ſhilling (the eſtimate being ſet downe under his hand, of the whole number of Acres of his ſayd Land) ſo, as it be within 5 of 100, and 50 of 1000; and ſo ſhall not part with any Land of his at all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. FOVRTHLY, Whoſoever ſhall be unable or unwilling to pay the taxe of tenne ſhilling the Acre, or to venture ſeven ſhilling the Acre, and yet willing to redeeme his ſeveralls, given by the Commiſſioners. We therefore make this offer, that he ſhall, if he pleaſe, have a defeazance, or ſuch other ſecuritie, as by Councell ſhall be adviſed from us: That if he pay thirteen ſhilling foure pence for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every Acre of his ſaid ſeveralls, charged with the ſaid taxe of tenne ſhilling, after they are adiudged drayned by the Commiſſioners, then he ſhall retaine all his ſeveralls to himſelfe. PROVIDED, that he demand the ſayd defeazance, or other ſecuritie, within one moneth after the Act or Decree of Sewers, whereby his Land ſhall be decreed to us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. FIFTLY, And becauſe we deſire to give all poſſible eaſe, and content to the Country, wee are content that one ſhilling of the taxe of tenne ſhillings for euery Acre be left in the hands of the owner, and one ſhilling of the ſeuen adventured, and one ſhilling foure pence of the mony due by the defeazance, ſhall remaine in the hands of the owners, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> urgent occaſion and neceſſitie force vs to call, for ſome part, or the whole, which yet we hope we ſhall not need. But for the further eaſe of the Country, we are content that they ſhall pay the ſaid ſeven ſhillings Adventure, for euery Acre of their ſeveralls, in manner and forme following. <hi>vz.</hi> two ſhillings within one moneth after the taxe is ſet, and two ſhilling two moneths after, and the other two ſhilling two moneths after that: one ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling being ſtill left in their hands as aforeſaid. And for the twelve ſhilling of the thirteene ſhilling foure pence, to be paid after the worke ſhall be adiudged drayned, we demand to have it paid as followeth; <hi>vz.</hi> foure ſhillings within one moneth, and foure ſhillings three moneths after that, and the other foure ſhilling three moneths after that.</p>
            <p n="6">

               </gap>. SIXTHLY, If the houſe of any Cottager ſhall happen to ſtand in any part of any Common allotted to us, wee will build him an other in ſome convenient place in or upon the ſame Common.</p>
            <p>If any of theſe three particular offers be accepted, we will undertake a generall drayning of the Fennes, and other Grounds annoyed with freſh or ſalt waters, within this Levell, and will expect no recompence, but out of ſuch lands, as ſhalbe adiudged drayned, or ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as the Countries ſhall agree to giue before hand by way of Adventure.</p>
            <p>Wee will undertake to make good and maintaine for ever, at our owne charge, all ſuch draynes and workes, as wee ſhall make, and will ingage for the performance thereof, a reaſonable proportion of Land, as ſhall be agreed upon betweene us and the Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>That all the maine workes ſhall be made Nauigable, and be built for the moſt part, with Bricke and Stone.</p>
            <p>That all Owners of Land and parties intereſſed ſhall haue libertie to adventure, after the rate of other adventurers.</p>
            <p>That wee will vndertake to performe all this within foure yeeres to bee accompted from the time, the bargaine ſhall be fully perfected, with the Commiſſioners and the country. So vve receive no impediment from the Commiſſioners, nor the Country.</p>
