            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

went out at the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> to
wait on my Maſter) that I could
find to convey any Letters to your
hands, by which I can now acquaint you with
nothing that is likely to afford you any content
or ſatisfaction, but onely this; That my ſelf, with
ſome other of your friends here amongſt us, are
in good health; and that indeed is a greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
then we deſerve; and God make us ſenſible
of his mercie that affords us it to ſweeten all our
other calamities, which it hath lately pleaſed him
to poure upon us in a very plentifull meaſure: his
will be done, and hallowed be his name; and
yet how great ſoever our ſufferings &amp; afflictions
have lately been, they are like to prove but the
beginning of ſorrows, and prologue to that full
Scene of miſerie, which in probabilitie we ſhall
ſhortly act: The King being in no condition to
<pb facs="tcp:40692:3"/>
keep the field, he dares not reſt in any Garriſon
for fear of being beſieged; we have no ſtrength
at all of our own; and there is ſo much profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and irreligion, ſo much violence and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion
amongſt us, that I know not how to
expect any aſsiſtance from above, that God can
bleſſe the proceedings of ſo wicked an Armie,
whoſe ſinnes increaſe with our puniſhments.
We are here now at <hi>Wooburn</hi> within 26. miles of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Enemie at <hi>Nopthampton,</hi> with a
greater power to get between us and home. We
march long and tedious marches to prevent it;
yeſterday from <hi>Huntington,</hi> and ſet not out till
eleven a clock; The King is in ſuch a condition
that he knows not which way to turn himſelf:
God Almighty may pleaſe to manifeſt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
his power and goodneſſe in our weakneſſe
and ſinfulneſſe; for I have learned from him
that our extremitie is his opportunitie: and truly
upon that prop I reſt my ſelf, reſolved to run the
ſame fortune to the uttermoſt that it ſhall pleaſe
God to ſend my Maſter. My attendance on him
at this inſtant calls upon me to break off abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and tell you that I am and ever ſhall continue</p>
