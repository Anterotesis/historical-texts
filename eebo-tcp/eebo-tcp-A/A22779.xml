            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the reader.</head>
            <p>DEmosthenes the renowmed O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
defyneth law in this wise.
The law (sayth he) is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing that all
men ought to obey for many skylles,
but in especial bicause law is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; also the gifte of god, the decree
of prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chastisement of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; vnwilfull offenses, &amp; finally the
common suretie of a realme wherby
it becommeth al men to liue which be
conuersant in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. Chrysippus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t philosopher thus begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his boke of lawes. The lawe is
kinge of all aswel diuine as humane
affaires, the preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and comptroller
of thinges honest and dishonest, the
prince, captaine and ruler of the iuste
and iniust, &amp; it is of ciuile-creatures
aswell the commaunder, what they
ought to do, as the forbydder, what
<pb facs="tcp:27056:2"/>
they ought not to do. These auntike
sayenges of wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> assuredly ought
moch to inflame vs to the knowledge
of those thinges, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out which we shal
be estemed no men but as brute and
sauage beastes. Let vs not commyt,
that it be sayd of vs English men, as
it was ones said of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men of Athens,
that is, that we make very goodly &amp;
profytable lawes, but we vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not.
Certainly there can be no greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche
to a common weale then thys.
One lesson I wolde we lerned of the
auncient lawyer Romain named Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and that is this. The knowledge
of lawes is not to beare awey y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordꝭ
but the pyth &amp; power of them. This
he wrote bicause there be many which
when good &amp; holsom lawes be made,
seke not to se them executed, &amp; obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
but rather how to defraude them
<pb facs="tcp:27056:3"/>
and to haue them vnexecuted, whiche
kinde of people after the sentence of
most ancient lawmakers be no lesse
worthy of reprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they which
do expresly against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law. Now, they
do (say they) against the law which do
the thing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law forbyddeth. And
they defraude a law or statute, which
the wordes of the law saued, do circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
the meaning and sentence of it.
Let vs tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so read the lawes, that we
may beare awey the sentence &amp; mynd
of them, and so fulfyl and obserue the
lawes, that it maye appeare that they
were not made in vayn. Thus doing,
we shal please god, we shal be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
subiectes to oure
prince, and finally we
shall seke our own
weale and
sauetye.</p>

of more amplitude and excellencye
than other some be, as that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce
whyche is pure, simple, and

is it called fee tayle, of which also be

               <p>FEe simple is (as I sayd) the most

               <p>So then tenaunte in fee simple is he
that hath landes or tenementes (whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
it be by purchase or by discent)

these be the onlye wordes that make

that is to saye, free mariage and free

in franke mariage wythout further
addicion or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion of heires, this is
an estate of inheritaunce, as we shal

In likewyse it is of landes giuen to
an house ecclesiastical in pure &amp; fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k
almes. Moreouer if landes be giuen
to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; to his blode, or to him &amp; to

this word seed, and bloud, and suche
lyke do implye wordes of inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
               <p>But nowe it is to be sene who be
sayde a mannes heyres in the lawe.
Ye shall therfore knowe, that my
brother or syster by the halfe bloude,
<pb facs="tcp:27056:21"/>
that is to wytte, by the fathers syde,
and not by the mothers, or contrary
wyse by the mothers and not by the
fathers, shall neuer be myne heyre,
nor none that come of them.</p>
               <p>Neither my bastarde can be myne

ne mother, nor grandefather ne

               <p>For it is a principle and grounde in
the lawe, that inheritaunce may lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
descend, but ascende it may not.
And therfore if I haue landes in fee
simple and dye wythout issue of my
bodye, my father can not be myne
heire, but my fathers brother or sys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shal, and then if my vncle or aunt
dye seased wythout issue, my father
shal haue the landes as heir to myne
vncle or to my aunte, but heyre to me
he can not be. But it maye go from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27056:21"/>
me to myne vncle or aunte well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe,
for that is not called a linial

               <p>And ye shal note, that by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
lawe of this realme, my eldest sonne
shall haue the hole inheritaunce, and
after hym if he hathe no issue, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
sonne, and so forth. And if I
haue no sonnes but daughters, than
shal al the daughters togither inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
if I haue no issue at all, neither
son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

eldest brother in heritage succede me
but if I haue no brother, than my
systers if I haue any, if not my vncle
by my fathers syde, if the landes be
of myne owne purchase. And to be
shorte if there be none in lyfe of my
fathers syde, it shall goo to my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
syde, and if there can be found
no heyre neither by fathers syde ne
<pb facs="tcp:27056:22"/>
yet by mothers, then shall it reuerte
and eschete (as they call it) to the lord
of whome it was holden, for euerye
lande must nedes be holden of some
lorde, as shall be here after shewed.
But if landes descende vnto me by
my mothers syde, than if I fayle of
issue, the landes shall descende onely
to my heyres of my mothers syde, &amp;
neuer to myne heyres of my fathers
syde: as on the contrarye syde, yf I
haue landes or any hereditamentes
by disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my father or his blode,
they shal neuer descend to my heires
by my mothers syde.</p>
               <p>Thus ye se a greate difference in
this behalfe, bitwene purchased lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and landes which descende from
my auncestoure.</p>
               <p>Yf there be thre sonnes, and the
myddell sonne purchaseth landes &amp;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27056:22"/>
dye wythout issue, the heldeste shall
haue the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and not the yongest.</p>
               <p>Also it is a principle in oure law,
that none can be myne heyre of landꝭ
that I holde in fee simple, onles he
be myne heyre by the hole blode that
is to say, both by father and mother,
for if a man hathe issue two or thre
sonnes by sondry wyues, and the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
purchaseth landes in fee and dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth
wythout issue, his halfe brethren
I meane those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be not his brethren
bothe by the fathers syde &amp; mothers
syde shall not haue the lande, but it
shall go to his vncle. Lykewyse if a
man hath by his fyrste wyfe a sonne
and a daughter, and by his seconde
wyfe an other sonne, and the sonne
by the fyrst wyfe purchaseth landes
in fee, and dyethe wythout issue: the
syster german shall haue the landes
<pb facs="tcp:27056:23"/>
by disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as heyre to her brother, and
not to the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger brother. Otherwise
it is of landes or other hereditame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tꝭ
entailed as shalbe herafter specified.</p>
               <p>Also if a man be seised of landes

and daughter by one wyfe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
a sonne by an other, and dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth,
and the eldest sonne entreth in to
the landes, and after dyeth wythout
lawfull issue of his body, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shall haue the landes and not the
yongest sonne, and yet the yongest
sonne is heyre to his father, but he is
not so to his brother. But if in thys
case the eldeste sonne had not entred
after the death of his father but had
died before any entre made by hym,
than shal not the syster germaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
but the yonger brother is heire to
his father, bicause the eldest brother
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27056:23"/>
was neuer in actuall possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
is requisyte to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> personne that clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

a sonne &amp; daughter by one wyfe,
and afterwarde a sonne by an other,
he dyethe, the eldeste sonne entrethe
not, but dyeth wythout issue before
he can make any actuall entree, hys
syster shall not haue the landes as
heyre to her brother, bycause her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was neuer actually possessed,
but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger brother shall haue them
as heyre to his father. Yet if theldest
sonne in that case had lefte behynde
him issue of his body, whether it had

wythstandyng that the father of the

issue was neuer possessed either actu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally,
or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, shal haue the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des,

linial heyre, where as the brother, sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
vncle, aunt. &amp;c. be heyres collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and so obserue a dyuersitie.</p>
               <p>I call an actuall possession, whan
a man entreth in dede in to landes to
him desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, but a possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in lawe,
is called when landes be descended
to a persone, ann he hath not yet real
ly and actually e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred in to them. For
notwythstandydge that he is not in
actuall possession yet he is possessed
in the lawe, that is to say, in the eye &amp;
consyderation of the law, for asmuch
as he is tenaunt to euery mans acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that wyll sue for the sayd landes,
for els there shulde insue an intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

               <p>Ye shall vnderstande that thys
worde inheritaunce is not onelye to
be accommodate and applied to that
whyche commeth by discente from a

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Fee tayle.</head>
               <p>Ye shall vnderstande, that before
a certayne statute called the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Westminster seconde, there
was no state tayle, but all was fee
simple, eyther purely that is to saye,
wythout condition or condicinallye:
as appereth by the pretence of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> said
statute, but now sythens the promul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gating
of that statute diuers formes
of state tayles haue rysen.</p>
               <p>Fee tayle is whan it is prescribed
and lymytted in the gifte, what hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
and by whome engendred shall
<pb facs="tcp:27056:25"/>
inherite. As for exemple I gyue lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
to a man and to his heyres and
go no further, this is fee simple: but
if I make a limitation, and adde of
his hody begotten, now is it fee taile
that is to saye, a fee or inheritaunce
limitted, prescribed, determinate, or
assigned. So that if I gyue landes
to a man and to his heyres, he hathe
fee simple, but yf I gyue landes to
hym and to hys heyres of hys bodye
lawfully begotten, he hathe but a fee
tayle, for asmoche as I appoynte, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte,
prescribe and determyne the
heyres, and for lacke of suche heyres
the gyfte shall be expired and worne
out, &amp; the landes shall reuerte agayn
to the gyuer or his heyres.</p>
               <p>But ye muste obserue that there
bo two kyndes of fee tayle. There is
a generall tayle, and there is a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27056:25"/>
tayle. Fee tayle generall is as
where landes be giuen to a man and
to his heyres of his bodye begotten,
without anye mencyonynge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressynge
by what woman they are
to be begotten. And therefore yfa ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be tenaunte in the generall tayle of
landes, and taketh a wyfe and hathe
issue by her, and she dyeth and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
he takethe an other wyfe, of
whom he hath also other issue, here
either of these issue is inheritable to
this land entayled. But if I expresse
in the gifte by what woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heires
shall be procreate and inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, then
is it an especiall tayle, as for exemple
to make the thynge playne, if landes
be gyuen to a man and to the heyres
of his body lawfully begotten by Ka<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therin
his wyfe, this is an especiall
tayle, for the issue of him begotten by
<pb facs="tcp:27056:26"/>
an other woman, shal neuer inherite
by force &amp; vertue of the tayle. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
it is, if landes be giuen to a wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man
and to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> heires of her body law
fully begotten (&amp; shewe not by what
man) this is a general taile, but if I
adde &amp; saye by suche a man her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande,
than is it an especiall taylle.</p>
               <p>Also yf I gyue landes to a man
and to hys wyfe, and to the heyres
of there two bodyes lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
thys ys an especyal tayle, as wel
in the husbande as in the wyfe,</p>
               <p>Semblably it is, yf a man gyueth
landes to an other man wyth hys
daughter or kynswoman in francke
mariage, thys emplyeth a state tayle
especiall, and in thys case as wel the
man as the woman hathe estate in
in the speciall tayle.</p>
               <p>But yf I gyue landes to a man
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27056:26"/>
and to suche a woman, and to hys
heyres that he shall begette of her:
here the woman hathe estate but for
terme of her lyfe, and the husbands
an estate in the especyall tayle. In
lykewise it is on the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s behalfe,
as if I gyue landes to a man and to
hys wyfe, and to her heyres of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye
of her said husbande engendred,
he hathe an estate but for terme of
lyfe, and she an estate in the specyall
tayle. But in bothe cases, yf I hadde
sayde to the heyres and not hys or
her heyres, than shulde eyther of
them haue hadde an estate in the spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyall
tayle, bycause thys worde hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
is as well referred to the one as
to the other.</p>
               <p>Ye shall also vnderstande, that yf
landes be giuen to a man, ond to the
heyres males of his bodye, this ys a
<pb facs="tcp:27056:27"/>
state tayle, and in this case the heyre
femalle shall neuer inherite.</p>
               <p>Finally it is to be noted, that of
landes whych a man hath in fee sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the possession of the brother shall
cause the syster germayne that is to
saye, the syster bothe by the fathers
syde &amp; mothers, to inherite, and not
the brother by the halfe blod, as here
tofore was said, but of landes which
be entayled otherwise it is. Therfore
if a man be seysed of landes in the
generall tayle, and hath issue by hys
furst wyfe, a sonne and a daughter,
and also a sonne by an other wyfe, &amp;
dyeth, and the eldest sonne entreth in
to the landes &amp; after dyeth, the suster
germayne shall not haue the landes
but the yonger brother of the halfe
blode, bycause whosoeuer shall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
landes in taile, must claym them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27056:27"/>
as nexte and immediate heyre, not to
hym that dyeth last seased of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> landꝭ;
but to hym vnto whome the landes
were fyrst gyuen, whyche in the case
before remembred, is the sonne and
not the daughter.</p>
               <p>Thus ye shal marke obserue a great
diuersitie bytwene the forme of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessyon
in landes of fee simple, and
the forme in fee tayle.</p>

               <p>Nowe partycion maye be made

they them selues do make particion

               <p>There is also an other forme of

               <p>That yf any of the parceners wil

For the land holden in villenage

               <p>And here ye shall vnderstande,
that seruitute or villenage, is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
not of the law of nature but
of that law, which is called <hi>Ius gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>

the benefyte of manumission. Manu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mission
is <hi>de manu datio,</hi> that is to
saye a gyuynge out of the hande or

without the compulsion of the lawe
euen by his owne propre power and

there is commonly reserued one
rente or other: therefore I thynke it
good sumwhat to treate of rentes.
But ye must vnderstande that there
be sundry sortes of rentes. There is
one kynde of rente whyche is called
rent seruice. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n other whiche is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
rent charge, and the thyrde which
is named in frenche rente secke, that
is to saye in latyne <hi>redditus siccus,</hi>
a drye rente. Nowe rent seruice is so
called, bycause it is knyt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tenure,
and is as it were a seruice, wherby a
man holdeth his landes or teneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tꝭ,
or at lest way when the rente is vnse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerably
<pb facs="tcp:27056:60"/>
coupled and knyt wyth the
seruice, as for an exemple, where the
tenant holdeth his lande of the king
or of any other lorde by fealtie and
by certaine rente, or by homage, feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and certaine rent, or by any other
sortes of seruices &amp; by certaine rent,
this rent is called rente seruice. And
here ye shal note, that if this rent ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice,
be at any time when it ought to
be payed, behynde and vnpayde, the
lorde of whom the land or tenement
is so holden, whether it be in fee sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
fe taile, for terme of life for yeres
or at wyll, may of common right en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
and distraine for the rent, though
there be no mencion at all, ne clause
of distresse put in the dede or lease. I
said before, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nature of this rent
seruice is to be coupled and knyt to
the tenure. For where no tenure is,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27056:60"/>
there can be no rent seruice. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore,
if at this day I be seised of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
in fee simple, and make a dede of
feffement of the same to an other in
fe simple, reseruing by the same dede
a rente, thys can be called no rente
seruice, bicause there can be nowe no
tenure betwene the feffoure and the
feffee. Otherwise it is of feffementes
in fee simple, made before the statute
of Westmester the thirde called <hi>Quia
emptores terraru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For before the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king
of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> statute, if a man had made
a feoffement in fe simple, reseruynge
to him a certayne rent, yea though it
had bene w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out dede, here had bene
created a new tenure betwene the fef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>foure
and the feffee, and the feffee
shuld haue holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the feffoure, who
by vertue of the same myght of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
right haue distreyned for suche
<pb facs="tcp:27056:61"/>
rent. But at this daye, by force of the
sayde acte, there can be no suche hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
or tenure created nor begonne,
and consequently no rent seruice can
be at this daye reserued vpon anye
gyfte in fee simple, except it be in the
kinges case, who being chiefe lord of
all euer might and may giue landes
to be holden of him. Thus ye se, that
at this day, no subiect can reserue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rente seruice vnto him, onles the
reuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the landes or tenementes
that he shall graunt, be styll in him,
as where he grauntethe them in fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tayle, or maketh but a lease for terme
of lyfe or for certayne yeares or ells
at wil. For in al these cases the reuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion
of the fee simple remayneth styll
in hym, and therfore if here be anye
rent reserued, it is to be called a rent
seruice, and is of common right dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treynable,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27056:61"/>
though there be no clause
of distresse in the dede of feffemente
or lease.</p>
               <p>But here ye wyl aske me, when in
the case before remembred, a man at
this daye gyuethe cleane aweye the
lande or tenement from himselfe in
fee simple, so that there is no maner
of reuersion of the same remaynyng
in him at all, and yet neuertheles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
vnto hym by hys dede a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
rent: what maner rent this shal
be called? I answer, if there be in the
dede indented any clause of distresse
put, that is, that if the rent be behind
vnpayed, it shalbe lawful for the fef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foure
to entre and to distreyne, it is
called a rente charge, forasmoche as
the lande is charged therwyth, but
howe? of common right? no, but only
by vertue and force of the wrytynge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:27056:62"/>
But on the other syde, if there be no
suche clause of distresse put in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture,
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rent so reserued shal
be called a rent secke.</p>
               <p>Likewyse, if a man that is seised of
certaine landes, wyll graunte eyther
by inde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture or by his dede polle that
is to saye single and not indented, a
yearly rent out of the same landes to
an other, whether it be in fe simple, fe
tayle, for terme of lyfe, for yeares, or
at wyll, wyth clause of distresse, then
this rent is called a rente charge and
he to whom suche rente is graunted
may for defaulte of payment therof,
entre and distreine. But contrarely,
if the graunte be made wythout any
such clause of distresse, it is called re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
secke that is to say a dry rent, bicause
he can not come to it in case it be deni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed,
by way of distresse in so moch that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27056:62"/>
if he were neuer seysed of it, he is by

shillinges sterlyng, that then it shall
be lawfull for the sayd Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Style
to distreyne for it in the Manoure of

the Manoure is charged with

in this case the persone of

any a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nuitie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd Ihon at Style
but onely grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that he might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyne
for suche yearly rent.</p>
               <p>Furthermore ye shall note, that if
a man hath a rent charge to him and
to his heires co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng out of certeyne
landes, and doth purchase any parcel
of this land to him and to his heires,
in thys case the hole rente charge is
qwenched and gone, and the annuite
<pb facs="tcp:27056:64"/>
also, the cause is this, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a rent charge
can not be in suche case apporcioned.
Otherwise it is of a rent service, for if
one whiche hath a rent seruice as for
exemple, xx d. by yeare doth purchase
parcel of the lande out of which this
yearly rent of, xx d. is commyng, this
shal not extinguish ne drowne y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hole
rent, but for that parcell only. For re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
seruice in suche case may very wel be
apporcionate and rated according to
the value of the lande. Yet there be
some sortes of rentes seruices which
in no wyse can be apporcioned. As
where a tenaunt holdeth his lande of
his lorde by the seruice to re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre to his
lorde yearly at suche a feast, an horse,
a ring of gold, a redde rose, a gylouer

                  </gap> suche lyke, if in this case the lorde
doth purchase parcell of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> land thus
of him holden, this seruice is gone, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:27056:64"/>
such seruice can not be seuered
ne apporcioned. Also escuage is a ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice
that may very well be apporcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
accordinge to the afferaunce and
rate of the lande.</p>
               <p>But where any lande is holden by
homage and fealtie, if the lorde pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaseth
parcel of the land, yet he shal
haue hys homage and fealtie styll of
his tenaunte.</p>
               <p>Ye shall marke also, that if a man
maketh a lease of landes to an other
for terme of lyfe, reseruing to him cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine
rent: if in this case he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth
the rent to Iohn at Style sauing to
himselfe the reuersion of the said la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
thys rente is but rente secke bycause
Iohn at Style y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hath the rent, hath
nothing in the reuersion of the land.
But if he graunteth the reuersion of

<pb facs="tcp:27056:65"/>
of lyfe and the tenaunt atturneth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
then hath Iohn at Noke

I Shewed you before, that for a re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
seruice if it be behynde, ye may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayne
in the grounde euen of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

a rente charge ye maye distreyne or
bryng your wryt of annuitie at your
choise and election, as before is decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red.
But of a rent secke if ye were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
seised of it nor of any parcel ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
ye be without remedy by course of
the como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law, for ye can not distreyne
for it, nor yet bryng your wrytte of an
nuitie, but if ye were ones seised of it
or of parcel therof and it is estsones
behinde, then youre remedie shall be
this. Ye must go either by your selfe
or by your deputye to the lande or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement
out of which the rent is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng,
and there demaunde the arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragies
<pb facs="tcp:27056:66"/>
of the rent, whiche if the tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
denye to paye, this denyal is a dissei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
of the rent. Also if the tenaunt be
not then ready to pay it, this counter
uayleth a denyal which is a disseisin.
Moreouer if neither the tenaunt nor
none other man be remayning vpon
the grounde to pay the rent, when ye
demaund the arreragies, this also is
a denyall in the law, and is in very
dede a disseisin. And of these disseisinꝭ
ye may haue an assise of nouell dissei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
against the tenaunt, and shal reco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
seisin of the rent aud the arrera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
and youre damagies and costes
of your wrytte and of your plee. And
if after suche recouery and execution
had, the rente be agayne at an other
tyme denyed you, then ye may haue a
redisseisin and shal recouer your dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
dammagies. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:27056:66"/>
It shalbe therfore good wisdome
for a man when a rent is grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by
any persone vnto him, to take of the
tenant of the land a peny or an halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peny
in name of seisin of the rent, and
then if at the next day of paiment the
rent be denyed him, he may haue an
Assise of nouel disseisin.</p>
               <p>And ye shall note, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there be thre
causes of disseisin of rent seruice, that
is to wete, rescouse, repleuin &amp; inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.
Rescouse is, when the lorde vpon
the lande holden of him, distreyneth
for his rent behynde, and the distresse
is rescued from him, or if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lord come
vpon the land and wyl distreine, and
the tenant or any other man for hym
wyl not suffre him, this is called Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couse.</p>
               <p>Repleuin is, when the lorde hath
<pb facs="tcp:27056:67"/>
distreyned &amp; repleuin is made of the
distresse by wryt or by playnt. Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
is when landes or tenementes be
so inclosed that the lord can not come
within the landes or tenementes for
to distreyne. And the chefe cause why
suche thinges so made be disseisins
to the lorde is for asmoch as the lord
is by this wey disturbed of the mean
and remedy wherby he ought to com
and haue his rent, that is to wete, by
distresse.</p>
               <p>And there be iiiij. causes of dissei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
of a rent charge, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is to wete, res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous,
repleuin, encloser, and denyer.
For denyer or denyal is aswell a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seisine
of a rente charge, as it is of a
rent secke.</p>
               <p>Finally ye shal vnderstande, that
there be two causes of disseisin of a
rent secke, that is, denyall &amp; en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loset.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:27056:67"/>
And is semeth that there is yet an
other cause of disseisin of all the three
rentes aforesaid, that is to wete this,
when the lorde commeth to the lande
holden of him, or when he that hath
a rent charge or a rent seck commeth
to the lande to distreyne for the rente
behynd, and the tenant hearing this,
encountreth him, and forstalleth him
the weye wyth force and armes, and
manaceth him in such sort as he dare
not come to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ground for to distreine
for his rent behynd for feare of death
or of mutilatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his membres: this
is a disseisin bicause the partie is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
of his mean &amp; lawful remedy
wherby he ought to come to his rent.</p>
               <p>Finally ye shall obserue &amp; marke,
that by an act of parliament made in
the xxxij. yeare of oure soueraygne
lorde king Henry the eight, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
