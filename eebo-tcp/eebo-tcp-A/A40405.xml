            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
LETTER
FROM
TANGIER
Concerning
The Death of Jonas Rowland the Renegade,
and other ſtrange Occurrences ſince the
Embaſſadors Arival here.</head>
            <p>IN my laſt I gave you an Imperfect Account of the Arrival of <hi>Ben Hadu</hi>
the <hi>Morocco</hi> Embaſſador and his kind reception and noble Entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
here by our Governour Collonel <hi>Kirk.</hi> Since then by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the Renegadoes Wife, we have had a more ample account of
all paſſages ſince the Arrival of the Embaſſador at Court, and the
Death of the Renegade her late Husband, which for the ſtrangeneſs of the
Manner, with what other Occurrences happn'd ſince, I thought fit to ſend
you.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſador attended out of Town with 200 of our Hors, (his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all dead or kill'd at Sea) we marched with him as far as our Liberties Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
where he was received by a Party of 300 of the Moors with great
Shouts, and three Volleys of Shot being diſcharged on both ſides he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the Emperous Pallace. The next morning being ſent for to Render an
Account of his Embaſſy, he did it with a great deale of Satisfaction, where he
Inſiſted much in the praiſe of <hi>England,</hi> Concluding every Period of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with the Greatneſs of the King, the Gallantry of the People, and the
nobleneſs of his Entertainments, when having ended his diſcourſe, <hi>Buzzy Ham,</hi>
the other Ambaſſador there who was as <hi>Superintendant</hi> to <hi>Ben. Hadu</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Embaſſador ſaid he had ſpake very kindly of <hi>England,</hi> as indeed it had
well deſerv'd, but he had forgot two things which merited his Commendation,
<hi>viz,</hi> their Wine and Women, with whom he had been as familiar, and to
whom he was as deeply engaged as the reſt, this being ſeconded by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,
which ſo enraged the Emperour, that immediately he order'd him to
the <hi>Ballcove,</hi> the other two to other Priſons, till they made good their Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
The ſecretary being put to the Rack, confeſſed that he had joyned
in a Confederacy againſt the Embaſſador on Shipboard, being put upon it by
the Renegade, and for what he had ſaid againſt his Maſter, was by Subornation
of <hi>Buzzy Ham</hi> the other Embaſſador. Of all which when the Emperour was
made ſenſible and that it proceeded rather from Malice then any other juſt
grounds of Accuſations, he ordered <hi>Buzzy Ham</hi> with the Secretary to be ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and the Embaſſador to be ſet at Liberty.</p>
            <p>The Renegade who was brought to Morocco bound, having all things prov'd
cleerly againſt him, was Committed to a deep Dungion of 100 Steps deſcent
