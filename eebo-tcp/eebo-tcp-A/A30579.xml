         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

long in a little time.</p>
            <p>It <hi>grieved his Soul</hi> to ſee how among Profeſſors of Religion, Holineſs

will readily diſcern, that he judged the <hi>power of Godlineſs</hi> not to conſiſt in

Sanctification, before Vnion with Chriſt. Many cry out for Obedience
and good Works, yet are profane, becauſe they go not to <hi>Chriſt for theſe;
You will not come to me, that you might have life,</hi> ſaith our Savior: Except
we do all <hi>for</hi> and <hi>from</hi> Chriſt, our Luſts will not be mortified, our Duties
not accepted, our Conſciences not purified; we ſhall not be ſtrengthned
againſt croſſes, neither <hi>ſhall we go on chearfully, nor perſevere:</hi> The fooliſh
proud heart of man is loth to be ſo much beholding to Ieſus Chriſt, as to
receive Salvation from him <hi>altogether,</hi> but <hi>ſomething</hi> it will do, and <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
Chriſt muſt do; yet it leans <hi>much,</hi> if not <hi>moſt</hi> upon <hi>it ſelf,</hi> onely it
will take in Chriſt to make <hi>more</hi> ſure work. There is a ſturdy ſtoutneſs

Goſpel made known unto them; they muſt have <hi>Peace, Comfort, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,</hi>
their own way, or elſe reject all; they would finde a principle of
life and power within themſelves, and not go to Chriſt for it; they would
bring ſomething to Chriſt, and not fetch all from Chriſt; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the way which all true Believers have gone (after much wearying
of themſelves to finde ſomething in themſelves) hath been at the laſt to
<hi>rowl</hi> themſelves wholly upon the <hi>Free-grace</hi> of God through Ieſus Chriſt,
ſeeing <hi>nothing</hi> in themſelves, yet <hi>giving glory</hi> to God by <hi>believing;</hi> and
if they could bring their hearts ſo diſpoſed and qualified, yet they ſee the
danger of reſting in what they <hi>are, have</hi> and <hi>do.</hi> And if want of ſuch and
ſuch <hi>conditions</hi> and <hi>qualifications</hi> had ground enough to keep <hi>from Chriſt,</hi>
it might have hindred any that ever did caſt themſelves upon the <hi>Free-grace</hi>

them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe things</hi> we judge not unſeaſonable to premiſe, in the reading of
this and all other Treatiſes of this nature, that Chriſtians may (when

in doing well, as of <hi>committing ill,</hi> and be content to have all flowers
withered that refreſh them without Chriſt; And when after <hi>Humiliation</hi>
and caſting down for ſin, they begin to ſtand upright, as they think, upon
the legs of their Prayers, Performances, Inherent Graces and Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Righteouſneſs and Holineſs expreſſed in their Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
they may yet notwithſtanding all this, be brought, not to glory
in themſelves, but in Ieſus Chriſt, and willingly come down from the
<hi>Throne</hi> of their own Conceits, <hi>Sufficiences, Abilities,</hi> and be at the <hi>Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool</hi>
and <hi>Threſhold</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt; that ſeeing they <hi>know</hi> nothing, <hi>are</hi>
nothing, <hi>have</hi> nothing, <hi>do</hi> nothing, they may <hi>be</hi> nothing in their own eyes,
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might <hi>be</hi> all, <hi>do</hi> all their work in them and for them, that ſo
they may wholly live upon Chriſt, and to Chriſt, ſtill drawing vertue
from him, ſeeing a need <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, and <hi>of</hi> nothing elſe, and finding a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

we find to be in a ſtraight what to do,
whether to be willing to live, or to die; for
his own inclination or deſire it was rather to
die, becauſe then he ſhould be with Chriſt,
which was beſt of all: A notable Scripture
to prove the Immortallity of the ſoul. For if
ſo be the ſoul did die with the body, it could not have bin bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for <hi>Paul</hi> to have been dead than to live, it were better that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29998:8"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had lived even to the day of Judgment than to have died,
and ſo to be nothing and turned into duſt; but he ſaith, that
when he died, <hi>he ſhould be with Chriſt,</hi> which was better for him;
but that which ſwayed him on the other ſide, why he ſhould be
willing to live, it was this, That he might be uſeful to the
Churches, <hi>Nevertheleſs, it is better for you that I ſhould abide in
the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Service to the Churches is the great cauſe that makes one
who hath made his peace with God, to be willing to live, it is
not that he may live in eaſe, and enjoy pleaſures to the fleſh, but
that he may live and do ſervice for God, that makes him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to live. And then he tels them, he is confident he ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
with them a while for the furtherance of their faith, and
that by his coming to them their rejoycing ſhould be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant;
but in the mean time, whether I do come, or come
not, <hi>Only let your Converſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> As
if he ſhould ſay, I ſhall the more willingly live, my life wil be
the more comfortable to me; it will ſomthing recompence my
abſence from Heaven, my ſtaying from the joyes of it; if your
Converſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: If I
may hear from you being abſent, or when I come to you, I may
ſee that your Converſation be as <hi>becommeth</hi> the Goſpel of Jeſus
Chriſt. This is the dependancy of the words.</p>
               <p>For the opening of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Only] Only let your Converſation.</hi> That is as if he ſhould
ſay, be not ſolicitous about me and my ſufferings, and what
ſhall become of me, and whether I ſhall come to you or not, be
not ſo careful about that; only let your care be taken up about
this great buſineſs, <hi>That your Converſation be as becometh the Goſpel
of Chriſt:</hi> for ſaies he, this ſhould be the main thing that I ſhould
aim at if I ſhould come to you; this is that I ſhould put you
upon and give you directions about, That your Converſation
be as becometh the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: And if I be abſent
there is not any thing I deſire more to hear of than this, That
you that have received the Goſpel of Chriſt from my hands (as
it were) through my Miniſtry, that your Converſations be as
becometh the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Brethren, if we had <hi>Paul</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29998:8"/>
and could write an Epiſtle to this Congregation, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Congregation, the main drift of his preaching or writing
would be, to thoſe that had heretofore received the Goſpel,
That they would make it their great care that their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>be</hi> as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Only let your Converſation]</hi> The word here, is a word taken
from the ordering of a City, or a Common-wealth, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one acts in their own ſphere, and is ſerviceable each unto
other, to the publick good; ſo ſaith he, the Church of God,
it is as a City, as a Common-wealth wherein every Chriſtian is
to act in his own ſphere, and every one laboring for the good
each of other in a comely order, that ſo there may not only be
peace in the Churches, but edification of all, and the Goſpel
may thrive and proſper, that's the meaning of this word tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
here, <hi>Let your Converſation;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Do not
think it enough that you have ſome enlightenings, that you
have ſome ſtirrings, ſome affections are moved by the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel, reſt not there, but look to your Converſation.</p>
               <p>It is not enough for Chriſtians to have knowledg, and to be
able to ſpeak of the Goſpel, and have ſome ſtirrings of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but they muſt look to their Converſations, <hi>Let your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation

               <p>
                  <hi>And ſecondly, What is it ſo to live as becometh the</hi> Goſpel of
Chriſt? Let your Converſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> in general is this: It is the good Tydings
that God hath revealed concerning Chriſt, <hi>This hath come unto
your ears,</hi> the good Tydings concerning Chriſt, for ſo the word

                  </note> the good Tydings that comes from Heaven unto
you concerning Jeſus Chriſt, that's the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>More largely it is this, As all Mankind were loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;
become the children of wrath, put under the ſentence of death,
God though he left his fallen Angels, and hath reſerved
them in the chains of eternal darkneſs, yet he hath thought
upon the children of men, he hath provided a way of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29998:9"/>
to reconcile them to himſelf again. Namely, the ſecond
Perſon in Trinity takes mans nature upon him, and becomes
the Head of a ſecond Covenant, ſtanding charged with mans
ſin, and to anſwer for it in a way of ſuffering what the Law
and Divine Juſtice required, and for making ſatisfaction, and
keeping the Law perfectly, which ſatisfaction and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he tenders up unto the Father as a ſweet ſavor of Reſt for
the ſouls of thoſe that are given to him; and now, this media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt is by the appointment of the Father preached to
the children of men, of what Nation or rank ſoever, freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
this unto ſinners for atonement for them, requiring
them to beleeve in him, and upon beleeving, promiſing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a diſcharge of all their former ſins, but that they ſhall never
enter into condemnation, that none of their ſins or unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhall ever hinder the peace of God with them, but that
they ſhall through him be received into the number of Sons,
that they ſhall have the Image of God again to be renewed in
them, &amp; that they ſhall be kept by the <hi>Power of God through faith
and ſalvation,</hi> that theſe ſouls and bodies ſhall be raiſed to the
height of glory that ſuch creatures are capable of, that they
ſhall live for ever enjoying the preſence of God, and Chriſt, in
the fulneſs of al good; this is the Goſpel of Chriſt; this is the
ſum of the Goſpel that is preached unto ſinners: when you
hear ſpeaking of the Goſpel your thoughts may be about this,
this glad Tydings that is come into the world for ſalvation
of ſinful creatures through Jeſus Chriſt, and all the good things
that Jeſus Chriſt by his blood hath purchaſed for ſinners.
When Miniſters are cald the Miniſters of the Goſpel, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, they are appointed by God Miniſters to declare and to
preach this glad Tydings to the world: Oh it is glad Tydings
indeed to the world; could there be ſuch glad tidings preached
at Hell gates, that there were any ſuch way of reconciliation of
them to God, we could not but conceive there would be joy
there, they would account it acceptable news indeed.</p>
               <p>Now then, Thoſe that do beleeve this Goſpel, or do profeſs
it, that they have entertain'd this Goſpel, this glad Tydings,
they muſt be careful to walk in their Converſation ſo as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
this Goſpel, as becomes ſuch glorious glad Tydings as
are ſent unto them from Heaven.</p>

ſhould be ſuch as deſerves al the good that there is in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
No, but <hi>Worthy,</hi> that is, as much as <hi>Beſeeming</hi> the Goſpel, as
<hi>meet for the Goſpel,</hi> or as it is tranſlated in your books, <hi>Becoming
the Goſpel;</hi> as he that <hi>eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks
his own damnation;</hi> Can one eat and drink ſo as to be <hi>worthy</hi> of
the Body and Blood of Chriſt? No, but he that eats and
drinks ſo, carries himſelf ſo in that Ordinance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as is unbeſeeming the Body and Blood of Chriſt that he
comes to receive; and on the other ſide, thoſe that do eat and
drink ſo, as to ſanctifie Gods Name in that Ordinance (as you
have heard) they do it worthily, for ſo the ſame word is here,
<hi>Worthy of the Goſpel of Chriſt. And ſo bring forth fruit worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
ſaith <hi>John</hi> to thoſe that came to him, that is <hi>meet, ſit
for repentance,</hi> ſuch fruit as may manifeſt your repentance, as is
ſutable unto ſuch men or women that do profeſs their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for their ſins. Further, I find that the word that is here
tranſlated <hi>Becoming,</hi> in another place is tranſlated <hi>Convenient and
meet,</hi> and can be underſtood in no other ſenſe; as in 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 4.
If it be meet that I ſhall go alſo,</hi> the word that is tranſlated there,
<hi>[meet]</hi> it is in the Greek <hi>[worthy]</hi> the ſame word that we have
here tranſlated <hi>Becoming,</hi>

                  </note> if it be a comly thing or a meet or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

that we have here is, <hi>meet, convenient, ſutable,</hi> or, <hi>becoming the
Goſpel, Let your Converſation be ſuch, as it meet for, or becoming the
Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You will ſay,</hi> What Converſation is that which is meet for, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, Firſt, a Converſation raiſed to a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
than the light of Nature, or than the Law can raiſe one to,
it muſt be that certainly, it is not a Converſation becoming
the Goſpel, except it be a Converſation raiſed higher than the
light of Nature, or than the Law can raiſe one to, it becomes
not the Goſpel elſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Converſation ſutable and anſwerable to thoſe
many bleſſed and glorious truths that are revealed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29998:10"/>
there is much of the mind of God revealed in the Goſpel,
glorious truths are there preſented to us, that is a Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
becoming the Goſpel that is ſutable and anſwerable unto
theſe bleſſed and glorious truths that are revealed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Converſation manifeſting the power of the
Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A Converſation that is ſutable unto al the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of the Goſpel, agreeable unto whatſoever there is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ordinance of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And then fiftly, A Converſation holding forth the beauty,
excellency, and glory of the Goſpel before thoſe with whom
we do converſe, here's a Converſation becoming the Goſpel;
when thoſe that are Chriſtians profeſſing that the Lord hath
revealed the Goſpel unto them, and that in ſome meaſure they
have been brought to beleeve in the Goſpel, when as now their
Converſation is beyond that which any man can attain unto
by the light of Nature, when it is beyond that that any man
by the Law can be raiſed unto, when it's anſwerable to the
many bleſſed and glorious truths that are revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
when it manifeſts a power of the Goſpel in him, when it's
anſwerable unto the bleſſed Ordinances that he doth enjoy in
the Goſpel, and when his Life and Converſation holds forth
the beauty, excellency, and glory of the Goſpel before the
world, here is a Converſation becoming the Goſpel; and
this is that which the Apoſtle here exhorts unto, <hi>Only let your
Converſation be ſuch, as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Thus you have
had the words opened.</p>
               <p>Now for the Doctrinal Points in the words, only theſe two,
the firſt is but to make way to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>1. Doct. <hi>The firſt is this,</hi> That thoſe that profeſs the Goſpel, muſt
have a great care of their Converſations.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, <hi>This Converſation of theirs muſt be ſuch, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes,
as beſeems the Goſpel.</hi> Theſe are the two main Points in
the Text. I ſhall this morning but make way to the ſecond
Point which is the great Point in the Text.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That Chriſtians that do profeſs the Goſpel, muſt have a great
care of their Converſations, to look to them.</hi> They muſt not ſatisfie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29998:10"/>
themſelves with what is inward in their minds, or in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
but look to their Converſations; You think, or hope
at leaſt, that through the Goſpel there hath been converſion
wrought in you: After the Lord hath wrought converſion,
he doth expect that you be careful of your Converſations
before men: you have knowledge, you can ſpeak well, you
have ſome ſtirrings of heart that you have felt in hearing of the
Word, preaching of the Goſpel, but now look to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
and know, there is a bond laid upon you more than
ever was, to look to your Converſations: in <hi>James,</hi> 3. ſee the
exhortation of the Apoſtle there, at the 13. verſe, <hi>Who is a wiſe
man, and endued with knowledge among yeu,</hi> mark, <hi>let him ſhew out
of a good Converſation his works with meekneſs of wiſdom.</hi> It is a very
ſweet and excellent Scripture, Who is a wiſe man and endued
with knowledge among you: What ſhould he do? Let him
ſhew out of a good Converſation his works with meekneſs of
wiſdom: here is <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> again. If you
would manifeſt that God hath wrought any true ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
any wiſdom in you to ſave your ſouls, why know that
God requires that you ſhould ſhow your good Converſation &amp;
that with meekneſs and wiſdom, your Converſations, you muſt
have a care of them, both in reſpect of men, and in reſpect of
God.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of men, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 12. Having your Converſation ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
among the Gentils:</hi> And (the latter part wee ſhall ſpeak to
by and by) ſo that Chriſtians they muſt look to their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
in reſpect of men.</p>
               <p>And then in reſpect of God: In 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 15. But as be who hath
called you is Holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Converſation;</hi> There
you have <hi>Honeſt Converſation;</hi> and in this ſcripture, <hi>holy in all
manner of converſation:</hi> ſo that you are to have regard to your
Converſations, both in reſpect of men, and in reſpect of God:
and upon theſe grounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in general.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in regard of God more generally, that God may be
honored by your Converſations. Oh! you that have ever
heard from God the glorious glad tydings of Salvation in
the Goſpel, Is it not in your hearts to do what you can to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29998:11"/>
him? now let your Converſation be ſuch; have a care of
your Converſations that God may be honored; the Name of
God will be blaſphemed, except you have a care of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
in <hi>Matth. 5. 16. Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that
they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, What, hath God brought the light
of the Goſpel to you? hath it ſhined into your hearts? and hath
He revealed unto you thoſe glorious Myſteries of Salvation in
Him? O then, let this light break forth and ſhine in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
before men, that others ſeeing your good works may
glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. Some men and women
are ready to ſay, what do they care what others obſerve in them
ſo that God knows their hearts? I but that's not enough, if it
could be ſo that you could have good hearts unto God without
good Converſations; but we ſhall ſee that there cannot be any
ſuch thing, and it is required of you, your works ſhould ſhine
forth before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
your Father which is in Heaven. 'Tis one thing to do a
good work that <hi>may be ſeen,</hi> and another thing to do a good
work that <hi>it</hi> may be ſeen; to do a good work that may be ſeen
that is lawful, though we ſhould not do them principally aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they may be ſeen, but our works ſhould be ſuch, that
of their own nature they may be ſeen, but not to make that to
be our main end, that they may be ſeen; ſo, as aiming not ſo
much that they may may be ſeen, but that being ſeen, men may
glorifie our Father which is in Heaven, that God may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.
Now God is honoured by the Converſations of His
Saints many waies, and therefore they ſhould be very careful
of their Converſations.</p>
               <p>As in the firſt place, The people of God, Saints, Beleevers,
they are the great Witneſſes that God hath in the world, to
witneſs for Him againſt the corruptions of the world; If ſo be
that you are not careful of your Converſations, God will loſe
witneſſes to His Truth: Now a witneſſe is not a thing that is
kept within, a man cannot be a witneſs by keeping things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his own thoughts and heart, he muſt manifeſt ſomething to
witneſs. The Lord makes uſe of the lives of His Saints to be
His Witneſſes in the world, to ſtand and witneſs for His Truth;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29998:11"/>
whereas others they will think when the Goſpel is preached
that it is but a meer notion, or imagination, and that there is
no reallity in what is preached: No ſaith God, look here upon
the Converſations of theſe that have beleeved the Goſpel, do
you not ſee they witneſſe, that there it a reallity in thoſe things
of the Goſpel? look what a change my Goſpel hath made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them in their lives and converſations, thoſe that were before
proud, how humble they are; that were before froward, how
meek they are, and the like; theſe are my witneſſes. Many
Scriptures might be given, eſpecially that in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 3. where
the Saints in general are called witneſſes: And that's the firſt
thing. You are to look to your Converſations, that you may
be Gods witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly: That you may hold forth the Image of God in
the world; that Image that God made man in at firſt, by the ſin
of man was loſt; but now through the Goſpel it comes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
and God delights to have His Image held forth in the
world, that men may behold ſomewhat of the glory of His I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage:
But how can the world ſee the Image of God? They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee it in your hearts, but now God would have it conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
therefore have you a care of your Converſations, that in
your Converſations you may hold forth the Image of God in
the world. It's much to the glory of God to have His Image
held forth in the world. As men that would honor their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and other dear friends, if they have a curious Picture of
them, when their image is drawn, they will not ſee it abuſed and
ſullyed, but they will keep it fair; a man that hath the image
of his father or dear friend, will not hang it in a ſmokey hole
behind a chimney, or door, but in ſome conſpicuous place; ſo
we ſhould hold forth the Image of God conſpicuouſly, it
ſhould appear in our lives and Converſations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By your Converſations God may be honored, for
you will further the great deſigns that God hath in the world:
the holy and gracious lives of the Saints ſerve to further the
great deſigns that God hath in the world to do.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, They may ſerve to make up the great diſhonor
that God hath from others; the Lord hath abundance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
from moſt in the world; but now there are ſome that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29998:12"/>
God cals out of the world, and He gives his Grace unto them to
the end that He might have ſome of the great diſhonor that He
hath in the world from others made up; now ſuch as are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of their Converſations, as walk exactly and cloſely with
God (I ſay) they are made uſe of by God for the making up in
ſome part of the great diſhonor that God hath in the world.
What honor ſhould God have in the world were it not for the
holy and gracious Converſations of ſome of His Saints? and
therefore you who profeſs the Goſpel, look to your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that God may be honored by you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Have a care of your Converſations, look to them
in reſpect of wicked men among whom you live.</p>
               <p>As firſt, That you may convince evil and ungodly men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom you live in the world. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 12. Having your
Converſation honeſt among the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpeak againſt
you as evil doers, they may by your good works which they ſhall behold,
glorifie God in the day of viſitation.</hi> This likewiſe doth confirm
what was ſaid before, for the glory of God, and the conviction
of wicked men; <hi>That they beholding,</hi> may glorifie God in the day
of viſitation. There are many interpretations upon this place,
<hi>In the day of viſitation, the day wherein God ſhall viſit them.</hi> Though
now they rail againſt you, yet when God ſhall viſit them, either
in His ſtroke upon them by ſickneſs, then they will acknowledg
you to be righteous, and holy men, and wiſh that their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were like yours; or in the day of viſitation, if God ſhall
viſit their ſpirits to turn them, or in the day of viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as ſome
think) in the day of Jeſus Chriſt: But I find others looking nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
into the words, <hi>In the day of Over ſeeing,</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
from whence the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> comes, it is an <hi>Over-ſeer,</hi> now this
word <hi>viſitation,</hi> ſignifies nothing elſe but an <hi>Overſeeing;</hi> as if
God ſhould ſay thus, walk ye honeſtly, and holily before the
world, perhaps they will vail your glory, &amp; one will ſay this, &amp;
the other that, but go ye on in a conſtant way and courſe, there
will be a time that all things ſhall be over-ſeen, all things ſhall
be examined, and narrowly ſearched into, and when that day
comes, the wicked men ſhall be convinced, and ſhal be forced to
give glory to God, and ſhal ſay, that whatſoever aſperſions there
were caſt upon you, yet certainly you were the ſervants of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29998:12"/>
living God, in the day of inſpection, of overſeeing; therefore
be ye careful of your Converſations in reſpect of wicked men, to
convince them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In reſpect of wicked men, to ſtop their mouthes,
their malice, violence, and rage, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 15. For ſo is the Will of
God, that with well doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh
men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> The word there tranſlated <hi>Put to ſilence,</hi> it is to put (as it
were) a bridle into their mouthes, or to ſtop their mouthes, you
may even ſtop their mouthes by your holy Converſation; Oh
Chriſtians look to your Converſations, that by them you may
ſtop the mouthes of wicked and ungodly men, that they may
not be able to ſay any thing againſt your holy Converſations;
ſo in 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 16. Having a good conſcience, that whereas they ſpeak evil
of you as of evil doers, they may be aſhamed that falſly accuſe your good
Converſation in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Yea, you may by your good Converſation be a
means to convert other men, to bring wicked men into the
love of the waies of God: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. 2. the exhortation there
is directed to wives that had wicked husbands. <hi>Likewiſe ye wives
be in ſubjection to your own husbands, that if they obey not the word,
they alſo may without the word be won by the Converſation of the wives,
while they behold your chaſt Converſation coupled with fear.</hi> Mark,
how the Apoſtle urges upon wives to look to their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the end that they may be a means to gain their husbands.
I am verily perſwaded that there are many gracious women that
would give (if they had it) a thouſand worlds to gain their
husbands to thoſe waies of godlineſs that they have found ſo
much ſweetneſs in, but perhaps they cannot get them to come
and hear the Word, and if they do, their hearts riſe againſt
it, or it may be they little regard it; but you by your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
may do that which the world will not do, you may be
converters of them; and in this ſenſe indeed; there may be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
preachers, that is, preaching in their lives and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that's all the preaching that the holy Ghoſt allows
women, let them preach that way, in their lives and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in their families, and preach every day a Sermon, and
neither God nor man will find fault with any ſuch thing, and
this is the way for them to do great ſervice for God; and ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29998:13"/>
likewiſe ſhould husbands do to convert their wives, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
one of another, but do you labor to convince and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
one another by your holy Converſations? I am confident
that there are many that are able to ſay by experience, this;
That the Lord ſtruck upon my heart and conſcience by ſeeing
the holy Converſation of my wife, ſince ſhe went to hear the
Word, by ſeeing the wiſdom, humility, obedience and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of my wife, it ſtruck upon my heart. There is many have
given glory to God and acknowledged this, both wives by their
husbands, and husbands by their wives; and ſometimes the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in ſeeing it in the child, or the child in the parent, or
brother in brother, or one ſervant in another, it hath been a
means to turn them unto God.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, If they be not turned to God, then your
converſation ſhall ſerve to condemn them, to aggravate their ſin,
and their condemnation in the day of Jeſus Chriſt. As it is
ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. that Noah <hi>prepared an ark, by the which
he condemned the world.</hi> He condemned the world by that courſe
of his, in beleeving in God, and in making the Ark, every nail
that he ſmote into the Ark, was (as it were) a condemnation of
the world: and ſo the Saints by walking in their holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
ſhal be the Judges and Condemners of the world. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you are to be careful of your Converſations, in reſpect of
wicked men.</p>
               <p>Alſo, In reſpect of the Saints, we muſt be very careful of our
Converſations.</p>
               <p>1. For by your Converſation you will rejoyce the hearts of
the Saints. Oh thoſe that are godly, when they ſee others that
profeſs godlines to walk in a ſtrict and holy converſation, how
doth it rejoyce their hearts? it is the comfort of their lives.</p>
               <p>2. Beſides, they bleſſe God for it; they not only rejoyce in
it, but bleſs God for it; when they get alone in ſecret they are
bleſſing God for the gracious, and holy, and convincing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
of ſuch and ſuch kind of men that they converſe
with.</p>
               <p>3. And by that means the Saints they have a boldneſs before
men, they can lift up their heads whereſoever they go, when
they know that all ſuch who make profeſſion of Religion in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29998:13"/>
the places where they live, they walk unblamably: upon that
godly men can hold up their heads with boldneſs, whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
it makes ſuch as are profeſſors of Religion aſhamed,
when they ſee and hear of ſuch and ſuch that make profeſſion
of Religion to walk ſcandalouſly, and looſly: but of them we
ſhall ſpeak preſently.</p>
               <p>4. Then further, Your holy Converſation it will eſtabliſh
the hearts of the Saints, it will ſettle young beginners; there are
many that are giving up their names to Chriſt, when they ſee
the holy and gracious Converſations of theſe that are Ancient
profeſſors, Oh how are they ſtabliſhed in the waies of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
               <p>5. And it wil edifie the Saints, they wil edifie and grow up in
holineſs, they will imitate you, and will find the graces of God
not only ſtrengthened, but increaſed in them by your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Oh the abundance of good that you may do; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſtians have a care of your Converſations.</p>
               <p>6. Then, You in reſpect of your ſelves, by this means you
wil have an evidence to your ſouls of the truth of grace in your
hearts, which you cannot have if your Converſations be not
right. In 1 <hi>John,</hi> 1. 6. mark what the Apoſtle ſpeaks there, <hi>If
we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lye
and do not know the truth.</hi> And again, you have a notable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the 3. chap. 7. verſ. <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you;
He that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous, even as He is righteous.</hi> As if
he ſhould ſay, there are a company of deceivers in the world,
and they think it enough to talk of righteouſneſs, they ſay they
beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt, and it's Faith that is only required of
them; and as for the other, that's but a meer legal thing, for men
to make conſcience of duties, and of their lives, this is but legal,
but let them truſt in Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt hath done all, what can
we be ſaved by our lives? hath not Chriſt done all? Is there not
righteouſneſs in Him? <hi>Let no man deceive you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)
If there be not a doing righteouſneſs, there is no righteouſneſs
in you, <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs is righteous:</hi> You have nothing
to do with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as your own applied yet
unto you, except you do righteouſneſs; therefore have a care of
your Converſations, that you may have evidence to your ſouls
of the truth that there is in your hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:29998:14"/>
Secondly, Have a care of your Converſations that you may
continue and encreaſe that which is within you; certainlie
thoſe that make profeſſion of Religion and have not a care of
their converſations, they wil never continue in their profeſſion,
mark that, they may be a Comets a while, blaſing-ſtars, but
they will vaniſh, &amp; within a little while you ſhall find that their
profeſſion will wear away; where there is not a godly life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with profeſſion, profeſſion will vaniſh and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
their very common graces will be taken away from them
if they have not a care of their lives, but if they have a care of
their lives they wil continue in the waies of godlineſs and grow
up and encreaſe more and more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Have a care of your Converſations, that you may
get honor in the very conſciences of men.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Some will ſay,</hi> Should we have a care of our Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes truly, a man may deſire to have the teſtimony of
the conſciences of thoſe that he lives withal, it's no matter for
their <hi>talking</hi> this or that, but that you may get into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
God gives you liberty for that.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You by this means will be Inſtruments of a great
deal of publick good, if you live according to your profeſſion,
otherwiſe no body will regard you, you are reffuſe, no man
will imploy you, you will be contemn'd and ſlighted, but when
they ſee mens Converſations according to their profeſſion, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
bodie loves to make uſe of theſe men, they know they ſhall
find them faithful in whatſoever they are imployed, and ſo they
come to the Inſtruments of much publick good.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, You will further a joyful account againſt the great
day; for you muſt be call'd to account, not only for your
thoughts, and the inward workings of your hearts, but for
whatever you have done in the fleſh, we muſt appear before the
Judgment Seat of Chriſt to anſwer whatſoever is done in the
fleſh: Oh be careful of your Converſations that ſo you may be
able to give a comfortable accompt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſtly, Be careful of your Converſations in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of your profeſſion: This ſhould be the care of thoſe that
make profeſſion, that we may keep up the ſucceſſion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29998:14"/>
nor of Religion from one generation to another: Heretofore
there were ſome godly people that liv'd, and they kept up (in
their generation) the honor of the profeſſion of Religion, Wel-now,
we are upon the ſtage of the world; and God looks upon
us that we ſhould in our generations keep up the ſucceſſion of
the honor of the profeſſion of Religion: and ſo afterward in
another generation, as men come upon the ſtage of the world
and live here: God expects ſucceeding ages ſhould keep up
the honor of the profeſſion of Religion in their times. And
this one conſideration might go to the very heart of ungodly
men (if they would mind it) that it may be thou art the man or
woman among others that keeps up in a continual ſucceſſion
enmity againſt God in the world; do but conſider of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between theſe two, one mans Converſation is wicked, and
anothers is holy and gracious, thou that liveſt wickedly this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is charged upon thee, that thou art the man that joyneſt in
this work to keep up a continued ſucceſſion of enmity againſt
God in the world, ever ſince <hi>Cains</hi> time there was an enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, and <hi>Cains</hi> poſterity kept up the ſucceſſion of it; and
ſo from one generation to another there hath been wicked men
keeping up the ſucceſſion of enmity againſt God, and thou in
thy generation art come to it, and this (it ſeems) is thy work:
but now on the other ſide, ever ſince <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Abels</hi> time, there
hath bin godly men in the world, and in every generation ſome
have kept up the honor of profeſſion: and now, hath God been
pleaſed to reveal his glorious Goſpel to thy ſoul? why now,
thou being careful of thy life and Converſation, God imploys
thee in this work to keep up the ſucceſſion of the honor of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
in the world. And this is a comfortable life indeed.</p>
               <p>And thus we have done with the explication or the Point.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall only give you ſome paſſages for the Application
of it.</p>

                     <hi>Only</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>let your Converſation be as becomes the

you would fain get more knowledg, and be accounted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29998:15"/>
where you live; Well, whatſoever you would fain be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of, let it be your only care, that your Converſation be as
becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt. Oh! this point ſpeaks bitter
things, and ſharply rebukes the careleſneſs of the profeſſors of
the Goſpel in point of their Converſation.</p>
                  <p>Oh Lord, how have we cauſe to bewail the looſneſſe of the
profeſſors of the Goſpel at this day! and I fear, that ſome may
be preſent whoſe conſciences may tell them that they are very
looſe in the point of their Converſations. Thou profeſſeſt
thou knoweſt Jeſus Chriſt, that the Lord hath made known
the glorious Myſteries of the Goſpel to thee; What is thy life?
Canſt thou ſay as in the preſence of God, that thy Converſation
is anſwerable? I beſeech you as in the preſence of God, examin
but this, ſee whether thou art able to ſay, Lord, thou knoweſt
according to what light thou haſt given me in the Goſpel, it
hath been my care to look to my Converſation, Oh that I
might live to thy honor, and be a witneſſe to thy truth; that
I might hold forth thy image and further thy deſigns, and
make up the diſhonor that thou haſt from others in the world;
and that I might convince wicked men, and ſtop the mouthes
of thoſe that are oppoſite; and that I might be a means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
thoſe that I live with, or otherwiſe to judge them; Oh
that I might rejoyce the hearts of the Saints, that they might
lift up their heads with boldneſs becauſe of me, that they may,
and ſo I might be ſtabliſhed and edified! Go along in the reſt
of the heads. Can thy conſcience tell thee that thou haſt done
ſo? No, but its quite contrary in ſome. The Lord ſpeaks now to
the conſciences of thoſe that this point concerns, that have
been negligent in the point of their Converſation, thou art the
man or woman that God hath as great diſhonor from as from
moſt in the world, yea certainly, there is no men upon the face
of the earth that darkens the glory of the bleſſed God ſo much,
as profeſſors of Religion who live looſly, al the prophane ones,
all your drunkards that reel up and down in the ſtreets, and
your blaſphemers, yea name what ſinners you will, there is non
that do darken the glorie of God ſo much as thou doeſt, who
art looſe in thy Converſation, and yet a profeſſor of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
thou caſteſt dirt upon the bleſſed Image of God, thou doeſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29998:15"/>
as much hinder the deſigne that God hath in the world as any
men whatſoever, thou ſtandeſt againſt the great works that God
hath to do in the world, Oh wretch that thou art, what is
this a time to be looſe and wicked in? There was never a time
that the Converſations of the profeſſors of Religion were ſo
pried into as now, and never a time ſince Chriſtian Religion
was profeſſed upon the earth that the looſe Converſation of
Profeſſors have done more hurt; and I verily beleeve never a
time wherein there were more looſe Profeſſors. If ſo be that
our fore-fathers that were godly and holie, and kept ſtrict with
God were now alive again, they would ſpit in the faces of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
that would think themſelves eminent Profeſſors of Religion,
becauſe of the looſeneſs of their Converſations: And this is
the worſt, that they can all put it upon Chriſt, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Chriſt: but of that we ſhall ſpeak more when we come
to ſhew how our Converſation muſt be as becomes the Goſpel
of Chriſt: Certainly it is that that is quite oppoſite to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Jeſus Chriſt. The Lord rebuke thee this day, and let this
point be as a dart in thy liver, thou art the man that liveſt in
this generation as if thou wert born to do miſchief; no men
live ſo as if they were born to do miſchief as the Profeſſors of
the Goſpel that live looſlie in their Converſations: If I ſhould
give a mark of a man that were born on purpoſe to do miſchief,
it's that man that lives in theſe times and walks looſlie. What,
doeſt thou convince wicked men, and ſtop the mouthes of
wicked men? Oh no, thou hardeneſt them, and openeſt
their mouthes, nay, all the ſcorns of Religion thou art char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with, and ſhalt be brought to an account for it; I ſay
ſuch as live looſlie in their Converſations they ſhall be one
day charged for all the ſcorn that is caſt upon the profeſſion
of Religion, and for all the oppoſition of it, and for all the
perſecution of it, and for all the diſhonor of it; it is becauſe
of you, you harden the hearts of wicked men, that they think
they do God good ſervice in following and perſecuting ſuch
and ſuch men ſo forward in Religion, for they think they are
all like to you, what care they for mens talking and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
when they ſee your Converſation looſe and wicked, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be hardened by you; and the Saints they fare the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29998:16"/>
worſe for you, they are aſhamed of it, when they go in the
ſtreets and meet with ſome of their acquaintance, Oh ſay they,
Do you not know ſuch a one, what he did ſuch a week in his
houſe, how falſe he was, and how he plaid the knave? What!
one that would go in a morning to hear, and riſe early in the
winter time, and take ſo much pains, and yet do ſuch and ſuch
things! it caſts a mighty ſcorn upon all profeſſors of Religion,
and upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the waies of the
Goſpel, all (I ſay) is ſcorn'd and contemn'd and men be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt it, meerly for thy Converſation; and it may be
ſome that were coming on, and began to think that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Religion was the way to Heaven, and for them to be
more ſtrict than they were, and to enquire after the waies of
God more than before, and to attend upon the Miniſtry of the
Word; but ſince they heard of ſuch a miſcarriage, ſuch looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in ſuch a ones Converſation, their hearts riſe againſt it,
and they bleſſe themſelves from ſuch a way, God bleſſe me (ſay
they) from ſuch waies! If this be the fruit of their profeſſion,
and of their talking of Religion, to do thus and thus! So that
thou proveſt to be a ſtumbling block that others ſtumble at and
periſh by, and doſt thou think that (they ſtumbling and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
at thy ſins) that thou ſhalt go ſcot-free? Canſt thou think
that thou that art a means to ſend ſo many to Hell, that thou
ſhalt not go thither thy ſelf? Certainly there's no men in the
world that are the cauſes of ſending ſo many to Hell, as ſuch as
live looſly in their Converſations, when they make profeſſion of
Religion. Canſt thou have any evidence to thy ſoul that there
is any work of grace in thee, and yet live looſlie? Oh! Chriſt
and His Goſpel will ſcorn ſuch as thou art, ſuch wicked looſe
ones, thou art a diſhonor to Jeſus Chriſt, a diſhonor to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
and I may ſay of thee that doſt ſo, as it was ſaid of <hi>Judas,
It had been happy if thou hadſt never been born:</hi> eſpecially to be born
in theſe times. But we ſhall meet with theſe again, when we
come to the point in the particulars, how we ſhould walk as
becomes the Goſpel; this is but only in the general for ſuch
as are looſe in their Converſations; for certainly this muſt be
granted as an everlaſting rule, That that man or woman which
makes not conſcience of every thing in their Converſations,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29998:16"/>
makes conſcience of nothing, if there be anie that upon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
and knowing this or that to be ſin beforehand, and
yet for by and baſe ends, will ſin to get monie, or the like, and
ſo think to gain or free themſelves from ſome trouble, by going
againſt their light, and that upon deliberation, let that man
or woman know that they can have no evidence that they ever
made conſcience of anie one thing: <hi>He that breaks one Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
breaks all;</hi> and there is ſuch a bond in the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and conſcience doth knit the bond ſo uniformlie, that
where there is one bond thus broken, the truth is, all is broken:
<hi>Knoweſt thou not</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>James) Oh vain man, what doeſt thou
talk of faith if there be no works? thou art a vain man and thou doeſt
deceive thy ſelf.</hi> Certainlie thoſe men that are looſe in their
Converſations, if God doth not humble them, and bring down
their hearts, they will grow in time not onlie to loſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
(as I ſaid) but to be enemies to thoſe that are ſtricter than
themſelves; that is, when men have corrupt hearts, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get up to that height of ſtrictneſs that others do, they fall
to perſecute that way which is above them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They begin to envie others that live better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and after having envied them, then they will begin to
have their hearts riſe againſt them, and to hate them, and after
hating to ſpeak againſt them, and after ſpeaking againſt them,
to perſecute them, and thus by degrees men that have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
profeſſors, now they grow as bitter perſecutors as others,
Oh therefore look to your Converſations.</p>
                  <p>And that ſhould have been the exhortation, Chriſtians be
careful of your Converſations in your families, be careful
there. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 1. you have an excellent Scripture of <hi>Davids</hi>
profeſſing his care of his Converſation in his familie, how he
would walk, <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way:
when wilt thou come unto me? I will walke within my houſe
with a perfect heart.</hi> Oh I beſeech you look to this Scripture;
I will behave my ſelf wiſelie in a perfect way; mark, I'le look
that my way may be perfect, everie way right and ſquare to the
world, and when it is ſo, I will labor to behave my ſelf wiſelie,
I will not carrie my ſelf fooliſhlie in thoſe waies that are good:
and then, <hi>Oh when wilt thou come unto me?</hi> Mark, it was a time
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29998:17"/>
that God was abſent from him, and yet then he profeſſes that he
will behave himſelf wiſelie in a perfect way; and I wil walk in
my houſe with a perfect heart: There are ſome that make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Religion indeed, and if you come to them before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
companie, then their converſations ſeem to be very fair and
ſquare; but if you do but follow them to their families, and
ſee what they do there, Oh thoſe that live with them in their
families, after they have been abroad in companie ſhall ſee in
what guiz they come home. Shal they ſee their converſations to
be holy as becomes the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt? But thus it was
with <hi>David,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Let thoſe that live with me in my
houſe mark me as narrowlie as they can; <hi>I will walk in my houſe
with a perfect heart; what I am in the Congregation or among thoſe
that are godly, or any company; I will be in my family, that thoſe in
my family ſhall ſee my Converſation to be thus and thus.</hi> Oh that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of Religion would look to this, not only to live before
others in the pariſh or the town where they live, but to walk in
their familie with a perfect heart, ſo as all in their family may
even bleſs them and ſay, Oh how doth my Maſter or Miſtriſs
walk! how graciouſly in their whol courſe from morning to
night! obſerve them in all their waies and you ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
almoſt to ſee anie miſcarriage in them: Oh that's excellent,
when a man ſhall have a better teſtimony even from thoſe in his
familie than from thoſe that are ſtrangers; it may be they think
though thou makeſt profeſſion of Religion, yet all things are
not anſwerable; but thoſe that ſee it everie day can teſtifie all
things are anſwerable; thus it ſhould be w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> every Chriſtian that
profeſſes the Goſpel, to walk with a perfect heart in the midſt
of his family, &amp; ſo to converſe in the world. Divers Arguments
I ſhall give you, to ſtir you up to look to your Converſations.</p>
                  <p>1. Arg. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is the mercy of God that you have your Converſations
among men to this day, that you have not your Converſations among De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
and Reprobates, it might have been your portion that your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
might have been among Devils and Reprobates, God might have
ſent you down to your own place to have converſed with them. <hi>Let this
be an Argument for you to look to your Converſations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Arg.</hi> Secondly conſider this, <hi>Wicked and carnal men</hi> (among
whom you live) <hi>have no skill in the principles that you walk by, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29998:17"/>
they have skill in your lives and Converſations, they are able to paſs
judgment upon your lives and Converſations, but not of your principles.</hi>
Godlie people are acted by ſuch and ſuch principles that are
myſteries to carnal men; but when it comes to their lives
they can underſtand them; they cannot ſearch into their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
whether ſuch a Doctrine be true or no, or ſuch a thing be
according to ſuch a Scripture, whether there be a right interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ſuch a Scripture that carries them on in ſuch a way,
they take no pains to look after this, but they look to your
lives, there they have skill to diſcern how you walk, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you walk to the rule or not in your lives and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and therefore let it be your great care to look to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Arg.</hi> A third motive is this, <hi>There are ſome things that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but do, that will diſpleaſe wicked men, if you will act according to
your Principles.</hi> Well, but this ſhould make thee ſo much the
more careful of thy Converſation in all other things, that ſo
wicked men may be convinc'd, that if ſuch men do ſome things
that I do not underſtand, yet ſurelie it is for ſome thing that
God hath made known to them more than to me, for I find this,
that in all things that I do underſtand there they walk exactly,
therfore though there be ſome things that they do that I cannot
underſtand, why ſhould I be enraged againſt them? As now in
point of inſtitution of Worſhip, which doth not depend upon
the light of Nature at all, but meerly upon Scripture, and ſuch
and ſuch interpretations of Scripture; and ſuch principles wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men have no skill in: Now the profeſſors of Religion they
are tyed up by inſtitution, and by the words of Scripture thus
interpreted, which they think in their conſciences is the truth,
they having compared all things together think this is the mind
of Chriſt rather than the other, and ſo long as they think thus
they muſt follow it: Now there's many of theſe things that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
men underſtand not, (for they take no pains to ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them) and therefore they will be angry with you for them;
and indeed they will have cauſe to be angry with you for thoſe
things they underſtand not, if they ſee you make no conſcience
of thoſe things that they underſtand; but if in other things
that they do underſtand you walk circumſpectly, and that it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29998:18"/>
appear to them that in thoſe things they underſtand they walk
conſcionably, then they will beleeve that it was meer conſcience
that made you differ from them in thoſe things which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
not, or had no skill in; this will make them ready to
ſtand for you, yea to ſpeak and plead for you (no ſuch way to
get true libertie of conſcience as this is) if you be careful to walk
blameleſlie in all thoſe things that they underſtand with whom
you converſe; they will be convinced in their conſciences that
if theſe men differ from us, it's conſcience that makes them differ,
for (ſay they) we find that in all thoſe things we underſtand
theſe men walk conſcionablie. Certainlie a holie Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will make manie men (even carnal men themſelves) plead
for libertie of conſcience (ſo far as things be not deſtructive to
godlineſs or the Kingdom) for ſuch men, they will ſay, were
they all ſuch men as theſe men are they might verie wel be born
withal, for they differ in nothing but that conſcience puts them
upon, (ſay they) for we find them in all their waies ſquare and
juſt, they walk conſcionablie. Therefore be careful of your
Converſations, becauſe in ſome things you cannot but do that
which will diſpleaſe wicked men.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Arg.</hi> Fourthlie, <hi>Conſider that your lives are but ſhort, within a
while you muſt have your Converſations either among Devils or Angels,
one of the two; and how ſoon it may be, only God knows.</hi> Now then
I would appeal and put this to your conſciences, Are your
Converſations now, ſuch as can give you comfort? Oh I hope
within a while I ſhall have my Converſation among Angels; I
deſire now that the will of God may be done in earth as it is in
heaven, and that my familie and life were as it were a heaven,
I would fain have my Converſation in heaven now, and this
gives me ſome good hope that my Converſation ſhall be with
Angels within a while.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, Will not mens conſciences miſ-give
them, if you would make a judgment of what your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall be within a while by that they are now? are not the
Converſations of many of you in your families, and when you
come in ſome companie more like to thoſe that are appointed to
have their Converſation among Devils?</p>
                  <p>Why? what's done among Devils? there's hatred Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29998:18"/>
and of God, and of his Saints, there's railing and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming,
the Devils they accuſe the Brethren, and blaſpheme
the Name of God; And what is your Converſation otherwiſe
than theirs? Know, that your Converſation is ſuch as is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
fore-runner, that if you continue as now you are, that
within a while your Converſation will be among Devils; for
that's the moſt ſutable to you.</p>
                  <p>And my Brethren conſider further, The eyes of the world,
yea the eyes of God, and of Chriſt, and the Angels are upon
you, to ſee how grace acts in your Converſations; the eyes of
the world are upon you watching for your halting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing:
remember but this; that your Converſations are not
onlie before men, but the eyes of God, and Chriſt, and His
holy Angels, they look upon you where ever you are; when
you are in your familie, there God, Chriſt, and His holie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
ſtand looking upon you to ſee what your Converſation is
with your wife, husband, children, ſervants; when you come
into companie, there the Lord God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
ſtand looking upon you: and therfore look to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, The eyes of wicked men are upon you, they
watch for your haulting, and they would rejoice to ſee any
thing that they might have againſt you. That place that we had
before, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. where the Holie Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>That whereas
they ſpeak againſt you as evil doers, they may by your good works which
they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of viſitation.</hi> The word is
thus: that is, Beholding with a narrow circumſpection; it is
not onlie ſeeing, but with a narrow circumſpection: Oh!
it's an excellent thing, that when wicked men bend their eyes
and look narrowlie upon the Saints, and would be glad and
rejoice if they could find them halting, yet that they are able
to find nothing. As it was ſaid of Chriſt, the Phariſees ſent to
watch Him, but they could find nothing amiſs in Him. And ſo
though others ſhould be ſent on purpoſe to watch your lives,
yet your lives ſhould be ſo exact that they might find nothing
amiſſe in you.</p>
                  <p>And I conclude all with that excellent promiſe that we have
to ſuch as are careful of their Converſations. In <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50. 23.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29998:19"/>
Theſe times you all crie out of, as dangerous times: Mark, that
one Scripture will help you that are careful of your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
againſt the danger of the times wherein we live: <hi>Who ſe
offereth praiſe, glorifieth me; and to him that ordereth his Converſation
aright, will I ſhew the Salvation of God.</hi> Theſe are times that you
are called upon for praiſes and thankſgiving for mercies, we
are bound to do that: but mark, Do not put off God with a
verbal praiſe: it's true, he that offereth praiſe, honoreth me;
but yet together there muſt be an ordering of our Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and to him that ordereth his Converſation aright, will I
ſheſh the Salvation of God: This is that which is required of
Chriſtians, to order their Converſations aright: Oh! it's an
excellent thing to ſee the Converſations of Chriſtians in due
order, all guided with Spiritual wiſdom and holineſs; Oh that
man or woman that is careful to order their Converſations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
here is a promiſe to them: <hi>That the Lord will ſhew them his
Salvation:</hi> What ever times thou liveſt in, though never ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
though God apear never ſo dreadful in the times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou liveſt, yet if thou canſt have but this teſtimonie of thy
conſcience, Lord, thou knoweſt it is the care of my ſoul, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make profeſſion of Religion, but to order my Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
aright, therefore Lord, ſave me in evil times, Lord ſhew me
thy ſalvation: thou maieſt take this promiſe and lay it to thy
heart, and comfort thy heart with it, thou maieſt plead it with
God in prayer, Oh make it to be a matter of thy prayer to God
In theſe evil times, that the Lord would ſhew His Salvation to
thee, becauſe He hath put it into thy heart through His Grace
to order thy Converſation aright.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE concluded the laſt day with an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Chriſtians. Do you hope that God
hath wrought the work of Convertion? Be
you careful of your Converſation. And many
motives there were to ſtir up Chriſtians to be
careful of their Converſations. I ſhall not
look back, but proceed; only give unto you
ſome few Rules that I deſire to add unto the Motives, and then
we ſhall come unto the Second point.</p>
               <p>Look to your Converſations, and eſpecially obſerve theſe
Rules.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Rule.</hi> Firſt, <hi>If you be convinced that it ought to be your care to
look to your Converſation, then have a ſpecial regard to the duties
of your Relations.</hi> The work of Grace in mens Converſations
doth appear much in the duties of their Relations; as children
towards their parents, parents towards their children; ſervants
towards their maſters, maſters towards their ſervants; husbands
towards wives, wives towards husbands; the younger towards
the elder, the elder towards the younger: if you ſtand in a
private, or publick place, Majeſtrates, or Subjects; if you profeſs
godlineſs, manifeſt in your Converſations in performing the
duties of your relations: what ſoever men may talk of godlines,
except it appear in their relations, except a ſervant be a diligent
obedient and a faithful ſervant, all his, her or their talk of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29998:20"/>
is to no purpoſe; except a child be an obedient and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
child, a wiſe an obedient and loving wife, all profeſſion
of Religion is to no purpoſe; and ſo on the otherſide, except
maſters, and husbands, and parents be careful in their places
to perform the duties of their relation, all their Religion will
come to nothing; look to your Converſations in the duties of
your relations.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Rule.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Look to your ſelves in thoſe things that eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
you are moſt in danger to offend in, take heed of that ſpeciall ſin
that you are moſt inclined to, that that do not break forth in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.</hi>
It may be in your Converſation you will have a
care that you do not offend in ſuch and ſuch things that you ſee
other men offend in, but there is ſome ſpecial haunt of evil,
there is ſome other ſin that your natures are moſt inclin'd unto,
and you (it may be) give liberty to your ſelves in that; this ſpoils
your Converſations, this darkens your Converſations, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
good you do otherwiſe this ſpoils it all: If you give but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to your ſelves in that corruption that your natures are
moſt prone unto, nay if you be not more watchful againſt that
corruption than againſt any, your Converſation will have no
beauty at all in it, God will have no glorie by it, you will but
diſhonor your profeſſion; therefore if you would make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to have your Converſation to be rightly ordered, be very
watchful over your ſelves in that ſpecial ſin that your nature is
moſt inclin'd unto; Are you one that find your ſelf very haſty
by nature? it may be you are not guiltie of other ſins ſo much,
I but that will ſpoil the beauty of your Converſation; a man or
woman that is a froward peeviſh and paſſionate Profeſſor,
there's no beauty in their Converſation: And ſo if you find
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> your diſpoſition to ponuriouſneſs, and coveteouſneſs, that
will darken all, and carry you into fooliſh luſts (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaks) Oh how have men that have made profeſſion of
Religion, by one fit of baſe covetouſneſs been carried into ſuch
fooliſh luſts that every boy in the ſtreets could point at them as
fooliſh and ſilly ones, and crack their credits, and names,
and wound their own ſouls, yea, and endanger their lives,
and make them a by-word to all, and diſhonor their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and get nothing by it at length! Coveteouſneſs carries
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29998:20"/>
into fooliſh luſts, fooliſh baſe ſordid extreams, unbeſeeming
the Goſpel of Chriſt; as we ſhall hear more when we come to
ſpeak of what Converſation we ſhould have as becomes the
Goſpel of Chriſt; take heed of your ſpecial ſins if you would
be careful of your Converſations.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Rule.</hi> A third Rule is this, <hi>Take heed of temptations that you are
liable to without, by reaſon of your calling, by reaſon of your places
wherein you are, or through any providence of God that may be; theſe
temptations that do moſt attend your condition, take heed of them.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one ſhould conſider this; what temptation am I moſt liable
to? ſome mens callings are liable to ſome temptations, other
mens to others, ſome men by reaſon of their buſineſſes and
occaſions in the world are liable to ſuch and ſuch temptations
as others are not, and ſometimes a man is liable to ſome tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that he is not liable to at another time; when you are at
Sea you have your temptations there in forraign parts, and
when you come home you have other temptations, yea manie
times when a man is at home among his neighbours there he
dares not take that liberty that he doth when he is gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in a journey, then he thinks he is free when no bodie
knows of it, there's his temptation; and ſo you that come from
Sea, when you were there you were kept ſhort of manie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and of much companie; now when you come home, the
companie comes about you, now theres a temptation comes that
was not heretofore; now if you would make conſcience of
your Converſations, you ſhould look to your temptations,
and conſider, what temptations am I liable to now, that I was
not before, and let me be careful of them. This you pray to
God, that you may not be led into <hi>temptations, but delivered from
evil;</hi> if you would not dally with God in your prayers then be
careful of your ſelves when a temptation comes to ſuch and
ſuch evils: this is a vain plea for men and women to ſay, Oh
the temptation was a ſtrong temptation: God expected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(if you have the Spirit of Chriſt and wiſdom) that you
ſhould fore-ſee temptations, and eſpeciallie that you ſhould be
careful when temptations come, you ſhould watch againſt all
temptations: What a vain plea were it for a Soldier that keeps
a Town, to ſay, Oh but they came againſt ſuch a weak part
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29998:21"/>
of the Town with a great ſtrengh; That's no argument to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him; for if you knew that that was the weakeſt part, you
could not but know that if the enemy knew of it he would come
againſt that with his greateſt ſtrength, and therefore you ſhould
have man'd that part rather than any other part of the Town;
ſo let not us ſay, O the temptation came ſtronglie upon me in
ſuch a thing: we ſhould watch the more againſt that that the
temptation comes ſtrongeſt upon us in, for the Devil knows
wherein we are the weakeſt. And that's the third Rule for the
helping of us in our Coverſations.</p>
               <p>Fourthly obſerve this, <hi>Take heed of defiling your ſelves with the
ſins of the times wherein you live.</hi> That the Lord doth expect from
everie Chriſtian that he ſhould look to himſelf in regard of the
preſent times wherein he lives, and conſider what's the ſpecial
ſin of the Time, Age, or of the Place; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie as there are ſome
truths that are more eminentlie revealed in one Age than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo there are ſome ſins that more prevail in one Age than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and in one Place than another, everie Countrie almoſt
have their ſins that are moſt predominate; you ſhould conſider
(I ſay) what are the ſins of the Times, of the Places where you
live; manie they think to excuſe themſelves becauſe that which
they do it is but what others do, it is the common ſin of the
Time and Place where they live, thou ſhouldſt be ſo much the
more careful to avoid it, that thou maieſt keep thy ſelf undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in thy way; and that's a fourth Rule for the helping of us
in our Converſations.</p>
               <p>A fift Rule for the helping of our Converſations is, <hi>To live ſo
that your lives ſhall be convincing lives.</hi> Then take heed of anie
ſecret ſin, take heed of keeping anie ſin at all within thy heart,
for it will break out, take heed of entertaining ſin ſo much as
in thy thoughts or affections; what's the reaſon that ſome that
have been Profeſſors of Religion a great while and ſeem'd to be
verie glorious in their profeſſion, and yet at length break out
into ſome vile ſcandalous ſin? Surelie the reaſon is, they have
kept hid ſome corruption within, and they have thought it
were a verie horrible thing that this corruption in my heart
and thought ſhould break out, Oh God forbid (ſaith he) I
hope I ſhall never live to that time to be ſo left of God as to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29998:21"/>
commit this ſin! well, thou thinkeſt verily that thou ſhalt not
commit it, I but if thou takeſt libertie to dally and play with
this ſin ſecretlie in thy thoughts, and affections, it is juſt with
God to leave thee to thy ſelf to ſhame thy ſelf, to leave thee
to the commiſſion of that ſin thou haſt for a long time kept
dandling in thy thoughts and affections within, although it
be with reſolution not to commit it; that man that ſhall
pleaſe himſelf in any kind of ſecret ſin (I ſay) it were juſt with
God to lead him forth with the worker of iniquity, ſo as to lay
his ſhame open and naked before all that he lives with: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you that are Profeſſors of Religion be careful of ſecret ſins,
if you would never diſhonor your profeſſion in your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>A ſixth Rule is this, <hi>If you would be careful of your Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
do not ſo much look at thoſe that are beneath you and in the lower
form; as let your eye be upon thoſe that are moſt eminent in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
look upon them rather as your mark and aime.</hi> Manie
Chriſtians live, and their Conuerſations are very dark and no
beauty at all in them; Why? Becauſe they think they live as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do, they look upon ſuch are beneath them, and they
think their lives are rather better than ſome others that have
made profeſſion, and this makes them go on in a dull and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
way; but now, if you would have your Converſation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as it ought, ſo as to be convincing, ſet before you the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the moſt eminent of thoſe whoſe Converſation doth
moſt gliſter, not a meer gliſtering ſhew, I do not mean them,
But that gliſtering that comes from Diamonds and Gold and
Pearls, that have the excellencie of Grace ſhining in their verie
Faces and Converſations, ſet them before you, and labor to
imitate them, and ſo this will help you in your Converſations.
We have in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. a Scripture for this, <hi>Remember them which
have the rule over you, who have ſpoken unto you the Word of God, whoſe
faith follow, conſidering the end of their Converſations.</hi> 'Tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that they ſhould be moſt eminent, <hi>Such as have the rule
over them,</hi> that are their Guids; but mark, he ſpeaks of thoſe
that had ſpoken unto them the Word of God, for he doth not
ſpeak of the Rulers in Civil States, but of the Miniſters that
were their Guids, for ſo the word is: now though there be a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29998:22"/>
work of <hi>Ruling</hi> beſides <hi>Teaching,</hi> we find in Scripture; yet we
find no Rule of anie Miniſter but over thoſe that they ſpeak the
Word of God unto, what Ruling any Miniſter hath (I ſay) it is
over ſuch people as he ſpeaks the Word of God to: If anie Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
ſhall come to rule over a people, that people may well ask
them, <hi>Have you ſpoken the Word of God to us? Do you teach us the
Word of God?</hi> Do you chalenge Rule over us and have not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Word of God to us? <hi>Remember them which have the Rule
over you, who have ſpoken unto you the Word of God, whoſe Faith fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
conſidering the end of their Converſations.</hi> They were it ſeems
eminent in holineſs of life, and eminent ſo as they continued in
that way of eminencie, and the Apoſtle would have all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to look at them; it's a notable Scripture to ſhew that the
Miniſters of the Word ſhould be eminent in their Converſations
everie way, and that all thoſe that they ſpeak the Word of
God to, ſhould ſee in their Converſations the Beautie and the
Excellencie of the Word of God that they ſpeak to them; for
people look at the lives of Miniſters as well as at their Word, it
is not enough onlie to be a good man in the Pulpit, except it be
in the conſtant way of their Converſations.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt Rule, you have it here in this Scripture
<hi>Heb. 13. 7. Whoſe faith follow, Conſidering the end of ther Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi>
That is, be not only careful of your Converſations at
firſt, when you begin to be profeſſors of Religion, then to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act,
but be conſtant to the verie end. Mark, <hi>Conſidering the end
of their Converſations:</hi> he doth not mean <hi>the end</hi> onlie, the reward
that comes upon their Converſations, that they ſhal have a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
reward, but conſidering <hi>the end,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay thus,
look at theſe that have ſpoken the Word of God to you, they
come not onlie at the verie firſt to you and ſpeak great things,
and ſeem as if they were Saints or Angels come among you, but
they go on in a conſtant way, whatſoever diſcouragements
they have they go on in a conſtant way to the verie dying day;
obſerve not onlie what they were when they came firſt among
you, but what they are in the end of their Converſations, and
follow them: this is a notable Scripture to ſhew how careful
Chriſtians ought to be, not onlie to be holie in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
when their hearts are firſt ſtir'd by the Miniſtrie of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29998:22"/>
Word as 'tis with many, many there are that when the Word of
God comes firſt to them, when they are firſt enlightened, and
firſt converted, Oh how ſtrict are they! Oh how careful are
they! then they walk exactly, and they are afraid of the leaſt
ſin, and examine everie thing by the Word, Oh how curious
are they in everie thing then! and-their conſciences are verie
tender, and are afraid that this is ſin, and that the other thing
is ſin, and there is a mightie change in the familie, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
or Parents they ſee them ſo afraid of everie thing, and
careful of their verie words, on the Lords Day careful in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of God, and attending upon Ordinances, and in their
particular calling at the firſt verie ſtrict: But now, within a
little time you ſhall find manie of theſe that by degrees they
grow more looſe, and eſpeciallie in theſe times, becauſe in
theſe times there is a way that the Devil hath to get men to be
looſe in their Converſations, that hath not been known in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
indeed in <hi>Germany</hi> it was known, and there it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarilie
in the beginning of <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformation; that it is
weakneſs in men to make conſcience of dutie, to be troubled for
their ſin and be humbled. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> it was
their weakneſs when they were troubled ſo much for their ſin:
Oh this is a moſt horrid and abominable wickedneſs that doth
diſhonor the Goſpel of Chriſt, and will make it rediculous to
the world! (I ſay) ſuch carriages of people, to think that they
may take libertie to walk in a looſe way becauſe of the Goſpel.
But that we ſhall come more fully to, when we ſpeak how our
Converſations ſhould be <hi>becoming the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> But I ſpeak
this in this point as a preparation to that, &amp; eſpeciallie to young
Profeſſors that have been wrought upon by the Word within
theſe few yeers, ſince there hath bin more freedom of preaching
the Goſpel; and I verily beleeve that divers of you in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
do know many young ones and others, that have
been wrought upon by the Miniſtrie of the Word, that for the
firſt yeer were verie exact, and verie careful of their lives, and
verie punctual in every thing, but you now ſee them begin to
grow looſe and wanton, and vain in their Converſations: Oh
this is a ſad and an evil thing! If you would be careful of your
Converſations obſerve this ſeventh Rule; Be not onlie careful
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29998:23"/>
at the firſt work of God upon you when you begin to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,
but in the conſtant courſe of your lives; Oh give
me a profeſſor of Religion, that was wrought upon when he
was a Youth, or a young Maid, and yet continues till they be
old diſciples in a conſtant way of holineſs and ſtrictneſs, Oh!
They are the moſt beautiful objects that are in the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!
the Sun in the firmament is not ſo glorious, as an ancient
profeſſor of Religion that hath continued conſtant in the waies
of godlineſs from his youth, that can ſay as good <hi>Obadiah</hi> once
ſaid, 1 <hi>King. 18. 12. I have feared the Lord from my youth,</hi> and
my conſcience, though it tell me of many failings and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
yet my conſcience excuſeth me in this, that I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
with a good conſcience to walk with God, and without
offence to man, and not given way to my ſelf in any way of
looſneſs ſince God made known Himſelf to me; Oh ſuch may
have an abundance entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, and
die with abundance of comfort. But thus much for this firſt
point: That Chriſtians ought to be careful of their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>We come now to the ſecond, and that is the main point in
the Text.</p>
               <p>Let your Converſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Every kind of Converſation of profeſſors is not enough;
it muſt riſe to that height as muſt be ſutable to the Goſpel of Chriſt, meet
for the Goſpel that they do profeſs. <hi>That's our point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we ſhall come to the Particulars, what Converſation
it is that is <hi>meet for the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> I gave you the Heads
in the opening of it: But now I ſhall ſpeak to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That Converſation that is meet and becomes the Goſpel of
Chriſt, muſt be a Converſation raiſed to a higher degree than the light
of Nature will raiſe it.</hi> That Converſation that is no higher than
poſſibly may be raiſed by the light of Nature, certainly that's
not a Converſation becoming the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> that's beneath
not fit for the Goſpel of Chriſt. As thus,</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a man in his Boat here in the Thames rows, very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
I but this is not a work ſutable to ſhew the skill of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigator,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29998:23"/>
of one that profeſſes the art of Navigation, it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
that. Why ſo; To live exactly according to the light
of Nature it is beneath the Converſation that becomes the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Chriſt: if ſo be that a man ſhould make his boaſt that he
hath great skill in the art of Navigation; And how will he
ſhew this skill? he will go into a Boat and there he will row
over the Thames, and by that you may ſee what a mighty Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigator
he is; this would be ridiculous to any man. And ſo
if one that profeſſes the Goſpel of Chriſt, would manifeſt that
he is a good Chriſtian, What doth he do? the life that he lives
it is no other than a man by the light of Nature may be enabled
to, this is even as ridiculous as the other.</p>
               <p>1. As now for inſtance; The light of Nature that will teach
this: <hi>That we are to worſhip God:</hi> the Heathens have worſhiped
God in their way.</p>
               <p>2. Yea, the light of Nature will teach, <hi>That we muſt live juſtly
among men,</hi> yea, <hi>and that we muſt do as we would be done to:</hi> This
the light of Nature will teach. Many of the Heathens have had
that principle, to be juſt with men, to do as we would be done
by. The light of Nature condemns groſſe ſins, of Drunkenneſs,
Adulterie, Swearing &amp;c. I could give you many inſtances in the
Laws of Heathens, puniſhing thoſe ſins very ſeverely, and ſome
of them with death.</p>
               <p>3. Yea the light of Nature will riſe thus high, <hi>That a man
ſhould be conſciencious, ſhould make conſcience of ſecret ſins, of ſins
that none in the world could know of, or are ever like to know of.</hi> As
I remember ſometimes I have told you of one of the Heathens
that did but owe for a pair of ſhoos to a Shoo maker, and
no body knew it but only the Shoo-maker himſelfe; the
Shoo-maker dies, no body could challenge this of him, yet
his conſcience would never let him be at quiet, until he ran and
threw the money into the ſhop, and ſaid, <hi>Though he be dead to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yet he is not dead to me:</hi> whereas he had a temptation to have
kept it becauſe no body could challeng it; he knew it was not
his, he knew it was either the Childrens, or Executors, and ſo
he reſtortd it. Many particulars might be named to ſhew how far
we might go by the light of Nature; but now I only bring it in
to this end, to ſhew that if we would have our Converſations
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29998:24"/>
ſuch as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, we muſt go beyond what
ever anie have done by the light of Nature: and yet Oh Lord
how ſhort do manie Profeſſors of Religion come of this! How
manie that will profeſs they hope to be ſav'd by Chriſt! I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
there is not anie one in this Congregation, or if I ſhould
go to everie ones houſe that belongs to the Pariſh, they would
ſay they hope to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt; and yet what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God is there? And what juſtice is there among men to
do as they would be done by? Nay, this is a Rule that will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
manie profeſſors of Religion, and their conſciences would
tell them that in ſuch and ſuch things they would be loth to
be dealt with as they deal with others: And for groſs ſins,
manie Profeſſors of Religion break out into them alſo, for all
are a kind of Profeſſors of the Goſpel at large, Drunkards, and
Adulterers, and Blaſphemers, and yet they will come and make
profeſſion of Religion, and think it very much if they ſhould
be denied the Sacrament of the Bodie and Blood of Chriſt, Why,
are they not Chriſtians? and their children Chriſtians? and
yet muſt they not be Baptized? And yet they are beneath Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
Heathens will riſe in Judgment againſt them. And
for conſcienciouſneſs in ſecret, I appeal to everie one of your
conſciences, are there no ſins that you live in that your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
condemns you for? A Heathen would not do it, a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
would not wilfully live in a ſin that his conſcience tells
him is a ſin, manie of the Heathens came to that: And what way
have you made in profeſſion? Perhaps you have ſeemed to be
in the School of Chriſt manie yeers, and others take you for a
forward Profeſſor, and yet your conſcience tells you that you
live in ſome ſins that are known ſins to you, but becauſe they are
ſecret and none knows them but your ſelf, therefore you have
continued in them, and ventured upon them hoping of Gods
pardon, being perhaps but one and no great one, (I ſay) in this
you are beneath the light of Nature, and therefore you are far
from having your Converſations <hi>ſuch as becomes the Goſpel of Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi> This Converſation of yours is not ſuch as becomes the
light of Nature; divers Heathens would abhor ſuch Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Chriſtians, yea, if it were among themſelves, and they
would hardlie companie with you; there are manie that make
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29998:24"/>
profeſſion of Religion, that (I ſay) if they lived among Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
Heathens would not keep companie with a great part of
this Kingdom, yea and of moſt Congregations, and therefore
they ſhould not think much though they may not be admitted
into ſuch a near communion as the <hi>Lords ſupper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>You will ſay then,</hi> But what is that Converſation becoming
the Goſpel, that is beyond the light of Nature?</p>
               <p>Firſt, The light of Nature teaches to worſhip a God: That
many of you do, you worſhip God: But this is that that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>To worſhip &amp; honor God as a Father,</hi> &amp;
as the <hi>Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> this goes beyond the <hi>light
of Nature</hi> in that particular; not only I am convinc'd that there
is a God, that He is the Creator of Heaven and Earth, and my
Creator, and therefore I'le worſhip Him; but I do not do that
that becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, til I get my ſelf to this, That
I am able through the grace of the Goſpel to worſhip God as a
Father reconciled to me in Chriſt, and as the Father of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo do I come and preſent all my ſervices
unto God: This few of our Civil men do; yet your Civil men
will make a profeſſion of the Goſpel too, and your Civil men
they worſhip God, but it is in a meer natural way. The God
of Heaven and Earth, that made them, is to be worſhiped: they
can ſay their old Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who made you?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore did he make you?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>He made me to ſerve Him &amp;c.</hi> I but doeſt thou (when thou
comeſt to ſerve and worſhip the Lord) look upon God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reconcil'd in Chriſt, and as the Father of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt? and ſo doeſt thou tender up all thy ſervices to God?
Thou art not raiſed to that that becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt,
except thou doeſt thus worſhip God in this way; that's that
which becomes the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> and know that all other
worſhip that thou tendereſt up to God, meerly as God is Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
God that made thee, and therfore thou muſt ſerve him: I ſay
al that worſhip (if thou goeſt no further) God rejects it; indeed
we are to worſhip God as a Creator, God would have that;
I but, if He hath not that and the other too, and if He have not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29998:25"/>
both, he will not accept of one, for the firſt is included in the
ſecond, but the ſecond is not included in the firſt. A man that
worſhips God as a Father, and as the Father of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, he doth worſhip God as a Cretor too; but a man
may worſhip God as a Creator and not at all be acquainted
with Him as a Father, and as the Father of our Lord Jeſus,
and therefore till the Lord in the Miniſtrie of the Goſpel hath
been pleaſed to ſhine in upon thy ſoul as a Father, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou comeſt to worſhip God
thus, or at leaſt this is the endeavour of thy ſoul that thou
maieſt worſhip God in this way, thou art not ſatisfied in
worſhiping God after the other way, becauſe he made thee,
and thy heart works after this, indeed I have not got this full
aſſurance that he is my Father, but this is that my heart is
unſatisfied untill I have got it, and I cannot be quiet in anie
other kind of worſhiping God, till I find ſome abilitie to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
up all to him as a Father, and as the Father of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, (I ſay) till thou comeſt to this, thou doeſt not in
that particular worſhip God as becomes the Goſpel of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo in the point of Juſtice, thou doeſt give every one his
own. I but this is beneath that that is required in thy dealing
with men according to the Goſpel of Chriſt. If you reade the 5.
of <hi>Mat.</hi> there you ſhall find when Chriſt comes to preach what
he requires, he raiſes the point of Juſtice beyond doing as we
would be dealt with: ſaith Chriſt there, <hi>You have heard that it hath
been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. But I ſay
unto you, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them
that hate you, and pray for them which deſpightfully uſe you, and
perſecut you;</hi> this is higher than meerly to be juſt, and for one
man not to wrong another; you ſhall have manie men ſay,
Who is able to ſay black is mine eye? I live and no bodie can ſay
I wrong them; you think this is an excellent Converſation, it's
true, it is good in its kind and it were good if all Profeſſors of
Religion could ſay they live ſo that no body can charge them
for unjuſt dealings, I but this doth not riſe to that height to be
the Converſation as <hi>becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> you muſt come
to this height, to love your enemies, and to bleſs them that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29998:25"/>
curſe you, you muſt do good to them that hate you, and pray
for them that deſpightfully uſe you and perſecute you; Can you
find this: this is ſomewhat like the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than to do no wrong to others.</p>
               <p>And to do as we would be done to, we muſt go higher, we
muſt not onlie ſet this as a pattern, <hi>I'le do as I would be done by.</hi>
No, <hi>But I'le labour to do to another as God hath done to me.</hi> This
is higher; that's thus, hath God ſhewed Himſelf gracious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me? I'le labour to do that good to others as much as I am
able even as God hach done to me: You have for that thoſe
two Scriptures, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 31, 32. Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and
anger, and clamor, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you with all
malice, and be ye kind one towards another, tender hearted, forgiving
one another.</hi> The light of Nature now will juſtifie all this: But
mark the concluſion, <hi>Even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven
you:</hi> Set the example of God before you, what God hath done
for you for Chriſts ſake, and let that be the great motive; Do
not only argue thus, well, I would be forgiven if I had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and I would not have another to bear anger and malice
againſt mee, and therefore I will not be angrie with them nor
malign them; this is a low principle: but if I find that this is
revealed in the Goſpel, that the Lord for Chriſts ſake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
me, and it's this that quiets my paſſion, when I feel my
corruption riſing and ſtirring againſt any that hath offended
me, when I do but think of Gods mercie in forgiving me for
Chriſts ſake, this quiets me. I this is ſomewhat like as <hi>becomes
the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> when we walk upon ſuch principles as theſe
are. And ſo you have it in <hi>Col. 3. 13. Forbearing one another, and
forgiving one another: If any man have a quarrel againſt any, even
as Chriſt forgive you, ſo alſo do ye.</hi> It is very unbeſeeming ſuch
as profeſs the Goſpel of Chriſt to be quarrelſome with their
neighbours: Now you ſhall have ſome that are of very meek
and quiet diſpoſitions naturally, I love to live quiet (ſay ſome
men;) thus far thou maieſt come by the light of Nature not to
love to quarrel: But now when any doth cauſe any quarrel,
doeſt thou labor to quiet the quarrel upon this ground: <hi>Evn
as Chriſt forgave me:</hi> O I have found the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
my wretchedneſs againſt Him, and all the wrong
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29998:26"/>
I have done Him, He hath forgiven me, and therefore ſeeing
Chriſt will not take advantage againſt me as He might, I will
not take advantage againſt another: Is it upon this ground?
And doſt thou raiſe thy Converſation with thy Neighbor in
keeping from quarrelſomneſs, and contentiouſneſs, doſt thou
naiſe it to this height, upon this ground, ſo to forgive as Chriſt
hath forgiven you? I will not forgive only in this particular,
or in this leſſe offence, But <hi>as Chriſt hath forgiven me.</hi> We ſhall
ſtill have further occaſion to mention theſe things, in opening
the ſutableneſs of our Converſations to the Goſpel; that is, for
the point of Juſtice, it muſt riſe higher than that of doing as we
would be done by.</p>
               <p>And then for groſſe ſins, thou keepeſt from them, thou than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
God, thou art no Swearer, no Drunkard, no Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ſuch kind of notorious ſins thou art not guilty of: but
what art thou in reſpect of inward ſins? what art thou in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of ſecret ſins? Mark that Scripture in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10. ſaith
Chriſt there, <hi>I ſay unto you, That except your righteouſneſs ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, you ſhall in no caſe
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> We ſhall likewiſe ſpeak fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this, when we open that of the Law, that our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
muſt riſe higher than the Converſations of thoſe did
that lived under the Law, or elſe it doth not become the <hi>Goſpel
of Chriſt.</hi> You ſhall find further in the Chapter, how Chriſt
would raiſe them higher than meerly not to commit adulterie,
or to be openly prophane: Verſe. 17. <hi>Ye have heard that it was
ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery. But I ſay
unto you, That whoſoever looketh on a woman, to luſt after her, hath
committed adultery with her already in his heart. And if thy right eye
offend thee, pluck it out and caſt it from thee: for it is profitable for thee
that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whol body
ſhould be caſt into Hell.</hi> And then, <hi>If thy right hand offend thee, cut
it off.</hi> And ſo in the point of Anger, in the 21, &amp; 22. verſes, <hi>Ye
have heard, that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not kill:
and whoſoever ſhall kill, ſhall be in danger of the Judgment. But I
ſay unto you, That whoſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe,
ſhall be in danger of the judgment: and whoſoever ſhall ſay unto his
brother, Racha, ſhall be in danger of the councel: but woſoever ſhall
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29998:26"/>
ſay, Thou fool, ſhal be in danger of hell fire:</hi> That is, liable to the ſame
judgment that you think murder is. Now is your converſations
<hi>as becometh the Goſpel?</hi> Here Chriſt is a great Preacher of the
Goſpel; and ſhews that there is more ſtrictneſs in the Goſpel
than ther is by the light of Nature, or by the Law, or by that
that they underſtand by the Law: This the light of Nature
doth dictate, that men ſhould not Kill, nor commit Adultrie,
but now, If thy Converſation be ſuch as becomes the Goſpel,
then thou muſt make conſcience of Anger, and tremble at that
as a natural man would tremble at Murder, for that becomes the
Goſpel; (I ſay) one that is a profeſſor of the Goſpel, he ſhould
tremble at ſinful anger as a natural man would tremble at
murder; for obſerve it here, look what (they ſaid) murder did
make a man liable to; the ſame thing (Chriſt ſaith) Anger
would make a man liable to; therefore one that would walk
as becomes the Goſpel, muſt tremble at the inward ſin of Anger,
as a natural man would tremble at the outward ſin of Murder.</p>
               <p>And ſo for Adultry, <hi>Thou art no Whoremonger.</hi> But one that
profeſſes the Goſpel, muſt look at the luſting of the eye, and of
the heart, as a natural man that hath but the light of Nature
would look upon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion of Adultrie, for Chriſtlaies that
upon the luſt of the heart that they lay upon the commiſſion of
Adultrie. <hi>This is as becometh the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, <hi>By the light of Nature a man may be conſciencious.</hi> That
is, make conſcience of ſeveral ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But now you will ſay, <hi>Wherein ſhould a man go beyond this
as becomes the Goſpel?</hi> What can any man that profeſſes the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
go beyond this, of making conſcience of a ſecret ſin, that
though he knew that no bodie in the world did know his ſin?
nay, ſuppoſe he knew certainlie that it ſhould never be known,
yet he dares not do it, how can a man go beyond that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, <hi>You muſt labor for the mortification of the body of ſin
that is within you;</hi> not onlie to make conſcience to keep from the
act of ſecret ſins, but thy work muſt be to labor for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the bodie of ſin and death that is in thee, that's
that that is reveal'd by the Goſpel, that no man by the light of
Nature ever knew; you ſhall never reade among all the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
of the point of Original ſin, nor of mortification of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29998:27"/>
body of ſin and death, this the light of Nature never tels. So
that now, when a man come to his height, that is, firſt my
conſcience being enlightned by the Word ſo that I dare not
commit any ſecret ſin for the world, though there be none but
God and my conſcience together, but beſides that, <hi>Oh I carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with me a body of ſin and death, a root of bitterneſs,</hi> that original
corruption, and this makes me cry out, <hi>Oh wretched man, Oh
wretched woman! who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> and
Oh that I could find this mortified in me, this is that that is
the ſtrength and endeavor of my ſoul, to get this bodie of ſin
to be mortified, <hi>I, this is as becomes the Goſpel,</hi> ſo to live in your
Converſations as it may appear that you are not content meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to keep from actual ſins, though in ſecret, but it is your
great care and endeavour to mortifie this verie bodie of death
that is within you; and by this a great manie of your Civil
men, and meer moral men will or at leaſt may be convinced
that their Converſations comes ſhort of that that becomes the
Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, for they are not acquainted with this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If you would have your Converſations ſuch as becomes the
Goſpel of Chriſt, you muſt not only think to make conſcience of ſecret
ſins, but that which you do, you muſt manifeſt that it doth proceed out
of Love, not only that you do obey, but that you love the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that you do obey. <hi>Now this, neither any hypocrit or meer
moral man doth, if you take it univerſallie one Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as well as another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> You will ſay, Love is a ſecret thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But as you may know in your family the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your childrens obedience to you and your ſervants, ſo
there may appear a difference between the obedience of one
that is meerly moral, or doth it out of conſcience, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that doth it out of love; therefore you muſt know that
you do not riſe beyond the light of Nature, except that you do
love the Command as well as obey the Command, and ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
things in your Converſations as you may make it appear
that all thoſe waie of God that you make conſcience of, that
you likewiſe have a love unto them, and do them out of a
principle of love, and thus you come beyond the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in ſome meaſure it is as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29998:27"/>
And that's the firſt thing how we ſhould walk in our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
as <hi>becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> But now this is the loweſt
of all.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>That our Converſations muſt be ſuch as is beyond
ſuch as live under the Law,</hi> for the Law of God goes higher than
the light of Nature, for there's more reveal'd there than in the
light of Nature. It's true, that that you call the moral Law, the
light of Nature, if it be cleer it is ſutable to it, to the moſt part
of it, only there is ſome part that is poſitive, but moſt part is
but ſutable to the principles of Nature if they were cleer and
pure; but now becauſe, ſince the fall of Man, the light of Nature
is darkned, and the principles of Nature are much corrupted,
therefore God hath given His Law, that is as it were a glaſs of
His Will, that is, the cleer glaſs of what was written in the
heart of man in Innocencie, that's the Law: Only there is that
of the limitation of the ſeventh Day particularly from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
that hath ſomewhat poſitive in it, but take all the other
and (I ſay) it is nothing but as a glaſs of what was written in
the heart of man in the time of Innocency: There was written
in mans heart to keep ſome ſolemn time for the worſhip of God,
only the ſpecification was by revelation, but the ſubſtance of all
thoſe ten Commandements (I ſay) is the glaſs of what was
written in the heart of man in Innocency: And becauſe God
ſaw that this writing was ſo much blotted out, almoſt all obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated,
therefore God wrote it in Tables of ſtone, whereas it
was written in the Table of mans heart at firſt; But now when
He comes to bring men to the Goſpel there He writes over that
Law again in the Tables of their hearts: At firſt it was written
in the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> but he falling, doth blot it out in a great
meaſure, then God writes it over fair again, but how? He
writes it over in a fair Copie, but it is in Tables of ſtone: but
when God receives any ſoul in the Goſpel He writes it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the Tables of their hearts; Now this gives you a little
hint of the difference between the Law and the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Converſations of men that were meerly Legal, and
the Converſation that is Evangelical: but the opening of it
to ſhew the difference between the Law and the Goſpel in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to this, and to ſhew how low the Converſation was that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29998:28"/>
was meerly Legal, and how high raiſed the Converſation of a
Chriſtian ought to be if he would make it Evangelical, ſuch as
<hi>becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> would ask more time, and therefore
we muſt defer that to the next day.</p>

                  <hi>it muſt

or elſe it doth not become the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed you already what the Goſpel
of Chriſt is. But now we are upon the point
of Converſation, That it muſt be higher than
can be by the Law, thoſe that live under the
Goſpel muſt live in a higher way of holineſs than thoſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under the Law. Now for this, we are to conſider of the
Law under theſe two conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>As it is a Covenant of works for life, ſo it was made at firſt
to Adam:</hi> It was a Covenant of works for eternal life to <hi>Adam,</hi>
and ſo to man kind in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We are to conſider the Law as in the Miniſtration of it by
Moſes:</hi> Take it either of theſe two waies. Thoſe that live under
the Goſpel, and profeſs the Goſpel, muſt live in a more holy
Converſation, or aim, or endeavour at leaſt after a more holy
Converſation than that Converſation could be that was under
the Law: As now, I ſay thus, the Law as the Covenant of life
to <hi>Adam,</hi> But what was his Converſation?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:29998:28"/>
Firſt, <hi>It was obedience to God meerly as Creator,</hi> no further;
<hi>Adam</hi> in innocency he lookt upon God as Creator of al things,
as the Firſt being of all, and ſo <hi>Adam</hi> tendered up his ſervice
to God meerly as the Creator and Firſt-being. That was his
obedience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Law to</hi> Adam <hi>had promiſe only of natural things,
of a natural life to be continued:</hi> We do not reade of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<hi>Adam</hi> to live in Heaven if he had obeyed; but, <hi>Do this and
live;</hi> that was the Tenour of the Covenant with him: that is,
he ſhould have continued in Paradiſe and ſo have lived a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
life, but yet continued eternally, God would have upheld
that natural life of his, that's all we reade of that ever God
promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi> if he had ſtood by vertue of that Covenant
of the Law: That's the ſecond thing conſiderable in him. ſo
that his obedience was tendred up to God to that end, that he
might obtain the continuance of a natural life here in this
world, only in order unto that, for we find no more revealed.
The firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> he was <hi>Natural,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the firſt
of the <hi>Earth earthly,</hi> the ſecond, <hi>the Lord from Heaven.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſpeaks of <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency as the common
head of al man-kind, he was of the <hi>Earth earthly,</hi> and in way of
diſtinction the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>Lord from Heaven;</hi> He brings
all heavenly glory. Though <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, yet we never
reade of any heavenly glory that ever he or his poſterity ſhould
have had; but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> he is the Lord from Heaven
that brings Heavenly glory with him. That's the ſecond thing
conſiderable in the Law as a Covenant with <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing in the Law as a Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> was
this, <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>under the Law he muſt have wrought by his own
ſtrength that he had received.</hi> God at firſt gave man ſtrength for
obedience, and he puts his ſtock into his own hand, and ſo he
muſt have wrought and continued by the power of the ſtrength
that God did at firſt give him, he had not that fountain to go
to for that continual ſupply of ſtrength as we have, which you
ſhall ſee preſently.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Adam, he was in ſuch a condition, as he was in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his miſcarrying for his eternal eſtate;</hi> He was indeed in a
way of obedience to the Law that God gave him, but ſtill ſo
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29998:29"/>
as he was in hazard of eternal miſcarrying; this was the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Adam</hi> under the Law.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>You will ſay,</hi> He was holy, and had no ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But conſidering his condition under the Law; That
it was Obedience to God as a Creator, he did work for natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
good; and he wrought by the ſtrength he had received,
and he was in hazard of miſcarrying eternally. Now compare
his condition with the condition of the Saints in the time of
the Goſpel, and you will find the condition of the Saints ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the fruit of the Goſpel, to be in a great deal better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even now; not only ſhall be in Heaven, but are in a better
condition now than <hi>Adam</hi> was in paradiſe.</p>
               <p>1. Adam <hi>he obeyed God, and tendered up his ſervice to God as
a Creator.</hi> But now the people of God under the Goſpel, thoſe
that are brought home to God by the Goſpel, they look upon
God under another relation, not meerly as Creator, but all
their ſervices that they tender up to God, it is as unto the Father
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and their Father in Him; <hi>I go to my
Father, and I go to your Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>John,</hi> 20. 17. It's
true, ſtill we look upon God as the Firſt-being of all things, as
Creator; but we look upon Him in a higher relation than
meerly our Creator, we look upon Him as the Father of Jeſus
Chriſt, and ſo in Jeſus Chriſt as our Father, and ſo we tender
up obedience to Him in that way, and ſurely ſuch obedience
tendered up to God as under ſuch a relation; ſhould be a higher
kind of obedience, a higher kind of holineſs than was in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although it is true, in reſpect of our condition here, we are
not ſo free from corruption as <hi>Adam</hi> was in Innocencie, yet the
obedience that we tender up to God, though it be not ſo free (I
ſay) from mixture, yet it is of a higher nature than <hi>Adams</hi> was,
it is to God as the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>We have better promiſes than ever</hi> Adam <hi>had, we have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Heavenly Glory that he had not:</hi> God doth not ſay, <hi>Do and
live</hi> to us only, live hear in the world in a natural life, and
I will free you from outward troubles, and from the death of
the body: But we know that the Goſpel brings immortallity
and glory to light, it tels us of the glory of Heaven, and of the
Manſions that Jeſus Chriſt is gone before to prepare, of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29998:29"/>
glorious Communion that the Saints ſhall have with God in
the higheſt heavens, which is another manner of motive to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
than ever <hi>Adam</hi> had: And therefore our obedience to
God ſhould be raiſed in a higher way than ever his was.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The ſtrength that we have, it's not put into our own hands to
keep and ſo to improve, and there's all.</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Perſon in Trinity, He is fil'd with all fulneſs that we
might receive grace for grace continually from the fulneſs of
Jeſus Chriſt that hath all the treaſures of wiſdom in Him, In
Him it pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell; now
the Saints by faith have as it were a pipe laid into that Ciſtern
that hath all fulneſs, from whence continually by the work
of Faith they draw ſtrength and nouriſhment, new ſupply
from Him, they have not ſomewhat given to them and ſo are
ſet to trade for themſelves and improve what is given them,
but they ſuck new vertue from Jeſus Chriſt as from a Head.
<hi>Adam</hi> he was the head of the firſt Covenant himſelf, but now
'tis Jeſus Chriſt that is the Head of the Second, and all Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
draw ſpirits from Jeſus Chriſt, and ſtrength from him as
from the Head, they have a Head that <hi>Adam</hi> had not to draw
ſtrength from, and therefore they are to manifeſt the ſtrength
of Jeſus Chriſt in all their waies, that fulneſs that there is in
Jeſus Chriſt they are to make that appear to the world in their
lives and Converſations: And therefore that text <hi>Col. 1 10,
11.</hi> is very remarkable, <hi>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto
all pleaſing, being fruitful in every good work, and increaſing in
the knowledg of God:</hi> mark in the 11. verſe, <hi>ſtrengthened with all
might, according to his glorious power;</hi> This is worthy of the
Lord, becauſe that now we come to receive of his fulneſs, of
the fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and to have a continual ſupply from
him; Though 'tis true, ſo God hath ordered it that ſo long
as we live we ſhall have ſome mixtures of corruption here, but
yet he hath provided a help for us, a fulneſs in his Son, that
from Him we ſhould draw of His fulneſs, and ſo come to be
ſtrengthened with all might.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>We now ſerve the Lord and obey Him in our lives as thoſe that are
delivered from the hazard of eternal miſcarrying. Adam</hi> obeyed,
but yet he might know when he was obeying; I now obey,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29998:30"/>
but I am in danger to miſcarry eternally, every hour to undo
my ſelf and poſterity for ever. But now certainly this very
thought, and the underſtanding of this, it could not ſtand
with that full freedom of ſpirit that the Saints may have now
under the Goſpel, the Saints under the Goſpel come in a way
of obedience to God, and upon this ground they have their feet
(as it were) upon ſure ground: Well, as for my eternal eſtate
the hazard of miſcarrying there, it is over, I bleſſe God that is
over, for that now my obedience it is not that I might work
out, and earn ſalvation; but my obedience to God now is (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſet ſafe upon the ſhore) that I might live to the praiſe of
the grace of God that hath delivered me from al danger of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying,
and hath ſet me with Jeſus Chriſt in heavenly places,
I am now already ſet in heavenly places with Jeſus Chriſt, and
as ſure of Heaven (for ſo a Believer may come to be) as if ſo be
that I were there already, and ſo I am now to begin the life of
Heaven, to be bleſſing and magnifying God, not in word only,
but in my life, therefore am I to hold forth the glory of God in
my life and Converſation, that I might bleſſe and magnifie the
Name of God, that hath delivered me from darkneſs, and hath
tranſlated me into the Kingdom of his dear Son, and upon theſe
terms do I ſerve God now; I do not ſerve God as one that is
in hazard for ever to miſcarry, and out of a baſe and ſlaviſh fear
leſt I ſhould miſcarry, I do endeavor to work out my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but it is as one that is redeemed and delivered from eternal
miſery, yea, I now begin to joyn with the Saints and Angels
that are in Heaven, that are there magnifying God, and ſhal be
to al eternity praiſing of Him for His free grace towards them;
ſurely this Converſation ſhould be in a higher degree of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than the Converſation of <hi>Adam</hi> could be even in Paradiſe:
Yet ſtill remembring this, we cannot in this life attain to ſuch a
Converſation as to be without mixture of evil, but we ſhould be
more ſpiritual and heavenly in our waies, we have more cauſe
to be ſo than <hi>Adam</hi> had in his innocency, and we do not walk
anſwerable to the Goſpel except our hearts do riſe in a more
ſpiritual and heavenly way than his heart could riſe when it
came new out of the hand of his Creator. That's the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the Law as it was a Covenant of life to him and al
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29998:30"/>
man-kind in him. Oh that as we go along we would but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what cauſe we have of humiliation then; Oh how far are
our Converſations ſhort of that that becomes the Goſpel if it
ſhould riſe to ſo high a pitch as this is that hath been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider we the Law as in the adminiſtration of it to</hi>
Moſes, <hi>and ſo to the people of the Jews:</hi> The adminiſtration of the
Law to them it was under another notion, it was to bring
them to Chriſt, and that they might come to ſee their inability
of keeping of that Covenant, and come to underſtand Chriſt
ſo much the more, and to be driven unto Chriſt by having the
Law preſented to them, God did never intend by giving of the
Law to the people of the Jews that it ſhould be a Covenant of
eternal life to them; indeed there was this in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it ſomewhat different from us, ſome ſpecial Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their living in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and about mercies in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Land, beyond that that we have in the Law, as we find
in the new Teſtament, they (I ſay) had this annexed to it.
The Law that was firſt given unto <hi>Adam</hi> and written in his
heart, afterwards even obliterated, then it was tranſcribed by
the ſame hand in tables of ſtone and given unto them chiefly to
ſhew them their miſery, and their need of Chriſt; to be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for Chriſts coming into the world; and with this
one addition beyond what we have in the new Teſtament, that
there was a temporal Covenant annexed unto it, that concern'd
their living proſperouſly in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (&amp; ſo far we are
delivered even from the Law as it was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is,
from the connexion of the Covenant that was added unto the
delivering of the Law) concerning their happy and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> upon the keeping of their
Law; but now (how ever it was) certainly that Converſation
that <hi>becomes the Goſpel</hi> ſhould be beyond what could be even
from godly men in the time of the Law.</p>
               <p>As firſt, <hi>The Law to them it was given under low Promiſes,</hi> their
promiſes were but very low that were under the Law: It's
true, they had ſomewhat of the Goſpel that we have, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
darkly, and very little that they knew of it, but the
chief Miniſtration of God towards them was then in a legal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29998:31"/>
way, and that had but low promiſes, as their living in <hi>Canaan;</hi>
you ſhall find generally al the promiſes that are annexed to the
Law even by <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is but, <hi>that they ſhall prolong their daies in
the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord their God ſhall give them, That they ſhould be bleſt
in their basket and ſtore:</hi> their Promiſes were under Heaven-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
Promiſes of this life only; and therefore it could raiſe
them but to a very low degree of holineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their Ordinances were but poor and mean, and beggerly
in compariſon of our; <hi>for ſo the Goſpel cals them,</hi> Col. 2. They
were but beggerly rudiments, which ſtood only in meats and drinks, and
divers waſhings, and carnal Ordinances impoſed on them untill the
time of reformation. Heb. 9. 10. They had an earthly Tabernacle, a
worldly Sanctuary, Heb. 9. 1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The burden of them under the Law was very great,</hi> they
were under a heavy yoke &amp; burden that did bow them down:
A man that is under a heavy burden it makes him ſtoop &amp; bend
in the back, he cannot ſtand ſo upright nor faſt as others that
have no ſuch weight upon them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The adminiſtration of the Law was with Thunder and
Lightning very terrible,</hi> It made even <hi>Moſes</hi> quake and tremble,
(as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks.)</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Their ſpirits were very ſervile under the Law, they
were ſubject to bondage even all their daies;</hi> God ſo ordered
things as to carry on his people even in a very ſervile way, they
were but mean ſervants then, hewers of wood and drawers of
water.</p>
               <p>But now under the Goſpel, Firſt, our Promiſes are far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and our Covenant better, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. there the Apoſtle
compares their Condition and ours, <hi>Who ſerve</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unto
the example and ſhadow of heavenly things,</hi> There was but <hi>the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of heavenly things;</hi> the Goſpel hath the Heavenly things
themſelves, and they are but the <hi>ſhadow,</hi> for ſo you have it in
<hi>Heb. 10. 1. For the Law having a ſhadow of good things to come,
and not the very image of the things:</hi> They had but a <hi>ſhadow</hi> of
good things to come, and not the very image it ſelf. As
<hi>Moſes</hi> was admoniſh'd of God, when he was about to make
the Tabernacle, <hi>For ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou make all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the pattern ſhewed to thee in the Mount.</hi> And then in <hi>Heb. 8. 6.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29998:31"/>
But now hath he obtained a more excellent Miniſtry, [that's Chriſt]
By how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was
eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes: A better Covenant, and ſtabliſhed
upon better promiſes, or a better Teſtament:</hi> Their promiſes I ſay
were but low and mean; and our promiſes are high and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and we have a better Covenant, a Covenant not of living
in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but of <hi>Heaven,</hi> of which that Canaan
was but a Type, and therefore our Converſations ſhould riſe
higher in holineſs according as our Covenant and Promiſes are
better than theirs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Our Worſhip is more ſpiritual than their worſhip was.</hi>
As that known place in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23. where Chriſt ſaith to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Samaria, You ſerve God in this place: But the time ſhall come
that they ſhall ſerve him every where, for God is a Spirit, and will be
worſhiped in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> There is more ſpiritual worſhip
in the time of the Goſpel than was in the time of the Law: The
Lord carried them on in a carnal and a ſenſitive way: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this hath been a great deſign of Antichriſt to bring men
to a carnal way of worſhip, <hi>To carnal Ordinances,</hi> for ſo they are
called in Scripture, the Commandements of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> are
called carnal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. For their worſhip was in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the worſhip in the Goſpel but carnal; (I ſay) it hath bin
the deſign of Antichriſt to darken the glory of Jeſus Chriſt in
the Goſpel, by bringing the Church to a carnal way of worſhip,
and to take away ſpiritual, and therefore they are altogether
about carnal Inſtitutions, whereas Jeſus Chriſt hath inſtituted
but only two Sacraments, wherein there are outward carnal
things, wherein we worſhip God through the Creature, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
His worſhip is altogether ſpiritual; but now Antichriſt
he would bring in altogether carnal things, he would ad a
hundred inventions of his own, as building ſumptuous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
railing in of the Communion Tables, and then turning
them into Altars; with ſuch kind of apiſh geſtures, fooliſh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Heatheniſh muſick, all which was <hi>carnal worſhip,</hi>
the devices of men to pleaſe children and fools with: excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
much againſt the very life and ſoul of Godlineſs, and the
only rule of worſhip in the Word of God. Beſides this redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and carnal way of worſhip, made the worſhipers twofold
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29998:32"/>
more the children of Satan than they were before. But now
the more ſpiritual any worſhip of God is, the more ſpiritual it
makes the heart, the leſſe we ſtick to the creature while we are
worſhipping of God, the more communion we come to have
with Chriſt, and ſo it doth raiſe holineſſe to a more higher
pitch.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Goſpel our yoke is more eaſie:</hi> You know
what Chriſt ſaith, (in a Scripture that I have opened to you at
large) <hi>Come, take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is eaſie, and my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
is light.</hi> You are delivered from that heavy burden that
they were under, and therefore you ſhould run the waies of
Gods Commandements, and follow after holineſs more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and freely than they could do.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>We have acceſs with boldneſs to the Throne of grace,</hi> (as
the Scripture ſpeaks) God doth not reveal Himſelf in that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
way to his Saints now, as in the time of the Law, but
would have them come with boldneſs, <hi>and have libertie of ſpeech:</hi>
for that's the word, as in the ſecond of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> of the
boldneſs that we have to come into the preſence of God; <hi>Through
him we have acceſs by one ſpirit unto the Father. [Acceſs]</hi> the word
ſignifies a coming with freedom (as it were) being led by the
hand of God. In <hi>Epheſ. 3. 12. In whom we have boldneſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi>
(ſaith the text there) <hi>with confidence by the faith of Him.</hi> Three
words here are together: We have <hi>boldneſs,</hi> and <hi>acceſs,</hi> with <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi>
by the faith of Him. The word that is here tranſlated
<hi>[Boldneſs]</hi> it is, <hi>liberty of ſpeech;</hi> we may come and ſpeak our
minds and unboſome our ſpeech freely to God without any
ſuch terror; and we may come to God without deſiring. <hi>Moſes</hi>
muſt go into Gods preſence for them as he did; Oh they durſt
not go themſelves, but <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt go and ſpeak with God. We
may come into the preſence of God and ſpeak our hearts freely
with a holy boldneſs in the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>We have the ſpirit of adoption more than they. Rom. 8.
We have not received the ſpirit of bondage to fear again, but the ſpirit
of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Father.</hi> There was a ſpirit of
bondage under which, even the people of God were in former
times, and now the ſpirit of adoption is more ſpread abroad
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated in the world to the Churches than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29998:32"/>
and therefore the Lord expects a Converſation ſutable to
the ſpirit of adoption. As now, take one that is a child and
hath a ſervile ſpirit and is afraid to come into the preſence of
his father, it may be he will do ſome works in obedience to his
father, but in a heavy &amp; dull way, but afterwards when his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is fully reconcil'd to him, &amp; comes &amp; ſpeaks kindly to him
&amp; there comes a ſpirit of adoption upon the child, Oh then he
goes lively on in duty to his father, then he rejoyces in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of his father, &amp; to do any thing that may pleaſe his father;
when he is acted by a ſpirit of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, theres more ſervice done
according to the mind &amp; wil of Chriſt than there was before.</p>
               <p>So (my Brethren) we ſhould exceed all under the Law with
a more fillial obedience, than ever there was in that time, or
elſe our Converſation it is not ſuch as becomes the Goſpel:
Therefore when you open the old Teſtament and reade of thoſe
excellent gracious ſpirits that were there, eſpecially in the
<hi>Pſalms,</hi> what holy breathings and pantings after God there
are, and in the Prophets, what exemplary holineſs then liv'd
and ſhined in the world: Be aſhamed of your ſelves if you do
not riſe to as high a degree as they and higher too</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Why you will ſay, But they were eminent men, they
were the Prophets of God and ſo were extraordinary; and can
ordinary Chriſtians riſe as high as they did, and be ſuch bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and ſhining lamps as they were?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I'le give you one Scripture about that, in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 8.
it is a cleer Propheſie of the times of the Goſpel, <hi>In that day
ſhall the Lord defend the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and he that is fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
among them at that day ſhall be as</hi> David; <hi>and the houſe of</hi> David
<hi>ſhall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before them.</hi> Mark, <hi>he that
is feeble among them ſhall be as</hi> David, who was a man according
to Gods own heart. Oh reade <hi>Davids Pſalms,</hi> particularly the
119. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and ſee the holy breathings of <hi>David,</hi> and obſerve
that there is a Propheſie, <hi>that thoſe that are feeble ſhall be as</hi> David,
and thoſe that are as <hi>David,</hi> that is, the eminent Chriſtians,
the Lords Champions, and <hi>the houſe of</hi> David <hi>ſhall be as God, as
the Angels of the Lord.</hi> Chriſtians in the time of the Goſpel that
are eminent ſhould live as Angels, Angelical lives, and the
weakeſt of all ſhould <hi>be</hi> as <hi>David:</hi> Indeed conſidering what we
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29998:33"/>
have revealed in the Goſpel we ſhould be aſhamed that our
hearts and lives ſhould come ſhort in ſpiritualneſs, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of any that lived in the times of the Law: ſee in the 119.
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> how you find <hi>Davids</hi> heart taken and raviſhed with the
Word of God, <hi>Oh how ſweet was the Law of God to him, ſweeter
than the honey and the honey comb.</hi> He doth not mean there the
Law in oppoſition to the Goſpel, but the whol Word of God;
Now you ſhould conſider this, what part of Gods Word had
<hi>David</hi> there, he had not many of the Propheſies, he had but
the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and ſome other Books; the Book of <hi>Job</hi> was
then, and ſome of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> ſome part of the <hi>Kings,</hi> and the
Book of <hi>Judges;</hi> but moſt part of the <hi>Kings</hi> he could not have,
for he was the ſecond King: therefore what little part of the
Word of God was written at that time; and yet how ſweet
was the Word to him, <hi>as ſweet as the honey and the honey comb,</hi> and
how he did delight in it above Gold and Silver. And then for
the Ordinances of God, O how was he taken with them! though
in compariſon of ours they were but carnal: In the 84. <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
he did envy the very birds that were in the Temple of God,
<hi>How aimable are thy Courts O Lord</hi> (ſaith he;) now do but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
thoſe Scriptures he had with theſe that we have, The five
Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> which were
the chief Scriptures then extant, and do but compare them with
the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, in particular the Sermons of Chriſt,
from the fifth Chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> to the eighth; So thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
places from the fourteenth to the eighteenth of <hi>John,</hi>
and ſo on; O what heavenly things are there let down amongſt
us! What <hi>Heavenly truths</hi> we have, ſtudy and reade over <hi>Pauls
Epiſtles</hi> (which are ſeveral holy Letters ſent from Chriſt to His
Saints here on earth,) Oh what ſpiritual tranſcendant truths!
What great myſteries and depths of God are opened and revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
there beyond what there is in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> or <hi>Exodus,</hi> or <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
or <hi>Numbers, &amp;c.</hi> And yet the Word of God was dearer to
him than al the world, and he profeſt he did meditate in it day
and night. Now we have that word in two Teſtaments, that
doth reveal abundance more of God in Chriſt than ever he had,
and therefore our Converſations ſhould riſe higher in holineſs
than the Converſtions of thoſe that were under the Law; we
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29998:33"/>
ſhould endeavor to be more exemplary in holy walking than
they were. And thus much for the ſecond head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now for the third, which is the chief of all,</hi> If you would
have your Converſations to be ſuch as becomes the Goſpel, it muſt
be ſuitable to what the Goſpel holds fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h unto you. <hi>Now this
is a gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t point, and it will ſerve for two ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To hold forth unto you the principal things in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhew you how you ſhould ſute your Converſation to
thoſe things that are in the Goſpel. <hi>And we ſhall abide upon this
head ſomewhat long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt and principal thing in the Goſpel, <hi>It is the holding
forth unto us the infinite love of God to man-kind;</hi> this is the very end
of the Goſpel, that God might declare what an infinite love he
hath unto the children of men, yea unto men rather than unto
Angels; you know that Scripture in <hi>John, 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>6. So God loved the
world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever beleeveth in
him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi> And indeed that
one verſe hath more of God in it than all Creatures in Heaven
Earth; the whol frame of Heaven and Earth hath not ſo
much of God in them as that one verſe hath; <hi>So God loved the
world</hi> that he ſent forth his only begotten Son that whoſoever
beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life: It
is as if God ſhould ſay when he comes to reveal the Goſpel, I
will have a way wherein it ſhall appear to men and Angels for
ever what the greatneſs of my love is unto theſe poor creatures,
unto the children of men: And to that end I ſend my Son the
ſecond Perſon in Trinity to take their natures upon him, to
come to be their Mediator; there will I manifeſt what my love
is; that ſhall be the great fruit of love. It is the ſimilitude of
a learned Divine (ſaith he) the love of God in all other things
in compariſion of the love of God in Chriſt reveal'd in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
it is a little ſpark of fire in compariſon of the heat in a
furnace; when a furnace is heated red hot, it may be a few
ſparks of fire fly out, but what is one of thoſe ſparks of fire that
fly out in compariſon of al the heat that there is in the furnace,
(ſo ſaith he) all the fruits of the love of God to man-kind in all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29998:34"/>
the works that ever God did do, are but as that one ſpark on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
excepting this of Chriſt; and the love of God unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in Chriſt is as it were the heat of the furnace, there's bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
love indeed, <hi>the love of God in Chriſt,</hi> this is the great ſcope
of the Goſpel, the great aim of God, the great deſign that
God had in the Goſpel to make known the infinitneſs of His
love unto the children of men: Now then if ſo be that God in
the Goſpel doth reveal what there was in His heart from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
to man-kind (for ſo it is) that's the ſcope of the Goſpel;
there was in the heart of God infinite love burning toward
man-kind, God from eternity ſaw man-kind before him, and
there was that ſtrong inclination of his heart towards them in
love, as did even burn in his heart: Now in time God reveals
this in the Goſpel, in the Doctrine thereof He doth open His
heart to the children of men: when ever the Goſpel comes to be
preached in any place, God doth look upon that place and
hath theſe kind of workings in Himſelf, <hi>Well,</hi> that love of
Mine that I have had burning in my Boſom from all eternity
towards theſe poor creatures, now it ſhal be opened, now it ſhal
be revealed; juſt as it was with <hi>Joſeph</hi> that had his heart ſo
warm in love unto his Brethren, that though he kept it in a
while he could not keep it in long, but at length it breaks out
as fire, his bowels yerned towards his Brethren, and he weeps
tears of love over their necks: So in the Goſpel of Chriſt, look
upon God towards poor creatures, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> towards his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and God as it were keeping in his heart towards them
for a long time; but now when the Goſpel comes among them
God opens his very heart to them, now therefore there muſt be
a Converſation that <hi>becomes the Goſpel,</hi> as becomes this <hi>great
thing</hi> in the Goſpel, that is the chief thing indeed that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
holds forth in every line of it, and diſcovers his eternal
love towards them in particular, in the Son of his love, Chriſt
Jeſus in whom he is well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay, What is it that becomes this thing in
the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ. Surely love,</hi> anſwerable love, that we ſhould return
love for love, he that dwels in God dwels in love, God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is love; Reade but the firſt Epiſtle of that beloved Diſciple
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29998:34"/>
                  <hi>John,</hi> what abundance of love is there made known of God?
every letter thereof is a character of love; and what commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of love in heavenly expreſſions? But you reade no ſuch
thing in the Scripture before the Goſpel was revealed in that
cleerneſs as it was then; now nothing but Love, love, and how
it called for love: Then there muſt be this converſation, <hi>Love
to God, as God to us.</hi> And that muſt be real as Gods love in Chriſt
was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How did God manifeſt his love?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Converſation becoming the Goſpel, muſt be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of our love in ſome proportionable way: <hi>So God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the world, as He gave His only Son:</hi> that is as if he ſhould have
ſaid thus, God ſo loved the world, <hi>ſo dearly,</hi> as that which was
the deareſt thing unto God he gave for a teſtimonie of his love
to man-kind. The deareſt thing, What's that? His Son. If
God ſhould have ſaid, That I might teſtifie my love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as I have made one world for them, I will make ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
more, yea I will make ſo many worlds as every one of the
children of men ſhall have a world to poſſeſs; you would think
this were very much: Oh this were nothing in compariſon of
that expreſſion, <hi>So God loved the world, as He gave His Son;</hi> the
Son of God is infinitly dearer to God than ten thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
millions of worlds are. Now, a converſation that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the revelatio of ſuch love, muſt needs be this, Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
then is deareſt to our ſouls let that be given up to God. As it
was a teſtimony of the love of <hi>Abraham</hi> to God, <hi>Hereby I know
thou loveſt me.</hi> Why? Becauſe he gave up his <hi>Iſaac</hi> to God, he
would not ſpare his only Son whom he loved: ſo God ſhewed
his love to us: we may ſay, Lord, hereby we know thou loveſt
us, that thou haſt given thine <hi>Iſaac,</hi> thine only Son for us, and
hereby Lord ſhal men and Angels know that we love thee, that
whatſoever is dear to our ſouls thou ſhalt have it, we will offer
it up to thee in way of ſacrifice: this is a converſation that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Goſpel.</hi> So that when God cals for anything, never
think it much, Oh this is hard and coſtly and dear to me, and
how ſhall I part with this? Is this becoming the Goſpel, to
ſtand with God for any thing? for thy love muſt be ſomewhat
ſutable to Gods; His love was ſuch as he gave the deareſt to thee,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29998:35"/>
and thy love therefore (if it runs paralel with his) muſt give
the deareſt to him.</p>
               <p>And then if we be acted by love (for that's the converſation
that becomes the Goſpel to be acted in all that we do with love
to God) to be in a flame of love continually, as the <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
(they ſay) doth alwaies live in the fire; ſo ſhould we do in
the fire of love, not in the fire of contention: But now, Love
hath no need of any argument to do any thing but only this,
this thing will be pleaſing unto him that I do tender it unto,
it will pleaſe my Father; that's argument enough for Love,
that if I do ſuch a thing it will pleaſe my beloved; therefore
never ſtand arguing thus, Such a thing is a duty, but is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity?
<hi>Muſt</hi> I do it? Cannot a man be ſaved unleſs he do it? Be
all damn'd that do not this? Theſe are arguments from baſe
ſordid ſpirits: but here's enough for love, here's a thing would
pleaſe God; if we did thus, we ſhould pleaſe God better than
in not doing it: Therefore that place that you had before, in
the firſt of the <hi>Coloſſians, Walk worthy of the Lord to all pleaſing,</hi> let
the heart preſently ſpring upon this, There's ſuch a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
out of the Word at ſuch a time, and I heard it would
be well pleaſing to God if I did this.</p>
               <p>If we put but this upon you, you that do not ſet up the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God in your families, Do not you think that it would
pleaſe God better to ſet up his Worſhip in your families than
not? Is there no Converſation that your conſciences tell you
would pleaſe God better, than that Converſation which you
live in? Would it not be more pleaſing to God (ask but your
conſcience now?) if your hearts were acted by love you would
preſently fall upon that which your conſciences tel you would
be more pleaſing to God.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>Love:</hi> This is a maxim of Love, Love never knows
when it hath done enough, it knows no ſuch thing as too
much, for men to ſay, What need we be ſo ſtrict as to walk
circumſpectly? what need we do ſo much? why muſt we be ſo
holy? This is a baſe kind of reaſoning; Is this as becomes the
Goſpel? If thou wert acted by Love then thou wouldſt never
think that thou hadſt done enough for God, Oh thou wouldſt
rather think, had I ten thouſand thouſand times more ſtrength
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29998:35"/>
than I have, Lord thou art worthy of it all, what ſoever I have,
whatſoever I am, whatſoever I can do, thou art worthy of it all,
never ſtand arguing thus, what need ſo much; is the thing a
good thing? love never knows any ſuch thing as too much.</p>
               <p>We know love, <hi>It cannot bear with diſhonor done unto thoſe that
we do love,</hi> if any wrong any one that we love, if our hearts be
inflam'd with love we know not how to bear it; ſuch ſtrike us
in the apple of our eye; Oh that's a Converſation that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Goſpel, that when we ſee the Name of God diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored,
our hearts riſe more againſt any thing that is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, than it doth againſt any thing that is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our ſelves, we are inflam'd for God when we ſee any
thing done that is a diſhonour to the Name of God.</p>
               <p>And love we know it will make us mourn and melt for any
offence to thoſe that are beloved of us: So that's a Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that becomes the Goſpel, when we manifeſt melting hearts,
and mourning ſpirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love makes us delight in the preſence of thoſe that we do love;</hi> ſo
that's a Converſation that becomes the Goſpel, when we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
that there is nothing in the world that we delight in more
than to be in the preſence of our Beloved; Oh to be alwaies
with God in the arms of Chriſt, it is our Heaven on Earth.</p>
               <p>And then, a Converſation that becomes this Goſpel, <hi>It is
to be of a loving diſpoſition towards thoſe that have any reference unto
God.</hi> Reade over the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> where ſo much of the Goſpel is
revealed, for indeed there's the chief of the Goſpel, though
we call thoſe four Evangeliſts the Goſpel, becauſe they are the
ſtory of Chriſts coming into the world, and his Actions; yet
there is more of the Doctrine of the Goſpel in the Epiſtles; for
the time of the law was not fully expired till the deſtruction
of the Temple; which was after Chriſts death, and therefore
though the Goſpel began to ſhine forth, yet till after the time
of the deſtruction of the Temple there was not ſo much of the
Goſpel; and therefore reade (I ſay) the Epiſtle;, and you ſhall
find there is no one particular duty that the Goſpel ſo calls for
from men (beſides faith in Jeſus Chriſt) as it doth love in
Chriſtians one towards another, yea love to all: if you reade
the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> divers places in the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:29998:36"/>
and <hi>Philippians,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> continually ſtill they
are beating upon love; and eſpecially in the Epiſtles of <hi>John</hi>
(that was the beloved Diſciple and lay in the boſom of Chriſt)
nothing ſo much as love, becauſe this indeed is the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that <hi>becomes the Goſpel,</hi> for the main thing in the Goſpel,
it is the declaring of the love of God; and therefore Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that would live as becomes the Goſpel, they muſt live ſo as
acted by love: And ſo in the ſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> preſently as ſoon
as you reade of any that the Goſpel did prevail withal, they
had one heart and one mind, Oh how did they cleave one to
another! their hearts were one. And ſo we find in the ſtories
of the Primitive times, I remember <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, that that
was the way that the Heathens and perſecutors did uſe to find
out who were Chriſtians, for the Chriſtians did meet at nights
for fear of danger, &amp; did as wiſely as they could to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from their perſecutors, but they found this by experience
that when they were converted to Chriſtian Religion, then
there was another kind of ſpirit in them that did act them,
and eſpecially a ſpirit of love one to another, there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of love of Chriſtians one towards another then, than
of any other ſociety of man kind; the Heathens ſaw this, and
wondred at it, and it was by this that they found out who were
Chriſtians, if they ſaw any people beginning to have a ſpirit
of love more than before, they would think ſurely theſe have
heard of this Chriſtian Religion, and they begin to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
this was the glory of Chriſtian Religion in thoſe times,
that there was ſuch intire love and union of hearts amongſt
them. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> would have ſuch love as that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſhould be willing to die one for another, and they did ſo in
the primitive times, Oh this were becoming the Goſpel indeed:
But Oh how far, how far are we from ſuch a Converſation in
ſuch times as we live in now! as if ſo be that the Goſpel were
gone from us, we ſpeak of the Goſpel as if it were reveal'd more
now than ever, and much concerning free grace in the Goſpel,
but look upon the Converſations of men, they were never
more unſutable to the Goſpel, and in this particular, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the ſincere love in the hearts of Chriſtians: My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
malitious diſpoſitions are extreamly unbecoming the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29998:36"/>
Goſpel, hateful and malitious diſpoſitions, What doth a
beaſtly, brutiſh, ſavigeneſs do, the fierceneſs of beaſts do in the
breaſt of a Chriſtian? Oh it is infinitely unbeſeeming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
to have an unloving diſpoſition, a hateful diſpoſition, to
be hating one another, and to have a ſpirit of oppoſition and
contradiction, and frowardneſs one againſt another, there is
nothing more unbeſeeming the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt than this.
I remember I have read even of one of the Heathen Emperors,
that being convinced ſomewhat about Chriſt, and hearing
much of him, ſaw two that profeſſed the name of Chriſtians to
fall out bitterly one with another, which as ſoon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
he cals them to him, and gives a ſtraight command that
they ſhould never afterward, preſume to call themſelves by the
name of Chriſtians; No (ſaith he) you do not do according
to your Maſter that you profeſs, your life is unſutable to your
Maſter, even one that was but a Heathen himſelf ſpeak this.
Oh if we profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians let our Converſations be
as becomes the Goſpel in point of love, and make that to be
the argument of love, the love of God revealed in the Goſpel;
there are a great many arguments of love from humane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
from reaſon, that men that live together they ſhould love
one another as men, and that there comes a great deal of hurt
from frowardneſs and bitterneſs, and that it is againſt the
rules of ſociety, and that men cannot live quietly except there
be ſome way of ſodering by love; theſe arguments are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
and yet theſe would be among Heathens: Oh but now,
thoſe that profeſs the Goſpel of Chriſt, have one argument that
is infinitely beyond all arguments that can be imagined, and
that is in <hi>John,</hi> 3. 16. (before named) <hi>So God loved the world,</hi>
loved the world, that he gave his <hi>only begotten.</hi> We hear how
the love of God that was in the heart of God from all eternity
is brought forth and revealed in the Goſpel, Oh let this inflame
our hearts with love, Oh that there might be never a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
that profeſſes the Name of Chriſt, but that it might appear
in him that his heart is ſweetened with love, and that he doth
live (as it were) in the very element of love, and acted by love in
all that he doth, O this would beautifie your Chriſtian profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
more than all your talking of this and the other things:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29998:37"/>
Oh that it were come again, that this becoming Converſation
of Chriſtians were come again into the world. I remember I
have heard a ſpeech of Dr. <hi>Whittacre</hi> rebuking the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Scholers in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> he had this speech, Surely
(ſaith he) this that we preach is not the Goſpel, or otherwiſe
we are no Goſpelers, becauſe our Converſation is ſo different
from the Goſpel; and ſo we may ſay of this one particular in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of love, either it is but a fanſie that we hear ſo much of the
love of God in Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, or otherwiſe we are
no Goſpelers, we are no true Profeſſors of the Goſpel: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
profeſſion we make of the Goſpel, yet except there doth
appear divine love to act us in all that we do God will not own
us for Goſpelers; for certainly it is a main ſcope that God
hath in the revealing the Goſpel to ſweeten the hearts of men
with love, either deny the profeſſion, or walk more lovingly
than thou haſt done towards thoſe that make the ſame profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
yea thou ſhouldeſt walk lovingly towards thy enemies,
for the Goſpel reveals much of Gods goodneſs even towards
the whol world in general, ſo that there ſhould be love even
towards all from the knowledge of the Goſpel; Oh that it
might be ſaid of men and women, that were of rugged, harſh,
and malitious diſpoſitions before, yet ſince it pleaſed God
that they came to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and heard the
Truths of the Goſpel opened to them, Oh ſince that time their
hearts have been altered and changed, Oh of what ſweet diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
they are of now, the husband towards the wife, and
the wife towards the husband, in a family there was nothing
but harſhneſs and brawling, but now nothing but ſweetneſs
and love and this from the knowledg of the love of God in
Jeſus Chriſt: that love will be a Divine grace indeed that's rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the hearts of men, and acted from this principle of the
knowledg of the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt. This is the firſt
thing, and the great thing that is held forth in the Goſpel,
namely the love of God to man-kind.</p>
               <p>I'le but name one or two things more now, and the next is
this.</p>
               <p>The infinite willingneſs of God to be at peace and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
unto thoſe who have offended him, yea to his enemies,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29998:37"/>
what is the ſcope of the Goſpel? the eternal love of God to
man-kind in Chriſt: That's the firſt thing. Then the ſecond
thing is the infinite willingneſs that there is in God to be at
peace to be reconciled to ſuch as have offended him; this is
held forth in the Goſpel, the Goſpel is the Miniſtry of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
now what Converſation ſhould be in us becoming this
in the Goſpel that is held forth?</p>
               <p>And then the infinite mercy of God in the Goſpel in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
poor creatures out of a depth of miſery, that's a main
thing in the Goſpel, and many other particulars as the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
hatred that God hath againſt ſin, and the great price paid
for ſouls that's held forth in the Goſpel too, with divers other
things that might be ſpoken of. But I beſeech you conſider of
the point that we are about, namely to ſhew you what the
Goſpel holds forth to us; and then what Converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
all theſe things, and is ſutable to them. If God would
but be pleaſed to go along even with this one point that we are
now upon, we hope it may lighten the Converſation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and withal may commend this word of grace to thoſe
that ſit in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death; and may (if
God will ſay Amen unto it) in ſome meaſure recover the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
that hath been caſt upon the Goſpel of Chriſt in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times, by that looſe and uneven walking amongſt profeſſors
themſelves; which hath very much darkned the glory of this
marvellous great light, <hi>Which ſhould be a lamp unto their feet, and
a light unto their paths.</hi> Oh that Jeſus Chriſt from whoſe hand
and heart this Goſpel came would now preach it home to every
heart of us, that the truths thereof, may be turned into grace,
ſpirit and life in the midſt of us, ſo that our lives and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be a daily practical ſermon of holineſs, in particular,
<hi>That we love one another as becomes the Goſpels</hi>

<hi>I therefore</hi> (here's an inference with the uſe of it) <hi>the priſoner of the

have the love of Chriſt made known. How ſhal they walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of this vocation; <hi>with all lowlineſs, and meekneſs, with long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,
forbearing one another in love. Endeavouring to keep the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> He prayed before, that they
might know the love of Chriſt: therefore upon that he doth
exhort them, and builds his exhortation, or rather his beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29998:38"/>
that they would with all lowlineſs, meekneſs, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,
forbear one another in love; for you are called to the
profeſſion of the Goſpel, and there you have the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and of Chriſt ſet forth unto you: now would you walk
worthy of this calling? then let there be much meekneſs, and
forbearing one another in love; In <hi>Epheſ. 5. 2. And walk in love,
as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour:</hi> Walk in love
as Chriſt hath loved us, that is, ſutable; as if the Apoſtle ſhould
ſay, would you walk ſutable to the Goſpel of Chriſt that you
profeſs? <hi>Walk in love then as Chriſt hath loved us,</hi> this is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
thing. In the Goſpel you come to know the love of Chriſt
otherwiſe than other men do know it, therefore walk in love,
<hi>Walk in love as Chriſt hath loved us,</hi> make the love of Chriſt to be a
pattern for your love; there is nothing (as I told you) that
is more unbeſeeming the Goſpel of Chriſt, than a hateful, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
rugged, dog ſtar diſpoſition, than for Chriſtians to be tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
one another, &amp; falling out one with another, as thoſe beaſts
at <hi>Epheſus</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> complains of; Oh this is infinitely unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming
the Goſpel of Chriſt: Do you know what the love of
God means in Jeſus Chriſt? are you ſenſible of the love of Chriſt?
Oh this love ſhould ſweeten your hearts that there ſhould be
no more bitterneſs in you, but you ſhould live in this Element
of love. Saith an Ancient, what doth beaſtly fierceneſs and
cruelty, and ſavigeneſs do in the breaſt of a Chriſtian? it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming
the name of a Chriſtian, Therefore let your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, that holds forth
love; Oh let there be much love in you, be you acted by love
in all your waies, ſo that they that run may reade this new
Commandment which Chriſt left unto his followers, <hi>That they
love one another in deed and in truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Goſpel of Chriſt it holds forth this, <hi>The infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
willingneſs of God to be at peace with man-kind, to be reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
man, unto thoſe who have offended him, yea to thoſe who are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
unto him:</hi> This is the ſcope of the Goſpel, (a principal
ſcope) I ſay God would in the Goſpel make known to all the
world his infinite willingneſs to be reconcil'd to ſuch as have
offended him: Indeed without the Goſpel we might apprehend
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29998:39"/>
this, that the Lord is a God that is full of goodneſs, that He is
good and doth good, that all good is in him; but to apprehend
God to be ſuch a God of peace, ſo infinitely ſet upon it, (as I
may ſo ſay) to be reconciled to ſuch as are enemies, could never
have been known but by this Goſpel of Chriſt; herein we find
that though there was an infinite difference between God and
man, between Heaven and Earth through our ſinning ſin, yet
the Lord was willing to be reconciled, yea though the offence
of man was exceeding great ſo that it cried for vengance, yet
he was pleaſed wonderfully to condeſcend to make a peace with
him: Yea though the Lord had man under his power and
could do what He pleaſed with him, He had His enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
His feet, and might have broken him all to pieces with
His iron-rod as a Potters veſſel (which when it is broken can
never be made whol again) yet He was willing to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Though God had no need at all of us, He was infinitly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in himſelf, who is perfection and bleſſedneſs it ſelf.</hi> Sometimes
we are willing to be reconcil'd to our enemies, either becauſe we
have them not under our power, or becauſe we have ſome need
of them; but God that had us under his hand, and might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have deſtroyed us, and had no need at all of us, yet was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to ſpare us, as a father ſpareth his only ſon whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Goſpel holds this out to us, <hi>That the Lord He
begins the work of reconciliation, He firſt loving us,</hi> the infinit God
ſeeketh to us his creatures to come in to be reconciled, therefore
he ſends his Ambaſſadors of peace to beſeech us in Chriſts ſtead
to come in to be reconciled to him, to accept of His Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Peace which make ſo much for our everlaſting ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Though reconciliation muſt coſt God very dear;</hi> that God
muſt be at a great deal of coſts and charges to reconcile His
creatures to himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it coſt no leſs than the blood of his only
begotten Son, and yet he is willing to be reconcil'd: ſaith God,
my heart is ſet upon this work, and let it coſt what it will, if it
were ten thouſand worlds yet my heart i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo upon it, that I
will bring them in that they may be reconciled to me, and
made one with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:29998:39"/>
Sixthly and laſtly, The Goſpel reveals this, <hi>That God is ſo
ſet upon reconciliation, and is ſo reconcil'd to ſuch as do imbrace the
Goſpel as he will never be at enmity with them again.</hi> Being once
reconcil'd, he wil never ſuffer ſuch a breach to be made between
Man-kind and Himſelf any more. <hi>He wil be their Father in Chriſt,
and ye ſhall be his Sons and Daughters through Him to all eternity in
Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God?</hi>
Thus the Goſpel holds forth, not only reconciliation, but ſuch
reconciliation as this is, which men and Angels can never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
admire and bleſs God for. This is a Second beam (as I
may ſo ſay) of the Goſpel. Then what manner of perſons ought
we to be? our converſations muſt be as becomes this Goſpel of
Chriſt in this great thing that the Goſpel holds forth unto us.
Surely then, this cals to us al aloud to love peace, O love peace,
Is God ſo ſet upon peace as he is? and is he willing to be at ſo
great coſt for peace? Oh let us love peace, let us follow peace,
lets purſue peace, let's ſeek peace, let us do what we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
for peace, <hi>If it be poſſible as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
with all men:</hi> Let us account peace never bought too dear with
any thing <hi>but ſin:</hi> The Lord Chriſt would not ſin to purchaſe
peace, if it could poſſibly have been conceived that any ſin
ſhould have bin committed Chriſt would never have purchaſed
peace that way; but if it be by any way of ſuffering, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing to leave the Heavens for a while to take upon him
the form of a ſervant, yea to have the ſence of the influences of
the love of his Father ecclipſed for a time, he was willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
yea to be made a curſe, whatſoever he ſuffered in his Name,
he was willing to endure any thing to make peace between God
and man, to reconcile the World to Heaven: Oh! let us love
peace, that's <hi>becoming the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> for our hearts to be
ſet upon peace. And the exhortation that you have in the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
(before mentioned;) it is likewiſe built upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Chriſts working ſo for our peace, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 14. For
He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the
middle wall of partition between us, having aboliſhed in Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fleſh the
enmity.</hi> And then in the 16. verſe, <hi>That He might reconcile both
unto God in one body by the Croſs, having ſlain the enmity thereby.</hi> So
that this Scripture holds forth, not only that Chriſt is our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29998:40"/>
peace in reſpect of God, and he died for that end to make peace
between God and us, but likewiſe that Jeſus Chriſt did die to
make peace between man and man; it was one fruit of His
death to break down the middle wall of partition between us,
and to ſlay the enmity; he doth not ſay, to <hi>kill our enemies,</hi> but
to <hi>kill the enmity it's ſelf;</hi> the meaning is this, that Chriſt died
to take down the partition wall between <hi>Jew,</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> there
was an enmity between the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> that they might not
one converſe with the other; now it was a fruit of the death of
Chriſt to take down the partition wall and to ſlay the enmity
between them, that ſo there might be but one ſheep fold, that
He might reconcile both unto God in one body. Now, was
this the end of the death of Chriſt, not only to reconcile us to
God, but one unto another in one body, Jew and Gentile? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there cannot be ſuch a diſtance between one Chriſtian
and another as there was between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile:</hi> and Chriſt
did ſo love unity and peace in the world, eſpecially among
thoſe that made any profeſſion of his Name, that he would die
to that end, He would loſe His life that He might procure peace
between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and bring them into one body:
And truly ſo it ſhould be with us, we ſhould be willing, and
thoſe whoſe hearts are right (I ſay) cannot but be ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the breaches that are among us, and the unpeaceableneſs
of mens ſpirits, as if they could by the laying down of their
lives procure peace, they ſhould be willing to do it, every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſhould make it appear, that he is ſo ſet upon peace that if
the laying down of his life could procure peace he ſhould be
willing to do it, that if we may make up breaches by ſtanding
in the gap, and offering up our ſelves a ſacrifice of atonement
and pacification, let us thus prove our ſelves to be the true fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Chriſt our Lord and Maſter who hath left us his own
example herein for our imitation: this were an excellent thing
beſeeming the Goſpel of Chriſt that we do profeſs, yea, we
ſhould not only be willing to admit of peace, but ſeek for it,
ſeek for it to our inferiours, do not ſay that ſuch a man hath
wronged me, and therefore let him ſeek to me, Oh no, it doth
become you that make profeſſion of the Goſpel of Chriſt, not
to ſtay till he come to you that hath wronged you, but for you
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29998:40"/>
that are wronged by another, even to ſeek to thoſe that have
wronged you, that they would be at peace with you; you might
perhaps (conſulting with fleſh and blood) think it unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that you that are wronged ſhould ſeek peace; I but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Goſpel of Chriſt that you ſhould do ſo; God ſought
to you, you never ſought to him: If God had not begun the
work of peace with you, God and your ſouls would have been
eternally enemies, and therefore remember that you are not to
live according to reaſon, you think there's all the reaſon in the
world that thoſe that have wronged you ſhould crouch to your
feet rather than you ſeek to them, well grant it, that there is
all the reaſon in the world for it, I but what is there in the
Goſpel to the contrary? and you are not to live only in <hi>your
Converſations as beſeems reaſon, but you are to have your Converſations
as beſeems the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> If you ſtand upon theſe tearms, let
him come to me rather than I will go to him, <hi>Is this as becomes
the Goſpel?</hi> What do you hold forth of the great Work of the
Goſpel, if you do not hold forth this? Your willingneſs to
be at peace, and to ſeek for peace even from your inferiors? and
do not you ſay that the offence is great, Oh! 'tis a great offence
that ſuch a one hath committed, he hath dealt very proudly
with me, and ſhall I ſeek to him; his offence to you is not ſo
great as your offence was to God, and yet God ſeeks to be at
peace with you through Chriſt: But he is my inferior, it may
be he is a poor mean fellow that hath ſo wronged me: Do not
you think there is ſuch a diſtance between you and other men,
it may be thou haſt a little power in thy hand, and a few pence
in thy purſe more than thy neighbor hath; but what infinite
diſtance was there between God and you then? Oh remember
your Converſation muſt be as beſeems the Goſpel of Chriſt: I
but it will put me to a great deal of trouble, I can with more
eaſe have him puniſhed than I can bring things to make peace
between us. With more eaſe? Could not God with more eaſe
have ſent thee down to the nethermoſt Hell, how quickly could
God have brought thee down and undone thee for ever: but
God was content to be at peace upon hard tearms (as I may ſo
ſpeak) indeed they were hard tearms by which God came to
reconcile the world unto himſelf, the hardeſt tearms that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29998:41"/>
could be conceived, for Jeſus Chriſt, his eternal Son, did
take upon Him our Nature, and was made a curſe for us, that
knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſnes of God in
Him; and therefore ſtand not upon any hard tearms, if peace
may be purchaſed any way but by ſin, ſtand not upon it, for
this is as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>And when you are reconciled to your brother, be ſo reconcil'd,
as to be firm in your reconciliation:</hi> Not as ſome, there is peace
made between them, but how? ſo as they are ready to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
againſt one another upon any miſcarriage afterwards:
God doth not do ſo with you, the Goſpel holds not forth ſuch
a peace as this is, that God ſhall be at peace with you for the
preſent, but look to your ſelves afterwards, God will take all
advantages againſt you that he can; if there had been ſuch a
peace made between God and you, you had been in Hell long
before this time, and therefore let your peace be a firm, a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and a conſtant peace; Oh! that this were but thought
on in theſe contentions daies, wherein there is ſuch breaches
between Brother and Brother, in every town, in every family,
and none almoſt but are broken off one from another with an
irreconcilable ſpirit; Oh! how unbeſeeming the Goſpel of
Jeſus Chriſt is an irreconciliable ſpirit? Certainly God hath
not made thee to know what the myſterie of the Goſpel of peace
is, who haſt war in thy heart and tongue againſt thy brother.
And that's the ſecond thing that the Goſpel holds forth unto
us.</p>
               <p>Only take this one note in this ſecond thing, That whereas
there are many arguments to move us to ſuch a converſation
as now I am urging upon you, yet let Chriſtians above all
arguments, make the Goſpel to be the argument of arguments
to move them to it: As now, for the matter of peace, there are
many arguments to move us to be at peace with our brother,
from the inconveniences that will follow upon our breaches &amp;
the like, now ſhew your ſelves Chriſtians in this, Above all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
make the conſideration of what you underſtand in the
Goſpel to be the great motive of motive to prevail with you for
peace, and this argument will do it when nothing elſe will do
it. It may be a friend comes and perſwades you to be at peace,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29998:41"/>
you will find a great deal of trouble in Lawing and ſuing, and
enmity one againſt another, there will come a great deal of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety,
and therefore be reconcil'd and live like neighbors one
with another: well, but when you find that your hearts do not
ſtoop to any other argument, then get alone into your cloſets,
ſearch the Scriptures, and there lay to your hearts all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that you can from the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, there ſee
how God reconcil'd the world to Himſelf, and how God was
ſet upon the work of peace: lay them to your hearts, and when
no other arguments wil move, the conſideration of that through
the bleſſing of God will do it. And that's for the ſecond Point.</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>The Goſpel holds forth the infinit mercy of God
to miſerable creatures.</hi> When man was plunged into ſuch a depth
of miſery, nothing but bowels of mercy did move God to help
men out of that depth of miſery that they were plunged into;
and though man was unworthy of mercy, Gods mercy was
free, yea and it was a tranſcendent mercy of God, <hi>The mercy of
God is over all his works.</hi> The Heathens could underſtand that
God was a merciful God, the light of Nature will tel us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the mercy of God; but there's nothing that ſets out
the bowels of Gods mercy ſo as the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt doth,
there you have the very bowels of Gods mercy (indeed) made
legible to all the world, in <hi>Luke, 1. 78. Through the tender mercy
of our God, whereby the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us:</hi>
The tender mercies of our God, the <hi>bowels</hi> of mercy, ſo the
words are: here's the depth of the bowels of mercy held forth
in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; it's impoſible that we could have
underſtood the depth of thoſe bowels of mercy but by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:
<hi>Adam</hi> in innocency knew little of the mercy of God, for
he not being in miſery, had no need of that mercy to help out of
miſery, but though he by his underſtanding muſt needs know
that mercy was a good thing, and therefore in God the Firſt.
being of all, but yet he did not underſtand that mercy that
the Goſpel holds forth, yea the Angels in Heaven know it not
but by the Goſpel, and ſo they deſire to pry into thoſe deep
mercies of God unto man kind; Oh here are the mercies of
God that ſhall be the ſubject of the praiſes of Angels and of the
Saints to all eternity, held forth in the Goſpel: You think 'tis
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29998:42"/>
a great mercy when a child is ſick, that God recovers it; you
think it is a great mercy when you are at Sea that God turns the
wind, when if it had ſtood but one half hour more that way it
did, you had loſt Veſſel, lives and all; when you have been in
any danger abroad in forraign parts, that the Lord was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
help in time of trouble, when there hath been any affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon your family, that God hath ſent deliverance to you,
theſe are mercies that God is to be praiſed for; Oh! but what
are all theſe to the mercies of God in Jeſus Chriſt, His right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
mercies; and indeed this would be a good argument of
a gracious heart, when any particular mercie is granted unto
them, either family mercies, or perſonal mercies. Thus to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate,
Lord I am leſs, I am leſs than the leaſt of all thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
yet here is ſeaſonable comfortable mercies to me and mine
&amp;c. but O Lord what is all this to that infinite fountain of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in Chriſt, thy mercies in the Goſpel, thy mercies in thy
Son, there's depths, infinite depths of mercy indeed, this is
but a drop, and indeed that's ſweet, but the infinite Ocean of
mercy it is in Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt is the mercy of God to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
in the bowels of which all other mercies are conceived
and brought forth in the world: All my freſh ſprings both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and neather ſprings are in him, who is All in All. Oh it
were a good argument that the Goſpel is revealed to you, if
you admire at Jeſus Chriſt as the great mercy of all mercies,
though thankful for every mercy, yet when you come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of the mercy of Chriſt, look upon that as mercy of wonder,
ſtand amazed at the thought of that mercy; well it's the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
that holds forth the glory of the riches of the mercy of God,
God is ſaid in the word to be rich in mercy, He is not ſaid ſo
much to be rich in power as rich in mercy. Now what Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
is ſutable to this?</p>
               <p>What's that but as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>Be ye merciful as
your heavenly father is merciful,</hi> Oh have you a merciful heart
one towards another? look with a merciful eye upon thoſe who
are in great miſery; this is it that becomes the Goſpel of Jeſus
Chriſt; Oh a harſh, rugged, and cruel diſpoſition it is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unbeſeeming the Goſpel of Chriſt: To ſee a Chriſtian, one
that profeſſes the Goſpel, that makes more profeſſion of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29998:42"/>
knowledge of God and of the free grace of God in Chriſt than
others, and yet when it comes to it, that he hath to deal
with ſuch as are in miſery, to have a hard heart, Oh a hard
hearted Chriſtian is a monſter, I ſay a hard hearted Chriſtian is
a monſter in the world, not to be ready to forgive others, and to
do any thing for others that are in miſery is deviliſh; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
that they may have any object to ſhew pity and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto, Oh this is that which becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt;
though they be ſtrangers to you that are in miſery, yet be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to them; for you were ſtrangers to God.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>Be merciful to your enemies, not only be willing to be at peace,
but be merciful:</hi> Do you ſee any that have wronged you to be in
miſery, do not let them periſh but let bowels of compaſſion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
work towards them; Oh that our hearts did yern towards
all: Chriſt when He came neer unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> He wept over
it: Oh that the like ſpirit were in us as was in Jeſus Chriſt:
There's no ſuch argument for mercy to others, as the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the mercies of God in Jeſus Chriſt: Oh bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
beſeems the Goſpel of Chriſt; and it ſhould be manifeſted
really: Let not people that are in miſery have verbal mercies
from you, that is, you ſeem to pity them in words, Oh but
let there be real mercies to them, open your hearts and let ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
drop from you for releef of them that are in miſery: it is
a notable Scripture in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 31, 32. and ſutable to that in
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 13. in the 4. of the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> there the Apoſtle (ſpeaking of
the mercies of Chriſt) ſaith he, <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and
anger, and clamor, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you, with all
malice; and be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one
another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you. Be tender
hearted:</hi> Oh God manifeſts the tenderneſs of His heart in the
Goſpel; and this is <hi>beſeeming the Goſpel,</hi> to ſet forth this as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
the tenderneſs of Gods heart to poor ſinners in the depth
of miſery; do you ſee any to be in miſery, and do not you find
your heart begin to break towards them? if you do not find
your heart breaking, Oh ſet before you the infinite tenderneſs
of Gods mercies in Jeſus Chriſt, and 'tis that will break your
hearts if any thing in the world will: And ſo in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 13. a
place ſomewhat paralel to this, <hi>Forbearing one another, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29998:43"/>
one another; if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as
Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye: and above all theſe things, put on cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
You ſee the Apoſtle accounts this the great argument of
all, and therefore know that the Lord takes it very much to
heart when the bowels of Profeſſors are turned into gravel.
Search into that remarkable Parable, <hi>Matthew,</hi> 18 from verſ.
28. to verſ. 35. where Jeſus Chriſt Preacheth down all cruel
and unchriſtian like diſpoſitions in thoſe that are fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
belonging to one and the ſame Maſter, and living under
one roof; yea, the Zeal of Chriſt did break forth like thunder
and lightning againſt ſuch a ſervant as takes his fellow by the
throat, therefore (ſaith the text) ver. 31. <hi>His Lord was wrath, and
delivered him to the tormentors til he ſhould pay al that was due to him.</hi>
The Lord Chriſt delivered that cruel ſervant, that hard hearted
wretch to the tormentors that did a thing ſo unbeſeeming the
mercy he himſelf had received from Chriſt, Oh ſaith Chriſt art
thou cruel and unmerciful when thou haſt received ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from me, as a full diſcharge of thy many great debts? get
thee to the tormentors, let the moſt cruel executioners of my
ſierce wrath torment thee without any mercy and compaſſion.
Oh thoſe that have hard hearts walk unſutable to the Goſpel
of Jeſus Chriſt which is full of the riches of Gods grace to all.
Oh you that have received any pardoning mercies from Jeſus
Chriſt, take heed of cruelty to your ſervants, to your children;
It's very ſad to ſee how ſome Profeſſors caſt the Goſpel of Chriſt
behind their backs, if their paſſions are but moved; what will
ye bite and devour one another when ye receive the leaſt offront
either by tongue or hand? Oh where is you bearing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
with one another? for ſhame do not fly in the faces of
any (as a Bear bereaved of her whelps) when ye are buffetted
by men, Oh remember Jeſus Chriſt, Oh remember you that
ſtand in ſo much need of mercy every day from God, for you
to be cruel towards other, Oh here's a Converſation infinitly
unbeſeeming the Goſpel of Chriſt, and it is unbeſeeming the
grace that is offered, to have a ſullen, a deſpairing, and an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
diſpoſition, when as we ſee thoſe that are Diſciples, and
yet every little thing cauſeth them to deſpair, and to be ſullen,
and their hearts to ſnk within them, Oh friends is this an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29998:43"/>
frame of ſpirit! let me ſpeak plainly to you, when
you come to hear the glorious, riches of the grace of the Goſpel
ſet before you in the Word, ye ſeem to be ſomewhat taken
with it, but when you go home to your family, are ye not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
under the leaſt croſs then to bury a thouſand mercies? Oh
what a diſhonor is this to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
ſo much mercy of God in it, that it doth call for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that do profeſs it, to go through troubles, and through
diſcouragements with cheerful hearts? and although there be
many things that might daunt the ſpirits of others that do not
underſtand what the mercies of God in Chriſt are, yet thoſe
that profeſs the Goſpel ſhould ſhew undaunted ſpirits, for why?
It is infinite, free, rich, glorious grace that is made known to
them by the word of Chriſts lips.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>I, if I knew that this mercy were mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I but doſt thou hear in the Goſpel that it is free, and
there is no ſoul hath any right to this mercy, but by caſting its
ſelf upon this mercy, and therefore it is as free for thee to caſt
thy ſelf upon it as another; indeed the mercy that is revealed
by the light of Nature, Is ſuch mercy of God that is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,
that is, if I do ſuch and ſuch things then God will
be merciful unto me, the light of Nature goes no further than
this; if I obey and leave my ſin then I may hope that God will
be merciful to me: It's true, the Scripture tells us, if I do not
leave my ſin, God will not have mercy; I but the Goſpel holds
forth mercy thus, There is mercy in God, firſt to pardon thy
ſin, and then to take away thy ſin; now the Goſpel reveals
Gods mercy in juſtifying the ungodly; though I am poor and
blind, and miſerable, and naked, and have not power to leave
my ſin, yet I have free leave to caſt my ſoul upon Gods mercy,
both for pardon and for power together againſt my ſin, for ſo
it muſt be, indeed I have no power, I may not ſtay till I have
power againſt my ſin, and then I will venture all that I have
upon Jeſus Chriſt, this is the mercy of the Goſpel; I ſpeak of
this deſpairing and ſullenneſs of heart, as it's manifeſted in the
Converſations of men and women, by which they do diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
the Goſpel of Chriſt, when they live in their families and
their hearts ſink in ſuch a ſullen way as if there were nothing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29998:44"/>
in the Goſpel of Chriſt for encouraging of poor troubled ſouls,
no more than men might underſtand by the light of Nature;
Indeed if I did live better, and honor God, I might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
that God would ſhew me mercy; but the mercy
of the Goſpel it is ſuch, that there is mercy to pardon and to
heal my ſoul too, and therefore though I be ſinful, I muſt not
ſtay from believing in Gods mercy till I be heal'd, but I muſt
believe in Gods mercy that I may be heal'd. That's the third
particular that the Goſpel holds forth unto us.</p>
               <p>Now the Fourth thing that the Goſpel reveals, is this, <hi>That
though God be infinitly merciful, yet He is merciful in ſuch a way that
juſtice ſhall not be wronged:</hi> and this is proper to the Goſpel too.
It's impoſſible for Men or Angels to come to underſtand this
Myſtery but by this Goſpel-light, how God ſhould be infinitly
merciful, and yet that He ſhould be infinitly juſt too; this is
held forth in <hi>Rom. 3. 25, 26. Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs, for the
remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God: To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs: that he might be juſt, and
the juſtifier of him which beleeveth in Jeſus.</hi> Now this is a great
myſtery of the Goſpel; a Scripture that <hi>Luther</hi> faſted and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed
that he might underſtand, and he was a great while before
he could know the mind of God therein. Now the Goſpel ſaith
this, I will manifeſt infinit riches of my mercy, but yet ſo as
my infinite juſtice ſhall be no loſer, and therefore though I le
ſave Man-kind, yet I'le ſave them by ſuch a way, as I'le have as
much glory of my juſtice as if all the men in the world had bin
damned to all eternity: this is the myſterie of the Goſpel, and
'tis cleer, that though God manifeſt infinit mercy, yet God hath
a way for the manifeſtation of his mercy in the Goſpel, by
which the juſtice of God is as much honored and ſatisfied as
if all the men in the world had been caſt into everlaſting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
that is, through his Sons dying for mans ſin, being made
a curſe for us; this is the great point of the Goſpel, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we underſtand, we know nothing of Chriſt and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
as we ought to know it. Moſt men and women in the world
they ſeek to God for mercy, Lord be merciful to me, a ſinner,
but they think not of a way of Gods ſhewing mercy, ſo as yet
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29998:44"/>
he may have the glory of infinite juſtice, God ſeals the forgivenes
of ſin in the Court of Juſtice as well as in the Court of Mercy;
few think of this, and that's the reaſon why people are ready
many times to deſpair, becauſe a great while they having but
ſlight thoughts of God, they hope Chriſt will be merciful to
them, yet in time of temptation, when the Devil comes and
doth ſet before them the dreadfulneſs of Gods juſtice, that God
is a moſt juſt God as well as merciful, this makes their hearts to
ſink like a ſtone within their breaſts. But now the ſoul that ſees
the way of God in the Goſpel, ſees that God is infinitly ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mercy, and likewiſe ſees a way how Gods infinit juſtice may
be ſatisfied and ſeeing both theſe, this is a mighty help to faith;
now let there come never ſo many temptations, when the ſoul is
catching hold upon Gods mercy; I but ſaith temptation, God
is a juſt God as well as merciful, and doſt not thou preſume?
No ſaith the ſoul, the way of mercy that my ſoul reſts upon,
I ſee there is in it a way of ſatisfaction to infinite juſtice, as well
as a way for the manifeſtation of mercy, and therefore though
God be a righteous God, and a juſt God, yet here I ſee a way
for my ſoul to be ſav'd, yet for Divine Juſtice to have no wrong
neither, and therefore I can beleeve and venture my ſoul upon
this: It's impoſſible for a ſinner to venture his ſoul upon any
way of mercy, if it comes to underſtand with what a God it
hath to deal, except it comes to know God in Jeſus Chriſt, in
that way wherein infinit juſtice is ſatisfied to the utmoſt farthing
which is declared in the Goſpel. Now what Converſation is
ſutable to this?</p>
               <p>Hence let there be that Converſation in you, that may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
that you do not turn the grace of God into wantonneſs,
Oh a wanton Converſation is infinitly unbeſeeming the Goſpel,
Oh there is infinite mercy and free grace treaſured up here,
and what wilt thou be wanton and vain and looſe therefore?
there is infinite grace, but what way doth God take to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
infinite grace? Is it not in a way wherein the dreadfulleſt
Juſtice of God appears too? Is not the grace of God let out to
you through the blood of his Son? wherein the moſt dreadful
fruit of Gods juſtice is manifeſted that ever was ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world, or ever ſhall be manifeſted to the end of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29998:45"/>
world; if ſo be thou ſhouldeſt ſee all the damned in Hell, the
chambers of death unlocked under the wrath of God there
flaming out in fire and brimſtone; it would not be ſuch a
dreadful ſight as to ſee Jeſus Chriſt made an offering for ſin,
and lying under the vials of the wrath of his Father, falling
down upon the ground, grovelling and ſweating out great
drops of water and blood, and crying out upon the Croſs, <hi>My
God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> This is the way of the
purchaſe of thy mercy, therefore there is infinit juſtice together
with infinite mercy, Oh be not wanton then, do not turn the
grace of God into wantonneſs, but rejoyce in Gods mercy,
yet rejoyce with trembling and with fear and reverence of the
Name of God: When thou ſpeakeſt of the free grace of God,
and when thou comeſt to beleeve in the free grace of God in the
Goſpel, thou maieſt come cheerfully and boldly, I but come
with reverence and holy humble fear, I do not mean deſpairing
fear, nor ſervile ſlaviſh fear, but with awful reverence of the
glory of God that doth appear in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; I need
not ſend you to the Law to cauſe fear in your hearts, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in the Goſpel to cauſe your ſouls to tremble before God,
as well as to <hi>beleeve</hi> in God, <hi>Even our God is a conſuming fire:</hi> Oh
what was he to Jeſus Chriſt? I need go no further to lift up
God to make him an object of my fear, but to look upon him
in his dealings with his Son; and therefore thoſe Chriſtians that
walk looſly, and altogether upon ſlight thoughts of mercy
without any fear to ballaſt their hearts, Oh certainly their
Converſations are not Goſpel Converſations, for if thou didſt
underſtand the way of Gods mercy in the Goſpel, thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
ſee that that ſhould fill thy heart with fear and reverence
all the daies of thy life. And as to take heed of wantonneſs,
ſo to reverence Gods Juſtice, even the dreadfulneſs of it ſo as
the Goſpel holds forth; to think that God would only have
you to have your thoughts about his mercy, and not to have
your hearts to give glory to his juſtice, it is certainly a vain
conceit, and I fear it will cauſe the Goſpel to vaniſh into little
in the hearts of men; when men apprehend the Goſpel ſo, as
not to apprehend the dreadfulneſs of his juſtice; as if ſo be
that God would not have the glory of his juſtice. Chriſt hath
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:29998:45"/>
ſatisfied that: Hath Chriſt ſatisfied that? conſider what thou
ſaieſt when thou ſaieſt ſo, do but conſider how much of the
glory of Gods juſtice doth appear in what Chriſt hath done and
ſuffered; I deſire to hold forth no further the glory of juſtice
than by holding forth Jeſus Chriſt to thee, Doeſt not thou
think that God would have thee to ſanctifie in thy heart and
life all the Attributes of God that doth appear in Jeſus Chriſt?
Now the glory of juſtice doth appear as much in Chriſt as the
glory of mercy doth; then thou that doeſt profeſs the Goſpel,
thou muſt ſanctifie this Attribute of God as well as the other,
thou ſanctifieſt them both in honoring Gods juſtice; I do not
ſay that thou ſhouldeſt have a deſpairing heart, nay it will keep
thee from deſpairing, or that thou ſhouldeſt have a ſervile ſpirit,
but that thou ſhouldeſt ſanctifie it with reverence.</p>
               <p>And another thing that is very conſiderable, <hi>What is God ſo
ſet upon the glory of his Juſtice in the Goſpel?</hi> Oh labour you to be
juſt in all your Converſations; you ſee how God prizes juſtice,
that he will rather have his Son die and be made a curſe, than
juſtice ſhould not have honor; Oh take heed of injuſtice, the
ſin of injuſtice is a ſin unbeſeeming the Goſpel; and here's an
argument againſt injuſtice, a ſtronger than I know any in all
the Book of God, or can be imagined by men and Angels,
which is this, That in the Goſpel I find that God, hath His
heart ſo ſet upon juſtice, that rather than juſtice ſhall not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
he will not ſpare his Son one farthing (as the Scripture
ſaith) <hi>He ſpared not his own Son,</hi> but His Son muſt pay to the
uttermoſt, His Son muſt bear his very wrath, and all, that God
may ſhew his infinite love to juſtice; Oh then, let Chriſtians
love juſtice in all their dealings, in their dealing with God, in
their dealings between man and man. To ſee one that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the Goſpel, &amp; ſometimes accounts the feet of thoſe beautiful
that bring glad tydings of ſalvation, yet unjuſt in his dealings,
ſo as do but follow him in his courſe between man and man,
there he makes no conſcience of juſtice, there he will rather
break the rule of juſtice than (it may be) he will loſe ſix pence,
or a ſhilling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what if it were the loſing of thirty, or fourty
pounds, is it ſuch a thing, that the rule of juſtice muſt rather be
broken than the loſs of a little mony? Is this as becomes the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29998:46"/>
Goſpel? when as thou heareſt the Goſpel ſay, that rather than
the glory of juſtice ſhall be darkned, the Blood of his Son muſt
go for it, and God expects that Chriſtians ſhould be ſo in love
with juſtice, that they ſhould rather be content to be undone
in their eſtates, to beg their bread from door to door, than be
unjuſt in any of their actions, Oh 'tis an exceeding ecclipſing
of the glory of the Word when Profeſſors of it ſhall be falſe in
their dealings; Oh remember thou Chriſtian who holdeſt up
the Goſpel with thy right hand, that when thou heareſt of the
death of Chriſt, there the love that God bears to juſtice is held
forth, and God is ſet upon the honor of juſtice and he wil have
it: thy juſtice in thy trading, this muſt be made up one way
or other, either thou muſt pay eternally for it and ſo juſtice
made up, or elſe it muſt coſt the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, God is
ſet upon juſtice in another manner than you think of; Oh let
your Converſations be as becometh this truth of the Goſpel of
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>That the Lord in the Goſpel, ſhews how he is ſet upon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
the Law, and what a high price he puts upon the Law;</hi> The
excellency of the Law doth more cleerly appear in the Goſpel
than in the Doctrine of the Law its ſelf; as thus, Chriſt came to
fulfil all righteouſneſs, ſurely God ſet a high price of his Law,
that he would not ſave any ſoul living that had broken it, but
by his Son that muſt come to fulfil it: firſt, He muſt have all
righteouſneſs kept; &amp; to the end that he might manifeſt his love
unto his Law (I ſay) therefore it was that Chriſt muſt come and
ſubject himſelf to the Law, he muſt be under the Law; It was
from thence that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It becomes us to fulfil all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
So was God ſet upon his Law, that when Chriſt did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
for man-kind, if Chriſt had not ſatisfied every part of
the Law that was required, if there had been one jot of the Law
unfilfilled, all man-kind muſt have periſhed in everlaſting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings:
God ſets an high rate on his Royal Law, therefore learn
to prize the Law of God: It's true, you cannot keep it for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
that was Chriſts task, ſo to keep the Law that he might
juſtifie ſinners, God by this teaches us to eſteem highly of it, and
not to ſlight it and contemn it: the Law of God it is a precious
Criſtal glaſs, it is the very glaſs of the holineſs, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29998:46"/>
of God, and you muſt prize it, as you do prize your great
glaſſes that your Marriners have from other parts; you bring
home your great Criſtals, of 20. or 40. or threeſcore pounds
according to the largeneſſe of them: Now would not you take
it extream ill, when you have beſtowed ſo much upon it, that
a child or ſervant ſhould come and break it al to pieces? Now
(my brethren) conſider, The Law of God here reſembles the
Criſtal glaſſe; and as in your glaſſes you may ſee your faces,
ſo in that Criſtal glaſſe of the Law, the holineſs of God is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent,
'tis ſuch a glaſs that God prizes it more worth than all
the world; this is viſible: for the Lord ſtands much upon the
obſerving of the Law, and upon obedience unto it, and therfore
take heed of breaking it meerly to ſatisfie your luſts, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
and befriend your own baſe ends, this is unbeſeeming
the Goſpel of Chriſt. There are many that make a great noiſe
about Evangelical truths, ſo that they cry up the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,
the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> as they once did, <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the
Temple of the Lord;</hi> and they think that this doth wholly take
away their obedience to the Law of God, and that it muſt not
be ſo much as a rule of life. Certainly there's nothing holde
forth the excellency of the Law more than the knowledge of
Jeſus Chriſt (the only Law-giver) being ſubjected to the Law,
and his ſubjection it was to take away our guiltineſſe, to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
the bond of the Law, binding us to eternal death: But we
never reade that this ſubjection to the Law was to make void
our obedience to it, ſo that it ſhould not be any rule of life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, for indeed, what is the Law of God, but the pure Will of
God? and do you think that Chriſt came to take us away from
obeying the Will of God, which was Chriſts meat and drink
to do? I ſtand not ſo much upon that term, Whether as given
by <hi>Moſes?</hi> but upon thoſe things that are therein contained,
therein revealed as part of the will of God, God ſtands much
upon that, that we ſhould make the revealing of theſe things
in the Word to be the rule of our life, and this is manifeſted by
Chriſts ready and full ſubjection unto it. And that is the firſt
particular, what it is that we come to know by the Goſpel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which we ſhould ſute our Converſations.</p>

terrifie conſcience and raiſe up that ſleepy Lyon out

               <p>4. A man may come to know the evil of ſin by ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

judgments that God hath executed upon ſinners here in this
world, and by the terrors of conſcience that there are upon the
wicked, as on <hi>Cain, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> &amp;c. men many times here
for their ſins, by the wrath of God that is reveal'd from Heaven
againſt ſin in the execution of it, but take all thoſe together,
yea, did we ſee the woful execution of the wrath of God in
Hell its ſelf, did the Lord open unto us a door into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of death to diſcover the torments that are there, and to
hear all the ſhreeks and cries of the damned in everlaſting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
yet all this, the threats of the Law, the terrors of it,
the agonies of Conſcience, the torments of the damned in Hell,
(I ſay) put all together, and they would not ſo much, nor ſo
cleerly diſcover Gods infinit hatred of ſin, as what we find in
the Goſpel; the red Glaſſe of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that
was ſhed for ſin, doth diſcover more of Gods hatred againſt it,
than all the torments of Hell can do, or all the threats of the
Law can do; God doth in inflicting his wrath upon his Son
for mans ſin, thus preach unto the world? Wel, I ſee that you
cannot be brought to underſtand how I hate ſin with a perfect
hatred, but I'le have one way of argument to convince you,
that it is impoſſible you ſhould ſtand againſt, I will therefore
ſend my Son to take your nature upon him, and to ſtand char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with your debt, and you ſhall ſee how I'le deal with him,
who is your Surety, I'le not ſpare him, I'le powr out the vials
of my wrath upon him to the laſt drop, I'le make him a curſe
for ſin, though he be infinitly bleſſed, and equal with my ſelf,
yet I'le make him cry out in the anguiſh and trouble of his

the winepreſs of my wrath, I'le make the burden of ſin heavy
to Him, that ſhall make Him fall groveling upon His face, and
ſweat great clodders of blood in a winter ſeaſon, that ſhall run
down from His body upon the cold ground, I'le do this to that
end that all the world (to whom the preaching of the Goſpel
ſhall come) may ſee how infinitely I hate ſin: This is one of
Gods ends; though it's true, that the principal end of the death
of Chriſt it was, to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice: But there is another
end that God aims at in the death of his Son, To declare to all
the world, to men and Angels how infinitly the Lord doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29998:48"/>
all ſin: Now this is held forth in the Goſpel more
than in all the execution of the Law; if the Law were executed
to the full upon all the world, it would not hold forth Gods
hatred of ſin ſo much as this doth.</p>
               <p>Do you beleeve this Goſpel? Hath God let you live under
this Goſpel, that you hear it it your ears? And do you profeſs
that the Lord hath enlightened you by his holy Spirit, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

Converſation be as becomes this Evangelical truth.</p>
               <p>Queſt. What Converſation doth become this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hence then, your own reaſon cannot but make a
conſequence from this that the Goſpel holds forth. Hence then,
Caſt away al ſin as an abominable thing from you; What have
I to do any more with Idols? Hence then, Call no ſin little
which ſo much provokes the Lord. Indeed if you were only
acted by the light of reaſon, reaſon perhaps will tell you that
ſuch things are but little and ſmal, and you need make no ſuch
great matter about them. But now, Art not thou a Chriſtian?
A follower of Chriſt? A friend to the Goſpel? For ſhame call
no ſin little; for in the Goſpel you ſee the infinit hatred of God
againſt all ſin, yea, there is more evil in the leaſt ſin than in
the greateſt affliction whatſoever (that's a point that hath been
long ſince opened to you at large, and this will ſhew it cleerly,
there is more evil in any ſin than in the greateſt affliction, by
the dealing of God the Father with his Son) and therefore if
you will be willing to live as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be willing to bear any affliction in the world than wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to commit the leaſt ſin: Are theſe two in the ballance? Here
is a great and a ſore croſs, you think, how ſhall I endure that?
On the other ſide, Here's a ſin to be committed; if I venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſin, it may be I ſhall be delivered from this affliction?
Now would this become the Goſpel of Chriſt, for one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
that he doth beleeve that God the Father dealt thus with
His Son, that had ſin but by imputation upon Him, that He let
out the vials of His wrath upon Him, and made Him a curſe
for ſin; and if Chriſt had but undertaken for to have ſatisfied
for one ſin, though the leaſt ſin, He muſt have died for it, <hi>For
the wages of ſin, is death!</hi> of ſin indefinitly, it's death: And do I
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29998:48"/>
beleeve this, and yet ſhall I rather chuſe the commiſſion of a ſin
than the bearing of any affliction? Oh this is infinitly unbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: do I beleeve this, and is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
unto my ſoul? Oh let me then manifeſt in my whol courſe
and life that I tremble at the very thought of a ſin, at the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of evil, and am as much afraid of the leaſt ſpark of luſts
as of the fire of Hell: let me diſcover the temptation to ſin, that
I may endeavour to avoid all temptations to ſin, becauſe God
hath given ſuch a teſtimony from Heaven againſt ſin, Oh it is a
loud teſtimony indeed that God hath given from heaven againſt
ſin in the death of his Son, Oh then let my Converſation be ſuch
as I may make it appear that I am afraid of the beginnings of
ſin, of the firſt whiſpering and motions to ſin, Oh ſet me not
ſtand dandling of ſin in my thoughts, and roul it as a ſweet
morſel under my tongue, let me not entertain it in my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the leaſt degree, as to love it, to approve it, to delight in
it, but as ſoon as ever it enters into thy heart caſt it out preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let it not lodge within thy doors one moment, raiſe up all
the power of thy ſoul againſt it, follow it with Hue and Cry,
till thou haſt overtaken it, and then do juſtice and judgment
upon it, what though it may be a Delilah, yet cut it off; Oh let
me take heed of lying in any ſin, have I bin overtaken in my ſin?
Oh let me be willing rather to ſhame and condemn my ſelf, to
deny any thing in the world rather than to continue in that ſin,
the Lord forbid that if I have been once drawn to any ſin, that
I ſhould think to cover it by another ſin, by adding one ſin to
another, to think to ſhift for my credit or eſteem by adding
more ſin to that already committed, Oh no, the Lord in
his mercie hath made known unto me in the Goſpel of Chriſt
what ſin means, the evil of ſin, and therefore I have learned ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to endure any thing than to multiply iniquity; Indeed
before I came to underſtand Jeſus Chriſt, I thought ſin was an
evil thing, and I abſtain'd from groſs ſins by that dim light of
Nature that is within me; but ſince I came to underſtand the
Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, the great myſtery of godlineſs in his
Son, &amp; the dealings of the Father with his Son, the Lord knows
now I abhor a ſin in ſecret (though I were ſure no body in the
world ſhould ever know it) more than I do abhor Hell its ſelf;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29998:49"/>
I ſuch a Converſation as would manifeſt ſuch a work of God
upon the heart as this is would become the Goſpel of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
Whereas otherwiſe brethren, if any of you that do
profeſs the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhall make ſin but as a ſlight thing,
and ſhall be ready to entertain ſin in thy boſom, know that by
this means, you do no other but trample under foot the Blood
of Jeſus Chriſt as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon thing, as a thing that had no worth
at all in it. This doth deſpight to the Goſpel of Chriſt, you
do diſhonor Jeſus Chriſt, and you do put him to open ſhame
whoſe Name you have taken upon you by your profeſſion: I'le
give you a Scripture now for this in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. &amp;c. He ſpeaks
of ſome, <hi>that were once enlightned, and had taſted of the Heavenly
gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and taſted of the good
word of God</hi> (that's the Goſpel) <hi>and the powers of the world to come:
if they ſhould fall away, it were impoſſible to renew them to repentance.</hi>
Mark the reaſon: <hi>Seeing they crucifie to themſelves the Son of
God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame:</hi> Such as fall off after
the profeſſion of the Goſpel into ſinful waies, they are ſaid
here to crucifie the Son of God afreſh, and to put him to open
ſhame. This is far from walking as becomes the Goſpel. And
ſo you have another text in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. &amp;c. (he ſpeaks of

of, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the
blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing,
and hath done deſpight unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> See how the holy
Ghoſt ſpeaks of ſuch as fall from their profeſſion into ſinful
waies again. And there's a great deal of reaſon for it, for 'tis
not ſo much for thoſe that never made profeſſion of the Goſpel,
to fall to ſin, not ſuch a horrid thing for them; but for thoſe
that have made profeſſion of the Goſpel, that they hold forth
thus much; this is the language of their actions (though they
dare not ſay ſo) Lord I acknowledge that I have ſeen the fruit
of thy hatred of ſin in the death of thy Son, that thou didſt ſo
hate ſin, that thou madeſt thy Son to be a curſe for ſin; but yet
for all this, ſuch is the ſtrength of my luſts, I muſt have my
luſts, though it be ſo vile in thine eyes as the blood of thy Son
went for it, yet I muſt have it rather than deny my luſts; Oh
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29998:49"/>
what a dreadful thing is this? how provoking muſt it needs be
to the holy God? Oh happy had it been for ſuch men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that they had never heard of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.
But of the evil of walking unbeſeeming the Goſpel of Jeſus
Chriſt, we ſhall ſpeak to after, when we come to the application;
That's then the ſixt particular of what the Goſpel holds forth
The infinite hatred of God againſt ſin.</p>
               <p>Now the ſeventh thing that is held forth in the Goſpel that
cals for a Converſation beſeeming, is this, <hi>The great price of ſouls.</hi>
There's nothing in the world that ever God did, that doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the worth of mans immortal ſoul ſo as the Goſpel of Jeſus
Chriſt doth, there God manifeſts to all the world what a price
he puts upon mans ſoul, the Lord ſaw that men by ſin had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
themſelves and that thoſe ſouls that he made were like
to periſh to all eternity, yea, were under the ſentence of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
death, and muſt certainly periſh eternally, if ſo be that
ſome way were not found out by an infinit wiſdom for to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
them; now ſaith the Lord, rather than I will have all
ſouls periſh; (it's true, the love that I have unto my Juſtice is
ſuch, as for many ſouls I'le let them go, and they ſhall periſh;
but yet that I might ſhew that I have an high eſteem of the ſouls
of the children of men, for the ranſoming of that number that
I have appointed from all eternity to ſave,) I'le ſend my Son,
and he ſhall die for the ſaving of ſouls, that ſouls may not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh:
If the Lord ſhould have ſaid concerning any one ſoul, I
do ſo highly prize this ſoul, and account the worth of it to be
ſuch, as rather than it ſhall periſh I'le diſolve heaven and earth,
heaven and earth ſhall periſh rather than this ſoul ſhall periſh,
you will ſay, this had been a great teſtimony of Gods eſteem of
a ſoul: But know that the Goſpel holds forth a higher eſteem of
a ſoul than this comes to, when God ſhal ſay, Rather than this,
and the other ſoul ſhall periſh, I'le ſend my Son to be made a
Curſe; This the Goſpel holds forth; this is infinitly a higher
price that God puts upon a ſoul: You know therfore what the
Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 18, 19. Forasmuch as ye know that ye were
not redeemed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with corruptible things; as ſilver, and gold:</hi>
Then in the 19. verſe, <hi>But with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a
Lamb without blemiſh, or without ſpot:</hi> 'Tis not ſilver and gold:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29998:50"/>
or any corruptible thing that can redeem you, but the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
blood of Jeſus Chriſt, Oh that blood, that's more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than the world, even all the world muſt let the redemption
of a ſoul alone for ever, all the Angels in Heaven if they would
have joyned together to have redeem'd a ſoul, and would have
ventured themſelves to have been deſtroyed for ever that they
might have redeem'd a ſoul, it would not have been, they muſt
all let the redemption of a ſoul alone for ever; the matter then
of the redemption of a ſoul is more than we are aware of, and
we could never have come to have known this but by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Jeſus Chriſt: The full price of a ſoul is writ down by
the finger of Gods Spirit in the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is only
this, <hi>The Blood of the Son of God, the Blood of the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, let our Converſation be as becomes this that is
held forth in this Goſpel, that's thus, <hi>Manifeſting in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
that you ſet a high price upon your ſouls:</hi> do not venture
your ſouls upon nothing; Oh how unbeſeeming is this, that
when God ſhall ſet ſuch a price upon a ſoul, as to give for the
redemption of it more than ten thouſand thouſand worlds are
worth, yet that a man or woman that profeſſes themſelves to be
Chriſtians ſhall venture the loſs of their ſouls for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ſixpence or twelvepence, hazard thoſe immortal Jewels
for one or two minutes of ſenſual pleaſure, to ſatisfie the luſts
of the fleſh; what is it elſe, when ſuch will lye or coſen for a
little while for thick clay? For the Lords ſake, do not lay down
thy everlaſting ſoul at ſtake for a little gain, ſome for a little
credit; art thou a Chriſtian? didſt ever reade the Goſpel, man
or woman didſt thou ever hear of Chriſt? and doſt thou know
what the death of Chriſt meant? and wherefore Chriſt came
into the world? muſt Heaven and earth be mov'd to provide a
way to ranſom ſouls? and doſt thou ſet them at ſo low a rate?
Oh how unbeſeeming is this to the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>And others pawn away their ſouls, when God manifeſts
what a price he ſets upon them, yet will pawn their ſouls to
the very Devil.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay,</hi> Is any man ſo wicked as to pawn away his
ſoul to the Devil?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, When any man will venture upon ſin, but upon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29998:50"/>
this condition, I will repent before I die; that is, as if I ſhould
ſay thus, Here I give my ſoul to pawn, if I do repent, then I'l
have it again, if I do not repent before I die, then it's gone for
ever. As when you give a pawn, you give it upon theſe terms,
Wel, I give you this, and if I bring you by ſuch a time ſo much
money, then I'le have it again, and if not, then 'tis gone. So do
men and women, they ſay thus, <hi>Here Devil,</hi> thou ſhalt have the
poſſeſſion of my ſoul all this while ſo long as I am in a way of
ſin, if I do repent, then I muſt have it again, but if I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
before I die, then thou ſhalt have it for ever. Now doſt thou
know the price of a ſoul? Oh! is this to ſhew the high price of
a ſoul, that wil pawn your ſouls thus? And mark to whom you
pawn it, you pawn it to the <hi>Devil,</hi> he hath it all this time, it's
in his cuſtody: al the while that any one ſins upon hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
(I ſay) til they repent the Devil hath their ſouls in his
poſſeſſion, in his hands: as when you pawn a piece of houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff,
til the time that you bring the money, ſo long the man you
pawn it to hath the poſſeſſion of it. And thus do people; you
put your ſouls into the Devils hands, and upon ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that you are not able to perform; that is, if you repent,
you will have it again, if not, he muſt have it for ever: Oh
friends, you little know what repentance means! What is it to
repent? it requires a mighty work of God, the ſame power of
God that made the world is required to break the heart of a
ſinner, ſo that you put it to pawn upon that that is impoſſible
for you your ſelves to perform by all the power that you have:
Now if a man put a thing to pawn for that which is impoſſible
for him to redeem, it may be, if he ſhould have a great many
friends that will do ſome great matter for him, then he may
redeem it, but it is beyond his power; you will ſay, there is
a great deal of danger then that that pawn ſhall never be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
So know, when you pawn your ſouls, you put it into
the hands of Satan, and lock it up in the powers of darkneſſe,
and pawn it for that that you have no power to bring: Do you
prize the Goſpel? and know what a price God hath ſet upon
ſouls? O then take heed and ſet a greater priſe upon your ſouls
than to pawn them away for every trifle, a thing of naught.</p>
               <p>And then, If this be held forth in the Goſpel, <hi>O then do not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29998:51"/>
pollute and defile you ſouls with ſin as you do from time to time.</hi> God
hath a high eſteem of them, have you a high eſteem of them
likewiſe. Do not make your ſouls drudges and ſcuullions to
your bodies, only to make uſe of your ſouls to provide for the
ſatisfying of the luſts of the fleſh, as many men and women
have no other uſe of their precious immortal ſouls all their
lives, but only their ſouls are imployed to be ſlaves for the luſts
of their fleſh: Oh! are theſe the ſouls that muſt coſt the blood of
Chriſt, that God hath put ſuch a price upon? ſurely you do
not know the Goſpel nor Jeſus Chriſt. If I ſhould tel you what
Phyloſophers ſay of the ſoul, of mens immortal eternal ſouls
(though this be now doubted, yet it was plentifully known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Heathens) theſe would be but dry things to you in
compariſon of this, to tell you that Jeſus Chriſt hath died to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
ſouls, theres more in this than in al the arguments that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
can be brought to ſhew the excellency of the ſoul of man.</p>
               <p>Oh then, likewiſe let your Converſation be as becomes this
of the Goſpel, <hi>in your care of the ſouls of thoſe that are committed to
your care and charge.</hi> Do you profeſs the Goſpel? then you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
withal that God ſo eſteemed of a ſoul, that he gave the life and
blood of his Son to ranſom a ſoul; Oh then, really demonſtrate
that you do highly eſteem of the ſouls of your children, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
by walking convincingly before them, that you may do
all the good you can to them, by inſtructing of them, by praying
for them, and with them; and ſo before all your friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
let ſuch kind of meditations work thus in you as
theſe, Oh Lord, ſince I came to know the Goſpel, I have learn'd
what a high price thou haſt put upon ſouls, Lord, this ſhall
make me for evermore to value ſouls at a higher rate than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
I have done. Oh it were an excellent point to urge upon
Miniſters, who are charged with many ſouls, Oh let them ſo
watch over them, pray for them, and preach to them all the
Counſels of God, both in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, that in the
great Day of Chriſt, they may be cleer of the blood of all men,
as <hi>Paul</hi> was. And that's the ſeventh thing that the Goſpel holds
forth unto us, The preciouſneſs of ſouls; and let your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
be as becomes this great point of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:29998:51"/>
But then Eighthly, which is as principal a one almoſt as
any and neerly concerns us, and that's this: <hi>The Goſpel diſcovers
unto us, the great honor that God hath put upon humane Nature above
the Angels.</hi> This could never have been known but by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
this is as proper a thing to the Goſpel as any I have ſpoken
of: And one ſpecial deſign that God had in the Goſpel, was,
To reveal thoſe thoughts and counſels that he had from al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to put mighty and great Excellencies upon our humane
Nature in theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In the Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Mans Nature to the ſecond Perſon
in Trinity;</hi> That's the firſt, and great way of honor that God
hath crowned human Nature with. Hence the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.
1. 6. Without controverſie, great is the myſterie of godlineſs.</hi> What is
it? God was manifeſted in the fleſh. God manifeſted in the
fleſh! that's a great myſtery of godlineſs. Now it could not be
ſuch a myſtery, if God had only taken an humane ſhape upon
Him, (for ſo it was in the time of the Law) Jeſus Chriſt often
took humane ſhape; as when He ſtrove with <hi>Jacob,</hi> it was Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, as might eaſily appear. But great is the myſterie of
godlineſs, without controverſie it's great. <hi>God manifeſted in
the fleſh:</hi> that is, God taking fleſh of man into a perſonal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is more fully expreſt in <hi>John, 1. 4. The Word was
made fleſh.</hi> This was a ſtrange ſpeech, but proper to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
An Heathen would have thought this a ſtrange ſpeech,
and eſpecially if he knew, that by the <hi>Word</hi> was meant, He that
was true and eternal God. And then, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. it is
ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt did not take the Nature of Angels upon him; but
the ſeed of</hi> Abraham. So that it appears by the perſonal union
of our Natures to the Son of God, God hath advanced human
Nature above Angels, above all creatures. Truly my Brethren,
in Chriſts taking our Nature upon Him, which the Goſpel
holds forth to us, me thinks we may ſee God (as it were) reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to do a work from Himſelf, to the uttermoſt, to manifeſt
the uttermoſt of his glory in a work out of Himſelf, the work
of God within Himſelf, it is, His eternal generation, and the
poſſeſſion of the holy Ghoſt: but now God would work out of
Himſelf, and work out of Himſelf to the uttermoſt extent; I'le
make a world (ſaith God,) Heavens and Earth by my Word.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29998:52"/>
But this is not ſuch a glorious work as I am able to do: I could
make ten thouſand worlds, and when I have made them I
could make as many more, and more glorious: But I would
do ſome work wherein I might manifeſt even the uttermoſt of
my glory: What work is that? that is, The work that God
pitcht upon, He would do one work from without to manifeſt
the uttermoſt of his glory, and the Lord rather pitches upon
this, To take the nature of Man into a perſonal union with His
Son, that's the uttermoſt: And it is impoſſible that Men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
if they were left to all eternity to imagin, could think
of a work that it were poſſible for God to expreſs more of His
power, wiſdom, and glory in: but we know but little of it
now, but we ſhall know more in Heaven. Now, Oh how
hath God honored humane Nature in this! That when He
would do a work to the utmoſt of His Excellency, that He would
pitch upon Mans Nature, to take it into Perſonal Union with
Himſelf; here's the myſtery of the Goſpel: now this is indeed
the marrow of the myſterie of the Goſpel, <hi>The Word made fleſh:</hi>
the ſecond Perſon in Trinity taking Mans Nature upon Him;
This is the myſtery of the Goſpel that Angels and Saints ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at, and ſhall be taken up to all eternity in admiring and
praiſing and magnifying God for. That's the firſt way of
Gods honoring Mans Nature. And then, there is a ſecond
thing which the Goſpel reveals, and that's this, <hi>In putting honor
not only upon the Nature of Man, as having ſoul and body, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a mighty honor upon the very Body of Man,</hi> the meaneſt and
the very loweſt part of Man, the very ſhel, outſide, rine and caſe
of Man: that you have in 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19. What, know ye not that
your bodie is the temple of the holy Ghoſt, which is in you?</hi> Your
<hi>body</hi> is the Temple of the holy Ghoſt. You have no ſuch thing
revealed in the old Teſtament, this comes by the light of the
Goſpel, that the Lord hath made the bodies of the Saints to be
Temples to the holy Ghoſt, that the holy Ghoſt dwels in their
very Bodies as in a Temple; as the King in his Pallace, ſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt in His Temple: Now theſe <hi>two</hi> are great things revealed
in the Goſpel, and had we but a cleer underſtanding of theſe
two things, Oh! it would mightily elevate our ſpirits. And
Converſations ſutable to theſe two particulars ſurely muſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29998:52"/>
needs be a high raiſed Converſation. As now for inſtance,</p>
               <p>3. <hi>In the perſonal union of our natures with the ſecond Perſon in
Trinity:</hi> Oh how ſhould this raiſe up our hearts and we ſhould
manifeſt the elevation of our ſpirits in our Converſation, ſo as
it becomes thoſe that may expect great things from God, ſurely
that God that hath honoured our natures ſo, as to be perſonally
united to his Son, he doth intend great things to ſome of the
children of men, as now, Suppoſe you that are the pooreſt and
meaneſt here in this Congregation, you had a Siſter that were
married to the greateſt Emperor in the world, yea, to one that
were Emperor of all the whol Earth; now you would think
to live another kind of life than you did before, were it beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſuch a man to live now upon ſcraping of Chanels, or
wiping of horſe heels, (or any mean imployment,) when his
Siſter is married to the only Monarch of all the whol earth, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he may think now, I muſt live at a higher rate, for I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſomething by this: So ſhould every one of the children of
men think thus, indeed I have liv'd in a mean baſe way, the
humane nature of mine hath been baſely ſubject to filthy luſts,
all my daies, I have been a bondſlave to ſin and Satan, but when
I come to hear of the Goſpel, I hear that the ſecond Perſon in
Trinity, God bleſſed for ever, equal with the Father, that is
the Heir of all things, that he hath not married my humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but hath taken it into a perſonal union with himſelf, and
is become my kinſman, my neer kinſman, hath taken this into
the neereſt union as is poſſible for a creature to be taken into
with God: Oh let us be raiſed then in our thoughts, to think,
ſurely God intends higher things for ſome of the children
of men, than to eat and drink, and ſatisfie the fleſh, and be
brutiſh here in the world, there are higher things that God
will do for mankind, and why not for me? I am not excluded
no more than others? It was a ſpeech I remember of <hi>Seneca,</hi>
(though a Heathen) I am greater (ſaith he) and I am born to
greater things than to be a ſlave to my body: A Heathen could
ſay ſo: Oh but when we hear of humane nature ſo advanced
and enthroned in Chriſt, we ſhould think with our ſelves, that
any one that hath humanity in them is born to higher things,
than to make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29998:53"/>
What wilt thou be a ſlave to the Devil now? Thou heareſt how
God hath dignified the nature of man into ſo neer a union with
himſelf, Oh doth not this myſterie of the Goſpel call to all the
children of men? Oh all you children of men! Behold what
God hath done for man kind! ſurely the thoughts of God for
man-kind are great and glorious, there be higher things you
may attain unto, and will you yet periſh, and chuſe your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here in this world, and be groveling on the ground, as if
there were no higher thoughts that God had for your good,
than meerly to live as brute beaſts, to eat and drink, and then
riſe up to play? Oh if God hath advanced mans nature ſo, do
not deſpiſe it in the meaneſt of the children of men, the loweſt
ſervant, or pooreſt boy that lies begging at your door for a piece
of bread, (for it is of the ſame kind that is united in a perſonal
union with the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, of the ſame nature
which this poor boy that lies begging at your door for broken
bread and meat) therefore honor humane nature in every one,
and do not vilifie it in thy ſelf; thoſe men that live under the
Goſpel and vilifie humane nature, they put a diſhonour upon
Jeſus Chriſt. And even reverence thy ſelf in private when thou
art alone, (I ſay) reverence thy ſelf, do not abuſe thy body,
it is the Temple of the holy Ghoſt. Oh remember this all you
that are profeſſors of Religion, that theſe bodies of yours, this
fleſh of yours (if you be godly and walk anſwerable to your
profeſſion) I ſay this fleſh of yours it is the very Temple of the
holy Ghoſt, do not abuſe it; it's the Apoſtles argument, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fly fornication, and be not joyned to whores; for your bodies are the
temples of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> Oh it makes the ſin of uncleanneſs to one
that profeſſes the Goſpel of Chriſt a curſed ſin, the ſin of unclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in a profeſſor of the Goſpel, it's a thouſand thouſand times
more abominable than the ſin of uncleanneſs in another: why?
Becauſe they know how God hath advanced humane nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a perſonal union with himſelf, and how their bodies are the
Temples of the holy Ghoſt. What ſhal I make the Temple of God

There hath been a great deal of do about ſtony Churches

they ſet their foot in ſome of our meeting places; and in the

Chriſtians; Oh now, either deny thy Chriſtianity, or
do not abuſe thy body to any filthy luſt, for it is the Temple of
the holy Ghoſt. This the Goſpel holds forth. And let thy
Converſation be now as becomes the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; not
abuſing thy body ſo; For we ſee that the Goſpel cals for bodily
cleanneſs, as well as ſpiritual cleanneſs, and truly I do not know
ſtronger arguments to godlineſs than theſe that we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
here in the Goſpel: We have gone through three, Gods
infinit hatred of ſin. The price of ſouls. And the honor that the
Goſpel ſhews that God hath put upon humane nature. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
but becoming theſe three, would be other manner
of Converſations than you have. I ſhall only ſpeak of a fourth,
and that's this.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The Goſpel holds forth the greateſt example of ſelf-denial that ever
was in the world,</hi> &amp; by all waies that ever God hath made known
his mind, he never hath revealed his will in an example of
ſelf-denial ſo as he hath done in the Goſpel, and that is in the
example of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: God evidenceth there ſuch a
work of ſelf-denial, as never was: and 'tis impoſſible to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
a greater example of ſelf-denial than that is; though
Chriſt thought it no robbery to be equal with God; reade but
the ſecond of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> verſ. 7, 8. and there you may ſee
what Chriſt was, and yet how he emptied himſelf, how he
denied himſelf in his honor, how vile he was made in the
world, though he was the brightneſs of his fathers glory,
yet he was made of no reputation; how he denied himſelf
in riches, Chriſt that was the Heir of all things, though he
were rich, yet he was made poor for us; how he denied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his pleaſures, he was the delight of the Father from all
eternity, and yet he was made a man of ſorrows; he denied
himſelf in his life, for he was the Lord of life, and yet he
ſubjected himſelf to death, to a curſed death for us: Oh the
example of Chriſt in ſelf-denial is the greateſt that ever was:
and this ſeems to be one great end of the humiliation of Jeſus
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29998:54"/>
Chriſt to hold forth a preaching pattern of ſelf-denial to the
world: And there's a great deal more power in the pattern
and example of ſelf-denial, then in the commands of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
I only preſent this to ſhew you that it is the moſt unbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Goſpel for any one that profeſſes the Goſpel to be ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh,
altogether ſcraping for themſelves; and whatſoever ſervice
they are put upon, except <hi>ſelf</hi> may have an oare in it, they
have no mind to it; Oh 'tis becoming the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt
for men and women to be emprtied of themſelves, no matter
what becomes of our ſelves, but be willing to give up our ſelves
for publick good, to venture your eſtates, and lives, and all
your comforts, yea to be ſwallowed up in the glory of God, to
be nothing, that Chriſt may be all. In the Goſpel of Chriſt,
we find that Chriſt he was ſwallowed up with the glory of his
Father; and he came not to do his own will, but the will of
his father that ſent him; and though he was one that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more excellency than all men and Angels in Heaven
and Earth, yet he was content for the honor of his Father to
be made as a worm and no man, to be trampled under foot,
to endure the greateſt extremities of all ſorts; this holds out an
example to us, that while we live in this world we ſhould be
taken off from our ſelves: Oh this ſelf-love ſticks much in the
hearts of men and women: now upon the example of Chriſts
ſelf-denial, we are required to deny our ſelves, and it is the
proper leſſon of the Goſpel, <hi>He that will follow me, let him deny
himſelf,</hi> you never read of ſuch a precept in all the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
(though no queſtion the people of God did deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
then,) but in expreſſe terms ſo fully you have not
ſuch a thing there: and there's no ſuch rules among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
for a man to deny himſelf, <hi>Let him deny himſelf;</hi> thoſe
that know the Original, know that the word is, not only to
<hi>Deny,</hi> but there is that joyned to it that doth encreaſe the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
let them deny themſelves, <hi>throughly,</hi> there is a Prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
put to the word, to ſhew that thoſe that will come to
Chriſt muſt deny themſelves, and that throughly, it is a proper
leſſon of the Goſpel, and the firſt leſſon. Oh when our Lord and
Maſter hath thus denied himſelf, and emptied himſelf for good
to us, what is beſeeming this Goſpel, but that all that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29998:54"/>
of it ſhould deny themſelves? It is very unbeſeeming the
glorious Goſpel, for a Chriſtian to be ſelviſh, to have his ſelf-ends,
and ſelf-waies, and intereſts in every thing, as generally
almoſt al men in the world they are acted by <hi>ſelf,</hi> ſome ſelf-ends,
or ſelf-excellency carries them on in their actions, or elſe they
have no heart to do any thing; this is unbecoming the Goſpel.
But now I ſay, one that would live as becomes the Goſpel, muſt
be wholly emptied of himſelf, whatſoever parts, eſtate, credit,
or honor he hath in the world, muſt be melted into the glory of
God; Jeſus Chriſt for the glory of His Father, was content in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
to deny Himſelf more than we can; For what have we
to deny our ſelves of? Do you or I live as becomes the Goſpel?
when (I ſay) all that we apprehend to have any excellency in,
we have it all ſwallowed up in the glory of God, when we can
dedicate and conſecrate our lives, honors, liberties, eſtates, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
and all to the glory of God, and be as nothing to our
ſelves, and let God be all in all to us, Miniſters may bring
many reaſons why we ſhould deny our ſelves, but all theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
comes to nothing, till the ſoul comes to behold the cleer
light of the Goſpel, and there beholds the Son of God by faith,
how he did empty Himſelf; nay then, ſaith a beleeving ſoul, if
the Son of God did deny Himſelf, was emptied thus for me, Oh
then let me be wholly taken off from my ſelf, and venture
wholly upon God, I muſt not live in my ſelf, nor live for my
ſelf, nor live to my ſelf; but wholly live in God, and for God,
and to God, and upon God: Oh this is that which becomes
the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Ninth thing that the Goſpel holds forth
is this, <hi>That our Converſation ſhould be ſutable
to ſpiritual worſhip, the ſpiritual worſhiping of
God.</hi> The worſhip that there was in the time
of the Law, it was carnal in compariſon of
what there is in the time of the Goſpel: And
therefore a great part of the worſhip of God
is called, <hi>a carnal commandement,</hi> and <hi>rudiments of the world,</hi> and
<hi>beggerly things;</hi> If you reade the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> there you have
ſtrange expreſſions about that which was even the worſhip of
God: and ſo in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> divers times. But now you know
what Chriſt ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 4. to the woman of <hi>Samaria, The hour
cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem
worſhip the Father: But the hour cometh, when the true worſhipers ſhal
worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth: for ſuch the Father ſeeks to
worſhip him.</hi> We muſt not think to worſhip God in ſuch carnal
waies as before. I beſeech you conſider this one thing, Certainly
God wil have as much worſhip in the time of the Goſpel, as ever
He had: But where we have one external thing to worſhip
God in now, in the time of the Law there was an hundred, an
hundred to one of external things: yet now this worſhip of
God muſt be made up ſome way; we are not cal'd to thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worſhipings, offerings, ſacrifices, and coſtly things as they
were in the time of the Law; now, how ſhould this be made
up, but in ſpiritual ſacrifices, in preſenting our bodies and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29998:55"/>
ſouls to God as a living ſacrifice, therefore ſuch men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
as altogether are for the out-ſide of things in the worſhip
of God, and becauſe God hath appointed but a few things in
his worſhip; we have uſe of no other creature in the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of God, but meerly the Bread and Wine, and Water, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe elements; and the Man to ſpeak to us, to be either
Gods mouth to us, or our mouth to God; there's all we have
appointed in the Goſpel for the worſhip of God; therefore it
is expected if we would have our Converſation be as becoms the
Goſpel, to be very ſpiritual in our worſhip, and therefore to
take heed of thinking to make up Gods worſhip with external
things of our own, that's exceedingly unbeſeeming the Goſpel:
Many thought in former times, they did honor God much
by adding to His Worſhip ceremonies, external things; and
peoples hearts are ſet moſt upon them, becauſe they are from
man, they are humane: I'le give you but one-Scripture to ſhew
how we ſhould for ever take heed of traditions of men, and of
mixtures in the Worſhip of God, becauſe that the Goſpel points
at ſpiritual worſhip: That place in 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 18. Foraſmuch as
ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and
gold:</hi> from what? <hi>from your vain Converſations received by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a
Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot.</hi> See what an argument
the Apoſtle uſes here unto thoſe he writ to, ſaith he, There
was a time that you worſhiped God in an external way, and in
a ſuperſtitious manner, according to the traditions and fancies
of your fathers, this was before you knew Jeſus Chriſt; but
(ſaith he) now you come to know Jeſus Chriſt, know it was
the blood of Jeſus Chriſt that was ſhed to redeem you from this
vain Converſation that you received by tradition from your
forefathers. I do not know any one Scripture hath more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in it to take off mens hearts from all falſe and ſuperſtitious
worſhip, from all old cuſtoms that they had from their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
(as people are mightily ſet upon old cuſtoms, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God according to them) what a ſtir and do had we to get off
men from their late Service-Book (the great <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>England)</hi>
which was made up of the ends and ſhreds of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Maſs-Book,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:29998:56"/>
only printed in an Engliſh letter; and reading and bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
over Burials, and ſuch kind of trumperies, Oh how were
thoſe old <hi>Samaritan</hi> cuſtoms ſetled in the hearts of men? as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up to the Communion Table, and there to kneel down at
Rails like ſo many Beads-men to the Pope, &amp; Votaries to <hi>Rome.</hi>
Mens hearts are mightily ſet upon ſuch fooliſh things as theſe
are. But now this text tels you, that if you know what it is to
be redeemed by the blood of Chriſt, you muſt know that the
blood of Chriſt was ſhed for, to take you off from your vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
received by tradition from your forefathers: Chriſt
ſhed his blood that he might deliver you from all ſuch traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
things, that ſo you might worſhip God in ſpirit and in
truth; this becomes the Goſpel. And at your leaſure do but
reade over that ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi>
ſpeaking of men, <hi>that in a voluntary humility, worſhiped Angels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
into thoſe things which they have not ſeen, and vainly puft
up by their fleſhly mind.</hi> And then in the 16. verſe, <hi>Let no man
therefore judge you in meat, or in drink,</hi> not that you may not eat
fleſh at ſuch and ſuch times in the year) <hi>or in reſpect of an holy day,
or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath daies,</hi> (the Jewiſh Sabbath
day:) let no man judg you (ſaith the Apoſtle) in regard of theſe
things, <hi>which are a ſhadow of things to come.</hi> Then in the 19. verſ.
<hi>And not holding the head.</hi> Thoſe that ſtood upon ſuch things as
theſe are, they are here charged for not holding the head, that
is, they did not hold Chriſt; as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, If
ſo be that you hold Chriſt, and profeſs Chriſt, you would not
ſtand upon theſe things, upon theſe kind of ſuperſtitious waies
in the worſhip of God. And you ſhall find in the Epiſtle to the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> the Apoſtle telling of the GALATIANS about
ſuch kind of waies of continuing and holding of the worſhip
of the Law, ſaith he in <hi>Gal. 4. 10. Ye obſerve daies, and months,
and times, and years:</hi> What then? <hi>I am afraid of you, leſt I have
beſtowed upon you labor in vain.</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, I
profeſs I ſee you ſtand upon ſuch old things, and worſhiping
of God in an external way; I am afraid of you, leſt I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
all my labor in vain: This is ſo oppoſite to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
as makes me think, and am afraid that all my prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Goſpel to you is in vain: and yet mark my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29998:56"/>
what were theſe daies, and months, and times, and
yeers? they were ſuch as God heretofore had appointed, but
now they were ceaſed, after Chriſt came, out of date, and yet
they ſticking to them after the death of Chriſt (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle)
I profeſs I am afraid of you, that all my preaching in vain
to you: Now my brethren what ſhall we ſay to thoſe that ſtick
upon theſe things that God had never appointed, but were of
Popiſh ordination: As keeping one time more holy than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and thinking thereby to tender up ſervice to God: Why
ſhould we not keep the memory of ſuch and ſuch times? Now as
to keep them ſo as to think that they ſhall ſanctifie any time, is a
dangerous thing, a ſign that they underſtand the Goſpel but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
to think that any men upon any reaſon whatſoever ſhould be
able to ſanctifie a time, to make that time to be holy, (I ſay)
that's unbeſeeming the Goſpel; no man can make a holy day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, We keep daies of faſting, and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But there's a great deal of difference between them and
theſe times that here the Apoſtle ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p>Now the keeping of holy daies is this: We account the time
holy, and the very duty is more acceptable becauſe it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at that time; as now on the Sabbath day, there may be a
Sermon on the week day, but certainly it's a more holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God to hear upon the Sabbath, than on the week day,
and we ſanctifie Gods Name more on the Sabbath than on the
week; why? Becauſe the time doth ſanctifie the duty, being
ſet apart by God: As in the Temple, the duty was more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
than in any other place, why? becauſe it was ſet apart
by God; but we cannot make any place holy, and ſo no time
holy: ſo that our daies of faſting &amp; thanſgiving are only thus,
that we wil ſpend that time in holy duties, to humble our ſelves,
or to bleſs God, but not to make this time holy, ſo that the
duty ſhould be holy becauſe it's on this day rather than on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day; that's the ſuperſtition of it, when a duty ſhould be
holy rather on this day than on another; as now, ſome they
think it's a more holy thing to receive the Lords Supper on an
Eſter day than on another day; this is ſuperſtition, to think
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29998:57"/>
the duty is more holy by any holineſs that men put upon a
thing, that's unbeſeeming the Goſpel; and we are redeemed
from ſuch vain Converſations by the blood of Chriſt; and
while men ſtick upon theſe things, and ſay, let them do what
they will me thinks theſe things are good and right, it's very
evil. Thus it was with the <hi>Galatians,</hi> they had more ſeeming
reaſon to think that thoſe things that they ſtuck upon were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to God than you, yet ſaith the Apoſtle, I am afraid
of you leſt I have ſpent all my labor in vain, leſt I have been
a burning and ſhining lamp to no purpoſe: and truly there's
no people of which there can be leſs hope that the Miniſtry of
the Word ſhould work ſayingly upon, than thoſe people that
are ſet upon old cuſtoms in the worſhip of God, as wines upon
their lees: and till the Lord be pleaſed to take off your hearts
from old cuſtoms in the ſervice and worſhip of God, there's a
plain demonſtration that the preaching of the Goſpel hath not
prevailed with your hearts, for you do not live as becomes the
Goſpel: That which becomes the Goſpel it is worſhiping God
only in a ſpiritual way, the conſecrating of your ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
and all you have to the worſhip of God, in making them
to be an holy ſacrifice to God, and that according to the rules
of the Goſpel, <hi>which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi> And that's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particular that the Goſpel teaches: And therefore to live
as becomes the Goſpel is, to worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
               <p>The tenth thing that I ſhall further add of what the Goſpel
holds forth to us, and that is of ſuch conſequence that I ſhall a
little inſiſt upon it, that is, <hi>The near relation that we are in to God
and Chriſt, and ſpiritual union with him.</hi> This is opened in the
Goſpel more fully than ever it was before. The relation to
God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God as a Father, and Beleevers as Children, yea, and
as Children of age; for though in the Law, it's true, we find
that God was there a Father, and <hi>Ephraim</hi> was his deer ſon:
But you ſhall find in the 3. of <hi>Galatians,</hi> That now we are as
<hi>Children of age;</hi> whereas Beleevers in the time of the Law were
under age. Now you know any of your children when they
come to be of age, and to live to themſelves, and out of their
Apprentiſhips, then their lives are after another manner than
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29998:57"/>
when they were little children in their non-age, now they come
to have ſtocks in their hands, to trade for themſelves, and not to
be any more as ſervants; a child before he comes of age is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Tutors and Governors in the family, but when he comes to
yeers of diſcretion, then he lives like a man, and commands ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the family, and is ſerviceable to none, but his father and
mother. So we ſhould live as becomes children of age, that is,
manifeſting in our Converſations a ſtaiedneſs, wiſdom, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and now to live more above the things of this world than
before we did, as children of age.</p>
               <p>And for the union we have with God, that is, <hi>That the Saints
now are made one with God, and with Chriſt his Son:</hi> In 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 17.
He that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> It's a very ſtrange expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
we are one <hi>Spirit</hi> with God and with Jeſus Chriſt. O what
Converſation becomes this, that we ſhould be principled and
acted with the ſame Spirit? ſurely ſuch a one as muſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
that we are crowned &amp; graced with the ſame Spirit, that is
Gods Spirit, and the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt his Son; now ſurely
that muſt needs be a very holy ſpiritual Converſation. 1 <hi>Cor.
3. 16. Yea, the Spirit of God dwelleth in you</hi> (ſaith the text) and
2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be
their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi> See the neer union that we
have with God that the Goſpel holds forth to us. Yea and there
is another phraſe which is very remarkable, That as the Spirit
of God is in Beleevers, ſo Beleevers are in the Spirit: <hi>Gal. 5. 25.
If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit</hi> (ſaith the text.)
The Spirit lives in us, and we live in the Spirit, what Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
muſt there needs be here then? Oh let us walk, not in a
fleſhly way, to ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh, but in the Spirit, the
fruits that do become the Spirit of God: You ſhall ſee them in
this 5. of <hi>Gal.</hi> 22. verſ. &amp;c. <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit, is love, joy,
peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance,
againſt ſuch there is no Law. And they that are Chriſts, have crucified
the fleſh with the affections and luſts of it.</hi> If we walk in the Spirit,
then here's the fruit of the Spirit; Would you have your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
ſuch as becomes the Goſpel, then mark but theſe three
phraſes.</p>
               <p>1. The Spirit of God is in you, in a conſtant way taking up
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29998:58"/>
his habitation and reſidence in your boſoms.</p>
               <p>2. You live in the very Spirit, as in the proper element of a
Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>3. You are one Spirit with God. Put theſe three, and Oh
now, how unbeſeeming to theſe three expreſſions (that we have
in the Goſpel and no where elſe) is it for profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
ſo ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh? Oh how unſutable are fleſhly
luſts to a ſpiritual man? Oh take heed of this for ever you that
make profeſſion of the Goſpel, do not wallow in the mire of
uncleanneſs, do not give liberty to the luſts of the fleſh, but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the luſts of the fleſh and the deeds thereof, for you are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſo neer to God himſelf, ye live in God too: <hi>Col. 3. 3. Your
life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> It's a very tranſcendent phraſe that
the Saints do live in God; you do not only live in the aire, and
breath in the aire, but while you live here in the world you
live in God, Oh the wonderful myſtery of the Goſpel! and the
high things that are held forth in the Goſpel, That Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is in us, and we are in the Spirit, and we are the ſame Spirit
with God, yea, and we live in God; Oh then what a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
ſhould be ſutable to theſe things; ſeeing theſe things are
thus, what manner of perſons ought we to be? Yea, and there
is another expreſſion and that's more full than any of theſe, and
that's in the prayer of Chriſt, in the 17. of <hi>John, 21. That they
all may be one, as Thou Father art in Me, and I in Thee, that they alſo
may be one in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> The Goſpel diſcovers this union, for the
Saints to be one with the Father and Son, as the Father and Son
are one; now thoſe that are joyned ſo neer to God, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
had need be holy, and blameleſs, witneſſing the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of that God that they are ſo neer related to. I remember in
handling of that point in <hi>drawing nigh to God in his Worſhip:</hi>
There we ſhewed what holineſs is required in thoſe that are ſo
nigh to God; but thoſe that are one with God, and in God
Oh how much of God, of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſhine forth by
their lives in the faces of others? Reade theſe ſcriptures and by
faith make them real to your ſouls, and then let your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
tell you what Converſations is required of you: If you be
a Beleever, this is ſo: Charge your ſouls with this, when any
temptation to evil comes; What, is it fit for ſuch a one as I to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29998:58"/>
live thus, who have the Spirit of God dwelling in me, yea and
I dwelling in the Spirit of God, and joyned ſo as to be one ſpirit
with God, yea and to live in God, and to be one with God, as
the Father and the Son is one? and is this converſation ſuch as
beſeems one that is raiſed to ſuch a height of honor as this is?
Chriſtians, remember this, it wil be a mighty help to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Converſations, to put you on to ſhine before men in a holy
Converſation, to walk in the Spirit, conſidering the near union
we have with God; we ſhould never have known theſe things
had we not had them revealed to us by the Goſpel. Oh this
glorious Goſpel that hath revealed ſuch glorious things to us
as this is.</p>
               <p>And then, <hi>Our relation and our union with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> You
know the Scripture makes Chriſt ſometimes to be the <hi>Root,</hi> and
we the <hi>Branches,</hi> therefore we are to bring forth fruit, ſeeing
that we are Branches in Him that is the Root: Bring forth fruit
ſutable to the Sap. You that bring forth ſowr grapes, grapes
of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> that have bitter tart ſpirits, and live in any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and ſinful way: Is this the Sap that is ſutable to the Root?
You are graffed into Jeſus Chriſt, and not into a Crab-ſtock:
And do you receive this Sap from the Root? Oh you are a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
to the Root you grow upon. <hi>I am the true Vine</hi> (ſaith
Chriſt,) <hi>and every Branch in me beareth fruit, and my Father purgeth
it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould ſo live in
their Converſations as to manifeſt the fulneſs of the ſap and
juyce that there is in the Root, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; it's not
enough here and there to have a leaf, and a grape or two, but
full ripe cluſters of grapes becomes thoſe that grow upon ſuch a
fruitful Root.</p>
               <p>And then you know, <hi>Chriſt is the Head, and we the Members.</hi>
Then do not diſhonor your Head: When there is a temptation
comes to any ſin, but will not this be a diſhonor to my Head?
do I receive ſuch a ſpirit from the Head to act after ſuch a ſinful
courſe? Oh be not a crown of thorns to your Head Jeſus Chriſt.
Yea, and the Union is very great; for it is not only that we are
Members of Chriſt, and ſo we are in Chriſt; but Chriſt in us:
the Root is not in the Branch, though the Branches be in the
Root: and the Head is not in the Members, though the Head be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29998:59"/>
joyned with the members. But Chriſt is in us, as we are in Him,
and ſo the union is very glorious and myſterious. You com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of weakneſs: But is there not ſtrength in Chriſt? are you
not joyned to Chriſt thus, and a member of Him, and a branch
in Him? what ever infirmities you have which bows you down,
yet there is power enough in Jeſus Chriſt to convay to any, to
enable them to walk in an holy Converſation before the Lord,
to renew their ſtrength as the Eagle: Manifeſt then the vertue
of your Head, from whence all the ſinnews of every members
ſtrength doth ariſe.</p>
               <p>And then, you know the relation we have to Chriſt, <hi>As He
is the Husband, we the Spouſe:</hi> Oh do not diſcredit your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
Any wiſe vertuous Wife would make it a mighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt any evil way; It will diſgrace my Husband; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if her Husband be a publick man in place and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Oh let this be an argument againſt every ſin, even the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearence
of evil, it will be diſhonorable to the Lord Jeſus who is
my Husband, How can I do this wickedneſs againſt my Lord,
and my God, who hath betrothed me to Himſelf, ſo that I am
<hi>bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh.</hi> That's the ſecond thing.</p>
               <p>And then a Third thing that the Goſpel holds forth to us that
we ſhould labor to ſute our Converſations according, is this;
<hi>The near <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that the Saints have one with another.</hi> It's not ſo
revealed any where as in the Goſpel. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5. we are ſaid
there, <hi>to be members one of another, as we are members of Chriſt.</hi> (I
beſeech you obſerve it) ſo we are members one of another.
That Scripture may be in ſtead of all for this, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 4.
the exhortation there to unity; We muſt <hi>endeavor to keep the
unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi> Why? For, <hi>there is</hi> one
<hi>body, and</hi> one <hi>ſpirit, even as ye are called in</hi> one <hi>hope of your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
One <hi>Lord,</hi> one <hi>Faith,</hi> one <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> one <hi>God and Father of
all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> See, here's
ſome <hi>ſeven ones</hi> to be an argument of unity. One body, and
one ſpirit, and called in the hope of one calling, and one
Lord, and one Faith, and one Baptiſm, and one God: Where
have you ſuch a unity demonſtrated but in the Goſpel of peace
and love? And I do not know in all the Book of God where
any one duty is more preſſed than unity. Somewhat we hinted
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29998:59"/>
in ſpeaking of the love of God, which is a great deſign of the
Goſpel to hold forth, and there we ſpake ſomewhat of Love:
But here of the <hi>unity</hi> of the Saints, being ſo neer united into one
thing, the Saints ſhould be one; and certainly it's the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming
thing in the world that can be for Saints to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their affections upon ſome little differences in judgment;
Let me argue with you, What? was the Coat of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſeam, and ſhall the body of Chriſt be rent all to pieces?
Fy for ſhame, the Goſpel of Chriſt is in your hands which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
another leſſon. Next to our ſalvation, the Goſpel intends
the <hi>union</hi> of Saints, &amp; there's nothing preſt more ſtrongly in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
leaf of it, and it's here in my very text that makes me to ſpeak
to this; for mark the very words that follow in this of my text,
<hi>Phil. 1. 27. Only let your Converſation be as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you ſhould ſay, Wherein ſhould we walk ſo? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
doth anſwer then, <hi>That ye ſtand faſt in one ſpirit, with one
mind, ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel.</hi> Mark, <hi>ſtriving
together,</hi> he would have the Saints to be ſtrivers: I but ſtrivers
for what? Not for their own will and humors, and opinions,
and fancies, and cuſtoms, and traditions which are out of date;
But ſtrivers for the <hi>faith,</hi> for the <hi>faith of the Goſpel,</hi> for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>faith;</hi> and they ſhould labor to joyn all their ſtrength
together (both ſhoulders and hearts:) There's a great deal of
ſtriving now, Profeſſors of the Goſpel they ſtrive aſunder; but
the holy Ghoſt would have us ſtrive together; and this is as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Goſpel (ſaith the text:) The Apoſtle here doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in this particular above all others, that to live as it
becomes the Goſpel, it is to <hi>ſtand faſt,</hi> with one Spirit, with one
mind, ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel. Oh how
unbecoming the Goſpel is the waies and lives of moſt Chriſtians
now!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> You will ſay, From whence are theſe ſad diviſions and
riſings up of hearts amongſt the Tribes, ſo that one thinks that
he hath the truth, and another judgeth that he alone is in the
right way?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I beſeech you therefore, becauſe it's ſo fully inſtanced in
the very words of the Text, that the Apoſtle inſtances in this
particular, give me leave to ſpeak of it in a few words, certainly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29998:60"/>
his meaning is not (when he ſaith, that you ſhall be of one
ſpirit, and of one mind,) that men ſhould give up their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and conſciences to the opinions of other men, that others
(according to their power) may again lord it over us and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave
our ſelves, to draw in their yokes, to grind in their mills,
and plow with their aſſes, yea that were againſt other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
No, but the meaning is this, That we ſhould labor to find
out what is truth, ſearch for it as for ſilver, and go according
to what light we have, but yet ſo, though we ſhould differ, to
<hi>keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace,</hi> and joyn in al things
that we can, and walk ſo lovingly, that it may appear, that if
there be difference, it is meerly that which conſcience makes,
becauſe we dare not deny what we are perſwaded in conſcience
is a truth: We cannot put out the convincing light of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Lord which is ſet up within us, yet we can live in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and peace and be uſeful one to another, communicating our
gifts, and graces, comforts and experiences one to another as
it becomes Chriſtians. And indeed it is a greater honor to the
Goſpel, for men though they do differ in their judgments, yet
if they can keep <hi>the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace,</hi> I ſay, it's
a great honor to the Goſpel than if they were all of the ſame
mind. You know the <hi>Turks</hi> they are al of one mind, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay ſo of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet they have a chain to keep them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
We read of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that when it was darkneſs
among them, they ſat ſtill and kept cloſe together, but when
it came to be light, every man went about his own buſineſs: ſo
when light doth begin to break forth, and there's liberty given
to ſearch into truths; we cannot imagin that at the very firſt
men ſhould be of the ſame judgment, except they will give up
their conſciences and ſacrifice their reaſon one to another, but
though they be not of one judgement, yet there may be kept a
bleſſed unity of affection, there may be a golden girdle clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
about their loins: yea and of practice ſo far as men can
with peace of conſcience and joy in the holy Ghoſt, ſo as not
to ſin againſt conſcience and light; Unity of affection and
practice ſhould be endeavored to the utmoſt, and it is a moſt
Chriſtian thing ſo to do; and certainly this ſhould be ſtudied
and endeavored by us, as much as lieth in us. Me thinks
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29998:60"/>
when I reade over the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> or any part of the new
Teſtament, I ſee nothing more preſſed than this (next to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Jeſus Chriſt,) and therefore it ſhould be the care of
Chriſtians. And as it ought to be the care of Chriſtians to ſtudy
unity and peace; ſo I beſeech you that ſmall differences may
not be abuſed and heightned ſo far, as becauſe ſome do differ
from others, that therefore preſently (if they be the leaſt part
eſpecially) all the odium ſhould be caſt upon them, though
they can appeal to God that they do endeavour to know the
mind of God, and to keep unity ſo far as they can without ſin.
And we ſhall ſee that the Scripture doth never lay the ſin of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
upon any, except thoſe that do lay it upon them are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſay, that thoſe make diviſion from ſome corrupt end or
other of their own: and then it charges them deeply; as that
place is moſt famous that you have in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17, 18. (and I
verily perſwade my ſelf that there is many of your that hear this
text very much abuſed) <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren, mark thoſe
which cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have
learned, and avoid them.</hi> This is the great place againſt that ſin
which we call ſchiſm, for ſchiſm is nothing but a rending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,
<hi>That cauſe diviſion,</hi> [ſchiſm] <hi>contrary to the doctrine which
ye have learned and avoid them.</hi> Now you know the ſin of ſchiſm
was caſt by the Popiſh Biſhops heretofore upon all that would
not be of their minds in any ceremonies and will-worſhip, and
becauſe many would not come up to the Rails, and ſubmit to
receive the Lords Supper by kneeling in that way that it was
then admiſtred by our Prelatical Prieſts, therefore they were
termed ſchiſmaticks: And ſo at this day, many cry out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
if ſo be they cannot ſwallow Camels with them, if ſo be
they differ in ſome things wherein they cannot joyn with them
becauſe it would be ſin and a ſnare to them, they preſently ſay
they are guilty of ſchiſm, and faction (There is a great deal of
taking Gods Name in vain in this thing;) yet they do not tell
you what the true nature of ſchiſm is, but if any perſons joyn
not with the greater part (which is uſually leaſt conſcientious)
that's ſchiſm in an high degree; this is not that that becomes
the Goſpel, preſently to judg all that differ from us. But mark
the next words and there the Apoſtle tells what ſchiſm is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:29998:61"/>
Firſt, it muſt be <hi>contrary to ſound doctrine,</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>They
that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly, and
by good words, and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple:</hi> The
Apoſtle could take it upon his conſcience by ſeeing the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of theſe men, that the cauſe why they differed from others
it was, not out of tenderneſs of conſcience and deſire to know
the mind of God, but by their behavior he ſaw enough to ſatisfie
his conſcience, their Converſation gave their profeſſion the
lye; and therefore (ſaith he) <hi>avoid ſuch.</hi> So I confeſs, if
men can take it upon their conſciences, as they would anſwer
to Jeſus Chriſt; I ſee ſuch and ſuch men to differ thus; but I can
appeal to Chriſt in it, that upon theſe and theſe grounds I am
perſwaded it is not out of tenderneſs of conſcience, and I am
verily perſwaded that there is no willingneſs in them to know
the mind of Chriſt, but it is to ſerve their own carnal ends,
and purpoſes. I confeſs if we can take this upon our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
as we will anſwer it to Jeſus Chriſt, that there are ſuch
and ſuch grounds upon which we beleeve Chriſt wil ſo account,
that ſuch men do not differ through their tenderneſs, but
from their own carnal ends, theſe men may be accounted ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks:
This is the ſin of ſchiſm, when through want of love
and to ſerve their own by-ends men ſhall rend one from another:
But now is it poſſible to think that the holy Ghoſt ſhould lay
ſo great a load (as to command the Saints to avoid ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
upon men whoſe conſciences are upright with God, ſure
when a man ſhall be able to appeal to God, and ſay, Lord,
thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that it is the deſire of my
ſoul to know thy will, and I ſearch for it, and pray for it, and
it is the affliction of my ſoul that I differ in any thing from my
brethren that I ſee to be godly, and if I knew thy mind, thou
knoweſt I would quickly cloſe with them, and account it the
greateſt happineſs that can befall me in this life to ſhake hands
with them in ſuch and ſuch particulars; But thou haſt laid this
charge upon me, that I muſt do what I do out of faith, and I
ſhould ſin againſt that rule of thine if I ſhould yeeld to that that
I ſee no footing for out of thy Word. Now if a ſoul ſhould make
this moan to Jeſus Chriſt, do you think that Chriſt would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
this man a ſchiſmatick? and that he muſt be avoided and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29998:61"/>
perſecuted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a ſchiſmatick? no certainly there's a great miſtake
in this, and this is meerly for want of charity; and that which
the holy Ghoſt is ſo bitter againſt is, when men for want of love
to their brethren, and for to ſerve their own baſe ends make
breaches and rents in the Church; judge ſuch now to be guilty
of the ſin of ſchiſm and no other; for that is to break unity, to
judge others guilty of ſchiſm, meerly becauſe they differ from
you, and cannot reade by your ſpectacles, theſe extreams that I
have ſpoken of are waies that are very much unbeſeeming the
Goſpel of Chriſt, for men our of baſe ends to break unity, to
rend from the Saints; or otherwiſe becauſe men joyn not with
you in every thing you deſire, therefore preſently to put ſuch a
brand upon them, as to ſtigmatize them for ſchiſmaticks, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this unchriſtian like nicknaming the children of God main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the breach and widens it more and more; whereas the
Converſation that becomes the Goſpel is to ſtudy, to find out
the truth. And do I ſee Learned and Godly men of another
judgment? Let me pray more unto the Father of lights for the
Spirit of revelation: It may be I may miſtake; If I be miſtaken,
Lord diſcover it, let me not go on in the waies of darkneſs, but
take away the ſcales from my underſtanding, that I may ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the deep things of God and his Goſpel; And therefore others
that they differ from ſhould tender theſe as brethren, and look
upon them and ſee, are they not conſciencious in all their other
waies? Can I be able to find any fault with them in their lives
and Converſations? It may be it's their miſtake, then let me
pray for them and labor to help them, and tender them all I
can, it may be God will reveal his mind to them more fully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward:
Now in what we have attained let us walk, and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be otherwiſe minded God will reveal his mind to them, and
this carriage ſhould be in Chriſtians one towards another, that
differ one from another, and this is a Converſation becoming
the Goſpel: But when one differs from another, for to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling
ſpeeches, and names of diſgrace, and to caſt dirt one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another, this is exceeding unbecoming the Goſpel, yea,
if the Heathens were amongſt us, they would even loath the
Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt to ſee the carriage of Chriſtians that there
are at this day amongſt us: But the Converſation that becomes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29998:62"/>
the Goſpel of Chriſt, is that which manifeſts unity, to live in
unity one with another, for the Goſpel preacheth to us the
greateſt unity of Chriſtians that poſſibly can be between man
and man.</p>
               <p>Again, The Goſpel holds forth this, <hi>The glorious happineſs of
the Saints in Heaven.</hi> You cannot find much of that in the Law,
in all the old Teſtament you find but little of eternal life, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſcover three texts from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the end of <hi>Malachi</hi> that
doth cleerly hold forth eternal life; it's true, our forefathers
(no queſtion) in the old Teſtament did know that there was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life, and ſome Scriptures there are that do tend that way;
but I beleeve there's none of you can give many texts from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi>
to <hi>Malachi</hi> that do expreſly hold forth the Glory of the
Saints in Heaven. Now the Goſpel that holds it forth in 2 <hi>Tim.
1.</hi> 10. ſaith the Apoſtle there (ſpeaking of the glory of the Saints
and immortality) in the 9. ver. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us
with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his
own purpoſe and grace, which he hath givin us in Chriſt Jeſus before
the world began: But is now made manifeſt by the appearance of our
Savior Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life
and immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> How comes life and
immortality to be brought to light through the Goſpel? Did
not our forefathers know of life and immortality before? Yes,
but very darkly, and ſome of the eminent ones knew but little
of that exceeding riches of glory and happineſs the Saints ſhall
be crowned with in Heaven, life and immortality is brought to
light through the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>In former times was it known (till Chriſt came in the fleſh)
that the happineſs of the Saints ſhould be in the viſion of God,
in ſtanding before the face of God, and beholding him in glory
in Heaven?</p>
               <p>Did they know the communion that the Saints ſhall have w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
God, and with Jeſus Chriſt in his bodily preſence in glory?</p>
               <p>Did they underſtand the fruition of God, and Gods being
all in all to the Saints, as he ſhal be in the communication of all
fulneſs of good?</p>
               <p>Did they underſtand the inheritance of the Saints which is in
light?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:29998:62"/>
Did they know that the Saints were not only Heirs, but Co-heirs
with Jeſus Chriſt? Theſe things are known only in the
Goſpel, the glorious reward of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Did they in the time of the Law, know that theſe bodies of
ours ſhould be made more glorious than the Sun in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
This the Goſpel tels us, that theſe lumps of clay which
we carry now about with us, ſhall be one day more glorious
than the Sun ſhining in his luſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Did they know that our bodies ſhould be made like to the
glorious body of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> That it is ſown in weakneſs; but it
is raiſed in power; ſown in diſhonor, but raiſed in glory; ſown a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
body, but ſhould riſe a ſpiritual body; and ſown in corruption, and
ſhould be raiſed in incorruption? <hi>Certainly theſe things were very
little known to the forefathers, (if known at all.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe things were the great Counſels of God, that were
kept hid from all eternity, only the Lord did reſerve the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
thereof to the coming of his Son, that was the time for
opening of Heaven, Heaven was ſhut, and there was little ſeen
of the glory thereof till Chriſt was incarnate in the fleſh, the
Lord (I ſay) reſerved the opening of the Gates of Heaven, and
the ſhewing of the glory of it to the Saints till the coming of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. Chriſt now tels us of manſions that He is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to prepare for us, and when our earthly tabernacle is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
we have a building, not made with hands, but eternal
in the Heavens. Oh now my brethren, how ought we to live?
It's the argument of the Apoſtle when he ſpeaks but of the great
chang in the Church here (ſpeaking of new Heavens and a new
Earth) it's meant of the ſtate of the Church that it ſhall be in
even here; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd ſaith he, <hi>What manner of perſons ought we to be in
all holineſs and godly converſation?</hi> But then when we hear of the
higheſt Heavens, <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, the Paradiſe, the Saints ſhall
be living with Chriſt, wrapt up to the third Heavens (as the
Apoſtle was:) Oh what manner of perſons ought we to be in
all godlineſs and holy Converſation?</p>
               <p>Now if you ſhould ask me, what Converſation is becoming
the Goſpel? I would tell you, that which we have in the third
Chap. of this Epiſtle; <hi>For our Converſation is in Heaven.</hi> Upon
what ground is it? <hi>from whence alſo we look for the Savior, the Lord
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29998:63"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall chang our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like
to His glorious body.</hi> We look (ſaith he) for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
from Heaven, who ſhall put forth ſuch a power as ſhall change
our vile bodies, that they may be faſhioned like unto His glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
body; therefore our Converſation is in Heaven. Do you
expect that this fleſh of yours ſhould be made like the Sun in the
Heavens, like the glorious body of Jeſus Chriſt? Oh then do
not abuſe your fleſh to ſin, make not proviſion for the fleſh to
ſatisfie the luſts thereof, let no member of your body be a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
of unrighteouſneſs to ſin againſt God withal: when you
are tempted to any bodily ſin, ſtop your ſelves with this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
Shall I ſin againſt God with this body of mine that I
beleeve ſhall one day be more glorious than the Sun in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
which ere long will be made like to the glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Jeſus Chriſt? Have we the hopes and promiſes of ſuch an
inheritance in Heaven? Oh then, let not only our thoughts be
there, but our Converſation, our Trading, our only buſineſs be
there alſo; Oh let it appear that we have heavenly hearts, and
ſpiritual carriages, that we live as it becomes thoſe that hope
within a few daies, or months, to be poſſeſt with the glory of
Heaven which Chriſt hath prepared for us; ſuch ſhould our
Converſations be, heavenly Converſations, ſhining with the
light of the glory of Heaven upon us, Heaven ſhould appear in
our Converſations now, ſo that they who look upon us and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with us, may truly judg, theſe are the Citizens of the new
Jeruſalem, free Denizons of Heaven, they ſpeak the very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of <hi>Canaan</hi> already, and ere long they wil be poſſeſt of that
promiſed Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I'le conclude all now with one Scripture, in</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 3. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as ye are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt miniſtred
by us, written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not
in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly tables of the heart. <hi>Mark; the Apoſtle
here tels the</hi> Corinthians <hi>that they are manifeſtly declared to be
the Epiſtle of Chriſt: obſerve the text, the People of God, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. Epiſtle of Chriſt <hi>(you wil ſay)</hi> what's the meaning of that?
or what uſe can you make of that to your point?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:29998:63"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning of it is this, That Chriſt doth by them,
or in them, write an Epiſtle to the world, to declare to the
world His mind and His will; 'tis as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay,
You that are beleevers, know that Chriſt makes uſe of you to
declare to the world, what He is, what His glory is, you are
His Epiſtle; Chriſt ſends by you the knowledge of Himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, ſo that when the world looks upon you, they that
run may reade in your lives and Converſations, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
the very Epiſtle of Chriſt (tranſcribed to the life) whereby
He declares to the world His excellencies and His glory in live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Characters. Now my brethren, this ſhould be the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of all Saints, (that is) They ſhould in their lives be the
Epiſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, there ſhould be (as it were) fairly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in their lives the graces of Jeſus Chriſt, the myſteries of the
Goſpel, the deep things of God. Would you know what
Chriſts mind is? and what the excellencies of Chriſt are, and of
the Goſpel? Reade it in the Saints, in their lives, ſee their waies
and you may know much of the mind of Chriſt in them, you
that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tel a letter in the book, yet you may read this Epiſtle,
you may reade the Epiſtle that Jeſus Chriſt ſends to the world,
to convince the world: Now the Epiſtle that Chriſt ſends to the
world, is not only in His Word (there indeed is a great Epiſtle
that Chriſt hath ſent, for the Scripture is no other, but as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cals it, the Epiſtle of God to the world, God ſends His Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the world) but the Saints are Chriſts Epiſtle likewiſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Chriſts mind is to be read and known; then let your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
be ſuch, as that you may be a full Epiſtle of Chriſt to
the whole world, that all the world may reade what Chriſt is
in you, take heed of blotting and blurring this Epiſtle. If there
be a Letter ſent from a great man, if a Prince or a King ſend a
Letter, it uſes to come fairly written, and if thoſe that ſhould
bring it, ſhould all beſmeer it, and blot the Letter ſo as it could
not be read, it would be taken exceeding ill. So, you that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
your ſelves to be Chriſtians, you do not <hi>bring</hi> the Letter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but you <hi>are</hi> the Letter, therfore do not blot &amp; blur this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of Chriſt, but keep it fair, that all with whom you converſe,
all in the family may every day reade ſomewhat of the mind of
Jeſus Chriſt in your Converſations, that ſo you may be the glory
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29998:64"/>
of Chriſt, as in that ſcripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. it is ſaid of <hi>Titus</hi> and
other fellow-helpers, That <hi>they were the Meſſengers of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and the glory of Chriſt.</hi> Oh! this all Profeſſors of Religion
ſhould endeavor to be, <hi>the glory of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that whereſoever
they live, all might ſee the glory of Jeſus Chriſt held forth there;

That as Chriſtians are to ſanctifie the Name

their lives and Converſations muſt be
ſuch as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>[worthy]</hi>
of the Goſpel of Chriſt, (for ſo I told you the

               <p>What Converſation is that which becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I'le only add one Scriptare more to the laſt thing I named,

                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:29998:64"/>
That the revealing of the glory of Heaven in the Goſpel
ſhould work mightily upon our hearts to labor for a Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſutable thereunto. In <hi>Titus, 2. 11, 12, 13. For the grace of
God</hi> (ſaith he, that's the Goſpel) <hi>that bringeth ſalvation, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to all men:</hi> (What doth it teach us?) <hi>That denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly
in this preſent world.</hi> We have made uſe of this Scripture thus
far already; but that which I quote it for, is the refference of
this to the next words, <hi>Looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here's
a Scripture that if ever the Lord did enlighten us in the
things of the Goſpel, that we have been brought to beleeve
it's a Scripture that would mightily work upon our hearts
to live godlily and holily: <hi>The grace of God that bringeth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
what doth it teach us? Not to be licentious, and vain, and
ſlight, and bold in our ſinful courſes; but teaching us that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly,
righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world. Mark, it is not
enough to live <hi>ſoberly,</hi> not to be a drunkard, to live <hi>righteouſly,</hi>
that is, not to wrong any body, many think that's enough:
But mark, indeed the light of nature (as I told you) would teach
us that; but now the grace of God that bringeth Salvation
teacheth us more, <hi>To deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to
live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, and that in this preſent world:</hi>
though we live in the midſt of a wicked tempting world, yet to
live godly. And what's the great argument in the Goſpel to
cauſe us to live godly in this preſent world? <hi>Looking for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
hope:</hi> Oh we look for a bleſſed hope that the Goſpel reveals,
Oh we did not underſtand this hope, this bleſſed hope till the
Goſpel was preached to us; but ſince we apprehend a bleſſed
hope, the holy Ghoſt hath raiſed in our hearts a bleſſed hope
of glorious things: What glorious things? Looking for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
hope, and glorious appearing of the great God, and our
Savior Jeſus Chriſt. We have ſome little glimps of the great
God when we ſet forth to Sea, and launce into the deeps, we ſee
the glory of the great God, who rideth upon the wings of the
wind, and whom both the Winds and the Seas obey: Oh but
we look for another manner of the glorious appearing of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29998:65"/>
great God than ever yet hath appeared. I beſeech you conſider
of this text, God did never appear great and glorious in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of what he will appear, and bleſſed are thoſe whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
ſhall be ſuch, that can look upon the face of this great
God with joy when He ſhall appear in glory; we look for this
bleſſed hope, and then when this great God ſhall appear in His
glory, then we ſhall have our bleſſed hope, and this teaches us
to deny all ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, the knowledge of
this; Oh do you look to be ſaved? have you a bleſſed hope,
and do you expect the appearing of the great God in glory?
hath the Goſpel revealed theſe things unto you? O let this that
the Goſpel reveals teach us to deny all ungodlineſs, and all
worldy luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this
preſent world.</p>
               <p>But there are yet ſome other things that the Goſpel holds
forth that are very remarkable, for the furtherance of our godly
Converſation in this world, and if we would live as becomes
the Goſpel, we muſt have a right underſtanding of theſe things,
or elſe we ſhall never ſute our ſelves to the Goſpel, except we do
therby apprehend theſe great points that are publiſhed to us in
and by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>As now, this is a great point, <hi>That the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt
is not of this world.</hi> The Goſpel holds forth this to us, that Jeſus
Chriſt the Son of God, having taken our nature upon him, he is
a great King, He hath a Kingdom, but He hath a Kingdom that
is not of this world, neither is Chriſt of this world, nor His
Kingdom of this world, nor the Saints, thoſe that are the
Subjects of His Kingdom are not of this world; the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of this would much help us in our Converſations, and
a Converſation beſeeming this would much honor the Goſpel.
Firſt, We ſhall ſhew how the Goſpel holds forth this, That the
Kingdom of Chriſt is not in this world, mark thoſe Scriptures
in <hi>John, 18. 36. Jeſus anſwered, My Kingdom is not of this
world: if my Kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants
fight that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
not from hence.</hi> Therefore (as if he ſhould ſay) you muſt
not wonder or think much that I am thus apprehended, and
delivered up to men, that they do with me what they pleaſe;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29998:65"/>
though I be the great King of my Church appointed by my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet my Kingdom is not of this world, and I came not
hither for pomp and glory. The glory of Chriſt in His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
here is Spiritual. Indeed when this world ſhall be at an
end, then Chriſt will appear gloriouſly, though the Scripture
ſpeaks of a world hereafter wherein Chriſt ſhall appear glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
but whether perſonally or otherwiſe that we ſpeak not
of: But that Chriſt ſhall appear a glorious King even in the
world, not this world, but upon the earth, and yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaks of that as another world, a new Heaven, and a new
Earth, but for the preſent; for that that the Scripture cals this
world, we muſt not expect a pompous and glorious Kingdom
till ther ebe a new world, till there be new heavens, and a new
earth, this the Goſpel holds forth. Whereas the people of the
Jews they thought as ſoon as the Meſſias came, He preſently
ſhould be an outward Monarch, in outward pomp and glory;
no ſaith Chriſt, this world muſt paſs away firſt, I muſt come
firſt and reign ſpiritually in another way, and for my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
there is a time for the glory of it to appear when another
world ſhall come, but while this world laſts, never expect any
ſuch outward pomp and glory in the way of my Kingdom, I
have a Kingdom indeed here in this world, but it is not of this
world, I have a Kingdom wherein I reign ſpiritually in the
hearts of my people, there I have ſet up my Throne, and therein
I have writ my Laws by which I guide and order all things for
their eternal ſalvation, but my Kingdom is not of this world:
yea and he ſaith likewiſe in <hi>John, 8. 23. I am not of this world nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And <hi>John,</hi> 15. 19. (for <hi>John</hi> that beloved Diſciple who
lay in the boſom of Chriſt he knew much of the mind and
heart of Chriſt, and was much inſtructed in this myſtery, and
indeed none of thoſe that did converſe with Chriſt knew more
of the boſom of Chriſt than <hi>John</hi> did) <hi>If ye were of the world, the
world would love his own: but becauſe ye are not of the world, but
I have choſen you out of the world.</hi> So that as Chriſt is not of the
world ſo the Saints are not of the world: in the 17. of <hi>John,
14. I have given them thy Word, and the world hath hated them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Mark,
as I am not of the world, ſo they are not of the world: thus
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29998:66"/>
Scripture is cleer, that neither Chriſt nor his Kingdom is of
this world; and therefore beleevers are not of this world.
And hence then, what Converſation becomes this Goſpel of
Chriſt? even a Converſation ſequeſtred from the things of this
world, a Converſation that ſhall manifeſt the hearts being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off and diſingaged from ſublunary comforts and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations,
a Converſation which proves that the ſoul ſeeks
not great things for its-ſelf here below, but is fully content
with a morſel of bread and a cup of cold water, though others
fare deliciouſly every day; ſo beleevers ſhould manifeſt in their
Converſations that they do not much paſs or care how things
go in this world, becauſe Chriſt is not of this world, and the
Kingdom of Chriſt in which they make account their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to be involved, that is not of the world, yea they are men
redeemed from this preſent world; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. it is ſaid, <hi>That by
Chriſt we came to be redeemed from this preſent evil world;</hi> (it's a very
remarkable Scripture) <hi>who gave himſelf for our ſins;</hi> (to what
end?) <hi>That he might deliver us from this preſent evil world, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the will of God, and our Father.</hi> I beſeech you obſerve this
text, Chriſt gave Himſelf to deliver us from our ſins, that we
might not periſh eternally: And was that all? No, That He
might deliver us from this preſent evil world; I do not know a
more forcible text in all the Book of God to take off the hearts
of thoſe that profeſs the Goſpel from the world, ſo as they
ſhould not whine and murmur at the loſs of every little thing
in the world, nor be ſolicitouſly careful for the things of this
life, nor be offended though the men of the world prevail in the
world, and have the upper hand, and carry things in a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way, let them go on in all their pagentry and greatneſs: but
if thou beeſt one that belongſt to Chriſt, know that Chriſt hath
laid down his life to purchaſe this for thee, to deliver thee from
this world; Now, is Chriſt blood laid down to purchaſe this?
and yet wilt thou have thy heart glewed to the ground, and
wholly place thy contentment in the earth, and ſeek for thy
happineſs here in the duſt? Oh get up thy heart then from all
theſe things, and make it appear by thy Converſation that thou
art one that by the vertue of the death of Jeſus Chriſt art delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from this world, and therefore though thou haſt not ſuch a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29998:66"/>
portion in worldly goods as other men have, never envy them,
for Chriſt hath ranſomed you from the world, there's another
kingdom that thou haſt thy portion and intereſt in, Chriſt hath
made us Kings and Prieſts to his Father, and hath made us heirs
and co-heirs of that Kingdom that His Father hath given Him,
yea, and that He Himſelf hath purchaſed; and ſo you muſt in
your Converſations make it appear, that you do ſee another
kingdom beyond this kingdom of the world that you are made
partakers of, wherein you ſhall reign with Chriſt for ever: now
this Converſation doth beſeem the Goſpel. And therefore you
ſhal find it in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> about the 37. verſ. Chriſt ſhews
what kind of Converſation He would have in thoſe that once
come to beleeve in Him, (ſaith He) <hi>He that loveth father or mother
more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth ſon or daughter
more than me, is not worthy of me: And he that taketh not up his croſs
and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life
ſhall loſe it; and he that loſeth his life for my ſake, ſhall find it.</hi> Here
he ſhews what it is that would make the ſoul worthy of Chriſt
in a Goſpel ſenſe. If our hearts be taken off from father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and thoſe comforts &amp; relations that are the deareſt in the
world, brother, or ſiſter, or ſon, or daughter; not to take off our
natural affection, but to take off our hearts ſo, as they ſhould
not be hinderances of us in ſpiritual things, that our main af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
ſhould flow forth after ſpiritual things; then we come
to be worthy of Chriſt: then the other converſation is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Chriſt. Didſt thou ever know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and
the way of His Kingdom? Then why is thy heart ſet upon the
world as the hearts of other men that are ſtrangers to Jeſus
Chriſt? In <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 3. (when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe things
that moſt men in the world are greedy after) <hi>But fornication,
and all uncleaneſs, or covetouſneſs, let it not be once named among you,
as becometh Saints.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Saints, thoſe that know
Jeſus Chriſt, and the way of His Kingdom, for them to have
their hearts either ſet upon bodily luſts, or covetouſneſs, the
things of this world, it doth not becom them, it is not a Goſpel
Converſation becoming Saints; a heart greedy of the things of
this world, and wallowing in the luſts of this world, Oh 'tis
unbeſeeming Saints! thoſe that do profeſs the Goſpel of Chriſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29998:67"/>
that ſhews unto us that the Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this
world.</p>
               <p>Again, Another great point that the Goſpel holds forth to
us, is this, <hi>The great difference or the change that it makes in the eſtate
of a man or woman when once it prevails with him:</hi> then the great
difference is made in him, from what he was before, and from
other men; this is held forth in the Goſpel and no where elſe:
I ſay the wonderful change that the Goſpel makes in men when
once it comes to work upon their hearts in the evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the Spirit, and the great difference between their
eſtates before and what now is, and between them and other
men; I put theſe two together,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The great change that the Goſpel makes in the hearts of
men from what there was before the Goſpel came. You know
the Scripture in propheſying of the times of the Goſpel ſaith,
<hi>That the Wolf ſhall eat with the Lamb, and the Lyon with the Kid,
and the child ſhall play upon the very hole of the Aſp:</hi> the meaning
is generally carried thus, that when the Goſpel comes it ſhall
change the hearts of men ſo mightily, that though they were
wolviſh before, and cruel; as if you ſhould ſee a Wolf changed
into a Lamb, or as if you ſhould ſee a Lyon changed into a Kid,
you would ſay, this were a mighty change; the Goſpel makes
ſuch a change as this is, they that are in Chriſt are new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
it's a new Creation; ſuppoſe God ſhould make a new
world, what a mighty thing were this! or a new Sun ſhould
be created in the Firmament that never was before, how
would we ſtand and wonder! Thoſe that are in Chriſt are new
creatures, God puts forth a creating power upon them, 2 <hi>Cor.
5. Old things are paſſ'd away, all things are become new</hi> (you know
the Apoſtle ſaith:) and the change that is made, it is called a
new birth, <hi>Except you be born again, you cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, John,</hi> 3. If there were a new ſoul put into one,
or if God ſhould infuſe a rational ſoul into a beaſt, here would
be a mighty change; thou wert a beaſt before, but here is the
ſoul of grace, there's a new birth when the Goſpel comes to
prevail, and to enter in upon an heart, and it's call'd a new
reſurrection; if there ſhould be a voice come from Heaven that
ſhould open all the graves that you have here in the yard, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:29998:67"/>
all the dead bodies ſhould ſtand up and live, what a mighty
change would there be? Such a change doth the Goſpel make
when it conquers a people; indeed the Goſpel may be preached
and little change may be wrought, becauſe the power of the
Goſpel prevails not with their hearts; but when it doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in their hearts there is ſuch a ſtrange change.</p>
               <p>Oh then, What Converſation become this? it muſt be a
Converſation that doth hold forth to the world that there is
ſuch a mighty change wrought in you: Now I appeal to you,
you that make profeſſion of the Goſpel, you know what you
have been heretofore, worldly, and baſe, and carnal, and
ſenſual, and froward, and peeviſh, and prophane men, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unſavory before the Goſpel came to you; now you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that God hath begun to work upon you by the Goſpel,
What change hath it wrought in you? Can thoſe that live
with you ſee your Converſations ſo changed as to make them
ſtand and admire at the work of the Goſpel upon your hearts?
the husband to ſtand and admire at the work of God upon the
heart of the wife as if ſhe were another woman, and ſo the wife
to admire at the grace of God upon the heart of the husband,
as if he were another man; and ſo your children and ſervants
not the ſame that heretofore they were? Oh what honour
would this be to the Goſpel, that in places where it comes to be
preached in power there might appear a change, that becomes
the Goſpel of Chriſt? Certainly if your Converſations be not
ſuch as holds forth a mighty change that God hath wrought
in you, then it is not ſuch as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt: It
may be you are ſomewhat better than heretofore you have been,
as not to be a common drunkard, you ſee that's deſpiſed by
men; Who regards drunken fools, mad-men, very beaſts? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you come to be of more underſtanding, that you will not
be ſo prophane and laſcivious as you were wont to be, but live
ſomewhat better. Oh but this change is not that change which
<hi>holds forth the work of the Goſpel,</hi> for when the Goſpel prevails it
makes the gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>teſt change that ever was made in the world, we
may boldly aſcert this, that ſince the Creation of God in the
firſt ſix daies, there was never ſuch a change made in the world
as the Goſpel makes; and therefore a Converſation becoming
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:29998:68"/>
the Goſpel, muſt be a Converſation that muſt be a changed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
muſt be mightily different from what they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
ſometimes we ſee it ſo through the mercy of God, that
when men and women come to hear the Word in the cleerneſs
and power of it to be revealed, they have ſuch changes, that al
their friends ſtand wondring at them, What ſhall we have of
you now! Oh ſuch have cauſe to anſwer and ſay, Bleſſed be
God it is ſo, it is the Goſpel that hath made ſuch a change in
me. I, this becomes the Goſpel, when it ſhall appear that your
Converſation is ſo changed, ſo holy, and godly, and gracious
now over it was before. But you whoſe lives are not better than
they were before; before you made ſome profeſſion, only your
profeſſion now is greater than it was before, but your lives no
better, know, this is a Converſation that doth no way become
the Goſpel of Chriſt, the Goſpel of Chriſt hath no honor by
this Converſation of yours.</p>
               <p>And then, <hi>The great difference that the Goſpel makes between one
man and another.</hi> As now, thoſe that the Goſpel doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon, the Scripture tels us, they are the children of wrath,
they are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, they are under the curſe of
the Law, they are even enemies to God; this is the condition of
al men before this Scepter of Chriſt conquers their hearts, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wrath, enemies to God, dead in ſins, under the curſe.
But now, when the Goſpel comes to prevail over mens hearts,
then they come to be the Children of the living God, Heirs of
Chriſt, Co-heirs with Him, they come to be partakers of the
life of God, they encreaſe with the encreaſe of God, and their
lives are hid with Chriſt in God, and they come to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to God, to be friends with God, to be at peace with God,
and to inherit bleſſings: Oh the change that the Lord puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the heart and ſtate of the Saints when the Goſpel prevails!
How high are they raiſed above other men? Therefore you muſt
not make other men to be your example in your way, you muſt
not think to live as the world lives, and to ſay, I do as other
men do; the Goſpel makes a mighty difference between your
eſtate and the ſtate of other men, therefore never look to what
other men do, but conſider as God hath made a vaſt difference
between you and other men, ſo let there be a great difference
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:29998:68"/>
between your Converſation and the Converſation of other men.
Now this meditation ſhould have a mighty deal of power to
prevail upon the heart; I beleeve that I have ſuch and ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
beyond other men, and I look for ſuch and ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
above others; now what things I look for beyond others,
I muſt labor to be as much beyond them in holineſs of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
as God hath made me beyond them in ſpiritual priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and ſpiritual mercies; I think ſometimes I would not be in
the condition of ſuch men as are in their natural eſtate for a
world, nay I would not be one our in their eſtates if I might
have ten thouſand worlds, for fear I ſhould die that hour, and
then I ſhould be loſt for ever; Well, hath God made ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference?
then let not my life be like theirs for one hour, nay for
one moment. Oh this meditation (through Gods bleſſing)
would mightily help us in our Converſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Converſation ſhould be ſuch as becomes the Ordinances of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:</hi>
The Word, and Sacraments, they have a great deal more
in them than the Ordinances of the Law; but becauſe I ſpake
of the Goſpels being higher than the Law heretofore, and theſe
things may fall ſomething neer, yet had I time I would ſpeak
a little concerning theſe, and ſhew how we are to hold forth a
Converſation ſutable to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Converſations ſhould be ſutable to the power of the Goſpel:</hi> there
is a great deal of power in the Goſpel; it's call'd the <hi>power
of God unto ſalvation,</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. The very light of
the Goſpel it is a transforming light, it hath a mighty power
in it, the Goſpel it's called, <hi>the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of
God, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 24. it brings a great deal of power with it to
help men againſt ſtrong corruptions, to overcome violent temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
to carry them through in any difficulties: Powerful
corruptions, powerful temptations, powerful difficulties are
overcome by the power of the Goſpel; and therefore it is ſaid
<hi>by faith,</hi> that is, <hi>by faith in the Goſpel,</hi> we overcome the world; the
Goſpel certainly doth not only ſtir in ſome men and women,
ſome wiſhings, and wouldings and faint deſires, but it brings
a power to transforme their hearts. to make a metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
there; when there comes the light of the Goſpel there
comes the light of life together with it; as that Scripture
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29998:69"/>
in <hi>Heb. 10. 32. After ye were illuminated</hi> (that is, by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel)
then he ſpeaks of their great ſufferings, they were willing
to endure any thing for Chriſt; therefore a Converſation that
becomes the Goſpel is ſuch an one as exemplarily demonſtrates
the very power of godlineſs, that men and women ſhould not
be <hi>alwaies learning and never come to the knowledg of the truth,</hi> not
alwaies wiſhing and deſiring, and never come to any power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
reſolutions and determinations, for certainly where the
Goſpel hath the upper hand in a ſoul it doth bring power, but
I do not ſay it brings power ſo as to overcome all our luſts, ſo
as there ſhould be no ſin remaining, for ſo long as we live we
muſt be hungering after a further degree of righteouſneſs and
ſanctification; but certainly when the Goſpel prevails there
comes a great ſtrength; there's the ſtrength of Chriſt put forth,
the Spirit of power (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>We have not received the
ſpirit of fear, but the Spirit of power, of love, and of a ſound mind: be
not therefore aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord.</hi> As if <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> it's true, you meet with many difficulties, but
hath not the Goſpel given you a Spirit of power? There's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of power and reſolution when the Goſpel comes in. <hi>Timothy</hi>
was a poor weakly, ſickly man in his body, and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf
had no bodily preſence with him, a poor contemptible man
in regard of his bodily preſence, but he had a Spirit of power
given him by the Goſpel; ſo we ſhould manifeſt a Spirit of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
that is as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Goſpel of Chriſt is a glorious Goſpel. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 11.
it is call'd there by the title of a glorious Goſpel, <hi>According to the
glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God.</hi> Mark, what a title is here?
the Goſpel is the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God, that is,
the glory of all the Attributes of God doth appear in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
more brightly than they do appear in all the works that God
hath made; There doth appear indeed a great deal of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God in the Heavens, Earth, and Seas, and you have ſeen
much of the glory of God there, but I appeal to you in this, Have
you ſeen more of the glory of God in the Goſpel, than ever you
did in all the works that God hath made? that were a good
argument that you have had a true underſtanding of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and that the Spirit of God hath ſhined into your hearts,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29998:69"/>
if you can ſay, Lord I have ſeen much of thy glory in thy
Works, when I have been abroad in the mighty waters where
Gods paths and foot-ſteps are, Oh the Seas they are thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
creatures, but thy Goſpel that's glorious beyond all, there
do I ſee thine infinite wiſdom, and infinite power, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
juſtice, and infinite mercy, and infinite faithfulneſs, and
the Lord knows that all the glory of the creatures hath been
darkned in my eyes ſince the Lord hath ſhewed me the glory of
His Goſpel, Can you ſay ſo? This is a good evidence that the
Goſpel is a ſaving Goſpel to your ſouls, if you ſtand and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at the glory of God in the Goſpel; Certainly there's none
though never ſo weak in parts, yet if ſo be that God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Himſelf in the Goſpel to them, they ſee that which makes
them ſtand and admire at God, and darkens all the world in
their eyes; have you ſeen the Goſpel thus? then it is to you the
glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God: and in the 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. In
whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine into
them:</hi> Oh reade over this Scripture again and again, <hi>The God of
this world hath blinded their minds.</hi> Mark, compare this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
with that I ſaid before of Chriſt, that His Kingdom is not
of this world, but the Devil is called the God of this world,
note this, he hath blinded the minds of them which beleeve
not, if any which live under the Goſpel beleeve not, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Devil as he prevails in the world and by worldly
things, by the pomp and vanity of the world he hoodwinks
the eyes of thoſe which beleeve not, leſt the light of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Goſpel of Chriſt who is the expreſs Image of God ſhould
ſhine into them, Oh the Devil is loth that the gloriou Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
ſhould ſhine into the hearts of men; he is content that they
ſhould come and hear the Goſpel, but he labors to keep off the
light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, that it ſhine not into
them, for he know when once it hath ſhined into mens hearts,
then all the glory of the world will be darkned in their eyes,
and they will admire then at nothing but Chriſt; Oh none but
Chriſt, none but Chriſt, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Chriſt? and
there is none upon earth that I deſire in compariſon of my deareſt Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
who is the faireſt of ten thouſand;</hi> I never knew God before I
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29998:70"/>
ſaw him in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; and now I ſee God in the
face of His Son, I ſee him in another way than ever I did; O the
Goſpel is a glorious Goſpel, there is more of the glory of God
in one ſentence of the Goſpel, than in all the Heavens and Earth
beſide; this we may boldly aver. Now our Converſations muſt
be as becomes the Goſpel, then there muſt be a glory in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
we muſt hold forth the Goſpel in our Converſations:
therefor Profeſſors of the Goſpel they ſhould ſhine as lights in
the world.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you mark this one Note. I remember in the cloſe of
all the laſt day, I ſhewed you, that the Saints and godly people
are call'd, the glory of Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf; ſurely you that
are Profeſſors of the Goſpel ſhould live ſo as to be the glory of
the glorious Goſpel, and what manner of perſons ought we to be
then? it's not enough that our Converſations be not defiled with
the moſt filthy and abominable pollutions of the world, but
our Converſations ſhould be ſuch as ſhould be a glory to the
glorious Goſpel: Look in the Goſpel, there ſhine the Attributes
of God in glory, ſo in our lives there ſhould be ſhining the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Attributes of God, that all that behold our Converſations
may admire the Attributes of God ſhining in our lives, and
glorifie our Heavenly Father. Certainly a child of God that
keeps cloſe to God, and lives holily in his life, doth let out
more of the glory of God ſhining before the world than the
Sun in the Firmament; A Chriſtian that profeſſes the Goſpel,
and doth walk anſwerably to the Goſpel, I ſay he is a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
creature in this world than the Sun in the Firmament;
certainly if we do but conſider this, that we are appointed here
in this world while we live, to hold forth the glory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
to make it to be a glorious Goſpel before all that we live
among, it would cauſe another manner of Converſation than as
yet we have.</p>
               <p>But to wind up all in a few words of Application, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
(though all the way as I have gone I have labored to
apply it) all that I ſhall ſay may be refer'd unto theſe two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>

I appeal to your conſciences, Do not your conſciences in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
theſe things condemn you? If this be a Converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Goſpel, O Lord, how far are we from honoring the
Goſpel in our lives? for how do many of your Converſations
diſgrace the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt? you put Jeſue Chriſt even to
open ſhame by your Converſations; and ſuch as you are, are
blots to profeſſion &amp; ſtains to Religion, and the truth is, it had

you ſhall find <hi>Paul,</hi> when he did but ſee <hi>Peter</hi> to walk not as he
ought to do, (ſaith he) <hi>I withſtood</hi> Peter <hi>to his face:</hi> What's the
matter? You ſhall ſee the cauſe in the 14. verſe, (for ſaith he)
<hi>He did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel:</hi> In that
one particular (it ſeems) <hi>Peter</hi> was blame-worthy, O how was
<hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit ſtir'd! I reſiſted him to his face ſaith he. Though
<hi>Peter</hi> was a glorious Apoſtle, yet becauſe in that thing he did
not walk according to the truth of the Goſpel, <hi>Paul</hi> reſiſted him
to his face. And are there any that make profeſſion? and do
you ſee that they walk not according to the truth of the Goſpel?
Reſiſt them to their faces, though they be never ſo eminent, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Goſpel was precious to the heart of <hi>Paul,</hi> and therfore he could
not bear, no not a <hi>Peter,</hi> not to walk according to the truth of
the Goſpel. Oh how many! how many are there among you
that do not walk according to the truth of the Goſpel? Now the
Lord cauſe your conſciences this day to reſiſt you to your faces,
and to ſpeak in ſecret to you, and to convince you of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
evil that you are guilty of: is ſuch a Converſation as you
walk in ſuch as become the Goſpel? I remember I have read
a ſtory, you ſhal find it in <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, when he prevailed in
warr, and took a Biſhop, the Biſhop of <hi>Bevoice,</hi> the Pope was
angry, and ſends and expoſtulates with him, that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to meddle with one of his Sons, and impriſon him. The
King ſent this anſwer again to the Pope: He takes the <hi>Habergion</hi>
and other warlike inſtruments that the Biſhop had, and ſends
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29998:71"/>
them to the Pope with theſe words; <hi>See, Is this thy Sons Coat?
is it fit for him to wear ſuch things as theſe?</hi> So I may ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
many profeſſors, look upon their Converſations, and
what is this the Coat? this the Converſation of the ſon of God?
As that <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, thought it ſuch an unbeſeeming thing
for a Biſhop to have warlike inſtruments about him, and to be
taken clad in armor. On 'tis an unbeſeeming thing for ſuch as
profeſs the Goſpel of Chriſt, to have inſtruments of death about
them, to have wicked Converſations, to live in wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly

My brethren, know that when you undertake the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

to the profeſſion of the Goſpel and look upon it as if it were a

In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. it is a good Scripture for women, he ſpeaks of
women, <hi>that they ſhould walk as thoſe that do profeſs godlineſs,</hi> ſuch
ſhould preach the contents of the Goſpel in an Evangelical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior

wrought upon your hearts, to chang your minds and turn your

that is, your Converſations muſt be worthy of the Goſpel, and
that is fruit worthy of repentance: and in <hi>Acts, 26. 20. Works
meet for repentance.</hi> Oh you ſay, you have repented you of your

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:29998:72"/>
And divers motives there ſhould have been named for the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up of your hearts to walk worthy of the Goſpel: O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what's this Goſpel you profeſs, the Scripture cals it as here
the Goſpel of Chriſt: So <hi>the Goſpel of the grace of God, Act.</hi> 20. 24.</p>
                  <p>It's a Goſpel by which you are begotten, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It's the Goſpel of your ſalvation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
                  <p>And fourthly, It's an everlaſting Goſpel, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 6.</p>
                  <p>And then as you had it before, a glorious Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Oh walk worthy of this Goſpel that you have got ſo much
good by. I appeal to you any that have had the Goſpel wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon your hearts, Have not you got ſo much good by
the Goſpel that you would not part withal for ten thouſand
worlds? Oh then walk worthy of that Goſpel, ſeeing you
have got ſo much good by it. And I beſeech you conſider that
motive in the text, <hi>Only let your Converſation be as it becomes the
Goſpel of Chriſt. [Only]</hi> as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, the Goſpel
hath many things that darkens it, and many adverſaries that
do oppoſe it, Oh but, <hi>Only let your Converſation be as it becomes the
Goſpel;</hi> you need care for nothing that oppoſeth, ſo you walk
<hi>worthy</hi> of the Goſpel, only let your Converſation, <hi>be as becomes</hi>
the Goſpel. Now what a many enemies hath the Goſpel at
this day? and what errors and diviſions are there to ecclipſe
this Evangelical Sun? Why now, <hi>Only let your Converſation be as it
becomes the Goſpel:</hi> That is, in theſe times wherein there is ſo
much done againſt the Goſpel, as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, Let
all Devils and wicked men do what they can they ſhall never
prevail againſt the Goſpel, if your Converſations be as becomes
the Goſpel; this is enough to ſtand out againſt all that is done
againſt the Goſpel: Oh me thinks this argument ſhould be a
prevailing argument. Oh! do not your hearts bleed when
you hear what oppoſition is made againſt the glorious Goſpel
of Chriſt that ſhould be ten thouſand times deerer
than your lives? here's the way that the Goſpel ſhould ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Hell, and the gates of Hell, all counſels of the enemy
ſhall not prevail againſt the Goſpel, <hi>if</hi> your Converſations be
as becomes the Goſpel, This will do it. And mark what <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, he looks upon it as a thing thing dearer than his life, to walk
ſo as might further the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 12. We ſuffer all things</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:29998:73"/>
(ſaith he) <hi>leſt we ſhould hinder the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> Mark, (as if
he ſhould ſay) Oh 'tis more dear than our lives a thouſand times,
we will do any thing, and ſuffer any thing; Oh the Apoſtles
ſpirit was filled with the ſweetneſs of the Goſpel, he had found
the good of it. And here in this Scripture he ſaith, <hi>Oh what
ſhall I do? what ſhall I ſuffer that I may not hinder the Goſpel?</hi> Let
them do any thing that poſſibly can be to me, or take what they
will from me, I crave not, we ſuffer all things that the Goſpel
may not be hindred.</p>
                  <p>Now you will neither do nor ſuffer for the Goſpel, you will
not part with a baſe luſt that the Goſpel may not be hindred;
one profeſſor being overtaken with an apparent ſin may do more
hurt to the Goſpel than he can do good all his life, let him live
as long as <hi>Methuſelah;</hi> that ſin of yours that is ſo dear to you,
Will not you part with it? it will hinder the Goſpel, Oh wilt
not thou part with thy ſin, when any temptation comes to ſin?
Let every one of you that profeſs you love the Goſpel, but think
thus, Oh but ſhall I not hinder the Goſpel if I liſten and yeild
to this temptation? indeed this will bring me a great deal of
comfort and content, and I ſhall get ſo much by it; Oh but will
it not obſtruct the Goſpel? the very thought of this that it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
may hinder the Goſpel, ſhould cauſe your hearts to riſe
with indignation againſt that temptation, and caſt out that ſin;
God forbid that I ſhould meddle with that ſin which wil hinder
the Goſpel. And therefore in <hi>Act.</hi> 20, 24. the Apoſtle profeſſes,
that <hi>his life is not dear to him, ſo be it he might but further the Goſpel:</hi>
And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. from the 12. verſ. to the 23. he profeſſes there,
<hi>he would become all things to all men, he would be a ſervant to any
man, and yeeld to all things that he could, ſo be it he might not ſin
againſt God, to be never ſo vile in the eyes of men, and all that he might
but further the Goſpel.</hi> Oh that it were but ſo in our hearts. We
reade of an excellent commendations of one, in the 2 of <hi>Cor. 8. 18.
That his praiſe is in the Goſpel in all the Churches.</hi> Oh this is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
thing, when it can be ſaid of a Profeſſor of Religion (it may
be this man hath not any great commendation for parts, no
but) his praiſe is in the Goſpel. As the Saints of God and all
the Churches of God that knew him, they highly commended
him, Why? Becauſe that the Goſpel is furthered by him, his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29998:73"/>
praiſe is in the Goſpel: this we ſhould labor al of us what poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
we can. My brethren, what a mercy is it, that God ſhould
account any thing that we do worthy of the Goſpel! Mark the
Text, Why, can we poor worms do any thing worthy of the
Goſpel? I but though you can do but little, God will account
your endeavours even <hi>worthy</hi> of the Goſpel. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that he
was unworthy to looſe the latchet of Chriſts ſhoe, nor worthy
to carry the ſhoe of Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>: Then, are we ſuch as can walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the glorious Goſpel? Oh 'tis Gods infinit goodneſs that
ſhal account us to be worthy of the Goſpel. The Apoſtles did
not account themſelves worthy to ſuffer for the Goſpel, <hi>Acts,
5.</hi> 41. And ſhall God account us to do that which is worthy
of his Goſpel? Oh this ſhould be a mighty encouragement to
us, to walk worthy of the Goſpel. And there is an notable
encouraging text, in <hi>Luke, 21. 36. Walk worthy of the Goſpel:</hi>
And then you ſhall ſee what God will account you worthy of:
<hi>Watch ye therefore, and pray alwaies, that ye may be accounted worthy
to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſſe, and to ſtand before
the Son of Man. Watch</hi> and <hi>Pray,</hi> be watchful in all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
keep your communion with God cloſe: What will be
the fruit of this? That ye may be accounted <hi>worthy</hi> to eſcape
theſe things: that is, the many afflictions, dangers, and evils
that ſhall come upon the world, you ſhall eſcape the evil of
them at leaſt. <hi>And to ſtand before the Son of Man.</hi> Here's a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Scripture to quicken up our hearts to walk conſcionably
and ſtrictly in our Converſation, watch over your waies, ſtand
upon your guard, and pray, that you may be accounted <hi>worthy</hi>
to ſtand before the Son of Man: Why? Is there any that can
ſtand before the Son of Man in glory? or that ſhal be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
worthy to ſtand before Him? Yes, a godly and gracious
man or woman that walks conſcionably in their Converſation,
when the Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, they ſhal be able
to ſtand before Him, and be accounted worthy. Oh then, <hi>let your
Converſation be as becomes the Goſpel,</hi> and you ſhall be accounted
by God, <hi>worthy to ſtand before the Son of Man.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He
walks towards you as becomes a Mediator; yea Chriſt doth al
things that are ſutable to His relations, as a Husband, as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior:
Oh do you all things that are ſutable to your relations.</p>

And for the cloſe of all, I beſeech you lay but to heart the
great Deſign that God hath in the Goſpel, think thus with thy
ſelf, Surely the Work of God in the Goſpel is a glorious Work:
Well then: ſurely God hath ſome great Deſign that He drives
on in the Goſpel. What is it? Let me labor to ſerve it whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in me lieth. Now if you reade in the Goſpel you ſhall find
that the Deſign that God hath, it is, <hi>To purchaſe to Himſelf, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
people, zealous of good works:</hi> to promote holineſs and
godlineſs, <hi>that we being redeemed from the hands of our enemies,
might ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the daies of our lives.</hi>
This is the Deſign that God hath: I ſee that Mankind is fallen
from me, and the people in the world are generally fallen into
wickedneſs, the whole world lieth in wickedneſs, over head
and ears in ſin; but I would have holineſs advanced, I would
have my Image renewed, I would have a peculiar people that
might live for ever to ſerve and worſhip me: Here's the Deſign
of God: Oh let me now ſerve this deſign of God, and labor to
do all that I can to ſerve, and honor, and bleſſe, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
that God that hath wrought ſuch glorious things for us,
as He hath wrought in the Goſpel. And as Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Mat.
3.</hi> when He came to be paptized of <hi>John, It becomes us to fulfill
all righteouſneſs.</hi> Now ſhall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf ſay
thus, It becomes us to fulfill all righteouſneſs; ſurely then it
becomes you to fulfil al righteouſneſs. Would you walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Goſpel? Give up your hearts, ſtrength, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
what poſſibly you can to fulfill all righteouſneſs, do not
ſay, Why ſhould I do thus? and why need we be ſo forward
and ſtrict? Oh remember the text; If any talk of too much
ſtrictneſs, and too much forwardneſs; then anſwer thus; I
heard in ſuch a place ſuch a Text opened and applied to me,
that my Converſation muſt be as it becomes the Goſpel; and
certainly let me do what I can, I cannot do ſo much but that
the Goſpel will require ten thouſand times more than I can do,
and therfore I do endeavor to walk as becoms the Goſpel: And
I hear that Chriſt Himſelf ſaith, that it became Him to fulfil all
righteouſneſs; And why ſhould not I walk as Chriſt Himſelf
walked? O my life hath bin too vain heretofore, my heart hath
been dead, and I have not been quickned up ſo as to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29998:74"/>
of the Goſpel; but for the time to come my care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor

this glorious GOSPEL of Jeſus Chriſt, from whom I
do expect to have ſuch glorious things hereafter.</p>

               <p>THE words are a part of the ſtory of <hi>Chriſts arraignment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
Pilat. Behold here the King of Heaven and Earth
ſtands arraigned at the Barr of a wicked man. In this
Arraignment we find a ſpecial Charge which his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
bring againſt Him, which was this: THAT HE
MADE HIMSELF THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29998:75"/>
                  <hi>He was an enemy to Government.</hi> The uſual charge that the world
hath had againſt the Saints, that they are enemies to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They fare no worſe here than Chriſt did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilat</hi> requires of him to anſwer to the Charge, (whether it
were ſo or no, that He hath made Himſelf a King.) Now you
ſhall find in the anſwer of Chriſt, He doth not deny the thing,
but implicitly grants it, neither doth he anſwer him fully to his
mind, but ſaith, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Kingdom]</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I acknowledg that I have
a Kingdom, as mean and low as I am brought now, though I
ſtand here before you as a deſpiſed man, a Carpenters ſon, yet I
confeſs I have a Kingdom, but it is not of this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not of this world]</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>not IN this world,</hi> but ſaith,
<hi>it is not OF this world,</hi> it is not a worldly Kingdom. We have
in the words theſe two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Chriſt hath a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What kind of Kingdom Chriſts is, <hi>Not of this
world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not here ſpeak much unto the former, and ſo to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the common place of Chriſts Kingly Office, but only hint it
to you as it makes way to the latter, there we ſhall ſtay a
while.</p>
               <p>Chriſt he hath a Kingdom, He is anointed by the Father to
be King, as well as Prieſt, and Prophet of His Church: <hi>Pſal.
45. 6. Thy Throne O God, is for ever and ever, the Scepter of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is a right Scepter:</hi> (that Pſalm is a Propheſie of Chriſt:)
And in the 19. of <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. Chriſt is there called, <hi>The King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> Chriſt God-man, is the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, Chriſt God-man, is the King of Angels and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the World; and we muſt know Chriſt as a King, and
act our faith upon him as a King or elſe we know Him not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
we have not the true work of faith except (I ſay) our faith
act upon Him as a King as well as a Savior: In <hi>Acts, 2. 36. God
hath made Him</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>both Lord and Chriſt:</hi> Mark, He
it not only <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Lord and Chriſt;</hi> though it is true, that
in the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> all His Offices are implyed, which ſignifies,
anointed to them all; but yet this is expreſſed by its ſelf, <hi>Lord
and Chriſt,</hi> for indeed properly He is <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto His Church;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29998:76"/>
but He is alſo <hi>Lord</hi> over all the World in ſome ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But then you will ſay,</hi> How doth He ſay, that His Kingdom is not
of this world, if He he Lord over all the world?</p>
               <p>Now that I might come to that point that I have choſen the
text for, we are to know that Chriſt hath a double Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Together with the Father He hath a <hi>Providential King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
(as I may ſo ſay for diſtinction ſake.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, He hath a <hi>Mediatory Kingdom</hi> (as Divines call
it.)</p>
               <p>Firſt, A <hi>Providential Kingdom</hi> together with the Father where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
He mannages all the affairs of the world. (I ſay) God-man,
the ſecond Perſon in Trinity doth mannage all the affairs of the
world, His Scepter ruleth over all: as God did make all things
by Chriſt, ſo He doth govern all things by Him; if God had
not deputed the ſecond Perſon in Trinity <hi>God man</hi> the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to have been the Governor of all things, the holineſs and
juſtice of God according to the Covenant of works by which he
had to deal with man would have deſtroyed the world upon
mans ſin; had not the ordering and governing of the world
been put into the hand of the ſecond Perſon in Trinity <hi>God-man</hi>
the Mediator, for though he was not manifeſted in the fleſh,
He had not actually taken our humane Nature upon Him, yet
He was look'd upon as God-man with the Father even before
the foundation of the world was laid, and ſo all things were
committed to Him; And hence the world notwithſtanding the
ſin that hath been in it hath been preſerved ſo as it hath been
to this day; Chriſt therefore hath a Providential Kingdom to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Father, and ſo he is King, not over the Churches
only, the King of the Saints, but He is over all the Heathen, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the world, from the riſing of the Sun to the ſetting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
And the Civil Magiſtrate (as I may ſo ſay) is the Deputy of
Chriſt in this his Providential Kingdom, Gods Vicegerent upon
Earth, all Magiſtrates whatſoever are Officers ſubordinate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Him.</p>
               <p>But now, there's another Kingdom of Chriſt that this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaks of, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world.</hi> That is, the
Kingdom of the Mediator (as Divines calls it,) that more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
concerns His Church in the execution of His Mediatory
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29998:76"/>
Office: Now this Kingdom of Chriſt it was ever ſince there was
a Church, but it was very dark under clouds and curtains, the
glory of it was little till the ſecond Perſon came to be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in the fleſh, then indeed this Mediatory Kingdom of Chriſt
came to be revealed abundantly, more cleerly than before, and
Chriſt exerciſed it more fully; this is that which the Scripture
ſo often in the Goſpel cals the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Repent for
the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand:</hi> 'tis not of this world, but it's
cal'd the Kingdom of Heaven; the Mediatory Kingdom of
Chriſt is not of this world; there's a great deal of difference
between a worldly kingdom and this Kingdom of Chriſt. And
that's the ſubject that I am now to open to you, How Chriſts
Kingdom is not of this world, the vaſt difference between world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kingdoms and Chriſts Kingdom, which you will find to be
a point of very great uſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſts Kingdom hath not that pomp and glory, that brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and galantry that the Kingdoms of the world have;</hi> you know in
the Kingdoms of the world there's a great deal of outward
pomp and glory; <hi>Bernice</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> they came in great
pomp (the text ſaith;) the Kings of the earth have glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.
Chriſt hath no ſuch thing, His attendance was a
few poor Fiſher-men: Kings have great Courts, and crouded
with Courtiers: His Court was but ſmall, only a few of ſuch
kind of men, mean and contemptible, taken from the hedges,
and out of the high waies: They have ſumptuous Pallaces:
Chriſt had not a place to hide His head here in this world;
He ſaith himſelf, <hi>that the Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air
have neſts, but the Son of Man hath not wherewithal to hide His
head,</hi> and yet a great King for all that: Surely it was not of
this world. The Kings of the earth have all kind of delicates
that this world can afford, they carry things in great ſtate: It
was not ſo with Chriſt, <hi>Zech. 9. 9. Rejoyce greatly, Oh Daughter
of Zion, ſhout Oh Daughter of Jeruſalem; behold thy King cometh
unto thee, He is juſt, and having ſalvation, lowly, and riding upon an
Aſs, and upon a Colt, the foal of an Aſs.</hi> He comes lowly and mean,
the way of Chriſt in this His kindom is a way of humility and
outward meanneſs and lowlineſs, it is a way of outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
ſcorn and diriſion, this is the way of the kingdom of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29998:77"/>
Chriſt, by poverty, and lowlineſs He would overcome the
world, not by bravery and magnificence, nor by great pomp
and glory, He doth not dazle the eyes of men by ſuch means;
but His glory conſiſts in ſelf-denial, in emptying of Himſelf, in
becoming poor; &amp; therfore His Kingdom is not of this world.
<hi>Luke, 17. 20. The Kingdom of God</hi> (ſaith the text there) <hi>comes not
with obſervation:</hi> that's the word: the meaning of it is this: It
is not a thing that by any outward pompous Ceremonies can be
obſerved. Now Kings when they go from one place to another,
by their attendance, and by a great many ceremonies that are
uſed for the ſetting out of their pomp and glory, they are
taken notice of and obſerved; you may know the King comes
here, ſay the people, when they ſee ſuch things. But ſaith the
text there, The Kingdom of God comes <hi>not by obſervation;</hi> there's
no ſuch outward pomp and glory, there's nothing but outward
meaneſs and baſeneſs to the eye of the fleſh, in the Kingdom of
Jeſus Chriſt. He that is in Himſelf the moſt glorious King, and
from whom all other Kings have their power, yet He hath a
Kingdom that is not of this world, that hath nothing but mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
poverty, and lowlineſs that doth appear in it to the eyes
of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world, in regard
of His Subjects.</hi> Look what ſubjects Chriſt hath, they are ſuch as
are not of this world: So Chriſt tels His Diſciples, as you may
find in the 17. of <hi>John, I am not of the world: and you are not of the
world.</hi> Kings, they have for their ſubjects, Nobles, Peers, and
great Perſonages, eſpecially thoſe that are near about them: but
now the ſubjects that Chriſt hath for His Kingdom (for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of them) they are of the poor, mean, baſe, &amp; contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
men of the world, ſuch as are look'd upon, as the off-ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of all things, theſe are His ſubjects: as in the ſecond of
<hi>James,</hi> 5. verſe, <hi>Hearken my beloved brethren: Hath not God choſen
the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom?</hi> The
poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom:
they are the great hears, even the poor of this world. You know
what an offence it was unto the Jews, ſay they, <hi>Do any of the
Rulers beleeve in him? but this multitude, which is accurſed.</hi> A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of poor women, illiterat people <hi>they</hi> flock after <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:29998:77"/>
The ſubjects of Chriſt are men choſen out of this world, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
appeared not with the glory of the world. And ſecondly,
His ſubjects are men choſen out of the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world;</hi> that is, the
rule that Chriſt hath in His ſubjects, and over theſe His ſubjects
in this His Kingdom it is not of this world, the rule it is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
It is principally upon the hearts, the wills, the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of thoſe that are His ſubjects, every ſubject of Chriſt hath
his will and heart ſubdued to Jeſus Chriſt. It is not ſo in this
world, men may be ſubject to the Kings of this world meerly
by conſtraint becauſe they dare not do otherwiſe, many Kings
in this world have ſubjects whoſe hearts are not with them,
who love them not, the Kings of this world they rule only the
outward man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Chriſts Kingdom is another kind of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
He rules in the hearts of men, there is His Throne, in the
wills, in the affections of men, in the conſciences of men, Chriſt
ſwaies His Scepter in mens ſouls: men by conqueſt they ſubdue
ſubjects to themſelves; Chriſt he ſubdues too in a way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
but he doth not ſubdue the outward man ſo much as the
inward man, the will is ſubdued to Chriſt, He ſwaies His Scepter
in their hearts: this is a great myſtery of godlineſs, the ſwaying
of the Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt in the hearts of the Saints; and
therefore the Scripture tels us, <hi>That the Kingdom of God is within
us,</hi> it is an inward Kingdom. That's the third thing wherein
the difference between Chriſts Kingdom and the Kingdoms of
the world conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Laws of Chriſt are Spiritual.</hi> Obſerve the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Laws of Chriſt in the government of His
Church, and the Laws that are for the government of the world,
it will be of very great uſe for you to know: The Lord in His
Providential Kingdom appointing Magiſtrates to govern here
in the world in His room, He leaves them to make Laws accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the general rules of prudence and juſtice, ſuch Laws are
ſufficient for the governing of the outward man, and for the
attaining to a Civil end for which their government is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
But now Jeſus Chriſt in His Mediatory Kingdom, in His
Church He makes all the Laws Himſelf, He doth not leave it
unto the Church to make new Laws, according to the rules of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29998:78"/>
their own prudence, what they conceive to be fit in way of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
no, but they muſt fetch the Laws out of His Word, and
impoſe none but the ſame Laws that are in His Word, they muſt
have a <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> it is written, here are theſe and theſe texts
of Scripture for what is enjoyned, nothing muſt be added unto
what He hath in His Word revealed, only there are Divine
Laws for the government of His Church: now 'tis true, that the
Church becauſe they are a ſociety of men, they have ſome things
natural, and ſome things civil among them, ſo far as they have
need of natural and civil helps, ſo far there may be Laws made
according to rules of prudence and juſtice, and Magiſtrates
may come in to be helpful to the Church, ſo far as they have
need here of natural and civil helps as a ſociety of men; But
now to ſpeak properly to that which belongs to them meerly as
they are the Church of Chriſt, beſides that that they have need
of as they are men, and natural and civil ſocieties, (I ſay) what
belongs to them, meerly conſidered as a Church of Chriſt, they
are to be governed only by the Laws of Jeſus Chriſt who is the
only Law-giver, only by the Laws of the Word; and there is
not that liberty of making new Laws in the Church as there
is of making new Laws in the Common-wealth and State; and
that's a great difference between the Kingdom of Chriſt and the
Kingdoms of this world. That's a fourth; <hi>The Laws are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</hi>
The Laws are different, not only that they are by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
revelation in the one, and left to humane prudence in the
other: But 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> in the one the Laws bind conſcience, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do not, they do not bind conſcience any further than
the nature of the thing that is required binds, except it be
in caſe of ſcandal and contempt, ſo our Divines that have
been the moſt orthodox have gone; that the Laws of men in the
State they bind not conſcience, that is, if a man ſhould not do
the thing that is required, he ſhould in conſcience be bound over
to eternal death for not doing it, this is a very hard bondage,
a cruel yoke: but thus, if the thing that is required be right and
juſt, then the nature of the thing may bind conſcience, for
then there comes in a Law of God, if the thing be juſt and right
that is required: or however, if I know nothing to the contrary
but it may be juſt and right, I muſt not break the Laws of man
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29998:78"/>
ſo as to give ſcandal, or in a way of contempt; but if it be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly,
ſo as it be no ſcandal, nor no contempt, and the nature
of the thing bind me not, then my conſcience is not bound over
as guilty of eternal death, if ſo be I do not every thing that man
requires. But now the Laws of Chriſt they are ſuch as bind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
as they come from him, he is ſuch a King that (I ſay) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they come from him and from his Will, though we ſee
no reaſon in the matter of the thing, though they have nothing
in the nature of the thing but meerly the Will of Chriſt, it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to tye conſcience, and to bind us even upon pain of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
death to obedience.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Chriſts Kingdom is not of this world:</hi> That homage that
the Saints do unto Chriſt it is not worldly but ſpiritual, the
Worſhip of Chriſt, and the Ordinances of Chriſt they are not
worldly but ſpiritual. Now the Kings of this world they may
appoint what kind of worſhip they pleaſe, that is, what Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
they will, whereby their ſubject, ſhould tender up
their homage to them: and now men have ventured to be ſo
bold with Chriſt the King, becauſe men may tender up their
homage unto their earthly Kings by any waies invented of
their own, therefore they have thought that they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to tender up their homage to Chriſt their ſpiritual King
by any waies of invented worſhip; and therein was a great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
they lookt upon the Kingdom of Chriſt only in a carnal
way, whereas the Kingdom of Chriſt is ſuch as all our homage
that we tender up to Him muſt be Spiritual, it muſt be Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
it muſt be from Heaven, it muſt be from Chriſt Himſelf,
it muſt be from ſome Inſtitution and Appointment of Jeſus
Chriſt: and the more the kingdom of Chriſt doth prevail, the
more Spiritual ſhall that homage be that the ſubjects tender
up to Him: &amp; therefore you ſhall find that when the holy Ghoſt
ſpeaks of the Kingdom of Chriſt in the new Teſtament, with
reference unto that which was then in the old Teſtament, He
calls, even thoſe waies of worſhip in the old Teſtament <hi>worldly,</hi>
in compariſon of the worſhip and homage that the Saints ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Chriſt in the new Teſtament, as in <hi>Gal. 4. 3. Even ſo
we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29998:79"/>
world.</hi> The ceremonies of the Law are call'd here the elements
of the world, that we were in bondage to, while we were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
for though we were ſubject to Chriſt then, yet we were
but in our non-age; and indeed in compariſon of what we are
in the times of the Goſpel we were ſlaves rather than ſubjects;
we were then in bondage: and then in <hi>Col. 2. 8. Beware leſt
any man ſpoil you through Phyloſophy and vain deceit, after the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt.</hi>
[after the rudiments of the world] Theſe rudiments of the world
they had ſome reference (as it appears in reading this Chapter)
unto the ceremonies of the Law, and together with them there
was mixture of mens own inventions, they were the rudiments
of the world, not after Chriſt; you do not acknowledge
Chriſt to be a King when you worſhip him in a worldly way,
after the rudiments of the world; As now for inſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
men were wont to honor the Preſence Chamber where
the King ſits, when you go into it you are to be uncovered:
Now like unto that (according to the way of the world) men
think that becauſe they meet here for Religious ends to worſhip
God, that when they come (as any time in the week) into ſuch
a place as this is, they muſt come uncovered; now this is after
the rudiments of the world, you think to worſhip this King
after the ſame way, but his way of worſhip is no ſuch low in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
And as they bowed to the Chair of State, and ſo
they would bow with cap and knee to the Communion Table
that they cal'd the Altar; now theſe are according to the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the world; but Chriſts Kingdom is not of this world,
His worſhip muſt be ſpiritual, in <hi>Heb. 9. 1. Then verily the firſt
Covenant had alſo Ordinances of Divine Service, and a worldly
Sanctuary.</hi> Mark, in the time of the Law it was but a worldly
Sanctuary in compariſon of what is now in the times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;
thoſe waies of worſhip though they were once appointed
by God, Chriſt the King of His Church in the new Teſtament
would not have His homage tendered up by theſe waies of
worſhip, they were too worldly for Him; then ſurely to have
the inventions of men in the worſhip of Chriſt, in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
eſpecially, it is too worldly for Chriſt: No it muſt be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29998:79"/>
Divine and Spiritual, he that worſhips, muſt worſhip <hi>in ſpirit
and in truth:</hi> al that worſhip and homage we tender up to Jeſus
Chriſt, we muſt look to have it ſpiritual and not worldly; and
ſo the Ordinances, though they have ſomething external, as
the Sacraments, yet if we ſtick to the outward part, we do not
worſhip Chriſt as our King in a right way; but we muſt be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
in all, look upon the ſpiritual part in al Ordinances, or
elſe (I ſay) we do not tender up that homage to Chriſt that is
due to Him, as the King of His Church.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Chriſts Kingdom is not of this world: that is,
<hi>The Officers that Chriſt hath appointed, for the government of His
Church, are not of this world, are not to be of this world; but they are
all to be by Divine Inſtitution.</hi> Obſerve the difference in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Chriſts Kingdom, and the worldly Kingdoms:
In the kingdoms of this world men may invent as many new
Officers as they pleaſe, they may errect new Officers in a State
and Common-wealth: But al the men in the world cannot er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
any one new Office in the Church, cannot make one new
Officer otherwiſe than is in the Word; we do not reade of any
ſuch name as <hi>Tryers</hi> there: Now though we do not find Officers
of States in the Word, yet a Human Creation is enough, as the
Apoſtle cals it,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ſubject to every Ordinance of men.</hi> You have it in
<hi>Peter,</hi> the word that is there tranſlated, <hi>Ordinance of men,</hi> it is, a
<hi>Humane Creation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Humanae creationae. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> In the Church there can be no new Officers
created: Chriſt hath made Paſtors, and Teachers, Elders, and
Decons, and Widdows in the Church; and not any new ſort
can be added by all the men in the world. And therfore it was
heretofore, as in <hi>Popery,</hi> ſo in <hi>Prelacy,</hi> they would errect a new
kind of Religion (as they cal'd it) more ſpiritual, and ſo made
the Kingdom of Chriſt like unto the kingdoms of the world,
and thought that they had power to make as many new Officers
in the Church as they pleaſed. Certainly this was a derogation
from the kingdom of Chriſt, they made it too worldly. A
ſecond difference in the Church-Officers from the Officers in
the kingdoms of the world, is this, <hi>If once they be put into ſuch a
place in the Church, they have the ful power of the place.</hi> As ſupoſe now
a Paſtor or a Teacher hath as much power as any one Paſtor or
Teacher upon the face of the earth; there cannot be a difference
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29998:80"/>
between one Officer and another of the ſame kind in the Church
as in the State: Now the State may limit their Officers as they
pleaſe, in ſome Countries they may make Juſtices of the Peace
for one uſe, and in another Country for another uſe, they may
limit them according as they pleaſe, how they ſhall execute their
places, and when they muſt leave their Offices to others: But in
the Church, one Paſtor (whatſoever he be) hath as much power
of Chriſt in him as any that live, for as there can be no new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in this kingdom of Chriſt but by Divine Inſtitution, ſo there
can be no limitation of their Office but according to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>So His Kingdom is not of this world.</hi> It's true,
if ſo be that the Magiſtrate ſhall come in by Law to help the
Church, ſo far as they ſhall come in to give Civil help to the
Church they may appoint Officers, to ſee that their power be
not abuſed; but not any that are properly Church Officers, to
adminiſter any ſpiritual Ordinances in the Church, but ſuch as
are by Divine Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world;</hi> the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
by which Chriſt doth fight with His adverſaries to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
His Kingdom, are not the weapons of the world; in that
notable Scripture 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 4, 5. For the weapons of our warfare
are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong
bolds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing, that exalteth it
ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every
thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> Mark, here's the weapons of the
Kingdom of Chriſt, Chriſt brings into captivity every thought,
eaſts down ſtrong holds, whatſoever ſtrong hold, or high thing
is lifted up againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt, Chriſt hath weapons
in His Kingdom to caſt it down; but ſaith he, the weapons of
our warfare (there is a warfare) they are not carnal but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
               <p>Chriſt in His kingdom He doth not appoint carnal weapons,
He gives not unto His Church weapons of the fleſh, to make men
beleeve whether they will or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You will ſay,</hi> If there be not ſuch weapons that are outward to force
men, then all will be to no purpoſe, it will be nothing?</p>
               <p>Yes ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Our weapons are not carnal, but Spiritual;</hi>
and he anſwers that objection, That men will not care for
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29998:80"/>
them if they do not come in an outward compulſary way, by
impriſonments, and fyning, and ſuch kind of waies.</p>
               <p>We ſpeak not what power the Civil State hath, but Chriſt
hath committed no ſuch thing to the Church, as the Church:
and theſe weapons the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, though they be not
carnal but ſpiritual, yet they are mighty through God, and
the more ſpiritual they are, the more mighty they are to caſt
down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth its ſelf
againſt the knowledg of God, and bringing into captivity every
thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The weapons, What are they? They are the two edged ſword
of the Spirit, the Word of God in the Name of Chriſt, and
with the authority of Chriſt preached to the people in the Word
of God, binding men in a dogmatical way, theſe are our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
weapons; Chriſt hath never appointed his Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
its ſelf by carnal weapons, the Church goes no further
than Spiritual weapons, it's in the very text that I have read to
you, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world:</hi> Mark what follows, What
were the weapons Chriſt had to defend His Kingdom? ſurely
no worldly weapons, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world; if my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that
I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews;</hi> but now is my kingdom not
from hence; if my Kingdom were from hence, I ſhould have the
like weapons to defend me as the Kings of the world have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>You will ſay,</hi> What's the fighting and Wars for now? May
there not be Wars and fighting for the maintainance of Religion and the
Kingdom of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Now to that I anſwer thus, That the Church hath not theſe
weapons, as a Church they have only ſpiritual, yea and were
it that any Church of God were in any place where they had
not a Civil Right to the exerciſe of their Religion, then I confeſs
(meerly for their Religion when the Civil right of the State is
againſt it) if they ſhould take up arms and fight for it, I think
they ſhould go beyond the Commiſſion of Jeſus Chriſt: they
ſhould truſt Chriſt for His Kingdom; and we find no Warrant
in all the Book of God for to take up weapons meerly for the
defence of Religion. And therefore in the primitive times,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29998:81"/>
never took up weapons, all their armor were prayers and tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But we do <hi>(you'l ſay)</hi> now; Are not our Wars for the defence
of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now to that it's cleerly anſwered thus, Our Wars are
for the defence of the Civil Right we have to the outward pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of our Religion, and ſo by weapons we may defend our
Civil Right, that is, if we live in ſuch a State where we have
Civil Right by the Laws of the Sate to the peacable enjoyment
of our Religion, if any ſhall come to diſturb us, then by the
vertue of our Civil Right we may take up weapons to ſight and
defend our ſelves with; I but this is not as a Church, nor meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for Religion, for if now the Civil State ſhould be ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that the Supream Power ſhould be againſt the waies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
yet for Civil things they would defend us, but for the
waies of Religion they were againſt us in it, I confeſs in ſuch
a caſe for men that have no Civil authority at all to take up
weapons, to force any practice, or way of Religion, this
would not be warrantable by Chriſt, and by this we ſhould
fight for the kingdom of Chriſt by other weapons than ever
Chriſt hath appointed; but now, when we have the Civil Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
the Civil Magiſtrate may grant Civil Liberty, and Civil
Liberty for the outward practice of Religion, and ſo we may
defend ſuch a Right as this for the peaceable practice of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that none ſhould come to force any other falſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon us. But now, the kingdom of Chriſt is not of this
world, the weapons of Chriſts kingdom are ſpiritual weapons;
and in thoſe times when there were no outward weapons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the kingdom of Chriſt, as in the Primitive times when all
Civil States were againſt the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, Did it not
thrive? We are ready to ſay, Al Religion will be taken away ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
there be ſuch compulſary waies; I do not ſay but there
may be compulſion to keep men from miſchieving of others
in things that are againſt the foundation. But now for the
raiſing up of the Kingdom of Chriſt we know that when there
was no compulſary waies, yet the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt went
on and flouriſhed as much as ever it hath done ſince, ſo that
the kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world, He hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to His Church thoſe weapons that are carnal, all their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29998:81"/>
weapons are weapons that are ſpiritual, to prevail with the
hearts and conſciences of men and no further: And if we did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
this aright, it would mightily quiet our ſpirits; and
the more we did reſt upon the weapons Chriſt hath appointed
in his Word, the more we did look into the Armory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
to find what weapons there are there againſt errors and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes
in his Church, the more we ſhould have the Kingdom of
Chriſt prevail amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world:</hi> that is, the
Priviledges of Chriſts kingdom are not worldly priviledges, but
Spiritual, and Divine, and Heavenly Priviledges. Men that live
in ſeveral kingdoms have ſeveral priviledges, ſome in one way,
and ſome in another; ſo every ſociety of men, and every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
have priviledges, men that are ſubjects of ſuch a Kingdom,
they have the priviledges that belong to ſuch a kingdom. We
plead for many priviledges as we are the free born Subjects of
<hi>England,</hi> that the people have a right to by their freedoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
born free Subjects, as thoſe that are above them have a right
to that power that they have. So now in the kingdom of Chriſt,
there are ſome priviledges that thoſe that are in the kingdom of
Chriſt have that others have not.</p>
               <p>As now, When any man comes into the Kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt, Oh he comes to partake of a great many excellent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
being once made a free Denizon in this Kingdom of
Chriſt, he comes to have a great many priviledges that others
have not. But of theſe I ſhall treat more particularly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world;</hi> the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and puniſhments that Chriſt hath in his Church are not
worldly; I do not mean only external ones, for they may be
refer'd to that head of the weapons of Chriſt; but we take them
under another notion; Thoſe that are truly the Subjects of
Chriſt they may be under penalties: You think that thoſe that
are beleevers cannot be chaſtiſed for their ſin; as if there were no
penalties in Chriſts kingdom; I confeſs they are delivered from
the penalties of the Law; But Chriſts inflicts penalties as he is
King, there may be penalties in Chriſts kingdom. And the
right underſtanding of this would much help us in that point;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29998:82"/>
Whether Beleevers may be chaſtiſed for ſin or no, though they
be Beleevers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh they will ſay,</hi> No. <hi>Why?</hi> Becauſe Chriſt hath ſatisfied the
Lawfully, and how can God require it in them?</p>
               <p>I confeſs the Law cannot; I but Jeſus Chriſt in His admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
as He is King, not as He is the Judge of the Law, but
as He is the King over them, He may inflict chaſtiſements upon
them; they may in Chriſts kingdom have ſome chaſtiſements,
they cannot be carried out of that kingdom to have the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Law, but in Chriſts kingdom Jeſus Chriſt many
times inflicts ſpiritual chaſtiſements upon them, by hiding his
face from them for ſin, and by many ſpiritual diſcertions; and
ſuch men as are but by outward profeſſion under the kingdom
of Chriſt, and do ſeem to be His Subjects, and are not ſo indeed,
the Lord inflicts ſpiritual judgments upon them, as hardneſs
of heart, blindneſs of mind, reprobate ſences; and I beſeech
you obſerve it, The Lord Chriſt doth not ſo much obſerve
the way of outward judgements upon wicked men that are in
the boſom of the Church, as He doth obſerve to inflict out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
judgments upon the Heathens and others that are out of
the boſom of the Church; no, Chriſt hath other manner of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
for thoſe that are in the Church, though now and
then Chriſt doth inflict outward judgments upon them; but
the main thing that Chriſt looks at in His Church, is, To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with ſpiritual rewards; as righteouſneſs and peace, and
joy in the holy Ghoſt and the like; ſo He doth inflict ſpiritual
puniſhments; Thoſe that are profeſſors in the Church &amp; naught
and vile, it may be God may proſper them for a while as well
as others outwardly, Oh but the puniſhments of Chriſt in
His kingdom they are ſpiritual, your ſouls are bound over to
eternal death, your hearts are hardned, your conſciences are
benum'd, and that's more dreadful wrath a great deal than if
the Lord Chriſt ſhould puniſh your bodies, or take away your
eſtates, thoſe are puniſhments in Chriſts providential King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but the penalties as Chriſt is the King of the Church they
are ever ſpiritual puniſhments which we ſhould more fear and
tremble at a great deal. Thus the kingdom of Chriſt is not of
this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:29998:82"/>
Now I ſhould have ſhewed you how this kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt will certainly prevail in the world, let the world do what
they can. In the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Pſal. Yet have I ſet My King upon My holy
Hill.</hi> It will at length prevail over all the world, and bring
under all the kingdoms of the world to it; but when it hath
done ſo, then there ſhall be a new world: Certainly there is a
time that Chriſt ſhall have the kingdoms of this world to reign
over them in another manner than now He hath, and that is at
the end of the world; I will give you a Scripture or two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that. <hi>Revel. 11. 15. The ſeventh Angel ſounded, and there were
great voices in Heaven, ſaying, The Kingdoms of this world are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Chriſt; and He ſhall reign
for ever and ever.</hi> That is, He ſhall ſubdue the kingdoms that
were of this world, and then He ſhall reign; He ſhall reign for
ever and ever. Now they are the kingdoms of this world, but
when He reigns it is in this manner that is here ſpoken of, it is
in another world, as appears in <hi>Heb. 2. 5. For unto the Angels
hath He not put in ſubjection the world to come, whereof we ſpeak.</hi>
Here the Apoſtle ſhews that Chriſt is above the Angels, for he
hath not put in ſubjection the world to come unto the Angels;
therefore there is a world to come wherein Chriſt ſhall have a
further dominion than yet he hath: and <hi>Adam</hi> was a type of
Jeſus Chriſt in this, <hi>Adam</hi> he had the command of this preſent,
world. Now in this world Chriſt doth rule but in the mideſt
of his Adverſaries, but there is a time coming that Chriſt ſhall
have all under him; as <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency had the whol
world under his feet: And Chriſt doth promiſe unto his people
in the 3. of <hi>Revel 21. To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with
me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame and am ſet down with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his Throne.</hi> Mark, it ſeems there is a Throne of Chriſt
yet that hath not been, for here's a promiſe that he will ſet them
upon his Throne as he ſits upon his Fathers Throne: Now
Chriſt rules together with his Father, but ſaith he, You that
are my Saints, and my Subjects now, you ſhall ſit upon my
Throne.</p>
               <p>I but you will ſay, <hi>That is in Heaven?</hi> (in Heaven indeed the
Saints ſhall reign.)</p>
               <p>Nay, It connot be meant of a kingdom wherein the Saints
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29998:83"/>
ſhall ſit eternally with Chriſt in Heaven; I might give you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Scriptures for that, but I will only give you one Scripture,
1 <hi>Cor 15. 28. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto Him, then
ſhall the Son alſo Himſelf be ſubject unto Him, that put all things under
Him, that God may be All in All.</hi> Here he tells us that there is a
time that God ſhall be All in All, both unto Chriſt, and unto
His Saints; yea, and you ſhall find in this chapter, that Jeſus
Chriſt ſhall give up the kingdom unto the Father, (ſpeaking
of the time of the reſurrection) When all ſhall riſe again; and
when that ſhall come, the kingdom ſhall be delivered up unto
the Father; ſo that this is a time before the general reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that Chriſt ſhall ſit upon the Throne, there is yet a time
between this and the Saints being in Heaven, when the Saints
ſhall ſit upon Chriſts Throne (as he upon his Fathers) in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner than now they do: Therefore ſurely Chriſt ſhall
have the kingdoms of this world ſubdued unto him in another
manner than yet he hath; and for the proof of it, do but reade
the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of the book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and you ſhall find abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of proof, there ſhall be abundant deal of glory in that
kingdom of his, there he ſhall have attendants to purpoſe, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
thouſands adminiſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times
ten thouſand ſtood before Chriſt; and though there was a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Books were brought, yet its apparant afterwards,
that the Scripture ſpeaks of a time that ſhould be before the
Saints ſhould come to Heaven; for he ſaith this, <hi>That as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the reſt of the Beaſts, they had their Dominion taken away; yet
their lives were prolonged for a ſeaſon:</hi> Therefore it is not meant at
that time when the Saints ſhall aſcend up into Heaven with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, for the Beaſts had their lives prolonged for a ſeaſon
and time after that: But ſaith he in the 18. ver. <hi>The Saints of the
moſt High ſhall take your Kingdom, and poſſeſs it for ever, even for ever
and ever.</hi> And in the 21. ver. <hi>I beheld, and the ſame born made war
with the Saints, and prevailed againſt them until the Ancient of daies
came, and Judgment was given unto the Saints of the moſt High; and
the time came that the Saints poſſeſſed the Kingdom.</hi> And then in the
27. ver. <hi>And the Kingdom and dominion, and the greateſt of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
under the whol Heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of
the moſt High, whoſe Kingdom is an everlaſting Kingdom, and all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29998:83"/>
Dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi> What Dominions ſhall there
be when the Saints are in the higheſt Heavens, to ſerve and obey
Chriſt? He means the Dominions that are here upon the earth,
ſhall ſerve and obey Chriſt: Therefore the Kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt is not of this world, nor be ſaid hereafter to be ſuch a
world as this is: but when there ſhall be another world, then
Chriſt ſhall have a kingdom that ſhall have ſuch glory as ſhall
be apparent to all; and ſuch a Kingdom as the Kings of the
earth ſhall come and bring their glory to it; as in 21. of <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
you ſhal find, that it's ſaid, <hi>of the Kings of the earth.</hi> Reade
but that deſcription of the glorious condition of the Church of
God there, and you ſhall ſee this true: <hi>And the Nations of them
which are ſaved, ſhal walk in the light of it: and the Kings of the earth
do bring their glory and honor to it.</hi> But that is in another world,
not that world that Chriſt ſpeaks of here in this place of <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only now, do but conſider a little of the excellency of this
point by way of preparation to you for the next time. It
would be a notable Scripture to take off our hearts from all the
things of this world: The right underſtanding of this would
ſpiritualize the hearts of the Saints, would take away the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, would help them to carry
themſelves through this world with a great deal of joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and not much to regard how things go here below. <hi>I
through the mercy of God am brought into the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
And I find the whole tenor of Scripture carries it ſo, that the
Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt is not of this world, but in a ſpiritual
way: Oh then, let me have ſpiritual mercies, let me enjoy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt in way of His ſpiritual Kingdom; and farewell the
world and all things under Chriſt. Truly, Chriſtians are not
acquainted with this point of the ſpiritual Government of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt in His Church, and how God the Father hath ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
things, that <hi>In</hi> this world Chriſt ſhould have a Kingdom,
but not <hi>Of</hi> this world.</p>
               <p>And bleſſed are they that have by the holy Ghoſt an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to underſtand this Myſtery, to ſee the reality of it indeed,
That the Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Priviledges of this Kingdom of Chriſt
they are not of this world. I'le name a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
one; and this is the priviledg of al that
are under the Kingdom of Chriſt; <hi>That all buſineſſes, tranſactions
between God and them, are in the Court of Chriſt the Mediator:</hi> They
are not in the Court of exact &amp; ſevere juſtice, but they are to be
tried for their eternal eſtates, &amp; for all they do, in the Court of
Chriſt, in his Kingdom; which is a mighty priviledg the Saints
have. As kingdoms have ſeveral priviledges: 'tis a greater privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
to be tried in one kingdom than in another: All men and
women in their natural eſtate, not under the kingdom of Chriſt,
they are to be tried in the Court of Juſtice, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Court of Gods
providential kingdom, and there they are either to be acquitted
or condemn'd by the Law; that's the way of Gods proceedings
towards thoſe that are under His providential kingdom, only
to be dealt withal according to the Law. But al thoſe that are
under the kingdom of Chriſt, have all their buſineſſes, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to God, tried in another Court, tried in the Court (as I
may ſo call it) of the Goſpel, in the Judicature of Jeſus Chriſt,
for Chriſt He is as Mediator to them, He is the Judge to paſs all
ſentences concerning them: and the right underſtanding of this
would much help in the point of Beleevers being chaſtiſed for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29998:84"/>
ſin; it's true, they are not chaſtiſed by judgement out of the
court of Law as other men are; but they are chaſtiſed by Chriſt
that hath the Judicature committed to Him, and the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of all things, eſpecially concerning His Church and
People, and by a ſentence from Him chaſtiſed; not by a ſentence
from the Father, as He is the Judge of all fleſh proceeding accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law. This is the main thing which we ſpake to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But yet there are divers other things.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                  <hi>That all that are in Chriſts Kingdom, are Free-men,</hi> they are
delivered from bondage: all that are out of this Kingdom are
bondſlaves, they are under the prince of this world, (that is,
the <hi>Devil)</hi> and in ſlavery unto him; they are all as vaſſals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, in bondage, and have no other ſpirit but a ſpirit of
bondage in them, they are ſlaves to ſin, they are under the curſe
of the Law: But now being brought to the Kingdom of Chriſt,
they are made free, they are free Denizons of Heaven.</p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> And then from hence follows in the third place: <hi>All
that are in Chriſt's Kingdom, have the priviledg of a free-trade to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
they have free traffick to Heaven:</hi> there is now a bleſſed inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
between Heaven and them, that they have by being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this Kingdom: As we know the ſubjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
have many freedoms that forreigners have not, that thoſe
that belong to another Kingdom have nothing to do with. So
the ſubjects of Chriſts Kingdom have a freedom of coming into
Gods preſence, of trading to the promiſed Land that others
have not; others are caſt out of Gods ſight and cannot trade to
Heaven ſo as beleevers do that are brought under the Kingdom
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                  <hi>By vertue of this Kingdom they come to have right unto all the
Ordinances of Chriſt:</hi> And only by this we come (I ſay) to have
right unto them, ſo as to be our own. Indeed, Chriſt for the
ſake of ſuch as are His Elect Ones, that He intends to bring into
His Kingdom, He ſends forth His Word, the preaching of the
Word unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when they are brought into his Kingdom
then they are under the Miniſtry of the Word in another way,
Chriſt then is their great Paſtor and Shepherd, and ſo His Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
are in a more peculiar manner Paſtors &amp; Shepherds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. And beſides, there are other Ordinances that they have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29998:85"/>
nothing to do withal till they be brought into the Kingdom of
Chriſt, namely, the ſeals of the Covenant, with ſome others that
might be named: That's the great privledge of thoſe that are
under the Kingdom of Chriſt, to have right to all Ordinances;
Certainly all Saints and Beleevers, have right unto all, but they
are to come in an orderly way to them.</p>
               <p>5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                  <hi>By being under the Kingdom of Chriſt, there is this Priviledge:
Protection.</hi> As Kings ſhould be the protectors of their ſubjects:
Jeſus Chriſt hath taken upon Him the protectors of their ſubjects:
Jeſus Chriſts hath taken upon Him the protection of all ſuch as
come under Him, all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto
Chriſt, and it is al exerciſed for their protection, to deliver them
from dangers bodily, and ſpiritual, to protect their ſouls, they
are under Chriſts Kingly power for protection; when any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to ſin comes, they ſhould fly unto Chriſt as King, to ſhield
them from their enemies, when their ſpiritual enemies come in
like a floud, then the Spirit of Chriſt ſets up a ſtandard againſt
them.</p>
               <p>6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                  <hi>They ſhall certainly have victory over all their enemies:</hi> This
Kingdom ſhall never be ſhaken, let all the world conſpire what
they will againſt it, the gates of Hel ſhall not prevail againſt it,
no cunning deviſes, no ſubtil waies ſhall ever overcome this
Kingdom, no, nor any one ſubject of this Kingdom. This is
a priviledge beyond what is in the world. A Kingdom may
preſerve its ſelf ſo as to continue a kingdom, but many ſubjects
may be deſtroyed in the preſervation of it: but this is ſuch a
kingdom as there ſhall never one ſubject be deſtroied in it, that
is, Al the enemies ſhal never take off one ſubject from this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
indeed they may take away their bodily lives; but that
is but a transferring of them to the more glorious part of the
kingdom that they ſhall attain to: Then may a ſubject of this
kingdom be ſaid to be deſtroyed, when he ſhall be cut off from
Chriſt and loſe the grace that he hath received: but none ſhall
be thus deſtroyed, but ſhall be preſerved by Chriſt, and ſhall
certainly overcome all enemies, both inward and outward.
And that's a ſixt priviledge.</p>
               <p>7<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                  <hi>By being in this Kingdom, Beleevers are made every one of
them Kings:</hi> though they be ſubjects in ſome ſenſe unto Chriſt,
yet Chriſt hath made them Kings and Prieſts unto God (ſo they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:29998:85"/>
are called in Scripture.) There's no kingdom where all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are Kings; it is ſo here, Chriſt makes all that come under
His kingdom to be Kings, and they have too (according to
their Princely ſtate) the Angels to be their guard; as Kings have
their guard where ever they go; ſo the pooreſt and meaneſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
that is under this kingdom of Chriſt hath his guard of
Angels whereſoever he goes; though it be a poor ſmokey hole or
Cottage that he lives in, yet it is guarded by Angels, every night
they keep the Door and watch about the Bed: Thus the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tells us that the Angels are Miniſtring Spirits for Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
               <p>8<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> The benefit of this kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>It is Spiritual peace,
and joy in the holy Ghoſt:</hi> So in <hi>Rom. 14. 17. The Kingdom of God
conſiſts not in meat and drink, but in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy
in the holy Ghoſt;</hi> There's another manner of peace than the
world gives. So Chriſt in <hi>John, 14. 17. Peace I leave with you,
My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you.</hi> It's
the note of a learned Interpreter ſpeaking of this place, I give
not peace as the world gives; the world gives peace (ſaith he)
by taking away afflictions from a troubled perſon; but Chriſt
gives peace by taking away a troubled perſon from affliction
His meaning is this; the worlds way to give peace is to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
trouble from us, but the way that Chriſt hath is to take
the trouble of our hearts from our affliction; the world cannot
give ſo long as the affliction continues, but Chriſt gives peace
though the affliction doth continue; that's thus, Chriſt He
takes off the troubleſomneſs of mens hearts from the affliction;
the world takes off the affliction from the trouble of mens hearts:
now this is a great deal better peace when the trouble of our
hearts is taken away though the affliction continues, rather
than when the affliction is taken away and trouble of heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.
I give peace, not as the world gives peace, 'tis inward
peace, the worlds is outward, the world takes away ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but I take away the very root of all trouble; the branches
are taken away by the peace of the world; that is, whereas you
had not trading before, nor the freedom of your eſtates before,
you ſhall have that now; but the root of all your trouble the
world cannot take away, that is, <hi>ſin,</hi> but I take away ſin that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:29998:86"/>
is the root of all trouble. We may (through the bleſſing of
God upon Armles, Parliament, we may) come to have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace, that is freedom from outward troubles; Oh but
there may be vexation and trouble in our ſpirits in the mean
time. But Chriſts peace is eſpecially in the conſcience and heart,
within doors; we may have peace here mixed with abundance
of ſin and wickedneſs: it may be procured in a ſinful way, or
it may be the cauſe of much ſin; but my peace is a holy peace, it
doth further holineſs whereſoever I give it, my peace is a laſting
and a ſtable peace; peace here may be but for a few months,
but my peace ſhall be eternally, I give peace not as the world,
that is the fruit of the kingdom of Chriſt: So the truth is,
though there be many outward afflictions attend the Kingdom
of Chriſt, yet the Kingdom of Chriſt is alwaies in peace and in
joy of the holy Ghoſt. That is a priviledge which we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be crowned with but in the kingdom of Chriſt, as we can
never enjoy peace but here, all the peace that mens conſciences
have till they come under the kingdom of Chriſt it will turn
to greater trouble, that peace they have and live looſly, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſubdued to the kingdom of Chriſt will turn to horror and
miſery; and ſo the joy that there is in the world it will turn to
ſorrow and vexation; 'tis proper to the kingdom of Chriſt to
have joy in the holy Ghoſt; thou mayeſt have joy in thy cups,
joy in thy diſhes, joy in thy mirth and wicked company, but 'tis
proper to the kingdom of Chriſt to bring joy unſpeakable and
glorious unto the ſoul; the ſoul never knows experimentally
what the joy of the holy Ghoſt means, till it comes under the
kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, it's the priviledge of the kingdom of
Chriſt to bring ſpiritual peace which paſſeth all underſtanding,
and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, This is a priviledg in the kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>That
all that are in His Kingdom have right to all the gifts and graces of all
the Saints in the world:</hi> Whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephus,</hi> or
<hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Death, all is yours, for you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
They have (I ſay) right to all, all the gifts of all the Miniſters
of the world, and the graces of all the Saints they work for
good unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:29998:86"/>
Tenthly and laſtly, <hi>They are all Heirs of Chriſt with an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Crown of glory, that is laid upon Heaven for them.</hi> Thus Chriſts
Kingdom is not of this world, the priviledges of it are beyond
the worlds, which can only be ſeen by the eye of faith, for they
are ſpiritual and glorious priviledges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If you ask me why it is that God the Father would
not have His Son to have his kingdom in this world? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God might have given to Chriſt all the Government of this
world, might have made Him the great Emperor, to have rul'd
in an external way, and all His Subjects to have been in pomp
and glory here below; but God would not have the kingdom
of His Son here in this world for theſe reaſons,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, Becauſe that hereby He would confound the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the world, and ſhew the vanity of all the things of this
preſent world, and the folly of the hearts of men that are ſet
upon the things of this world; we look upon theſe things as
great things, but God hath ſhewed that he doth not look upon
them as great matters, but as things that have little value and
excellency in them, and therfore He would not have His Son to
have His kingdom here of this world; ſurely if there were ſuch
excellent things here as men dream of, then undoubtedly Chriſt
ſhould have had His Kingdom of this world; but that God
might confound all the glory and non-plus the wiſdom of this
world, therefore he would go another way to work, God would
ſo order things that He would fetch about the glory of his Name
and thoſe great things that he did intend from all eternity, He
would fetch them about in a way that ſhould be hidden from
the eyes of the world, in a way that ſhould appear contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the eyes of the world, and he would by this rebuke and
ſhame all the pride, folly, and vanity of the world, there is no
greater rebuke of the pride, folly, and vanity of the world than
in my Text here, that ſaith, <hi>The Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt is not of
this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe the Lord delights ſo much in the exerciſe of the
graces of His Spirit, the ſpiritual workings of the hearts of His Saints;</hi>
there's nothing that is <hi>ab extra</hi> from God, that is more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to Him than the exerciſes of the graces of His Spirit in the
hearts of His Saints, (excepting what is in the Perſon of Chriſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29998:87"/>
himſelf) nothing more pleaſing in all the works that ever God
made in which He takes more pleaſure than in the exerciſe of
faith, and of humility, and of patience, and the like; and the
holineſs of His Saints. Now the leſs the Kingdom of Chriſt is
of the world, the more bright and glorious do the graces of the
Saints appear, the more do they come to be exerciſed; had the
Saints a worldly glory and pomp here, their graces would not
ſhine forth ſo eminent, there would not be ſuch a ſpiritual lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
and ſhine upon them: but now that God may exerciſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the grace of faith, and humility, and patience, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial,
and brotherly love which are ſo precious to Him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God hath ſo ordered things that the Kingdom of His Son
ſhould not be of this world, but it ſhould be ſpiritual; (it may
be) you think it a ſad affliction that you have not thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
that you ſee others have in the world, you have not ſuch
eſtates and bravery as others have, brave dwellings, coſtly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitures,
and fine cloaths as others have, and you cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for your children as they do; I but is there the exerciſe of
faith in God in the want of theſe things; the exerciſe of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
ſelf-denial, of patience? know that theſe are more glorious
things than if thou didſt ſit upon a Throne with a Crown of
gold upon thy head and a Scepter in thy hand, and al the people
proſtrating themſelves before thee, this were all but a childiſh
vanity in compariſon of the exerciſe of the graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
thou haſt that that is more excellent in the eyes of God and
of His Son, and in the eyes of the bleſſed Angels, far more excel,
lent than theſe outward, pompous, glorious, glittering vanities
that are here: &amp; when thou findeſt by experience that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt is not of this world, Oh then think, that ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God delights much in the exerciſe of the graces of His Spirit
in His Saints: And this is the reaſon why he would not have
the kingdom of Chriſt to be of this world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, <hi>Therefore He would not have it to be of this
world, that hereafter when the Lord ſhall come to fetch out all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from thoſe things that ſeem to be the moſt contrary, that his power and
wiſdom may be more glorious and appear more evidently, that his glory
may be more conſpicuous:</hi> as certainly it will hereafter at the great
Day when the iſſue of all the great deſigns that God had in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29998:87"/>
of Chriſt into the world, when the iſſue of all ſhall come
and be accompliſht, then the Name of God will be ſo much the
more honorable to all eternity, becauſe He hath wrought out
ſuch glorious things, from that which did ſeem to the eye of
fleſh to be ſo mean and contemptible.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>But by way of Application; and that ſhall be built upon the
conſideration of the point more generally; and upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that are named, why the Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this
world.</p>
                  <p>From hence follow, thus much in the firſt place, <hi>That if the
Kingdom of Chriſt be not of this world, then there is a happineſs beyond
the things of this world to be had;</hi> that we muſt certainly conclude
and determin: If we beleeve this point, That Chriſt Kingdom
is not of this world, we muſt lay down this for a certain and
infalible ground that we may build upon, That there is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
to be attained unto that is beyond this world, for ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is a good in the of Chriſt, there is ſomewhat
beyond this world for the ſouls of the children of men to look
after as their cheef good, as their happineſs; that's a confectory
that follows from it. The Kingdom of Chriſt whatſoever it be,
it's a glorious Kingdom, it is the Kingdom of His dear Son (as
the Scripture ſpeaks) and therefore very glorious: And all the
glory of the kingdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> it was but to typifie out the
glory of the Kingdom of Chriſt; now that is not of this world:
therefore there is ſome glory beyond that of this world: and it
is a good ſign of a ſpiritual eye and a ſpiritual heart, to be able
to ſee an excellency and glory that is beyond this world; to be
able to look higher and further than this world can: We think
that all the good things that God hath to communicate to the
children of men, ſhould be here on earth; but I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of it: Can we think in our conſciences that all the good
things that God hath to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate to ſuch as He loves ſhould
be here in this world? Certainly, no. Conſider therefore that
all the good things that God intends for his people are not of
this world.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It's called, <hi>An evil world.</hi> Truly it's no great matter, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:29998:88"/>
we ſhould not account much that the Kingdom of Chriſt is not
of this world, if we conſider theſe things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this world it is an evil world. Gal. 4. <hi>We are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from</hi> this evil world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It's a world, that the Devil (in Scripture) is called the
god of, and the prince of this world;</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>Whoſe eyes the god
of this world hath blinded.</hi> Surely all the good things that God
hath to communicate to His Saints, are not of this world, that
is an evil world, that is a world that the very Devil is god of it
(in ſcripture phraſe.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>A world all whoſe bravery and pomp and glory it is not
of the Father. 1 John,</hi> 2. 16. you have an epitomy there of what
the excellency of the world is; for ſaith he, <hi>All that is in the
world, the luſts of the fleſh, luſts of the eyes, and the pride of life:</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
theſe three heads are all things that the men of the world
look upon as deſirable; either they are the luſts of the fleſh, the
luſts of the eyes, or the pride of life: But ſaith he, <hi>All that is
in the world, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</hi> Surely the chief
things that God hath to communicate to His Saints, are not of
the things of this world; for all that is in the world, is not of
the Father, And wouldeſt not thou have the riches of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
'Tis true, God is the Creator of all things, and hath the
diſpoſe of all things; but that that the men of the world look
upon as the excellent things that are here, they are not of the
Father, they are none of the good things that God the Father
hath to beſtow upon His children; and therefore ſurely, there
is a happineſs beyond the things of this world. Oh my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that I could but ſo take off the hearts of people by this
point from the things of this world, as to make them look after
the Kingdom of Chriſt that is not of this world; for you ſee
that all that is here in the world, the Scripture ſaith, it is not
of the Father.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>As all the excellent things are not of the Father, ſo the
truth is, all the glory that is in the world it is but darkneſs,</hi> it is a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
of darkneſs to a ſpiritual eye: As the Bats can ſee in the
night; ſo the men of the world they think they ſee ſome glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
here in the world; but in the language of Scripture, and to
ſpiritual hearts, it is but darkneſs: Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Eph. 6. 12.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29998:88"/>
For we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities and
powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſs of this world.</hi> Rulers of the
darkneſs of this world are the unclean ſpirits, ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
the Devils are the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world,
this world it hath a darkneſs in it, and therefore ſurely, the chief
good things that God hath to beſtow upon the Saints, they are
things that are beyond this world.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The world knows not God, John, 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 25. The world is
that that Chriſt ſaith, doth not know the Father; <hi>Oh, righteous
Father, the world hath not known thee.</hi> Take men that are the wiſeſt
of the world, and have all the wiſdom that this world can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
it will not help them to the knowledge of the Father, the
world knows not thoſe excellent and glorious things that are
of the Father.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The world it lies in wickedneſs, 1 John,</hi> 5. 19. (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I have opened that Scripture to you) Juſt as you ſee in a
common ſhore, a carion, a dead dog that lies over head and ears
in the mire or mud in a common ſhore, and in its own filthineſs:
ſo the whole world lies in wickedneſs, the wickedneſs of the
world is like the common ſhore, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> there is nothing but filth
and dirt; and the world as a dead carion lies in its own pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
ſurely, then there are other things that God hath to
communicate to his Saints than the things of this world: and
we ſhould not be offended though the Kingdom of Chriſt be not
of this world.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>The world it paſſeth away with the luſts of it, 1 John,
2.</hi> 17. it is a notable Scripture for that: <hi>And the world paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and the luſts thereof; but he that doth the will of God, abideth for
ever,</hi> (ſpeaking before of what was the glory of the world) and
it paſſeth away with the luſts thereof. Mark, Not only the things
of the world paſſeaway, but the very luſts to thoſe things paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
away: As now, men and women who have their healths,
and live bravely for a while, Oh! how greedy are they for the
contents of this world? how do they long and deſire that they
might have ſuch a merry meeting with ſuch friends, and ſuch
cheer, and ſuch commings in; <hi>They make proviſion for the fleſh, to
fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi> But now (mark) within a little while, not
only theſe comforts ſhall be taken from them, but the very luſts
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29998:89"/>
of them ſhall paſſe away; that is, they ſhal have no mind in the
world to them: Take a poor man that was wont to long for
theſe things, when he lieth upon his ſick bed, at the point of
death, now he looks upon theſe things as thoſe things that are
dry leaves, he hath no mind to them, not ſo much as a phanſie
after theſe things, all the varniſh of the things of the world are
gone in his eyes, he taſts them no more than the white of an eg,
yea, the deſire of his heart is dead to them: as now, a man that
luſted after drink, when his deſire is ſatisfied, the very deſire after
it is gon; and one that liv'd in gluttony, when his body is a little
diſtempered, the very luſts therof paſſeth away: ſurely there are
other things that God hath for his people than the things of this
world.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, <hi>There muſt be ſomwhat elſe beſides the things of this world:</hi>
for Chriſt Himſelf is not of this world, <hi>John,</hi> 8. 23. Are all the
good things that the Father hath to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate of this world,
and not Chriſt Himſelf of this world? Let me tell you, Chriſt
is the greateſt gift that ever was given, or poſſibly could be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and yet Chriſt is not of this world; therefore there is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
elſe beſides the things of this world, that God hath for
ſome of the children of men, that He intends good unto.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, The Saints are ſaid, not to be of this world, <hi>Joh. 15.
19.</hi> &amp; 17. 14. If they be not of this world, then their happineſs is
not here, God hath other happineſs for them than that which
is here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tenthly,</hi> The Scripture makes it to be a ſign of a child of wrath
that he walks according to the courſe of this world <hi>(in</hi> 2 Joh. 2.) <hi>this
is enough to deſcribe a child of wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, <hi>It's made a ſign of one that is an enemy to God;</hi> and
that's hateful before God, that is a lover of this world, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 4.
And 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 15. He that loves the world, the love of the Father is not
in him; and the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God</hi> (ſaith the
Holy Ghoſt in thoſe two Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) If ſo be that in the world
there were the ſpecial things that God hath to communicate to
the Children of men; certainly then God would have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to love the world, He would ſay, Love theſe things, for theſe
are the fruits of my favor and love, theſe are part of the riches
that I have to communicate to thoſe that I intend good to; and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29998:89"/>
therefore delight in theſe, expatiate your heart in theſe: Oh
me! ſaith the holy Ghoſt, whoſoever loves the world is an enemy
to God. And, if the love of the world be in you, the love of the
Father is not in you: ſurely then here are not the things that
God intends for the children of men.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, <hi>The world is that that ſhall be condemned: 1 Cor. 11. 32.
That ye may not be condemned with the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that notes that God
intends to condemn this whol world, all theſe things are under
the ſentence of death, and all the men of the world are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before God; and therefore theſe are not the things that
men ſhould ſo much look after to make them happy.</p>
                  <p>Thirteenthly, Take all the world together; the Scripture
ſpeaks by way of ſuppoſition, <hi>That a man may gain the whol world,
and yet his ſoul be loſt for ever;</hi> If one man could get all the world
in to his poſſeſſion and thereby loſe his ſoul, it would be an ill
bargain; the world then hath no ſuch excellency in it as we
ſhould place our happineſs in it; God hath ſomething elſe for
His people than theſe things that are at the beſt under Moon-vanities.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenthly, <hi>If Chriſts Kingdom is not of this world; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
thoſe that are of the world are not of His Kingdom;</hi> for theſe
two cannot ſtand together, that Chriſts Kingdom ſhould not be
of this world, and yet that theſe that are of the world ſhould be
of his Kingdom, if ſuch as are of the world are none of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
then certainly a worldly man or woman is not of the
kingdom of Chriſt, Chriſt owns them not as under His king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
they are Vagabonds and Runnagates not under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of Jeſus Chriſt, not partakers of any priviledg of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> You will ſay to me, How ſhould one know when a man
is a man of this world? The Scripture makes a plain diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome that are of this world, and ſome not; the beſt of all
you will ſay they have hearts worldly enough, and they deſire
to have the comforts of this world as well as others? well,
though there are ſome, yet we had need look to our ſelves; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
whether we be of the world yea or no, for there lies thus
much upon it, that if we be of the world we are not of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt; now I would give you but theſe three notes of
a man of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:29998:90"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt is this, <hi>One that is a man of the world is ſuch an
one as could be content if God would let him live here in this world, and
enjoy what he doth, he would be content for to live here for ever, and
could be ſatisfied though he never enjoyed any thing from God but what
he hath received here, if he might alwaies bold it.</hi> Here's an evident
Argument of a man of the world, I mean ſuch a man as hath
health of body in this world, he hath for outwards as much as
the world can afford any man, that for the properneſs of his
body, his comlineſs, his health, he hath as much as the world
can give, he hath convenient dwelling, with all accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
belonging thereunto, and he hath the comings in of the
world as much as his heart can deſire, he hath his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
about him, in which he hath a great deal of delight and
content; now, I would but put it to this man, What ſayeſt thou?
would not this ſatisfie thy heart if thou mighteſt alwaies be here,
alwaies have thy houſe, and gardens, and walks, and theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
in that thou haſt now, that thou mighteſt fare deliciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
every day, and have the ſweet and fat of the world, would it
not ſatisfie thy ſoul, though God ſhould never give thee any
thing elſe but this?</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you, in your own thoughts, anſwer even to God this
queſtion, and ſeriouſly look into your hearts, for you may know
very much of your hearts upon the anſwer to this queſtion, you
may come to know what is like to become of you for ever, even
from the anſwer that your conſciences would give to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:
That man or woman whoſe conſcience tels them that
this would ſatisfie, then we may conclude, that ſurely that man
or woman is of this world; becauſe the things of this world
would be enough for his portion: But now take a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that is choſen out of this world, that is of the Kingdom of
Jeſus Chriſt, unto whom the Lord hath made known the things
of another world and the excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuch
a one though it had ten thouſand times more than it hath,
though it had what poſſibly can be imagined, it would ſay, Lord,
it's true, I am unworthy of the leaſt crum of bread that I eat, or
of the leaſt drop of water, but yet it is not all the world, nor
ten thouſand worlds can ſatisfie my ſoul, for the portion of it, It
is nothing but thy ſelf, the unſearchable riches in Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29998:90"/>
thoſe bleſſed things that thou haſt revealed in that glorious
kingdom of thy Son, it's only that that can ſatisfie my ſoul for
the portion of it; and if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, well, thou ſhalt
have all the things in this world for thy portion and enjoy them
for ever; I ſhould account my ſelf in a miſerable condition, for
thou haſt revealed better and higher things to my ſoul; this
would be the anſwer of one that is choſen out of the world that
hath a gracious heart and is brought under the Kingdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. A ſecond note that I would give to know, whether a man be
a man of this world or no, is this, <hi>A man of this world is one that
accounts the poſſeſſions of worldly comforts, to be greater rices than any
riches conteined in the promiſes;</hi> that looks upon the comforts of
this world as real things, they have them in poſſeſſion: But looks
upon the promiſe, as that that hath but a notion in it, as if there
were no ſuch reality and excellency in the things of the promiſe;
a man that dares not truſt God upon his word upon his promiſe
without ſeeing in a way of reaſon or ſence how things may come
in unto him for ſupply from the things of this world; this is a
man of the world, he hath a promiſe, but things go very ill
with him in reſpect of his outward eſtate, in reſpect of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
by ſence or reaſon he is able to diſcern, he looks upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as miſerable, if indeed God would give him in the things of
the world in real poſſeſſion, that would ſatisfie him, but not the
promiſe: This is an evidence of a worldly heart, that regards
more the poſſeſſion of the things of the world than the promiſe
of God for proviſion for him; as for promiſes, he thinks that
that man is but in a ſad condition, that hath nothing but bare
promiſes to live upon; here's a worldly heart that hath low and
mean thoughts of the promiſes. But now, one who is taken
out of this world, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt, regards more to have a promiſe to live upon, than to
have poſſeſſions to live upon: Promiſes in the word are greater
and more real things to that ſoul than any Bills or Bonds from
men can be, he can live better upon a Promiſe, than upon Bils,
or Bonds, or Leaſes, or any ſuch things in the world: Haſt thou
found ſuch a principle within thee, that canſt cloſe with the
promiſe, and canſt bleſs thy ſelf in the promiſes, I have title to,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29998:91"/>
and an intereſt in many promiſes in the Book of God, for life
and godlineſs are more to me than all the treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and though I do not enjoy ſo much in the hand as others, yet
my heart hath enough, becauſe it is poſſeſt by Chriſt, in whom
all the promiſes are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> that is, ſure and infallible.
<hi>God is faithful who hath promiſed;</hi> this is an argument that thou
art taken out of the world, and taken into the Kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt; but otherwiſe, thou that canſt not truſt God for thy
outward eſtate, body and ſoul upon a promiſe, this is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of one that hath his heart ſet on the world.</p>
                  <p>3 A third ſign of a man of this world, is this, A man of the
world <hi>bleſſes thoſe that are like himſelf, looks upon and meaſures the
happineſs or miſery of other men, according to what they do enjoy, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what they do enjoy in this world.</hi> They call the proud,
happy; I mean by this they meaſure the happineſs of other men,
according to what they have of the world, and think that the
meer enjoying of worldly accommodations is enough to make
men happy, notwithſtanding they ſee them to be very wicked
and ſinful, yet ſo long as they flouriſh as a green bay tree, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in them and with them, yea, get themſelves in the midſt
of the guilt that is upon them, when conſcience (as a woolf in
their boſom) flyes in their faces, yet they can bleſſe themſelves
in the enjoyment of outward comforts, and ſet that againſt any
trouble of mind whatſoever, as if ſo be it were enough to make
up their comforts: I have been at ſuch a place, and contracted
ſuch guiltineſs upon my ſoul, committed ſuch ſins, Oh! what
ſhall comfort me now? well, he comes home, and ſees all wel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, his houſe furniſhed, his table ſpread, means coming
in as a floud, and this quiets him: here's a worldly heart:
whereas were the heart taken off from the world, the poſſeſſion
of al under Chriſt would never calm a conſcience that hath any
guilt upon it; when I have contracted any guilt upon my ſoul,
although I ſee all well about me, Oh! till I have an aſſurance
from the Holy Ghoſt the Witneſs of the Spirit, that the guilt of
my ſin is waſht away in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, what wil all
theſe do me good? I have theſe and theſe comforts, Oh! but I
have an unclean conſcience, a leprous ſoul: Doeſt thou ſet the
good things here to countervail the evil of ſin? Certainly, thou
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29998:91"/>
art a man of the world, thy name is written in the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou
art but living duſt and aſhes at the beſt. And the world is like to
be the only portion of thy ſoul, thou art a ſtranger to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Jeſus Chriſt. That's a ſecond Uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. The third Uſe ſhould have been this: Here we ſee the
main thing that doth hinder people from the Kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt: What is that which keeps off men from coming under
the Scepter of this King of Saints, from ſubjecting themſelves to
His Kingdom? Certainly, this point ſhews it cleerly, His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is not of this world, were the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt of
this world, then people would flock into it, Who would not
joyn in ſuch a Kingdom and be a member therof, where he could
have worldly glory and pomp and riches and bravery; but now
becauſe it is not of this world, therefore they ſlight it: As I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
we reade in the Goſpel of <hi>Herod,</hi> that when he heard of
the great Miracles that Chriſt wrought, <hi>Herod</hi> ſent for Chriſt,
and he longed a great while to ſee Jeſus Chriſt, but when Chriſt
came, and he ſaw Him a poor, mean, contemptible man to the
outward eye, he thought to have ſeen him to have done ſuch and
ſuch great things, and to have been ſuch a man as not the like
upon the earth. But Chriſt contemn'd <hi>Herod</hi> as much as <hi>Herod</hi>
contemn'd Him, and Chriſt would not ſhew his glory before
<hi>Herod,</hi> but appeared in his outward meaneſs, and the text ſaith,
Herod <hi>ſet Him at naught,</hi> he ſet Him at naught, when he ſaw him
ſo outward contemptible: And ſo it is reported of the Roman
Emperors, that hearing that Chriſt ſhould be the King of the
Jews, and that out of <hi>Davids</hi> ſtock there ſhould come a King
of the Jews, they ſought to deſtroy all of that family that they
could find out, and all the Tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> But afterward, when
they found out ſome that were of the Kindred of Jeſus Chriſt,
and ſaw that they were poor laboring men, that labored with
their hands to eat their bread by the ſweat of their brows, they
ſet them at naught and contemn'd them; certainly, this is the
great offence to the world, that the Kingdom of Chriſt is not of
the world, and as Chriſt ſaith, Wo to the world, becauſe of
offences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo wo to the world becauſe of this great offence, Chriſts
Kingdom being ſo ſpiritual, hence it is that the world receives
Him not, in 1. <hi>John,</hi> 10. And ſo in <hi>John, 14. 17. Even the ſpirit
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29998:92"/>
of truth whom the world cannot receive:</hi> Mark, the world cannot
receive the ſpirit of Truth, the world receives not Chriſt, and
it cannot receive the ſpirit of Truth. If you ſpeak of the world
to men, then they ſavor of thoſe things, come to a man and
tell him of a good bargain on the Exchange, he will liſten to
you, and remember what you ſay, but come and ſpeak to him
of the great things of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
priviledges of that kingdom, only there's a ſound in the air,
and it paſſeth away, and takes no impreſſion at all on the heart
of one that is carnal, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 4. 5. there you have this expreſt
fully, the very guize and way of a carnal heart, <hi>They</hi> (ſaith the
text) <hi>are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world: and the world
heareth them:</hi> thoſe that are of the world, they ſpeak of the world,
and diſcourſe of the world, and ſavor the things of the world,
and the world heareth them; but now, let a man come and tell
them of things that are heavenly, of a goodly Pearl, of Jeſus
Chriſt, they ſavor not thoſe things; and they hear them not:
Oh! 'tis from hence that men come not into the Kingdom of
Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it is not of this world. What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that there are more comes into the Kingdom of Antichriſt,
than into the Kingdom of Chriſt? <hi>Revel. 13. 3. The whol world
wandered after the beaſt,</hi> ſaith the text, becauſe they are of the
world, and Antichriſt doth ſet up a worldly kingdom inſtead
of Chriſts kingdom, and men that are of the world they flock
after Antichriſt, and hence it was, that your great rich men in
places where the Goſpel hath not been, they were Papiſts, or
Popiſhly affected, ſo that therefore the Papiſts make outward
proſperity to be one badge or ſign of the true Church; hence it
is that Popery is ſo ſutable to worldly hearts, and the holy
Ghoſt propheſied before hand, that the whol world ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Antichriſt, only here and there a few poor ones Jeſus
Chriſt chuſes out of this world to follow him, for His Kingdom
is not of this world.</p>
                  <p>One Particular more, in a word, ſeeing the Kingdom of
Chriſt is not of the world, then a worldly heart is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming
thing in one that profeſſeth himſelf to be a Chriſtian,
of any thing that can be in the world: If Chriſts Kingdom be
not there, certainly thy heart ſhould not be there: Thou that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:29998:92"/>
profeſſeſt thy ſelf to be of the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and heavenly, and yet thou a worldly earthly heart, I
ſay, it is the moſt unbeſeeming thing that poſſibly can be: what,
for a Profeſſor of Religion to have an earthly, covetous worldly
heart?</p>
                  <p>By that that I have already ſpoken in ſhewing the vanity and
the evil of the world, and the great evil of loving the world
were enough to ſtrengthen this uſe; but now that that I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhould have been to ſpeakeſp, ecially to thoſe that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
that have hopes that God hath made them partakers of
Jeſus Chriſt, and would be loth to loſe their hopes in the good
things of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt for 10000. worlds, &amp; yet
there doth remain much worldlineſs in their hearts to this day,
ſurely, this not beſeeming one of the profeſſion that thou makeſt,
it is no honor unto thy King, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; worldly
Profeſſors, they are great diſhonors to the Kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt; when there ſhall appear no difference between thoſe
that we account to be men of the world, and ſuch as we hope
are choſen out of the world; Oh! how is Chriſt diſhonored by
this? Look but upon the lives of Chriſtians that profeſs Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and one would think that the Kingdom of Chriſt were a
Kingdom of this world rather than any thing elſe, for I ſay, to
outward appearance, though it may be Chriſt may ſee ſome
integrity within the heart, yet to outward appearance there is
even almoſt no difference between them and the men of the
world.</p>
                  <p>It doth become Chriſtians to live ſo in their whol courſe, as
to make it appear that they are men and women above the
world, whoſe Converſations are in Heaven, that they do beleeve
the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt that is not of this world.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT this Kingdom of Chriſt was, and
how different from the kingdoms of this
world we have already opened unto you.
The fourth Uſe which we are to proceed
in, is, If the kingdom of Chriſt be not of
this world, then of all diſpoſitions, a
worldly ſpirit is moſt unſutable to thoſe
who profeſs themſelves to be of the Kingdom of Chriſt.
Certainly, then ſuch as are Beleevers, that are come under
the Kingdom of Chriſt, they muſt not be of earthly hearts:
We find the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> doth
rank Covetouſneſs, and Uncleanneſs together, and ſaith
of them both, in the 5. Chapter, 3. Verſe, <hi>Let it not be once
named among you, as becometh Saints:</hi> So that a covetous
heart after the things of the world, it is ſuch a diſpoſition,
as it ſhould ſcarce be named among Saints no more than
whoredom, they ſhould abſtain from it, as from whordom,
<hi>as it becometh Saints.</hi> It is the moſt uncomly thing for a
Saint of God, one of the Kingdom of Chriſt to have a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
heart for the things of the world, that poſſibly
can be. <hi>As it becomes them;</hi> it doth not become you; And
<hi>Luther</hi> that was a great man for the promoting of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt, he is bold to profeſs it; That of all ſins, he
was ſcarce ever tempted to that ſin, he found nothing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
almoſt that way; though it's true, there's no ſin, but
we have the ſeeds of it in our hearts; but yet he found his
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:29998:93"/>
ſpirit moſt above that worldly ſin, becauſe he was ſo much
taken up with Jeſus Chriſt. And indeed, the more any
ſoul is taken up with the excellency of Chriſt, and with
the glorious things of His Kingdom, the more vile will the
things of the world be to them. <hi>We look not at the things that
are ſeen</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) they are not things to be looked
at, <hi>But at the things that are not ſeen.</hi> And in the 6. of the <hi>Gal.
14.</hi> ver. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that was the great man for the
promoting of Chriſt in the world, and the ſetting up of His
Throne; he profeſſes, <hi>That he was crucified to the world, and the
world was crucified to him:</hi> That is, he look't upon the world,
but as a crucified thing. What eſteem would you have of
a man that is hanging upon a gallows? All the world was
to him no otherwiſe, was a thing crucified to him, and he
was crucified to the world, the world cares not for me, and
I care not for the world, I am quit with it that way, and do
as much ſlight, and contemn the world, and trample it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot, as the world ſlights and contemns me, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
me under foot. This ſhould be the diſpoſition of a
Chriſtian that is under the kingdom of Chriſt: for now it
is to converſe with things of another nature: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you find that Chriſt, He ſaith of thoſe that are given
to Him by the Father, They are given unto Him out of the
world: <hi>John, 17. 6. I have manifeſted thy Name to the men
whom thou haſt given me out of the world.</hi> No men have Chriſt
manifeſted unto them, but thoſe whom the Father doth
give Him out of the world: Saith the Father, Here's ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the world, And there are a ſelect company that I wil
take out of this rude heap and maſs of man-kind; and I'le
give them to thee: Take them, and manifeſt thy ſelf unto
them. If this be ſo, that thoſe that come under Chriſt's
Kingdom, are given unto Him out of the world, then
though they live in the world, they ſhould not live as of the
world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They are choſen out of the world, John, 15. 19.
And they are delivered from the world by Chriſt. Gal. 1. 4. And
they are oppoſed to the children of the world. Luke,</hi> 16. 8, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:29998:94"/>
of divers ſorts of people; and makes the diſtinction
between one and another: The Lord commended the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
ſteward becauſe he had done wiſely: <hi>For the children of
this world are, in their generation, wiſer than the children of light:</hi>
Theſe two are oppoſed one to another, the children of
this world and the children of light are quite contrary one
to another; for indeed one is in the kingdom of darkneſs,
and the other in the Kingdom of light, in the Kingdom of
the dear Son of God; you muſt be children of light, others
are children of the world; it becomes a child of the world
to follow after the things of the world; but not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of light: <hi>You are choſen out of the world, that you may be
the light of the world.</hi> So the Scripture ſpeaks of the Saints,
That they ſhould be the light of the world: <hi>Philippians,
2.</hi> 15. Now if they have as worldly hearts as others, how
can they be the <hi>lights</hi> of the world? Oh! many that are
Profeſſors of Religion, they are indeed but dark lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns,
they have a candle in them, have ſome kind of
knowledg, but by their worldly Converſations they are
made but as dark lanthorns, that the light of knowledg
and profeſſion that they have is ſo darkned by it, as none
can ſee the beauty and excellency of Jeſus Chriſt ſhining
through them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Surely it is a very unbeſeeming diſpoſition in
one that is under the Kingdom of Chriſt to be worldly:
for he is appointed to be one that ſhall judge the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
day, In 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 2. The Saints ſhall judge the world.</hi>
Now there ſhould be a great deal of difference between
Judges, and thoſe that are judged by them: if they be of
the ſame diſpoſition that the world is, why ſhould any be
choſen out of the world to judge them? Now all the
Saints if they do beleeve themſelves to be brought into the
Kingdom of Chriſt, they ſhould look upon themſelves as
thoſe that are appointed by God hereafter to judge the
whol world, and therefore they ſhould not live ſo as the
men of the world do, but as Judges, very preciſely and
ſtrictly according to rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:29998:94"/>
4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> It is required of them that they ſhould hate their own
lives in this world, <hi>John,</hi> 12. 15. Now if the Saints ſhould
be ſuch as ſhould ſee ſo much excellency in the Kingdom of
Chriſt as to hate their very lives in this world, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to look upon all things in this world as contemptible as
hateful in compariſon: it is not meant <hi>Hate their lives,</hi> that
is, <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> but in <hi>Compariſon:</hi> when any comfort or
preſervation of their lives in this world, comes in the leaſt
competition with the furtherance of the Kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt: They ſhould look upon the comforts of their lives
as a hateful thing, and look upon the very preſervation of
their lives as a hateful thing; ſhall I make my life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
with any hindrance unto the Kingdom of Chriſt?
Oh 'tis that that my ſoul ſhould abhor, and ſo ſhould I
preſerve my life with doing any thing that may be any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the Kingdom of Chriſt, I ſhould look upon the
very ſuggeſtion to ſuch a thing as that that my very ſoul
doth abhor, And we find in Scripture that it's made an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of apoſtaſie, of one that's falling off from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Chriſt to imbrace the world, as it is ſaid of <hi>Demas</hi>
in the 2 of <hi>Tim. 4. 10. Demas</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) hath forſaken me,</hi>
but what is it that hath made <hi>Demas</hi> to forſake me? he hath
imbraced this <hi>preſent world.</hi> So look upon many of your
Profeſſors of Religion, ſuch vs have been very forward in
former times, and Oh nothing but Chriſt in their mouthes,
they afterward begin to decline, and wax worſer and
worſer, but obſerve them, they imbrace this preſent
world, it is becauſe of ſome honors and eſteem, ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
riches, &amp; eſtates that they would have, or live at eaſe
in this preſent world, they cannot endure the hatred of
the world. So it was with <hi>Demas,</hi> when he began to hear
<hi>Paul,</hi> he perceived that it was a great excellency to be one of
<hi>Pauls</hi> followers, <hi>Paul,</hi> he wrought miracles, and <hi>Demas</hi> (I
ſay) thought it an excellent thing to follow <hi>Paul;</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had followed <hi>Paul</hi> a while, he found that he was
perſecuted, and he ſaw there was no preferment came in
by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, nothing but blows and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:29998:95"/>
and ſcorns, and contempt, then <hi>Demas</hi> begins to
bethink himſelf better, and thinks he was miſtaken; I
had thought that this <hi>Paul</hi> would have been a great man
in the world one day, and that by my following of him I
ſhould get great matters to my ſelf, but when he ſaw that
all men were ſet againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> and nothing but perſecution
was like to betide him, and his Diſciples; <hi>Demas</hi> begins to
bethink himſelf, And is it not better for me to keep my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and eſteem in this world; ſo <hi>Demas</hi> leaves him to ſhift
for himſelf: and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Demas hath
forſaken me, and imbraced this preſent world.</hi> This may be
written upon every Apoſtates grave, <hi>Here lies an Apoſtate that
hath forſaken Jeſus Chriſt, and hath imbraced this preſent world.</hi>
But obſerve it, and look upon thoſe that were forward in
Religion, and now are not; and ſee whether they have not
more worldly hearts than before, and give themſelves up
to honors, and pleaſures, and profits; Therefore it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
unbeſeeming the Saints to have worldly hearts,
they will certainly Apoſtatize, if their hearts take deep root
in the earth. If you find your ſpirits ſo glewed to the things
of the world, that you know not how to part with them,
that you know not how to live in a place, and not to have
your neighbors love and reſpect, and to honor you, and
to have the countenance of the times in which you live;
Do you find your hearts thus cleaving to the things of the
world, like the Serpent, that duſt you eat, and upon your
belly you go? Know that thou haſt a worldly heart, &amp; thou
art like to be an Apoſtate from the Truth of God ere long.
In the 2. of <hi>Titus,</hi> 12. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the grace of God
that hath appeared to all men, teaches them to deny all worldly
luſts.</hi> Oh my brethren! let's labor to walk worthy of our
Calling into the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 12.
There the Apoſtle with a great deal of earneſtneſs ſpeaks to
the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> exhorting them, that they would, <hi>Walk
worthy of God, who hath called them into his Kingdom, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
Are you converted to Chriſt? you are called into this
Kingdom; walk worthy of Him: And mark his earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

in the verſe before, <hi>As you know, how we exhorted, and
comforted, and charged every one of you, (as a father doth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.)</hi>
We comforted you, in ſhewing you the excellency
of the Kingdom of God, and the Priviledges of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
we exhorted you, and we charged every one of you,
as a father doth his children; And what did he exhort,
and charge them to? it was this, That they would walk
worthy of God, who had called them into his Kingdom,
and his glory. Oh! 'tis a great mercy that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
any thing of the Kingdom of his Son unto you, walk
worthy of it, as it becomes thoſe that are called to be the
Subjects of ſuch a glorious Kingdom as this is; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things, have a care, and let me warn you of this
worldlineſs in the hearts of the Saints: Namely, of a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
cunning ſubtilneſs in the things of this life; there is
nothing more unbeſeeming a Chriſtian, than a crafty cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſubtilneſs for the world: many men bleſs themſelves
in this, and they take abundance of content to think, that
by their craft and cunning ſophiſtry, they can fetch about
things, circumvent others, &amp; ſo provide for themſelves in
this world: (I ſay) there is nothing more unbeſeeming a
Chriſtian, than to be crafty and cunning in circumventing
others, and providing for themſelves in the matters of this
world. In 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We have not received
the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God,</hi> it is that
we have received. There is many men (you may plainly
ſee that) they have the ſpirit of the world, that's thus: I
have many times wondered at it; ſome men, come and
ſpeak to them about any matters of the Kingdom of Chriſt,
they ſpeak ſo fooliſhly and childiſhly, either they muſt
hold their peace, and ſay nothing, or elſe if they do ſpeak
they diſcover ſo much ignorance, and childiſhneſs that a
man would wonder where the underſtandings of ſuch men
are that have liv'd ſo long a time in the world as they have
done, and heard ſo much of Religion, and when one
hears them ſpeak ſo, one would wonder how theſe men
ſhould have underſtanding to live in the world: but now,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:29998:96"/>
theſe in the buſineſſes of the world they are as worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
no man can out go them there, they can foreſee all
kind of dangers in any miſcarriage, and can judge of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
things together in their thoughts, and compare one
thing with another, ſee further into the world than other
men; ſo that a man would wonder ſometimes (I ſay)
when one hears them ſpeaking of Religion, whether
theſe men have any wit or underſtanding? but when one
follows them in the things of the world, you ſhall ſee them
as witty, as underſtanding, as judicious, and as cunning
as any men (almoſt) can be: they have received the ſpirit
of the world, and they are led by the ſpirit of the world,
the god of this world hath taken poſſeſſion of them, and
it's that that makes them ſo: but they have not received the
Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, they may ſay quite contrary to the
Apoſtle; ſaith the Apoſtle, we have not received the <hi>ſpirit of
the world, but the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> they may ſay, we have
not received the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt, but of the world:</hi> it's true,
Chriſt would have us ſo long as we live in the world, to be
as <hi>wiſe as ſerpents,</hi> yet <hi>innocent as doves;</hi> the wiſdom that is for
the promotion of the Kingdom of Chriſt it is a wiſdom that
hath an upright plaineſs in it, and is according to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the Goſpel; indeed when they have to deal with
wicked men, they may exerciſe a natural wiſdom, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the dangers of perſecution, or to avoid the circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of wicked men; but when they have to deal with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things, there the wiſdom is that that holds forth a
ſimplicity of the Goſpel, that is carried on with plaineſs
and ſimpleneſs of heart. The Hebrews have the ſame
word that ſignifies a <hi>naked man,</hi> and a <hi>cunning ſubtil man.</hi>
You ſhall find where it's ſaid of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> they were
<hi>naked,</hi> nakedneſs of ſpirit and ſubtilty may ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they ſignifie the ſame thing, to ſhew what kind of
ſubtilty ſhould be in thoſe that are the People of God, it
ſhould be that that may ſtand with a naked ſpirit, ſo as if
God would diſcover the ſecrets of all their hearts to all
the children of men, that they ſhould not be aſhamed to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:29998:96"/>
have all their ſecrets to be opened to them: But now, the
cunningneſs, that is, the cunningneſs of the ſerpent, is ſuch
a cunningneſs, as men (if they were but laid open) would
quickly be aſhamed of. And ſo much of the fourth uſe,
that it is unbeſeeming thoſe that are of the kingdom of
Chriſt, to have the ſpirit of the world, becauſe Chriſts
kingdom is not of this world.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Hence we ſee the reaſon of the meanneſs of the
outward condition of the people of God in this world,
why is it that Chriſt hath ſo ordered things that the people
of God ſhould be ſo outwardly poor in this world? <hi>My
Kingdom is not of this world</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) Therefore, why
ſhould any that come under my kingdom look for great
things in this world? they muſt look to have their comfort
and glory in things that concern my Kingdom, and not
in the things of this world: in <hi>Pſal. 73. 12. Behold! thoſe
that are ungodly proſper in this world,</hi> (ſaith the Scripture.)
As for men that are godly and come under the Kingdom of
Chriſt, they muſt look for a proſperity that is beyond this
world; God gives the earth to the children of men, and
to the men of the world: Let them proſper ſaith God, here's
their portion, here's all that they are like ever to have. But
now for the people of God, they muſt not look to proſper
outwardly in this world; <hi>John, 16. 33. In the world, you
ſhall have trouble</hi> (ſaith Chriſt.) Chriſt does tell His Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
plainly beforehand, That in the world they ſhall have
trouble; never make account to have eaſe and proſperity
here below in the world; Certainly you ſhall have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
this is not your kingdom; and therefore <hi>John,</hi> in the
1. of <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. ver. There he ſtiles himſelf in writing to the
Churches: <hi>Your Companion in tribulation, and in the Kingdom
and patience of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Obſerve it, <hi>John</hi> that was ſuch
an Eminent Member of the Kingdom of Chriſt; when he
ſpeaks unto others that are brought into the kingdom of
Chriſt, ſaith he, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> who alſo am your Brother, and
Companion in Tribulation, and in the kingdom, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of Jeſus Chriſt: Theſe two may well ſtand together,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:29998:97"/>
to be of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and companions of men
in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and in Tribulation: yea, mark
how the Kingdom of Chriſt is ſet in the middle, Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Tribulation, and then Kingdom, and then patience;
So that trouble, and afflictions are on both ſides (as it
were) of the Kingdom of Chriſt. And it's very obſervable
here, <hi>John</hi> he doth not to get himſelf credit, ſay, I <hi>John</hi>
that was the Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, I <hi>John,</hi> that was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, I <hi>John,</hi> that was a Kinſ-man
of Jeſus Chriſt: no, but I <hi>John,</hi> your Companion in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and in the Kingdom, and patience of Jeſus Chriſt.
If you would be the Companion of the Saints in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Jeſus Chriſt, you muſt be willing to be their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
in Tribulation, and in the patience of Jeſus Chriſt.
So things are ordered by Chriſt, that the Saints ſhould be
in Tribulation, live in trouble in this world. When any of
you that are godly ſhall meet with croſſes, and afflictions,
(the briers and thornes which ſpring out of the world
ever ſince it was curſed by God) the very thought of this
Text may be a means to quiet your hearts, and not to have
any riſings in your boſomes againſt the diſpenſations of
God towards you: Do not I deſire to fear the Lord, and
follow Him in all His waies? and yet, how doth the Lord
croſs me in this world? Theſe murmuring, and repining
thoughts will be; yea, it may be ſince the time that God
wrought upon me by His Word, I am more afflicted than
before; Is not God diſpleaſed with me? it may be I am not
in the right way becauſe of theſe afflictions. Oh take heed
of theſe temptations, let my text come into your minds,
and anſwer all theſe temptations: Chriſt ſaith, His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is not of this world: ſince the time I was called out of
darkneſs by the Miniſtry of the Word, no mervail though
I meet with afflictions more than before, for I am tranſlated
into another Kingdom, which is not of this world; it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Father to make Chriſt (who is my Captain) to be
perfect through ſufferings: <hi>Heb. 2. 10. For it became Him,
for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:29998:97"/>
many ſons unto glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
through ſufferings:</hi> It's an excellent Scripture to quiet
the hearts of the Saints in the midſt of their ſufferings. [It
became Him] (ſaith the Text) for whom are all things,
and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation perfect
through ſufferings: The Captain of your ſalvation,
yea, your King, that is the King of glory, yet He was
made perfect through ſufferings. Now you muſt go the
ſame way that He did. Now if you muſt enter into a full
poſſeſſion of this glorious Kingdom through ſufferings,
why ſhould you murmur? <hi>Luke, 24. 26. Ought not Chriſt
to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into His Glory?</hi> It's a
ſpeech of Chriſt Himſelf. So I ſay concerning you: Ought
not you to ſuffer firſt, and then to enter into your glory?
Why ſhould not you come to the fulneſs of the glory of
that Kingdom that is prepared for you; as Jeſus Chriſt
your Head came to the fulneſs of the glory of His Kingdom?
It was by ſuffering. Remember His Kingdom is not of this
world.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Vſe.</hi> Here's the reaſon why the wicked hates the
Saints. Why? they love their own: <hi>John, 15. 19. If you
were of the world, the world would love you; but you are not of
the world, therefore the world hates you;</hi> you are tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another Kingdom, and therefore their ſpirits are bitter
againſt you, and their tongues as ſharp as two edged
ſword; you come to live by other Laws than they do;
they know no other Law but the Law of the Land where
they live but you have other Laws that they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the authority of, you have other rules for your
conſciences than they have; their conſciences can yeeld to
this, or that, according as may ſerve for their worldly
ends; but now your conſciences are ſubjected to another
authority, you cannot have your conſciences yeeld up and
down as they can, and thereupon they think it to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in you, but God knows it to be otherwiſe: And
they wonder at this, they underſtand not the reaſon of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:29998:98"/>
this, and therefore it is that they malign you, they hate
you with a perfect hatred, you are Rebels againſt their
kingdom, they are under the kingdom of Satan, but you
are brought under the kingdom of Chriſt, and ſo do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
againſt that kingdom. We hate Rebels. It's true, in
ſome ſenſe all the Saints are Rebels, that is, they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
againſt the kingdom of Satan, and the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and if any thing ſhould be enjoyed by men, yet if
it be againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt, they cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
in a ſenſe, that is, their ſpirits muſt needs be againſt
it, and whatever they ſuffer, they cannot ſubmit to it;
they do not rebel againſt lawful authority, but againſt
the kingdom of darkneſs, and the power of darkneſs; and
therefore it is that the world doth ſo much hate them:
When you come into the kingdom of Chriſt you live upon
other principles, and have other ends, you are a kind of
ſeparated people from the world; and we know there is
nothing more odious to the world, than that we ſhould be
a certain kind of ſeparated people from them; the world
would have all to be like themſelves, and for any kind of
people to make a profeſſion as if they were call'd out
of the world, and live after another kind and faſhion,
and have other ſort of hopes, and comforts, and ends,
and rules by which they live; Oh this the world cannot
endure: ſo long as <hi>Paul</hi> was in the world, and liv'd
as the men of the world, they loved him, and he was a
man of authority among them, but when he was called
out of the world, then a peſtilent fellow, then ſeditious;
this ſeparation from the world it cannot be born, there is
nothing more provokes the world than ſeparation from
the world, and therefore no mervail though the people
of God be hated in the world, and looked upon as the
ringleadees of ſedition: they are ſeparated from the world,
and tranſlated into another kingdom, into a kingdom that
is not of this world.</p>

               <p>You will ſay, How doth it appear? From my Doctrine
it appears thus: If Chriſts kingdom be not a kingdom of
this world, it would do men no hurt at al, it no way would
hinder any lawful comforts or honors here in this world;
it is not oppoſite unto the kingdoms of the world, that is,
ſo as to hinder any thing that is good in the world, the
kingdom of Chriſt may be ſet up, and the world need be
never the worſe for it. Indeed, it doth oppoſe the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
of the world, but it doth not oppoſe any thing
that they dare ſay themſelves to be good <hi>Herod</hi> perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Chriſt, becauſe he heard a King of the Jews was born:
But it was without cauſe; Jeſus Chriſt He did not come to
take the Kingdom of <hi>Herod</hi> away from him: The Kings of
the Earth (the text ſaith) they conſpire together, and are
engaged againſt Chriſt: it is their wickedneſs; Chriſt, He
doth not envy them or their Kingdoms, they may live and
be the Kings of the earth ſtill, and yet the kingdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt may go on; the truth is, that the kingdom of
Jeſus Chriſt doth not intrench upon any Civil Liberty of
men, and it's their hatred to it, that makes them think it
cannot ſtand with Civil Peace; the kingdom of Chriſt may
be ſet up, and Civil Liberty maintained. You may have
your eſtates ſtill, and yet have the kingdom of Chriſt, and
you may be in place of Rule and Government, and have
outward honors ſtill, and yet be of the kingdom of Chriſt.
It's true, if you be brought into the kingdom of Chriſt;
perhaps God may call you ſometimes to ſuffering, but
then it is ſo as you will be willing to it, you ſhall never be
call'd to ſuffering, but you ſhall ſee cauſe to be willing to

His Kingdome without any prejudice at all unto the
worldly Kingdoms, and yet they cannot endure it: You
would account that an ill neighbour if you ſhould come
and live by him and no way prejudice him, and yet
for all that he would malign you, becauſe you do but live
by him; thus it is with the world, they do malign Jeſus
Chriſt for living but by them; indeed if a neighbor comes
and will intrench upon your ground and liberties, you
cannot bear it; Jeſus Chriſt doth not do it: One would
wonder ſometimes why wicked men ſhould be ſo oppoſite
againſt men when they come under the Kingdom of Chriſt
more than before: I appeal to you, when God converts a
wife to be under the Kingdom of Chriſt, Doth that take her
off from ſubjection to her husband? let me aſſure you, it
makes her to acknowledge her husband to be Lord more
than before; indeed if when the wife were converted it did
take the wife from ſubjection to the husband, then there
were ſome reaſon why the husband ſhould ſtorm at it; but
when the more the wife is under the Kingdom of Chriſt,
the more doth ſhe acknowledg the authority of of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

of them by the Word under the kingdom of Chriſt,
did take them off from their obedience to their Maſters and
Miſtriſſes, then there were ſome ground to oppoſe them
from going to hear the Word; but when your conſcinece
tell you that the more they go to hear the Word, and are
wrought upon by the Word they are the more obedient to
you, why ſhould you hate them then? why ſhould you ſo
malign Chriſts Kingdom when as Chriſts Kingdom would

You have one ſervant that is prophane; another cannot lie

the wickedneſs of men, that they do hate the Kingdom of
Chriſt though the Kingdom of Chriſt doth not intrench

do not oppoſe Him, He will not oppoſe you in any thing
that you can deſire as a rational man.</p>
               <p>And for the outward Government: Chriſt would have
no man to be compel'd to it, but thoſe that are convinced

kingdom of Chriſt would go on for all that: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28.
this is a kingdom that cannot be ſhaken. At thoſe times
when the Magiſtrates were the greateſt enemies unto the
kingdom of Chriſt: yet even then the kingdom of Chriſt
went on as fully as ever it hath done ſince that time; but
the Magiſtrates may be helps, and there is a promiſe that
Kings ſhall be nurſing fathers, and Queens nurſing mothers
to the Church, but yet ſo it fell out that at the firſt when
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:29998:100"/>
the Church was in its infancy, that it did thrive as much
when Magiſtrates and Civil Power was againſt it as ever it
hath done ſince, and thereby Chriſt would ſhew us that
His Kingdom doth not depend upon this world, but the
Kingdom of Chriſt doth ſtand and will ſtand, and it doth
and will prevail to the end of the world, The gates of Hell
ſhall not prevail againſt it, <hi>it ſhall be more than conqueror;</hi> and
this is a great comfort to the Saints.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If the kingdom of Chriſt be not of this world,
but of another; then hence we collect the abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of living by faith, Chriſtians had need then have a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of faith to live by, for their greateſt good is in things
that are beyond this world, their very King that they obey
is a King that cannot be ſeen by the eye of ſence; nor by the
eye of reaſon, they had need have an eye of faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
their King in his glory: The Throne of this King of
Saints is not a viſible Throne to be ſeen by the eye of ſence,
and reaſon but by the eye of faith.</p>
               <p>The Priviledges that we ſpeak of, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot to be ſeen and
enjoyed by ſence and reaſon, but by faith,</p>
               <p>And ſo the Ordinances of this Kingdom, and the Laws
and Statutes of it, they are Spiritual, and muſt have faith
to cloſe with them, and all the comforts of this Kingdom
muſt be drawn in by faith, therefore it is of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
that the Saints ſhould exerciſe much faith in their
lives, that they ſhould live continually by faith; As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaith in 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 7. For we walk by faith, and not by
ſight;</hi> It is not by Sight we walk; indeed all the good
things that there are in the kingdoms of the world they
are ſeen by ſence and reaſon, reaſon and ſence is enough
to order us in the matters of the kingdoms of this world:
but now the kingdom of the Son of God that we are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
into, it's a Spiritual, an Heavenly kingdom, ſo that
the Saints muſt walk by faith, and not by ſight: therefore
my brethren labor to ſtrengthen faith, and act your faith,
and live upon faith, exerciſe faith in all your waies,
make much of grace and faith or you will never have
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:29998:101"/>
much good in the Kingdom of Chriſt, but that grace will
help you comfortably to enjoy, and ſpiritually to improve
all the good things in the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
advantage.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>

then the greater mercy to thy ſoul, that ever thou waſt
brought under this Kingdom of Chriſt: Oh! thou maieſt
look back unto thy former time, and know that thou hadſt
a worldly heart, worldly apprehenſions, thy ſpirit was
worldly, altogether for things of the world, taken with
the pomp, and glory, and the pleaſures of this world:
How comes it to paſs that thou ſhouldeſt have a Heavenly
Kingdom reveal'd to thee? Whence was it that ever Jeſus
Chriſt ſhould be known to thy ſoul, that was ſo worldly,
ſo droſſie, ſo earthy a ſoul? thou waſt as deep rooted in the
world (it may be) as any, and yet that the Lord ſhould cull
thee out of the world, and reveal ſuch a Kingdom to thee,
that is ſuch a myſtery as the Princes of the world have not
known, that thou that art a poor creature ſhouldeſt come
to underſtand the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>alities of Chriſt, that the wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men of the world have not known: Oh! the Free
Grace of God to thee, and not unto the world! As <hi>Judas,</hi>
(not <hi>Iſcariot)</hi> ſaid, How is it that thou revealeſt thy ſelf to
us, and not unto the world? how comes it to paſs that ſuch
wiſe men, that bear ſway in the world, they have very poor,
and low, and mean, and contemptible thoughts of the
Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt? they look upon it but as a meer
notion, and a conceit of men, and the rather becauſe they
ſee but a few poor people that are but of mean parts that
do imbrace ſuch a way, upon that they contemn it; and
through the worldly wiſdom that they have, they come
to undervalue it. Oh! then bleſs God that ever he ſhould
chuſe ſuch a poor weak wretch as thou art, for to make
known the things of the Kingdom of Chriſt unto; and
therfore of al men, you rich covetous men they are hardeſt
to be wrought upon by the Miniſtry of the Word. When
Chriſt Himſelf was preaching, it is ſaid in <hi>Luke,</hi> 16. 14. That
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:29998:101"/>
the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who were covetous, they <hi>derided Him;</hi> they
<hi>blew their noſes at Him,</hi> for that's the meaning of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
Like as a man that ſcorns and derides another ſnivles
in the noſe; that's the propriety of the word, that is here
tranſlated <hi>derided.</hi> Oh! a worldly heart is hardeſt brought
unto the Kingdom of Chriſt: therefore bleſs God ſo much
the more, that hath brought thy ſoul to underſtand the
myſteries of Chriſts Scepter, that hath tranſlated thee into
another Kingdom.</p>
               <p>11. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If the Kingdom of Chriſt be not of this world:
then they are rebuked that do ſeek to make the Kingdom
of Chriſt a worldly Kingdom. I might name very many
ſorts of men that do this: I will ſpeak but of Three or
Four.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> thoſe that are Popiſhly affected;
all their way is under the name of honoring of Chriſt, to
raiſe up a worldly Kingdom; and therefore they make the
Pope to be as an Emperor of all the world, as the King of
Kings; and their Cardinals, and many of their Biſhops to
be Princes, and all in a worldly pomp, and they carry it
on, and maintain it by a worldly policy, and by worldly
means, and worldly weapons, and therfore ſtir up the Kings
of the earth to root out all thoſe that are againſt them:
theſe underſtand not the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such as would conform the Government of
the Church meerly to worldly Government; that becauſe
worldly men may by their prudence order things as they
pleaſe in Common-wealths, ſo as ſhall be moſt ſutable to
them: therefore they falſly think, that the Kingdom of
Chriſt muſt be ſo too; that it muſt be ſuted to every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
whereas the truth is, there is but one way of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Chriſt in all the world. The great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Prelates was, Indeed ſay they, in ſome places
there may be another Government, where there is an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy
in the Civil Government; but where there is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
there muſt be a Biſhop. Now certainly that's not
the way of Chriſt, to ſute himſelf in his Government, to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:29998:102"/>
the Government of the world. But the Government that
was in the primitive times, muſt be ſtill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such kind of men as think that the ſucceſs of
the Goſpel, and the Ordinances do depend upon worldly
things; as now, upon outward pomp: except there be
ſome outward pomp go along with the Goſpel; As now,
Great preferments of thoſe that are the Preachers of the
Goſpel, they think the Goſpel will be contemn'd elſe, and
except the Ordinances be carried on in an outward pomp:
They conceive that all will be deſpiſed: except there be
Magnificent Temples built and beautified, and except brave
Gold and Silver Chaliſes, the Sacrament would be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and except they have their Altars, and Rails about
them: with all their heatheniſh vanities, Chriſt is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped.
But this is to look upon the Kingdom of Chriſt
as the Kingdoms of the world; but Oh no! the kingdom
of Chriſt prevails where there is but little of the world
with it. I remember I have read of one <hi>Boniface</hi> a Martyr,
that being asked, whether it were lawful to give the Wine
in the Sacrament, in a wooden Challis; ſaith he, <hi>There was
a time (indeed) when the Church had wooden Challiſes, and gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Prieſts; but now, the Church hath golden Challiſes, and woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Prieſts.</hi> No queſtion, in the primitive times, they had
very mean things in the Lords Supper, and all things were
carried in a very low way to a worldly eye; but (ſaith he)
though their Challiſes were wooden, the Prieſts were gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
and ſo the Goſpel did prevail. Oh! it's the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſs
of things that makes the kingdom of Chriſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail;
many think that the Goſpel cannot prevail, except
it hath abundance of gingles of mens wit, and tongues, and
ſuch kind of ſchool-boy-vanities as theſe are, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
never prevails by ſuch things; but that which the
world calls fooliſhneſs, that is made the power of God, and
the wiſdom of God to Salvation: They have carnal hearts
that think that the outward pomp, and glory of the world
ſhould be ſuch a furtherance to the Goſpel, as if it ſhould
not thrive without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:29998:102"/>
Laſtly, Thoſe that think that the Goſpel and the promoting
of Chriſts kingdom depends wholly upon humane policy and
ſtrength, theſe do make the kingdom of Chriſt to be but as a
worldly kingdom.</p>
               <p>The laſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is this: If Chriſts Kingdom be not of this world,
then it teaches us all for to labor to further a kingdom of Chriſt
as diſtinct from the world, it is a great Point that I am ſpeaking
of, about furthering the Kingdom of Chriſt as diſtinct from the
kingdoms of the world. Chriſt himſelf profeſſes that he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world to witneſs to this truth: and therefore certainly we
ſhould do ſo likewiſe. It is in the very next words to my text,
when Chriſt had ſaid his Kingdom was not of this world, <hi>Pilate</hi>
ſaid to Him, Art thou a King then? Jeſus anſwered, <hi>Thou ſaieſt I
am a King. To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the
world, that I ſhould bear witneſs to the Truth.</hi> Truth, <hi>Pilate</hi> asked
Him what the Truth was? but he ſaid not for an anſwer: but
certainly the Truth that Chriſt means here, is the Truth of His
Kingdom. Oh my brethren, it is a matter of ſo great conſequence,
that it is a ſpecial end why Chriſt came into the world, why He
was born, that he ſhould witneſs to this Truth. Then certainly
we ſhould account it a great end of our lives to ſet to our ſeal to
this Truth of the Kingdom of Chriſt, as diſtinct from the world,
let this be a great engagement on our ſpirits, to further the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the kingdom, further it as many waies as you can, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
your Eſtates, improve your Credits, your Eſteem, your Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for the kingdom of Chriſt; and then, Oh how comfortable
will your death be! though you ſhould not live here to enjoy all
the priviledges that the Saints in other ages ſhall have in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt; yet when you die your death ſhall be but a paſſage
of you into the glorious Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, for there's a
Kingdom of Chriſt beyond this world, though Chriſt will rule
Spiritually while this world laſts: but when men are taken off
from this world yet they do but go into the Kingdom of Chriſt.
In 2 <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. 5, 6. &amp;c. with which I will conclude, and beſides
this, giving all diligence, <hi>Ad to your faith vertue, and to vertue,
knowledg; ad to knowledg temperance, and to temperance patience, and
to patience godlineſs, and to godlineſs brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly
kindneſs charity; for if theſe things be in you and abound, they make you
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:29998:103"/>
that ye ſhall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledg of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And ſo he goes on further in his exhortation; and in
the 10. verſe, <hi>Wherefore the rather brethren, give diligence, to make your
calling and election ſure: for if ye do theſe things you ſhall never fall:
for ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abundantly into the evelaſting
Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt is here a King,
He rules in his Church in a ſpiritual way: but when this world
is done, He ſhall be a King, and if you be now godly you ſhall
have an abundant entrance into the everlaſting kingdom of our
Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt: Mark, when a Beleever dies,
he goes into the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, he goes but
from one adminiſtration of it to another, but ſtill he is
in the ſame Kingdom of Chriſt: here's the difference between the
death of the men of the world, and the death of the Saints: the
men of the world they are of the world, and they are under the
kingdom of darkneſs, and when they die they go to the kingdom
of darkneſs: and the Saints they are now under the kingdom of
Chriſt ſpiritually, and when they die they go to another admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the kingdom of Chriſt, and the more godly men are,
the more abundant entrance ſhall they have into the everlaſting
kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe his <hi>Excellency,</hi> that hath done ſo much ſervice for
the kingdom, when he ſhall come, What an entrance will be
made for him into the City? Every man that is a free ſubject may
come freely into the City, no body may wrong him, and he ſhall
enjoy the Liberty of the City; but he hath not that Abundance
Entrance into it as a man that hath done much for the kingdom
we live in. So now, every godly man or woman, if they have
but the leaſt degree of grace, they ſhall come into the Kingdom of
Chriſt, I but thoſe that are powerfully godly, burning and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
lamps, and have been very active and faithful to the death;
when they die, the Gates of Heaven ſhall be ſet wide open, and
they ſhall have an Abundant Entrance into the Everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>There are a Generation of men, unto whom God gives
out a portion, ſome comforts in this world, and here is all that they
are like to have.</hi> And now ſet your hearts (I beſeech you)
unto what I have to ſay in this Argument, for in my thoughts,
thinking what to pitch upon, for ſuch an Aſſembly as this, at
length I could not determine of an argument, that I thought
might more reach unto the hearts of thoſe to whom I was to
ſpeak; as I hope (before I have done) you will find it ſuch a
ſerious argument that concerns us all; I have read of <hi>Gregory,</hi>
that being advanced to preferment, profeſſed that there was
no Scripture that went ſo to his heart, that ſtruck ſuch a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
into his ſpirit, that daunted him ſo much as this Scripture
did. Here you have your reward, <hi>Son, in your life time, you
have had your pleaſure.</hi> Oh this was a dreadful Scripture, that
ſounded in his eares continually, as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks of that
Scripture, <hi>Ariſe you dead and come to judgement:</hi> night and
day he thought that Scripture ſounded in his his ears; So <hi>Gregory,</hi>
here you have your reward, in this life you have had your
pleaſure; This was the Scripture that night and day ſounded in
his ears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh that it might pleaſe God, to aſſiſt ſo far, to ſpeak
out of this Scripture to you, that I might make this Scripture
ring in your ears, even when you lie upon your beds, after the
Sermon is done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that yet you may think this Scripture rings
in your ears. <hi>Men of this world, who have their portion in
this life;</hi> If this Scripture ſhould prove to be the portion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one of you, of the richeſt in this place, Wo unto him that
ever he was born; which I ſhall after make out more fully to
you: But (you'l ſay) do you think to preach to men, that have
their portion here in this life? I fear me, I may meet with
ſome, whom it doth ſo neerly concern, yet do not think that
I have thoſe thoughts of you all, for you ſhall find (before I
have done) this Scripture will concern every one in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;
but yet be not any of you too too ready to put off
this from you, to think your ſelves out of the danger of this
Scripture, for it was ſpoken concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> might
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:29998:106"/>
have (for ought I know) as ſtrong arguments of Gods love to
him, as many of you (I fear) have this day.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Saul</hi> was a man choſen immediately by God himſelf, to
be the firſt King that ever was over his own people; and was
not that a great favor?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Saul</hi> for his perſon, was one of the goodlieſt men that was
amongſt all Iſrael, higher from the ſhoulders to the head than
any of them.</p>
               <p>3. For his Endowments, he was a man whom God did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
with admirable gifts of Government: he cauſed another
ſpirit to come upon him: he was a man that when he heard of
his preferment, ſeemed to be very humble, as judging himſelf
unworthy of ſuch a dignity; in the firſt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 9. 21. Saith
he, <hi>Who am I, and what is my Fathers houſe, that I ſhould be thus
choſen?</hi> And when he had been choſen, ſome that would reject
him, Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> that notwithſtanding God honoring
of him, yet would ſeek to caſt diſhonor upon him, yet this
<hi>Saul,</hi> had mighty power over his Spirit, he was very meek and
a quiet man, in the firſt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 10. 27. the text ſaith, <hi>He held
his peace, when the Children of</hi> Belial <hi>ſaid, What have we to do with
him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Though he were quiet in his own cauſe, yet he ſhewed
himſelf to have an excellent ſpirit of Government in him, in a
publick cauſe; he was full of anger when it was for the good
of the people, that he was a Governor over; though quiet in
his own; in the firſt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 11. 6. When he heard of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
done to the people of Iſrael, the Text ſaith, that his
anger did riſe within him; an excellent pattern for all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
for all in publique places, to be very ſilent, and quiet,
ſelf denying; putting up wrongs in their own cauſe; but to
be full of zeal for the publick cauſe; to reſerve their ſpirits
for a publick good: Many there are in publick places, that
when they are anger'd in their private cauſe; how full of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
they are, and they ſpend their Spirit there ſo much, that they
have no ſpirit at all, when it comes to a publick cauſe; <hi>Saul</hi>
went beyond them in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:29998:106"/>
5. <hi>Saul</hi> was one, who was much troubled at the ſin of
the people againſt God; not only had a ſpirit to vindicate
a publick wrong, but when he ſaw the people ſin againſt
God, his heart was much troubled at their very ſin, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be grieved for it, and mighty ſolicitous and careful
about it, to prevent ſin in the people; this you ſhall have
in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 33. they told <hi>Saul</hi> there, That the people had
ſinned in eating with blood, upon that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhews himſelf
diſpleaſed, Come (ſaith he) and do not ſin againſt the
Lord, roul a ſtone to me hither; and ſo he would ſee with
his own eyes, that they did ſlay the Cattel, and they did
powr forth the blood, that they might not ſin againſt God,
in eating blood; this was his care.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Saul</hi> he was very careful to enquire of God, what he
ſhould do in buſineſſes of great conſequence, in the 37. ver.
of that 14. chap. of the 1 of <hi>Samuel,</hi> there he would not
go out, till he had firſt enquired of God. Yea more than
all this,</p>
               <p>7. He was a man that had a very reverend eſteem of
the Prophets of God: when <hi>Samuel</hi> came to him, in
the 1 of <hi>Samuel 15. 13. O thou bleſſed of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Saul</hi>
to <hi>Samuel)</hi> Yea, yet further than this;</p>
               <p>8. When <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhewed unto him, what his ſin was, in
the 30. ver. of that 15. chap. he comes and confeſſes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people, and ſaith, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> I have ſinned againſt
the Lord: meerly at the conviction of one Prophet: Yea,
yet more than this,</p>
               <p>9. God ſeemed to be with <hi>Saul</hi> very much, and to ſhew
great reſpect unto him, to make him an Inſtrument of
much good to Iſrael; He granted unto him as glorious
a victory as ever man had in this world: (for ſo we may cal
it) and if there be any outward thing in the world might
be gathered as an argument of Gods love, then ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
victory as he had over his enemies: the victory
you ſhall find in the 1 of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 13. 5. and ſo reade on af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in that Chapter, and the next, you ſhall find
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:29998:107"/>
there, that the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> were riſen up againſt him, and
Iſrael; and there were thirty thouſand Chariots, of his
Adverſaries of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and ſix thouſand horſmen,
and people as the ſand of the Sea for multitude, beſides
all this; Wel, here was a mighty Enemy: What had <hi>Saul</hi>
to oppoſe theſe? You ſhall find in the 2. verſe of that 14.
chapter, that there were but ſix hundred men with <hi>Saul:</hi>
here was of one ſide thirty thouſand Chariots, here was
ſix thouſand horſmen, here was people as the ſand of the
Sea without number, and <hi>Saul</hi> had but ſix hundred with
him, at this time; yea, and of thoſe ſix hundred, there
was not any one of them that had a ſword, but only <hi>Saul,</hi>
and <hi>Jonathan;</hi> for the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> were wiſe enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
all the Malignants (that they accounted ſo) and
would not let ſo much as a Smith be amongſt them, they
would not only take away their Arms, but they would
look to them, to ſee that they had no arms ſupplied unto
them; that was the wiſdom of the <hi>Philiſtims;</hi> yet we find,
(if you reade afterwards) in the Scripture, that God was
ſo far with <hi>Saul,</hi> that he bleſſed him, and gave him victory
over all theſe. Beſides all this.</p>
               <p>10. God bleſſed <hi>Saul</hi> with a very gracious Child, a
godly ſon, of a ſweet nature, <hi>Jonathan,</hi> which indeed,
if any outward argument in the world, might be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods love, that might be; But now put all theſe
things together, and yet here is the man that hath his
Portion in this world: I now challenge the man, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
one, I challenge him that hath certain evidence of a
mighty work of God upon him in Chriſt, let him ſhew me
greater arguments of Gods love to him, than <hi>Saul</hi> might
have done; and yet it proved to be <hi>Sauls</hi> Portion, that he
ſhould have only his portion in this world: God herein
ſhews that His mercy is His own, and that He will let out
His mercy as He pleaſeth; <hi>It is your Fathers pleaſure to give
you a Kingdom:</hi> The Father doles out the Portion as He
pleaſeth unto His Children; God will let the Line of His
mercy to go thus far to one, and there ſtop; and ſo far to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:29998:107"/>
another, and there ſtop; and then come in a croſs line
again unto them; God ſo diſpoſes of his mercy that there
are ſome that ſhall have Heaven and Earth to be their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and their portion is bleſſed indeed; There are ſome
that ſhall have Earth, but not Heaven, and their portion
is poor, and mean, and ſad; there are others that ſhall
have Heaven, but not earth, and their portion is good;
And there are others that ſhall neither have Heaven nor
Earth, and their portion (you'l ſay) is miſerable indeed:
Gods mercy is His own to diſpoſe of, as He will. We reade
that <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 14. He cals for <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi>
and he gives them a <hi>piece of bread, a bottle of water, and ſends
them away,</hi> there's an end of them. So <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> in the
2 of <hi>Chron. 21. 3. He gave his other ſon</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>gifts,
but the Kingdom he gave to</hi> Jehoram. So God hath people to
whom he gives pieces of bread, bottles of water, yea ſome
to whom he gives great gifts in this world; but he keeps
his inheritance for his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> He keeps the Kingdom for
<hi>Jehoram: Eſau,</hi> he had his portion in this world, and ſuch
a portion as he thought to be a very good portion: in <hi>Gen.
33. 9. Brother</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have enough.</hi> Moſt rich men are
complaining: they go not ſo far as <hi>Eſau,</hi> they have their
portion, and yet complain of it; <hi>Eſau</hi> hath his portion,
and thought he had enough. Chriſts Auditors, in the 6.
of <hi>Luke,</hi> 24. they had their portion in this world, <hi>Wo to
you, here is your conſolation</hi> (ſaith Chriſt unto them:) O dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſpeech! wo to this man, wo to theſe here is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations.
<hi>Dives</hi> he had portion in this world, in <hi>Luke, 16.
25. Son, remember in thy life time thou hadſt thy pleaſure;</hi> and
<hi>thou hadſt thy good things,</hi> they were thy good things, thoſe
things that were meaſured out for thee, thou hadſt them
in thy life-time.</p>
               <p>In the handling of this Argument, a ſhall divide what I
have to ſay in theſe ſix Particulars: that you may every
one of you, go on the more readily along with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:29998:108"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Why is it that God will deal out ſomewhat to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men in this world, why they ſhall have any <hi>Portion</hi>
at all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this their portion, it is confin'd to this life;
and why ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some Corrallaries that you will ſee will naturally
flow from thoſe Two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We ſhall conſider the condition of theſe men, who
are ſuch that have their Portion in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We ſhall endeavor to ſhew unto you, who are thoſe
men, to cull out of the Congregation what that man is, or
woman is, that is like to have their Portion in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Conclude in the words of Exhortation unto you all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the firſt:</hi> God doth give to wicked men a <hi>Portion,</hi> He
doles out ſomething.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They are all His Creatures.</hi> Saith <hi>John</hi> concerning
<hi>Jezebel,</hi> Go, take away this curſed woman, ſhew ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
unto her, let her not lie there in the ſtreets, but take
her away; for ſhe is the Daughter of a King. So ſaith God,
Well, though theſe be curſed, yet they are my Creatures,
ſome reſpect they ſhall have from me, ſome good I'le com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to them; Indeed, it is not an Argument ſtrong
enough, that becauſe you are Gods Creatures, therfore God
ſhould be merciful eternally to you; but it may be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
ſtrong enough, becauſe you are His Creatures, you
ſhall have ſomewhat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This time of life, it's the time of Gods patience,
the day of Gods long-ſuffering.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:29998:108"/>
Thirdly. <hi>Therefore, ſomewhat you ſhall have;</hi> and the
day of patience is mans day: in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
there, <hi>I paſs not for mans judgement:</hi> The words are in
the Greek, <hi>For mans Day.</hi> I paſs not for mans day, ſo the
words may be tranſlated; as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay,
it is true, Man carries all before him now, man hath all
the doings now at this day, and he may judg and cenſure
as he pleaſeth; it is but his day, and I paſs not for mans
day; the day of patience may prove to be mans day; that
is the third.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Wicked men, they do ſomewhat for God here,
ſome kind of ſervice, that is at leaſt materially a ſervice for God:</hi>
and God will not have them clamour upon Him, that
they have nothing for their work; God will give to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one ſomething for what they do for Him, though it
be never ſo little, here in this world. You have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
place for that in <hi>Ezekiel, 29. 18, 19, 20. Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer</hi>
King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> cauſed his Army to ſerve a great
ſervice againſt <hi>Tyrus,</hi> yet had he no wages for his Army,
(ſaith God) he had no wages for his ſervice; well, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
God He enquires about this, and ſeems to complain,
that when a <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> did Him any ſervice, yet he
ſhould be all this while without his wages; therefore
(ſaith God) Behold! <hi>I will give the Land of Egypt unto him,
he ſhall take a ſpoil and a prey, and that ſhall be his wages;</hi> He
will give him wages for what he doth. Many wicked men
God doth make uſe of in divers ſervices, and much refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
and good, His Churches ſhall have from them; the
Lord cauſes the very Earth to help the woman; earthly
men to be of uſe to the Church, and God will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to them for their work; A thron may ſerve to
ſtop a gap, though it be but a thorn buſh, and if it ſerve to
ſtop a gap, and be of any uſe, it hath that Benefit by it,
all that while it is kep from the fire, whereas were it not
of uſe, it might preſently be brought to the fire. An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
by the way, to provoke all men to be of as much
uſe to the Church of God as poſſibly they can, it may be
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:29998:109"/>
that is the very thing that keeps thee from the fire; thou
art a thorn, but God hath uſe of thee, and therefore brings
thee not to the fire; but if thou once comeſt to be un-uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the fire is the next thing thou ſhalt hear of. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Auſtin</hi> (in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book, <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> and the 12.
Chap.) ſpeaks of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that had ſuch a flouriſhing
condition for a while, and he gives that for one Reaſon,
the <hi>Romans</hi> had brave ſpirits, they were men that had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
moralities, and had Herotick kind of ſpirits, and
were delivered from that baſeneſs of ſpirit, that other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had, and therefore God ſhewed ſome kind of reſpect
unto them; here many inſtances might be in that kind.
That's the fourth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God gives wicked men a portion here, <hi>to ſhew
unto them what little good there is in all theſe things, and to
ſhew the world what little good there is in all the things that
are here below in the world.</hi> Certainly, if there were much
good they ſhould never have them; it is an argument there
is no great excellency in the ſtrength of body, for an Ox
hath it more than you: an argument there is no great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in agility of body, for a Dog hath it more than
you: an argument no great excellency in gay cloathes, for
a Peacock hath then more than you: an argument there is
not any great excellency in Gold &amp; Silver, for the Indians
that know not God, have them more than you and if theſe
things had any great worth in them, certainly God would
never give them to wicked men, a certain argument: As it
is an argument there is no great evil in afflictions in this
world, becauſe that the Saints are ſo much afflicted; So
no great argument, there is any great good in this world,
for the wicked they enjoy ſo much of it. <hi>Luther</hi> hath ſuch
an expreſſion as this is, in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>The Turkiſh Empire, as great as it is, it is but a crum, that
the maſter of the family, that God caſts to dogs:</hi> the whol Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
Empire, ſuch an eſteem had <hi>Luther</hi> of it: and indeed it
is no more. All the things of the world, God in giving of
them to Turks, and wicked ones, His enemies, ſhews there
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:29998:109"/>
is not much excellency and good in them, God therefore
will caſt them promiſcuouſly up and down in the world,
becauſe he looks upon them as worthleſs things; God doth
not ſo much regard whether men be prepared to give him
the glory of them, yea or no, they ſhall have them how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
He is content to venture them: Indeed when God
comes unto His choice Mercies in Chriſt, there he looks to
have glory from them, and he doth never give them to any,
but firſt he prepares them, that they may give him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of thoſe mercies: but it is otherwiſe with others; As
ſuppoſe you ſee a man gathering of Crabs, although Swine
be under the Tree, he cares not much to drive them away,
they are but Crabs, let them have them; but if he were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
any choice and precious fruit, if any Swine ſhould
come under, he drives them away. As for outward things
Crabs, the Lord ſuffers the Swine of the world, to come
grunting, and take them up; but when he comes to his
choice Mercies in his Chriſt, there he makes a diſtinction,
Oh! that is precious fruit! A Black-ſmith that is working
upon Iron, though a great many Cinders, and little bits
of Iron fly up and down, he regards them not: but a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith
that is working upon Gold, he preſerves every ray,
and every duſt of Gold: and a Lapidarie that is working
upon precious Stones, every little bit he will be ſure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:
a Carpenter that is only hewing of Timber, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
it not much if Chips fly up and down; but it is not
ſo with a Lapidary. So theſe outward things are but as the
Chips and Cinders, and ſuch kind of thing, as thoſe are,
and therefore God even gives a Portion to wicked men out
of them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly. <hi>God knows that He hath time enough to manifeſt
His Juſtice upon them hereafter,</hi> He hath an Eternity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
for the Declaration of His Juſtice; and therefore
(ſaith God) Let them have ſomewhat for a while. As you
know it is natural in all, when they ſee a man going to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
that is not like to live above an hour or two, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one is ready to pity him, and to be any way officious to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:29998:110"/>
him, Oh! (ſaith every one) the man ſhall not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
long, we cannot do much for him, he ſhall have pain
enough ere long, and miſery enough ere long, and ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one pities him. It is obſervable, let a man go to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for wickedneſs, and then he is pitied by all; but if a
man ſhould ſuffer for godliineſs, then perhaps they will not
be ſo full of pity towards him. As I remember in the Book
of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> there is a ſtory of Mr. <hi>In<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Frith,</hi> a learned, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Miniſter, and <hi>Andrew Hewit</hi> that were Martyrs, and
were to ſuffer for their conſcience, and the Story tells us,
that one Dr. <hi>Cook,</hi> a Parſon in <hi>London,</hi> he openly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
the people, that they ſhould pray for them no more
than they would do for a Dog; that Charity of theirs
that they talked ſo much of, is ſuch towards them that
ſuffer out of conſcience; and as amongſt Papiſts ſo amongſt
ungodly men, let a man ſuffer out of conſcience, they
will rather rail at him, and when he is in his ſufferings,
they will rather give him gall and vinegar to drink, (as
they once did Chriſt upon the Croſs) though in other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
they pity men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> By this that God gives to the wicked, the
Lord ſhews, <hi>what great things he hath reſerved for his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi>
what a portion there is for them; Surely if the dogs
have ſo much, the Father keeps a good houſe; if the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes
may have ſuch doles, certainly there is good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the Children within: As by the afflictions of the
Saints, God doth declare to wicked men, and would have
them draw ſuch an argument from it, that there are fearful
things, that are like to befal them; <hi>If judgment begin at the
Houſe of God, where ſhall the wicked and ungodly appear?</hi> So
by the proſperity that wicked men have in this world,
God doth declare to his Children, and he would have them
argue from thence, what then hath he reſerved for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Ones? for his Saints, for his Children, that are ſo
dear unto him?</p>
               <p>Eighthly. <hi>God fetches a great deal of Glory from hence,</hi>
He fetches about His own ends very much, from the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:29998:110"/>
that wicked men have; as ſometimes He doth it, that
they might ſtumble and harden their hearts, and break
their necks at it, and to ripen their ſins; hence He lets them
go on a long time, and have their wills; in <hi>Iſa. 33. 1. Wo
to thee who ſpoileſt, and wert not ſpoiled, and dealeſt treacherouſly,
and wert not dealt treacherouſly withal; when thou ſhalt ceaſe
to ſpoil, thou ſhalt be ſpoiled;</hi> I'le let thee go on, thou ſhalt
ſpoil as much as thou wilt, and when thou haſt done ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
thou ſhalt be ſpoiled. And ſometimes God doth it,
to fetch about this end, Namely, to chaſtiſe. His own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
with the proſperity of the wicked: And as an Ancient
writer hath this Story of one that (he ſaith) by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way, from being a Monk was advanced into an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal</hi>
Seat, and being a lewd wicked man, he began to be
proud of this his Advancement, and being proud, he heard
theſe words in the ſtory, <hi>Ab angelo audivit, Cur ſuperbus</hi> ô
<hi>infaelix, non es creatus Epiſcopus, quia tu dignus, ſed quia Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
haec digna fuit tali Epiſcopi;</hi> it was a wicked place, and
this was the anſwer: Why art thou ſo proud Oh unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
man, for thou art not advanced becauſe thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of this advancement, but becauſe this City is ſo ill; it
is worthy of ſuch a Prelate to be over it: In way of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that place God advanced ſuch a man: And ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are advanced that they may be heavy judgments unto
others; God gives them ſuch a portion, not out of His
love to them (though they are ready to gather the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
but out of His diſpleaſure unto others: And then
He gives a plentiful portion to many, to teach us all to do
good unto our enemies, not only <hi>humanitati</hi> (as they ſay)
but <hi>homini,</hi> not only to human nature, but to men, to men
that are wicked, ſome good muſt be done unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly.</hi> The Lord would ſhew hereby, that He would
have no argument of love or hatred to be drawn from theſe
outward things; and alſo becauſe He would not have
them to expect any more. It may be many men that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
proſpering in this world, they gather this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That therefore God loves them, and intends mercy
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:29998:111"/>
to them, <hi>Cujus contrarium verum;</hi> nay, you may rather ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an argument quite th'other way, becauſe God intends
no further good unto you hereafter, therfore it is you have
ſo much now. We uſe to anſwer men, that come for their
dole, who have had out a dole, and they will come again,
Why do you come again? you have had your dole already.
So God will anſwer to many men, when they ſhall cry to
him for mercy, at that day, Why come you to me for
more? you have had your dole already; Have you not
had already more than your work comes to, more than
you have done? you have had your part and portion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
indeed men ſpeak much of Gods mercy, and the
mercy of God we acknowledge to be very great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
well, God doth ſhew himſelf glorious in mercy, that
thou being ſo wicked, haſt ſo much as thou haſt in this
world, and therefore though thou ſhouldſt be denied of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
mercy hereafter, yet thou haſt cauſe to tel Devils and
damned creatures that ſhall be thy companions, that God
was very merciful to thee, while thou didſt live in this
world? Somewhat thou hadſt then, but here's all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is all that ever thou art like to have.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe there are ſome men, whoſe names are written
in the Earth, and not in the Book of Life: In <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 13.
there it's ſpoken of men that are written in the earth; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Saints are deſcribed to be men that are redeemed from
the earth. In <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 3. It is their happineſs to be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from the earth: and it is all the happineſs thou haſt,
that thou art written in the earth.</p>
               <p>2. Here is their portion, becauſe they are vile in the
eyes of God; If you ſhould ask the Queſtion; why you
give bones to the Dog, and ſwill to the Swine, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe? The Anſwer would be; Becauſe it is a Dog
that hath it, and becauſe it is a Swine; it is Dogs meat.
Certainly God doth ſpeak exceeding contemptibly of all
ungodly ones in the world, let them be never ſo great in
regard of outwards; In the 11. of <hi>Daniel, 21. A vile perſon
ſhall ariſe:</hi> What is this vile perſon? Interpreters gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:29998:111"/>
conſent in this, that it is meant of <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
that was a mighty great Prince, ſuch a Prince as
when the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did write to him, they writ, <hi>Antiocho
magno deo,</hi> to <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great god; and his very name
ſhews him to be a great one; <hi>Antiochus Epiphanius,</hi> is as
much as <hi>Antiochus the Illuſtrious,</hi> and the <hi>Famous:</hi> and yet
when the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of him, it is <hi>Antiochus</hi> a vile
perſon: they are vile in the eyes of God. If there be any
in a family that you care not much for, you make no great
proviſion for them, <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> Somwhat
they have, but little; Doth God take care for wicked and
ungodly ones?</p>
               <p>3. Here is their portion, it is confin'd to this life;
Why ſo? Becauſe they chuſe it themſelves; and in that
they have no wrong; make choice of this Portion
themſelves: <hi>Moſes,</hi> (ſpeaking to the people, ſaith he) <hi>I ſet
before you life and death:</hi> So do the Miniſters of God in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to you, they ſet before you <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death:</hi> What
do you chuſe? Now you chuſe the way that goes out of
life, and into death; you have but your choice; you
chuſe <hi>Vanity</hi> to be your portion, God doth you no wrong
to give you Vanity: Now you that will indent with God
for your peny, you cannot take it ill, if when the end of
the day comes, God puts you off with your peny; you
know thoſe in the Vineyard, that agreed for their peny,
they began to murmur indeed, when they came to receive
their wages; but ſaith the Maſter of the Vinyard, Did you
not agree with me ſo? So you agree with God, all you
intend in Gods ſervice, is, that you may have ſome preſent
comfort in this world, you dare not truſt God for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and here is that that God will ſhew His infinit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
againſt the ſin of diſtruſt by, that when the Lord
propounds now in this day of Grace, ſuch glorious and
bleſſed things to the children of men, and (for ought
you know) any of you may have your portion in them,
as well as others, and yet you dare not truſt God for thoſe
gracious things; you think rather with your ſelves, let
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:29998:112"/>
me have ſomewhat now, ſomewhat for the preſent, ſome
preſent pay; the reward that you talk of, which is to
come, I know not whether they be imaginations yea, or
no; therefore you mean (it ſeems) to ſerve God for your
preſent pay, and preſent pay you ſhall have, and no more.
There are ſome ſervants that are your day-ſervants, they
ſerve you ſo as they expect their pay at night, and perhaps
you give them their two ſhillings at night, and there is an
end: but there are other ſervants now that will ſerve you
in expectation of ſome reverſions, and expectations of
honor, eſpecially when they ſerve Noblemen, and Princes,
though they have no preſent pay given them at night,
yet they go on cheerfully in their ſervice, they expect ſome
great Reverſions, as Leaſes and preferments, they may
have afterwards, and now though they have not their two
ſhillings a day as the others have, yet when the other befals
them, they are made rich men, they and their poſterities:
So now, the poor man that hath his pay every day, when a
Leaſe and preferment fals, if he ſhould come in for his part,
No, he may be anſwer'd, you had your pay every day;
here was one was content to relie and truſt upon me, and
had no pay, and he did truſt upon me, and now he comes
to be preferd: This is the direct difference between the
men of the world and Gods Saints; the men of the world
will do nothing without preſent pay, that which is juſt
before them, they muſt needs have, their hearts are upon
it; but the Saints they hear what a bleſſed thing God hath
revealed in his Word, what a bleſſed Covenant of Grace
there is, what rich Promiſes of glorious things to come;
now they beleeve God, and truſt in God for theſe, and
they ſay, Lord, let me have my Portion in the life to come,
and whatever thou doeſt with me here, I care not: As it
was the ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Lord, here burn, here cut; but
ſpare hereafter: I am content Lord, to be burnt, to be
cut, to endure any thing in the world, any ſufferings in
the world for thee, only hereafter I look for ſomewhat
elſe, and I'le wait for hereafter: You will not wait for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:29998:112"/>
hereafter, but you muſt have it for the preſent, and that
is the reaſon, you are put off here: Oh it is a ſerious
thing I ſpeak of to you, many a ſoul will wring its hands,
and curſe it ſelf eternally, that it was not content to truſt
God for hereafter, but would have preſent pay. You
that are great Merchants, if you buy a thing that is but a
trifle, you pull out your purſe, and give the mony down
preſently; but ſuppoſe you go to the Exchange, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for 10000l there, you may give a little down now,
but the great pay muſt come upon pay daies afterwards;
it is not expected it ſhould be preſently done: So there are
ſome men in the world, will trade with God, but they
trade with God for pedling things, for their Credit, and
applauſe, and for their preferments and eſtates, God gives
down the pay preſently, you ſhall have it, there is your
12<hi rend="sup">d</hi> preſently, it is done: but now there are other of Gods
Saints, that trade with God for great things, for immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
and glory, and a Kingdom, and a Crown of eternal
life; now they expect not to have it done preſently, they
are content to ſtay: Oh theſe are the beſt Traders, the beſt
Merchants that will trade with God for great things, and
be content to ſtay; you will chuſe that you have here for
the preſent, and therefore you have your portion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Theſe things that are here, they are the only
<hi>ſutable</hi> things to your hearts, and what will you do with
any more hereafter? theſe things do exceedingly pleaſe
you, and give you content as agreeable to you, and the
things that are to come, are diſagreeable; what would
men do that are carnal and wicked now? what would
they do in Heaven? Certainly if you hate Gods Saints
now, that have but a little Grace for their Grace ſake, you
would hate them infinitly more afterwards, when they are
perfect in Grace, when they ſhall be perfect, and then
when all your common gifts ſhall be taken away; for ſo
it ſhall be. Now the things of God are <hi>unſutable</hi> to you,
though you have now many common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and you now
abhor the Grace of God, though it be imperfect, what
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:29998:113"/>
then, when all common gifts ſhall be taken from you,
and Grace made perfect? how unſutable will it be then to
you? Therefore expect nothing hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You abuſe your portion you have now, what
will you do with more? Who will truſt you with the true
riches? You abuſe that you have. Indeed men of the
world that are wicked, and very rich, are preſently in
places of honor and power; Oh! what a deal miſchief
they do in the world? what dreadful evils are they unto
the earth? Such men, how do they abuſe their portions?
Why now, as it is with the Tooth, in a mans head, a Tooth
indeed is prefer'd, to have an eminent place in the Head,
but when the Tooth comes to be rotten, and put us to pain,
what do we but pull it out, and throw it away? So when
God prefers men to eminent places, when through their
wickedneſs they grow rotten, and ſo do a great deal of
hurt, the Lord plucks them out in His anger, and throws
them away; they abuſe their portion, and do a great deal
of hurt, and therefore muſt expect no more. But above
all the argument is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Becauſe they have no intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt;
The rich Treaſures of the infinite grace of God, they are
let out in Jeſus Chriſt; God hath divers Conduit-pipes (as
I may ſo ſay) of His Grace, to let out unto His Creatures;
there are ſome leſſer Conduit-pipes, and thoſe Conduit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes,
may be open'd through the general bounty of God;
but now the Lord hath the great Current of His eternal
mercies, for ſome that He doth intend eternal good unto,
and this great Current of His it is ſtop't by juſtice, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
juſtice of God doth ſtop this great Current, ſo as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be open'd to have any drop of the mercy let out, until
Divine Juſtice comes to be ſatisfied; In the mean time the
other ſmaller pipes, they run, the general bounty of God;
Now then, this is the very work of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt the
Second Perſon in Trinity, and it is the very myſtery of the
Goſpel; The Second Perſon in the Trinity, ſees that the
children of men, are capable of eternal happineſs, eternal
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:29998:113"/>
glory, and that there are glorious treaſures with God, to
be communicated to the children of men; but through
mans ſin, this great Current is ſtop't; in the mean time
Gods general bounty lets out a great many outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts;
Chriſt therefore out of pity to man-kind, that man-king
may not be put off with theſe general outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
He comes and ſatisfies Gods infinite juſtice, that He
might open the Current, the ſluice of His infinite, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Grace to others: Now happy are thoſe Creatures,
who have intereſt in the Lord Chriſt; for this is His work,
to ſatisfie the Juſtice of the Father, that ſo the great pipe
may be opened, and then flows in all Grace, infinit, eternal
Grace, when that comes once to be opened: No mervail
though we hear of ſuch glorious things, that the Saints of
God have in the life to come, no mervail, for Chriſt doth
come and open the great ſluice of Gods infinite Grace and
Mercie to them; as for the men of the world, they have
but a little of the drizling of Gods general bounty through
ſome crannies, but the Floudgates of Gods grace are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Chriſt; therefore til Divine Juſtice be ſatisfied, there
can be no further good for a Creature here, but the fruits
of Gods general bounty, &amp; patience: There are ſome Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
whom the Lord hath left to the Courſe of juſtice, they
ſhall have what they earn, and no more: this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Gods dealings with ſome Creatures and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
(I ſay) ſome there are that ſhall have what they earn,
and no more: others there are whom God hath ſet His
Heart upon, and whether they earn or no, God intends e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
mercies: unto them, and will bring them unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mercies: Here's the difference of the Covenant of works,
and the Covenant of Grace; and therefore the one is left
to Himſelf, and the other, Chriſt the Head of the Covenant
comes to undertake for him, that that he cannot do: and
here is the very Cut between the condition of ſome men, &amp;
other men; that ſome have their portion in this world, and
others have another higher portion in the world to come;
Thoſe have no intereſt in Chriſt, theſe have.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:29998:114"/>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> They are no Sons, no Children, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they muſt not expect childrens portions; As many of
you rich men, when you die, you will leave your ſervants
ſome Legacie, perhaps you'l give every ſervant in the houſe
five pounds, or ſo; but when you come to your children,
to write in your Will, what ſuch a Son, ſuch a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhall have, that is another manner of buſineſs than 4.
or 5 l. great things you leave to them: Now the truth is,
the world may be divided between Children and Servants,
for though the truth is, all men are at defiance with God,
yet God makes them ſervants one way or other; and there
is ſome little Legacy that ſervants ſhall have, but they muſt
not expect the Childrens portion; therefore they have it
here, but muſt not have it hereafter. In <hi>Ezek. 46. 16. Thus
ſaith the Lord, If the Prince give a gift unto any of his ſons, the
inheritance ſhall be his ſons; but if to his ſervants, then it ſhall
be but till Jubile.</hi> This was Gods Law, that if a Prince gave
a gift to his ſon, the ſon ſhould inherit it for ever, but if
he give it but to a ſervant, it ſhould continue with him but
for a while. So here is the difference of Gods adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all His gifts, He gives ſome to ſervants, and theſe
ſhall continue but for a while, within a little while all will
be called for again; all the good, and all the comfort thou
haſt, God will call for it all again: but that which he gives
to His Sons, to His Children, they ſhall have mercy for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
though not to enjoy it in the ſame way, they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the ſame good and comfort Eternally. And then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The portion that the world hath here, (you
heard before) it comes from Gods patience; now there will
be an end of the manifeſtation of the glory of patience in
this world, as thus: As there are ſome graces of the Spirit
of God in the Saints, that ſhall have an end in regard of
their exerciſe here in this world, ſo there are ſome attributes
of God, that ſhall have an end in regard of the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in that way that God doth now manifeſt them
here in this world, and that is, the patience of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:29998:114"/>
ungodly ones; Now if they hold all upon patience,
when the time of the glory of that in this world ſhall come
to be at an end, then all their good is at an end. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Ungodly men, they ſhal have to deal with God
immediately in the world to come, (I beſeech you obſerve
but this anſwer, I'le haſten;) they muſt have to deal imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
with God in the world to come; Now they have to
deal with God through Creatures, and while they have to
deal with God through Creatures, they may get a great
deal, and may make ſhift for much, but when they ſhall
come to deal with God immediatly, then it will be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with them: As for example, There are a great many
hang-bies, at great mens houſes, perhaps when they come
to have to deal with the ſervants, they get ſome bits and
ſcraps, and many things from the ſervants, but if they know
they can have nothing, but from the very hand of the
Knight, or Lord of the houſe himſelf, then they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no great matter. So wicked men of this world, they
are as hang-bies, that all that they have are but as ſcraps
from the ſervants, they have to deal only with creatures,
they look no further; but hereafter things ſhall be ſetled
another way, and all things ſhall be weighed by God
Himſelf, in a ballance of Juſtice, and diſtributed by the
hands of God Himſelf immediately, and now things
will be carried after another manner, the Lord Himſelf
will come to diſpoſe of things. It was a ſpeech of a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Divine, though he were a good man, and lived very
innocently, when he lay upon his ſick bed, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
Death, he was in great terrors of ſpirit, mightily
troubled, and ſome of his friends came to him, and asked
him, Why ſhould you be ſo troubled, that have lived ſo
good a life, as you have done? This was his anſwer, The
Judgments of God are one, and the judgments of men are
another, I am now to deal with God; it is true, I lived
thus before Men, and Men gave their Verdict of me, as
good, and thought I was in a good condition, but O I
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:29998:115"/>
am now to go to God, and to deal immediately with Him,
and Gods judgment, and Mans judgements are different
things; when God ſhall come to weigh all mens portions
out, as it will be then, So much Righteouſneſs, ſo much
portion, ſo much happineſſe, you will ſay then, Lord, what
ſhall become of us all? All our righteouſneſs is as the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous
cloath; I but for the Saints, the Righteouſneſs of
Chriſt will be put into one Scale, and their Portion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other, and their Portion will be weighed by the
Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Now when thou comeſt to God,
thou muſt come to the Scale, and thou wilt put in thy
good ſervings of God, and thy comming to Church, and
ſome good Civil actions, and Natural and Moral things
thou haſt done, thou wilt put them in the Scale; ſaith
God, That which thou haſt had already, weighs down all
thoſe; Haſt thou nothing to put into the Scales but this?
thou haſt had thy reward already for all this, and much
more than this; then if there be nothing to but into the
Scale but this, thou art undone, and there is nothing for
thee for Eternity. And here is the ground of the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Portions of wicked men. Theſe are the Two
firſt things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will give you ſome <hi>CORRALLARIES</hi>
only from hence.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that wicked men have a portion here, and here
is all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Here we may ſee the Reaſon why the men of the
world are ſo cunning in the things of the world, why
they can make ſo good ſhift for themſelves in the world,
rather than other men can: Why, here's their Portion,
their very happineſs and good is here; no mervail though
they make ſuch ſhift as they do here: the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.
2. 12. We have not received the ſpirit of the world</hi> (ſaith
the Apoſtle,) we cannot tell how to ſhift in the world
ſo as other men do, for indeed, we look further than theſe
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:29998:115"/>
things, and ſo cannot ſhift as other men can; They that
have the ſpirit of the world, and have their portion in the
world, they can ſhift; but we have not received the ſpirit
of the world. You know a Swine though it goes abroad
all day wandring up and down, it knows the way to the
trough at night; but a Sheep if it go a wandring a little
way out of his place, a Sheep doth not know how to
come back again, but wanders up and down till it be even
loſt, and is as a loſt ſheep when it is once wandring up and
down; but Swine are not ſo. So ungodly men, though
they go up and down wandring, they know how to come
to their trough at night, they have better skil in the world,
they are more artificial in the things of the world, they
have better underſtanding (as the Scripture ſpeaks,) <hi>The
children of this world are wiſer in their generation, than the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of light:</hi> Why is it? Their Portion is in this world.
That's the firſt Corrallarie.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Corr.</hi> Here we ſee the Reaſon, Why there are ſo many
great ones in the world that regard Religion ſo little as
they do, and the waies of God, and the Church of God;
why 'tis not their portion; thoſe things that concern ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life, is not any part of their portion; they mind what
it is that concerns the preſent life, becauſe this is their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When many come into places of dignity and power,
What are their thoughts? Now they think of gratifying
their friends, now they think of reſpect and honor that
they ſhall have abroad in the world, and be accounted
ſome-body, now they think of revenging al their wrongs,
of making up of all their broken titles &amp;c. This hath been
heretofore (I ſuppoſe very ordinary) in men advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you; theſe are all their thoughts: as for doing
ſervice for God, and for His Church, and vindicating the
Truth of God, and Honor of God, that is ſcarce in all their
thoughts, for they do not look upon that as part of their
Portion: Here is the reaſon why ſo many Magiſtrates
are like to <hi>Galio,</hi> in <hi>Acts, 18. 17. Carring for none of thoſe

Whether Chriſt were the true Meſſias, and whether
He were God, or no; but to <hi>Gallio</hi> theſe things were but
matter of words: And ſo the great things of God, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to carnal hearts, they are things that are of no
great conſequence at all; yea when as <hi>Soſthenes</hi> that was
the Ruler of the Synagogue for countenancing of <hi>Paul,</hi> had
the rude multitude of the City, riſe up in a rude manner
to apprehend him, and to lay violent hands upon him,
<hi>Gallio</hi> cared for none of theſe things; but ſo far he did not
go, <hi>Gallio</hi> went not to ſtir up a rude multitude to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
hands upon a Ruler of a Synagogue, or a City, but he
cared for none of thoſe things (ſaith the text:) What did
he care for rectifying any thing that was amiſs in Religion?
Oh let us (ſay they that have their portion here) what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
becomes of things, let us make peace (ſay they) that we
may go on and be quiet in our houſes, &amp; enjoy that we have
quietly, and peacably, and they look no further: Their
portion is here, and as for Truth, how do they reject it,
&amp; contemn it! It is a ſpeech (as is credibly reported) hath
come even from a Citizen here, in curſing of the Truth ſo;
(as had he lived among the Jews he would certainly have
been ſtoned to death) <hi>Let us have Peace, and a Pox of Truth.</hi>
(I ſay) ſuch a ſpeech as this among the Jews would have
cauſed him to have been ſtoned to death, being ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
blaſphemy. But how many are ready to ſay with <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi>
in the 18. of <hi>John,</hi> 38. when as Chriſt was before <hi>Pilat,</hi>
and talked to <hi>Pilat</hi> of Truth, Truth (ſaith <hi>Pilat) What is
Truth?</hi> You ſhall obſerve it at the 38. ver. <hi>What is Truth?</hi>
(Saith <hi>Pilat)</hi> as if <hi>Pilat</hi> ſhould have ſaid, What a ſtrange
man is this, the man is in danger of his life, and he talks
of Truth, when he is in danger of his life, What is Truth?
(ſaith <hi>Pilat)</hi> &amp; turns it back upon him preſently. Juſt thus
are the hearts of many, What ſhould we look at Truth,
or at any thing now, but to preſerve our lives, and eſtates,
and outward comforts in the world? What is Truth?
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:29998:116"/>
They are a company of mad-brain'd fellows, that are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious,
and ſeditious, they talk of Truth, and know not
what they ſay, Come, let us have peace, though it be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any terms: Who is there in this place that deſires not
Peace? The Lord knows it is the deſires of thoſe that are
accuſed moſt for want of deſires in this thing; yea ſo as we
dare challenge any of you with this Challenge: Thoſe
who have been moſt at the Throne of Grace begging unto
God for peace for <hi>England,</hi> let them carry the day; thoſe
that have put forth moſt prayrs for <hi>Peace,</hi> before the Throne
of Grace, we are willing they ſhall have the day. We reade
that amongſt al the Tribes that came up in a war-like way,
to help the people of God againſt oppreſſion, in the 5. of
<hi>Judges,</hi> 18. and ſo in that Chapter, that of all <hi>Naphtali</hi> was
the only Tribe that joyned w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Zebulun,</hi> that jeoparded their
lives in the Cauſe of God, that would take up Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves, and the people againſt oppreſſion; Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe two Tribes, by the others that would not venture
themſelves, were at that time accounted very factious, and
very ſeditious; What they! only <hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Naphtali;</hi>
Yet it is obſervable, though there were none joyned with
<hi>Zebulun</hi> but only <hi>Naphtali,</hi> there is no Tribe of which it is
ſo much ſpoken, to be a Tribe, full of Courteſie, and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
of a peacable and quiet diſpoſition, as <hi>Naphtali</hi> was;
you ſhall find it, if you reade in the 49. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 21. and
afterwards in another text, there are theſe two things ſaid
of <hi>Naphtali,</hi> only theſe two firſt, <hi>That he was a Hinde let
looſe, and give goodly words.</hi> But they may be but words of
Complement, not reality; Nay, (when <hi>Moſes</hi> comes with
the bleſſing, you ſhall find theſe two places, one in <hi>Geneſis</hi>
and the other in <hi>Deuteronomy,)</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> comes with the
bleſſing again upon <hi>Naphtali:</hi> Naphtali <hi>filled with favour,
and with the bleſſing of the Lord.</hi> What is the meaning? <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali</hi>
was a Tribe that had moſt courteſie and civility of all;
compar'd to a goodly Hinde, of a quiet diſpoſition, and
one that gave courteous language to all, &amp; not meer words,
but reality; it was ſuch a one that was fill'd with favour,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:29998:117"/>
that had the favour of God, and the favour of Men; he
had ſuch a courteous carriage, and he had the bleſſing of
God upon him; and yet this <hi>Naphtali,</hi> was the Tribe that
would jeobard their lives, and take up Arms in defence of
the people of God, againſt oppreſſion in thoſe times, above
all. And <hi>Phinebas</hi> (ye know) was ſo zealous, and would
make uſe of the ſword, ſo as he did; yet in the 25. of <hi>Num.
12,</hi> 13. God ſaith there, <hi>He would make a Covenant of Peace
with him.</hi> Beloved! <hi>Phinehas,</hi> that is ſuch a fiery hot
man, yet a Covenaut of peace muſt be made with him, by
God Himſelf; for he did indeed, by that way procure peace
to Iſrael; for ſo the Text ſaith there in that place of <hi>Num.
That becauſe</hi> Phinehas <hi>was ſo zealous, it was, that I might not
conſume them in my jealouſie:</hi> Now it's obſervable, the word in
the Original is, Becauſe he was zealous, therefore it was,
that I might not conſume them in my <hi>Zeal.</hi> Its tranſlated in
your books; Becauſe he was thus zealous, that I might not
conſume them in my <hi>Jealouſie;</hi> the words are different in
the Engliſh; but in the Hebrew they are the ſame: and ſo
be turn'd thus, Becauſe he was ſo zealous, it was, that I
might not conſume them in my <hi>Zeal;</hi> as if he ſhould have
ſaid, If there had not been ſome among them that had been
zealous, (and as they account fiery) I would have been zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
my Self, and fiery my Self, and conſumed them, and
it was wel they had ſuch amongſt them; and one day thoſe
that cry out of them, may come to ſee cauſe to bleſs God
for them; that would not have the world put off, and
gul'd with the fair name of peace; we know the Devil
hath made much uſe of it in former times, and would fain
make uſe of it now; As if thoſe that deſired Truth moſt,
were not greateſt friends unto peace; God forbid, but it
ſhould be ſo: Though it's true, we think not, we have our
portion here, and therefore we would not have peace upon
any terms; indeed we confeſs our portion lies higher, and
that wherein our portion doth conſiſt we would have upon
any terms; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Philippoans, 3.
if by any means, I may attain to the Reſurrection of the dead; If
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:29998:117"/>
by any means, upon any terms, that I may have peace at the great
Day, whatſoever I do endure:</hi> ſo ſay we for our portion; and
you ſay, Let us have peace upon any terms; why? becauſe
your portion is here: We would be glad that all our Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
were Mountains of Olivet, but we would be loth to
have them Mountains of Corruption: In 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23. 13.
You reade there of a <hi>Mountain of corruption,</hi> Of <hi>Mons offenſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi>
Of offence; ſo it is in the old Latin; Now, what was
that ſame Mountain of Corruption? if we compare one
Scripture with another, we ſhall find it was no other, but
<hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> Mount Olivet was made a Mountain of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
In 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 7. There <hi>Solomon</hi> built Idolatrous
Temples, for the honour of the gods of his Queen, thoſe
gods that his Queen did worſhip, <hi>Solomon</hi> built Temples
for to gratifie her, and it was upon the Mount before jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
which was the Mount of <hi>Olivet,</hi> that was the Mount.
Now you know the Mount Olivet was a Mount that had
his name from Olives that did grow there, and were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of peace; but yet the Mount Olivet may be made a
Mount of Corruption: we would be glad that we might
live upon Mount Olivet all our daies, but are loth this
Mount Olivet ſhould be made a Mount of Corruption.
Give me leave but in a few words, yet to put ſome Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to you, and if I ſpeak not reaſon in them, reject
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe that you are ſo greedy of Comforts in
this world, you would fain have peace; be wiſe even for
your own portion; you would have peace, but I hope a
ſafe peace, and that is all we do deſire: If the peace be not
ſafe, Oh the bood that may follow after. We reade in the
27. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> 13. that there was indeed a <hi>Calm,</hi> and the
<hi>South wind</hi> did blow ſoftly, for a while, warm wind and
very ſoftly, but preſently follows, not long after it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that there did ariſe a Tempeſtuous wind, called <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clydon;
Euroclydon</hi> did ariſe preſently after: Take we heed
(my brethren) that we be not deluded with the ſoftly
South wind; Take heed that there be not an <hi>Euroclydon,</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:29998:118"/>
that blows preſently after; were we ſure to be delivered
from that ſame <hi>Euroclydon,</hi> we ſhould be glad of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of ſoft blowings of the South wind: Can you think
of a ſafe peace that live under any Arbitrary Governments?
No (that you'l ſay) and therefore we account our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ill now, for we have Arbitrary Governments amongſt
us now, And who are they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Do not the Parliament themſelves Govern in that kind of
way?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Give me leave in a word to anſwer this: Conſider
of the difference between that Arbitrary Government the
Parliament complains of; and what now you feel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That was then, when the Kingdom was in a
ſetled way, and then when there was no contrary Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
power to oppoſe it, yet then it went on, and ſurely
then it did but make way for worſe Arbitrary government;
but now it is in a way, when the Kingdom is unſetled,
and in a way, where there is a neceſſity of ſome help beyond
the ordinary courſe of Law, becauſe of a contrary Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Power, that is oppoſ'd; And is it poſſible for any man,
that hath any wiſdom, or underſtanding in his head, that
cannot ſee the difference between theſe two? But I'le ſhew
you a greater difference than this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. That which was before, thoſe that did ſo Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
ſuffer'd nothing in it themſelves, but gained all; now
thoſe that are accuſed for the preſent, (if it be Arbitrary,)
they ſuffer themſelves as much as we do, and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
doth ſuffer as much as we do; and therefore the thing
is far different from what was before. And yet further, if
you would not be carried away with words, but judge
righteous judgment, Conſider this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. Can you think that if the Adverſarie ſhould
prevail, you ſhould be only at the diſpoſe of the King? Do
you not think that thoſe that are with him, and give ſuch
ſtrength and aſſiſtance for the preſent, that you muſt lie at
their mercy too, in great part; And will that be ſafe for
you? I put it to every mans conſcience, whether he can
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:29998:118"/>
think that it is ſafer for Church, or Common wealth to be
governed by the King, with thoſe that are now about him,
and an Army of Papiſts, than to be governed by the King,
with His Two Houſes of Parliament? Which is the ſafeſt
way in the conſciences of any men living. And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than this, Conſider (if you have your eyes in your
heads)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. That perhaps what you aim at as your <hi>End,</hi>
your Adverſaries may aim at, but as their <hi>Means;</hi> and
what will become of you then? If that that you would
have as an <hi>End,</hi> they ſhall look at, but as a <hi>Medium;</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what Conſequences may come of it. And yet laſtly:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 5. You that do deſire ſo much Peace, to preſerve
your own Portions here; Would you not willingly have
ſuch Peace, as thoſe that have appeared for you in Houſes
of Parliament, in Citie, in the Miniſtry, that have been moſt
active, be preſerved too? Are you ſo deſirous of it, as to
be willing to leave them to the fury and rage of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries?
Were not this one of the horribleſt wickedneſſes
that ever were committed in a Kingdom? If they from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſave their own particular eſtates, ſhould betray thoſe
that have been faithful to them, in their places of Truſt.
It was once a ſpeech of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to one that would fain
have peace, he affirms, that it is a vain and prepoſterous
thing, to deſire peace with the flock, upon this condition,
<hi>That the Keepers of the flock may but be betraied, and taken away.</hi>
The fair name of Peace will never ſo prevail with a wiſe
man, when this ſhall come to be the condition of it. The
good people in <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> time, (however you may think
of thoſe that have moſt appear'd for you, &amp; ventured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
they thought it ſuch a thing, to have but the mouth
of one <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſtopt. And alſo they profeſſed, That if
the Sun ſhould take back, or bring back, or keep in his
Rayes, it were more tollerable, than that the mouth of
<hi>John</hi> ſhould be ſtopt; they had ſuch an high eſteem of a
faithful Miniſter in thoſe times. And therefore if you
would be faithful to God, and to the Kingdom, and to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:29998:119"/>
thoſe that have appear'd for you, look after ſuch peace,
as wherein you and they may be ſafe; God knows they
would have been willing to have been as ſilent as you; but
ſuppoſe all the Miniſters in the Kingdom, and men that
had ability to appear publickly, had all been ſilent, ſo as
the buſineſs had been wholly betraied, and at length an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Papiſts had riſen, when you had had no help to
have reſiſted them, Would you not have cried out of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters?
would you not have cried out of Magiſtrates?
would you not have cried out of Parliament Men? If they
have ventured themſelves to be faithful for you, know you
can have no peace, except they have it; and it were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
thing, to think of your ſafety without theirs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> We would not have our Eſtates
and Peace thus, as you ſpeak, upon any terms, without any
regard to Religion; we have our portion in Religion, as
well as you, and we have our Conſciences to look after, as
well as you, and God forbid it ſhould be otherwiſe, but
that Religion ſhould proſper too with our Peace; but we
would not have Sects and Sectaries to be maintained in the
Kingdom; let us have Truth, and Religion; but away
with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Do you underſtand what they are you ſpeak of?
Do you know wherein you and they differ? You cry out
of them, as if they were of another Religion, whereas when
it comes to be ſcan'd, the difference between you and them
will not be ſo great. But further, I put this to you:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. Do you ſpend as much breath in praying for
theſe kind of men, as you do in railing upon them? then
ſomewhat may be ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. It is a vain thing to think, that true Religion can
be maintain'd, and have the liberty of it, without ſome
difference of Opinion amongſt us: Indeed the Turks have
as much peace in their Religion, as any Religion hath in
all the world; and there is as little difference of Opinions
amongſt the Turks as there is in any Religion whatſoever;
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:29998:119"/>
but well may that Coat have no ſeam, that hath no ſhape;
If the Truth of Religion comes to appear, certainly it is
impoſſible but many differences in opinion muſt come, and
it is a moſt intollerable pride of heare, and tyranny in any
whatſoever, to think by violent means to force all to be of
the ſame opinion that they are of, in matters that are not
of the Foundation, and that may ſtand with the Peace of
a Common-wealth too; You take upon you in that more
than Chriſt doth, more than the Apoſtles ever did.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But You will ſay,</hi> If men be in an Error, why
ſhould they not be forced? Shall every man be leſt to his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
to do what he will?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, I plead not for that neither: Therefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
all Opinions, 1. Againſt the Foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
2. All thoſe Opinions that are againſt the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Civil Government. Take theſe Two aſide, and
then for other Opinions that are of a lower inferior nature
(I ſay) there you take too much upon you, whoſoever you
are, if you ſhould think to force men to be of the ſame O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
as you are; and there is no ſuch way to make diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance
in Churches or Commonwealths, as to force men
to be of the ſame Opinion, in things that are of an inferior
nature.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> If it be an Error, they muſt not
be left to live in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, ſtay there; A man may be in an Error,
and yet you have nothing to do to offer violence unto him
to bring him out of his Error; you may ſeek to convince
him as much as you can, but to offer violence, you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
more than God hath given you Commiſſion to do,
whatever you are; and I give this Scripture for it, that is
cleer, in <hi>Romans, 14. 2. One beleeveth he may eat all things;
another eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that
eateth not; and let him that eateth not, not judge him that eateth.</hi>
And ſo he tels us, <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another?</hi> Who art
thou that judgeſt. Theſe two Opinions could not be true:
One man doth eat herbs; the other man makes conſcience
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:29998:120"/>
of it, and cannot do it; Certainly, one of theſe was a ſin
at that, time one of them was a ſin, to eat herbs, and that
he might eat no fleſh, for God never commanded them, that
they ſhould eat no fleſh; to make conſcience to eat no fleſh
was a ſin, but yet though one were a ſin, yet they that were
in the right, muſt not by violence force thoſe that were in
the wrong, to their opinion, but they muſt leave them to
God; I ſay, in matters of ſuch conſequence as theſe, it is a
point of Antichriſtian tyranny, and pride, and notorious
pride in men, that have taken ſo much upon them, as to
force all to be of the ſame opinion; this is not the way cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
for true peace. But thus much for the ſecond Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallarie.
The Third follows.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Corr.</hi> If men have their portion in this world, here
is the Reaſon that there is ſuch a ſtir in the world by men
to maintain this their Portion; what a deal of ſtir is there?
what rending and tearing is there, that they might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Eſtates? Eſpecially if ſome men have a higher
Portion in the world than others, Oh what a deal of ſtir is
there to maintain it. I remember <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, writes
to Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and tels him, that by reaſon of an Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there was about the <hi>Popedom,</hi> one being choſen in <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the other in another place, that there were 230000. men
loſt their lives out of that Emulation; meerly about two
men, two Popes, it coſt the bloods of two hundred &amp; thirty
thouſand men. O what a ſtir is therein the world to ſatisfie
the wils of a few men in the world? Certainly one day the
world will be wiſer, and will underſtand that they are
Men, and not Dogs, that they were not made to be ſubject
to the humours and the luſts of men, and that no man
hath now any further power over him, but what they have
by an agreement from them one way or other, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit,
or explicit, one way or other, it is by their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that any man hath any power over them, and can
exerciſe any; The world (I ſay) ere long I hope will be
wiſe enough to underſtand this, and therefore will not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:29998:120"/>
ſo ſacrifice their lives for the ſatisfying of the wills of a
few men in the world, they ſhall not make ſuch a ſtir in
the world as heretofore they have done; Indeed men make
a great ſtir now to maintain their portions, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is not, <hi>de finibus,</hi> but <hi>de haereditate;</hi> not about matters
of <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>limits,</hi> (as he ſaid) but it is about the <hi>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it ſelf;</hi> it is about their portion; it is their God;
<hi>And do you ſay, What ails me, when you have taken away my
gods?</hi> Here is the ground of all the ſtirs and Combuſtions
in the world, becauſe carnal hearts look upon what they
enjoy as their portion; But how comes it thus to paſs,
that men ſhould be ſo greedy of this their portion? Is it
ſuch an excellent portion that they are ſo greedy of it? Is
it worth ſo much, that they contend ſo much about it? This
makes way for me to ſlip into the Fourth Particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To enquire what kind of Portion this is, that
theſe men of the world, have in this world, that they
make ſuch a ſtir about. <hi>And therefore to make way for
that;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> Conſider what poor things they are, that they
make ſuch a ſtir about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Conſider the Tenure, upon which they hold
whatſoever they do enjoy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Conſider the mixture of Evil, that there is in
that they do enjoy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> The bleſſed Portion that they loſe, that they
might enjoy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly.</hi> The dreadful end that there will be to ſuch men
that have their portion here.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The poor things, that men have here in this world;</hi> What
are they? Their Comforts for the moſt part, are but
imaginary; In <hi>Hoſea, 12. 1. Ephraim feeds upon the wind:</hi>
And when a bladder is ful of wind, one prick lets it quite
out; and ſo when Death comes, it lets out all their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts:
even as the wind goes all out at one prick in a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:29998:121"/>
ſo all the comforts of the men of the world, go out
by the prick of death. In <hi>Prov. 23. 5. Wilt thou ſet thy heart
upon that which is not?</hi> it is not, it hath no reality in it. And
in <hi>Acts,</hi> 25. when <hi>Bernice</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> came in great pomp
and ſtate to the Aſſembly; that which you have in your
books tranſlated great <hi>Pomp,</hi> it is in the Greek, with great
<hi>Fancie:</hi> all the pomp and jollity in the world, it is but a
fancy, this is their portion.</p>
               <p>2. That which they have, it is of a very low nature;
this would be an argument, we might phyloſophize in,
if it were fit, or if we had time, but I'le quickly paſs over
theſe things, it's of a very low nature, it not much concerns
the ſoul, all the portion they have; Therefore ſaith the
Text here, <hi>Thou filleſt their belly;</hi> it's but a belly full; what
is that to the ſoul? Indeed the rich man in the Goſpel
could ſay, <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe, for thou haſt goods laid up for
many yeers, eat, drink, &amp;c.</hi> Wilt thou ſay, Soul, take thy
eaſe, becauſe thou haſt goods laid up, and becauſe you may
eat, and drink? What is all this to the ſoul? <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath
ſuch a ſpeech upon the place, <hi>If the man had the ſoul of a ſwine,
what could be ſaid otherwiſe?</hi> for indeed theſe things were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the ſoul of a ſwine: you ſhall find that a man is not
the better, becauſe of outward things, not a whit; the heart
of the wicked is little worth; his eſtate may be ſomewhat
worth, his houſe may be ſomewhat worth, his lands may
be ſomewhat worth; <hi>But the heart of the wicked is little worth,
Prov.</hi> 10. And would not you think it to be a great evil,
if ſo be that when you go up and down abroad, you ſhould
certainly know, that there is no man doth give you any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
or any reſpect, but it is for your ſervants ſake
that tends upon you, would not that diſcourage you, and
trouble you? Indeed you come to ſuch a mans houſe, and
he ſeems to make you welcome, and you have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
I but you come to know afterwards, that it was not
for your ſake, but for your ſervants ſake that be loved;
would you think you had a good entertainment there? the
truth is, ſo all the reſpect you have in this world, it is for
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:29998:121"/>
your ſervants ſake, for your goods, houſe, and lands, it is
not for any worth that is in you. It was a ſpeech that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
ſpake once, to one <hi>Achilous,</hi> when he had a fine houſe,
and a many brave things there (ſaith he) There are many
come to ſee thy houſe, and thy fine things there, but no
body comes to ſee thee; they know there is a worth in thy
fine houſe, and in thy fine furniture, but they ſee no worth
in thee. Indeed all theſe things are not ſouls meat, it is
not mans meat they feed upon, it is but aſhes, it is nothing
to the ſoul of man. Further:</p>
               <p>3. Suppoſe it were for the ſoul, What thou haſt here,
is but a very poor pittance, a ſcantie portion, thou haſt
not all the world neither, thou haſt thy portion in this
world; If thou hadſt the whol world at command, yea if
God ſhould make a thouſand worlds more for thee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
this were all but a poor pittance to put off an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
ſoul withal: but now, that thou haſt is but a little
minnim in the world: All Nations of the Earth are but as
the duſt of the ballance, and drop of the bucket to God;
What is thy duſt then? what is thy houſe, and land then?
As <hi>Socrates</hi> wittily rebuked the pride of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> when he
was very proud, that he had ſo much Land lay together;
He brought his Map of the world to him, and ſaith he, Pray
ſhew me where your land lies here, one prick of a pen would
have deſcribed it all. Should we take a rich man here that
hath a great deal of land, and bring a Map of the world to
him, all <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> are but three little
ſpots unto the world; And what are your Farms, and your
Mannours you have? you have but a little portion, if you
had all, it were no great matter: the truth is, All you have
in this world cannot be enough to make you live in faſhion
in the world, like a man; it's not enough (I ſay) for to live
like a man in the world, to live like one that hath an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
ſoul, like one that hath the Image of God upon him,
and was ſent hither into the world to do ſome great ſervice
as every one of you was ſent hither to do; therefore it is
but a mean thing, little cauſe you have for to rejoyce in it;
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:29998:122"/>
It's true, they that are godly, account themſelves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the leaſt thing they have here in this world, but I'le
tell you a Myſtery of Religion now, a practical Maxime of
Religion, that is a great Myſtery to the world, and that
is this, That a gracious heart, though he thinks himſelf
unworthy of the leaſt crum of bread, yet all the Creatures
in Heaven and Earth will not ſerve him to be his portion,
will not ſatisfie him; though he hath a heart that will be
ſatisfied with any thing, as counting himſelf unworthy of
the meaneſt condition in this world, as a preſent gift of
God, but if God ſhould give him Heaven and Earth, he
hath ſuch an unſatisfying heart, as he would not be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Heaven and Earth, except God gives him Himſelf:
therefore certainly thy portion is but a very little portion.</p>
               <p>4. Thoſe things that thou haſt, are things that will
vaniſh, and quickly come to nothing. It is ſaid, of the
whol world, in <hi>Job; 26. 7. The whol earth hangs upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi>
and ſo all things of the Earth do: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham;</hi> in <hi>Hebrews, 11. That he ſought
a City that had foundations:</hi> All other things, are as things
that have no foundation at all; There is a worm in every
creature, that will conſume it in time; and the Scripture
calls all our riches, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain riches;</hi> and Chriſtian thou
art made for an eternal condition, theſe things are fading;
when thou comeſt to enter in upon thy eternal eſtate, if
thou ſhould'ſt then ask, what ſhall I have now? I have
now thus much, and thus much, in my whol life, but
what ſhall I have now I come to enter in upon my eternal
eſtate, truly nothing at all. If a man were to go a great
Voyage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and all the proviſion he makes is this,
he gets a Veſſel that can make ſhift to carry him as far as
<hi>Graveſend,</hi> that he will do, and what need he hath of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
to <hi>Graveſrnd,</hi> or perhaps to the <hi>Downs,</hi> he provides
for; he goes on, and ſhould go on now to the <hi>Downs,</hi> and
begins his Voyage to go to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and is gotten into
the Ocean; alas the Veſſel is a rotten Veſſel; Were not this
an unwiſe man? Truly this is the condition of thouſands
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:29998:122"/>
in the world, Man, Woman, thou art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ade for an eternal
condition; God intends Eternity to every Mothers Child
that is here this day, &amp; God expects that thy life ſhould be
ſpent in making proviſion for this Eternal eſtate of thine,
and thou thinkeſt of nothing but that thou maieſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for a few years here, and live in ſome faſhion, and
be ſome body in the world here; Oh! when thou comeſt
to enter upon the Ocean of Eternity, thou wilt give a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſhreek, and cry out, <hi>I am undone, I am undone,</hi> I have
provided nothing for Eternal life; theſe things are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain:
Oh what a deal of difference there is between the
ſame men in two or three years? I might tell you (but the
time ſo haſtens) that great difference two or three years
have made between man and man, but I forbear it, becauſe
I ſee the time will not give leave: And yet further for the
meanneſs of the Portion.</p>
               <p>5. What ever thou haſt in this world, it is no other,
but what may ſtand with the Eternal hatred of an infinite
God towards thee; it may be the portion of a Reprobate,
and will this ſerve thy turn? will this ſatisfie thee? will
that ſatisfie thy ſoul, that may be the portion of a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate?
There are many now that are ſweltring under the
wrath of the infinite God, that have had twenty times as
much as any of you have, that are here before the Lord this
day, they have had greater eſtates than you, and lived mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
lives than you, and yet are now under the wrath of
God; Wil a Reprobates portion ſerve thy turn? Therfore
ſurely it is but a mean thing, that will ſtand with Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
hatred; Conſider it, To enjoy the Dominion of all
the world, may ſtand with Gods Eternal hatred; but to
have but the leaſt dram of ſaving grace, cannot ſtand with
Gods Eternal hatred: What a difference is there between
the having the leaſt dram of grace, and the enjoyment of al
the world? what a goodly portion is there here that thou
ſo much rejoyceſt in? It is certainly, becauſe thy heart is ſo
ſtraight, that thou thinkeſt theſe things to be ſo big; As
in a narrow Veſſel, a thing will appear big, but in a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:29998:123"/>
wide Veſſel, it appears little; So when the Lord by
grace ſhall widen and enlarge thy heart, then all the things
of the world will be little to thee; Grace hath the Image
of God in it, now what ſaith God of Himſelf, in <hi>Iſa. 40.
All the world is but as the drop of the bucket, and the duſt of the
ballance;</hi> Now grace hath Gods likeneſs, and through the
Image of God in a gracious heart, the Soul ſaith thus of
the world, as God ſaith of the world, that all the world
is but as the drop of the bucket, and the duſt of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
to me; When the Lord promiſed to perſwade <hi>Japhet</hi>
to dwell in the tents of <hi>Shem;</hi> the word that is tranſlated
<hi>perſwade,</hi> it ſignifies to <hi>enlarge,</hi> that He would enlarge the
heart of <hi>Japhet;</hi> and indeed when God doth convert a
ſoul, the Lord doth enlarge that ſoul, doth enlarge the
heart, and therefore all the things of the world, are now
but little; Indeed if a man be below here, and looks upon
that which is next to him, that hath any bigneſs in it,
it ſhews ſomewhat great, but if a man were advanced on
high, upon the top of a Pinnacle, then that which ſeemed
great, appears but little to him; ſo the men of the world,
that here lie groveling below, and the curſe of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
is upon them, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thy belly ſhalt thou go, and duſt ſhalt
thou eat;</hi> they think the things of the world great matters;
but grace lifts up the heart on high to God and Chriſt,
mounts it up to Eternity, and then they can look upon
all theſe things here below, as mean things; and this
was the reaſon that <hi>Luther,</hi> when he had great gifts ſent in
to him by many of the great men of <hi>Saxony,</hi> he began to be
afraid, leſt the Lord ſhould reject him, here in this world,
and he hath this expreſſion, <hi>I did vehemently proteſt God
ſhould not put me off ſo;</hi> that is his word, according to the
manner of the man, you know the man, and his language;
according to the manner of his language thus he ſpeaks,
when there came in things of the world, and he began to
be tickled with honor, and great men did reſpect him, Oh
(thought he) I ſhall be ſomebody now in the world, thus
corruption began to work, but grace did prevail, and he
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:29998:123"/>
breaks out with this expreſſion, I did profeſſe God ſhould
not put me off ſo, the Lord ſhall not put me off ſo; there
are other things which I look for, things which are better
and higher, theſe are poor pittances for this ſoul of mine to
be put off withal, there are other things I muſt have from
the Lord, or elſe I cannot be ſatisfied. That's the Firſt
thing, the poor things of the world, which is the Portion
of wicked men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider the Tenure by which they hold it.</p>
               <p>All you have in the world, you hold it not by a good
Tenure, it is not held in Capite, that is not the tenure
you hold it by: I confeſſe this, I think not the men of
the world to be Uſurpers for what they lawfully get in
the world, I do not think they ſhall anſwer meerly for
their uſing what they do, meerly for their right to uſe that
they have, but they ſhall anſwer for their not right-uſing;
they ſhall not anſwer (I ſay) for their right to uſe, but for
their not right-uſing; they have ſome right, but what
right is it they hold it upon? what tenure? There is a
Threefold right:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>A right from Juſtice,</hi> that we may claim a thing by:
One can claim by Juſtice, ſuch a thing is his due: That's
not your right, you cannot claim any thing.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>There is a right from Creation,</hi> that God gave to man
at firſt Creation: you have loſt that too.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>There is a right from Promiſe?</hi> God hath now promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all good things to his people; you have not that right
neither: You have neither the right of Juſtice to claim;
nor the right from your Creation; nor the right from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:
What right then? There is a Fourth right, and
that right I confeſs you have, and that is.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>A right from Donation:</hi> God is pleaſed to give to you,
but juſt thus; You hold all your Honors and Eſtates, that
are ungodly men, juſt thus, Even as a man that is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to die, and there being a little reprieving for two or
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:29998:124"/>
three daies before his execution, the Prince out of his indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
gives order to have proviſion made for him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Quality, that if he be a Gentleman, he ſhal have
ſuch proviſion, if a Knight, a Nobleman, a Peer of the
Realm, he ſhall have proviſion according to his Quality,
till his Execution; now no man can ſay, this man uſurps,
though he hath forfeited all his right to his Land and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
yet if the King will give him this refreſhment, he is no
uſurper, but it is a poor right he hath, it's a right from Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
and thus God gives the ungodly men, in this world
they have a right to outward comforts: you have your
Portion, but you ſee how you hold it. That's the Second
thing. I have but one or two things more to diſpatch of
this particular: and two things further, and I ſhall wind
up all as briefly as I can. (I am told I may take ſome liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at ſuch a time as this is, and ſeeing it is only the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
oportunity we meddle withal; give me leave a little
the more to tranſgreſſe upon your patience, in that I hope it
will not be very much) The next thing to be conſidered, it
is, That this Portion here, as it's poor in regard of the mean
things, and the Tenure: So,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> There is a great deal of Mixture here in this
you have.</p>
               <p>1. There is a manifold Mixture of <hi>Cumber,</hi> of <hi>Trouble;</hi>
and the truth is, All the good things that wicked men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
in this world, will ſcarce bear charges; that is, there
is ſo much trouble they meet withal here in this world with
their Portion, that all they have will ſcarce bear charges:
And if a man goes a Voyage, we uſe not to count any thing
he ſpends by the way to be part of his Treaſury. Now all
we have here in this world, is but Spending-money to bear
our Charges, in regard God knows we ſhall be at a great
deal of Charges, and afflictions we ſhall meet with here.
But beſides:</p>
               <p>2. There is a Mixture of <hi>Curſe</hi> in every Portion of an
Ungodly man. If any of you think you get ſuch a rich
Match, you get an Heir that is a very rich Match, and you
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:29998:124"/>
get her portion, and there you go and fetch away the bags
of God that are her portion, but if it ſhould prove that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
bag of Gold you have of your Wives portion had the
Plague in it, it were but a poor portion. Certainly it is
thus with all ungodly ones in the world, that all the while
they live, whatſoever they enjoy, ſo long as continuing
wicked, they have a Curſe of God that goes along with it,
and makes way unto Eternal miſery for them: As thoſe
that are godly have the bleſſing of God in outward things,
that makes way for their Eternal good; So thou haſt the
Curſe of the Lord mingled with all thy outward things
that makes way for Eternal evil unto thee. And then,
Conſider,</p>
               <p>3. What portion thou loſeſt; thou haſt gotten one, but
thou loſeſt a great deal more: If a man had been at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
and made ſome bargain about ſome petty thing,
and afterwards when he comes home, knows that by not
buying ſuch a thing, he hath loſt a bargain that would
have made him and his poſteritie, he hath little cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
in that bargain he hath made: So though thou haſt
got a portion that may ſeem to ſatisfie thee ſomwhat, know
thou haſt loſt a portion of infinit worth and value; and it's
impoſſible to ſhew you what this portion is; for the Devil
could ſhew Chriſt all the glory of the world in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an eye; but if I ſhould come to ſhew you the glory
of Heaven, I had need have Eternity to ſhew you what the
portion of the Saints is, but though I cannot ſhew it you
all, I will only give you a hint or two, that you may know
ſomewhat, what it is:</p>
               <p>1. It is ſuch a portion, as is fit for the Spouſe of the Lamb,
as is fit for the Spouſe of one that is to marry the Son
of God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity.</p>
               <p>2. It is ſuch a portion, which is fit and ſutable to an
Heir of Life and Glory, an Heir of Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>3. It is ſuch a portion, as God doth give it unto
them, to this very end, As to declare what the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Power of God is able to do, to raiſe a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:29998:125"/>
to the height of happineſs; What think you
this muſt be? that (I ſay) it muſt therefore be done,
that it might declare to Angels, and all creatures,
what the infinit power of God is able to do, to raiſe
a poor creature to happineſs and glory. This muſt
be ſomewhat.</p>
               <p>4. It muſt be ſuch a one, as in which God muſt attain
unto the great deſign that he had from all eternity
in making the Heaven, and Earth; the ſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
that God had in making Heaven and Earth,
from all Eternity, it was, to magnifie the Riches of
His Grace, to a Company that He had ſet apart
to glory; it muſt be ſuch a portion, and gueſs you
what this muſt needs be.</p>
               <p>5. It is ſuch a portion, as muſt require the infinite po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God to ſupport a Creature to be able to bear
the weight of that glory: it's ſuch a portion. And
do you but think what kind of portion that muſt
needs be?</p>
               <p>6. All this muſt needs be now to all Eternity. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
when <hi>Eſau</hi> did but hear <hi>Iſaac</hi> his father tel
what a bleſſing he had given unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Text
ſaith, that <hi>Eſau fell a weeping.</hi> Oh! that God
would ſtrike upon the hearts of men that have ſo
little minded any thing, but the preſent things of
the world; thou heareſt but a few words of what
the Lord hath reſerved to all eternity for his Saints,
and compare but that with what is thy portion,
and what is like to be thy portion; and thou haſt
cauſe to weep; I, but more cauſe you will have to
weep, if ſo be you conſider the laſt thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly.</hi> What is like to be thy <hi>End,</hi> thy Portion is in this
world; if indeed thou couldſt ruffle it out in this world, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
thy hearts deſire, and there an end, it were ſomewhat: Oh but
there is ſomewhat elſe remains afterwards: <hi>As firſt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:29998:125"/>
1. Oh the perplexity of Spirit that any worldly man
will have, when Death comes, when he ſhall ſee an end of
all the comforts of this world, now farewell houſe, and
lands, and friends and acquaintance, and all merry meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and jovialities, I ſhall never have comfort more in
you. As it was the ſpeech of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> when he was to
die; <hi>O thou my ſoul! my ſoul! whither art thou going? whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
art thou going? thou ſhalt never have more jeſts, nor be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor be jocund any more; where art thou going?</hi> So may a
man that hath his portion in this world here, ſay at his
death, Where is this poor ſoul of mine going? I have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
here thus many yeers, and I have had many merry
meetings, and I have eaten of the fatteſt, and drunk of the
ſweeteſt, and gone in brave array, but now my day is gone,
what ſhall become of me? what peace have I now when all
is gone? I remember <hi>Latimer</hi> hath ſuch a ſtory in one of his
Sermons that he preached before <hi>King Edward,</hi> he tels a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a rich man, that when he lay upon his ſick bed, there
came one to him, and tels him that certainly by all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
they can judg by, That he was like to be a man for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
world, a dead man: Aſſoon as ever he hearts but theſe
words, (they are <hi>Latimers</hi> words, I only repeat them as his
words, and they were before a King, and ſo they will not
be too broad words, nor too rude to ſpeak before you; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon
as ever he did but hear this) What muſt I die? ſend
for a Phyſitian; wounds, ſides, heart, muſt I die? wounds,
ſides, heart, muſt I die? and thus he goes on; and there
could be nothing got from him, but wounds, ſides, heart,
muſt I die? muſt I die, and go from all theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here was all;
here is the end of this man, that makes his portion to be in
this world. Another rich man that lived not far from the
place that I my ſelf lived in heretofore, when he heard his
ſickneſs was deadly, he ſends for his bags of money, and
hugs them in his arms, Oh! muſt I leave you? Oh! muſt I
leave you? And another, that when he lay upon his ſick
bed, cals for his bags, and laies a bag of gold to his heart,
and then bids them take it away, it will not do, it will not
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:29998:126"/>
do. Another when he lay upon his ſick bed, his friends
came to him and ſaid, What lack you? what would you
have? would you have any Beer? want you any thing?
Oh no, (ſaith he) I want only one thing, Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
that I would have: it is not beer, nor friends, nor
an eaſie pillow I want, but eaſe of Conſcience. Oh conſider
now, whether there be not like to be perplexity in your
Spirits?</p>
               <p>2. You muſt be called to an Accompt for all; though
(as I told you before) not to accompt for the right to uſe,
but for not right-uſing; and do but now think with your
ſelves, If you now have ſo much as you cannot reckon, how
then will you be able to reckon for it, if you cannot now
reckon it? now you have ſo much as you cannot count,
how will you be able to give an accompt of what you have
now, eſpecially when you have had no thoughts of this
beforehand?</p>
               <p>3. There is at laſt a dreadful portion indeed at the day
of Judgment; Oh the ſhame and confuſion that will be
upon the faces of the men of the world! eſpecially when
they ſhall ſee perhaps their poor neighbors have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Chriſt, in glory: perhaps a poor boy, a poor
ſervant in the houſe advanced to glory, and they ſtand on
the left hand to be caſt out; perhaps ſome of theſe poor
Hoſpital boyes ſhall be admitted to eternal glory, when as
ſome of you that are their great Maſters, ſhall be caſt out
eternally; and what an infinit ſhame and confuſion would
this be to you? Oh now I ſee what it is to truſt in God,
and not to truſt in him; theſe are happy that would truſt
for the future, but I miſerable that dare not truſt in him:
and then the concluſion what will it be? in <hi>Pſalm, 11. 6.
The Lord will rain ſnares and fire and brimſtone, and this ſhall be
the portion of their cup;</hi> here is the portion of the Ungodly
at laſt: and in <hi>Mat, 24. 51. Appoint him his portion with
Hypocrites, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth;</hi> that
is the portion of Hypocrites in the concluſion; Now here
thou ſeeſt the End of all, what do'ſt thou think then of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:29998:126"/>
thy portion now? Think but of one text and I have done
this, in <hi>Job, 27. 8. What hope hath an Hypocrite though he hath
gained, when God takes away his ſoul?</hi> Mark, there were many
Hypocrites that aimed to get in the world, and cannot
get in the world, God croſſes them here; well, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
thou aimeſt at gain, and canſt get what thou would'ſt
have, thou haſt got all thou would'ſt deſire, but what
hope hath an Hypocrite though he hath gained, though he
hath grown never ſo rich, and got all he deſires, when
God takes away his ſoul? This time is coming, it will be
ere long, and it may be ere long the portion of ſome that
are here preſent; and perhaps this Text of mine, may
then ring in their ears, when they lie upon their ſick beds,
perhaps within a month or ſix weeks, or a quarter of a
yeer, when Gods time ſhall be, and then this Sermon,
Conſcience may repeat in your ears; I heard ſuch a day,
there were a generation of men, that have their portion in
this world, and now I am afraid I am one of them, and
there is an end of my portion, only I muſt go to my other
portion; that will be very dreadful. But I muſt not make
an end, till I ſhall ſpeak ſomwhat of the next, I ſhall leave
the Point very bare elſe; I, but who have you ſpoke to all
this while?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Who is the man that hath his Portion in this world?</p>
               <p>It is a poor portion you have ſet it out to us, but every one
will go away and ſay, I hope it is not I, I hope it is not
I, I hope God hath a better portion for me than this;
therefore give me leave to ſpeak in the Name of God to
you, and I'le only ſpeak from God, and out of His Word
to you, to point out the man and woman, that is like
to have his portion here, living and dying in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
I now am ſpeaking of; that man that is in ſuch a
condition I ſhall open to you, in the preſent condition
wherein he is, is certainly the man, and the Lord pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it this day, that his portion is in this world. Who is
he?</p>
               <p>1. That man to whom God gives in this life nothing
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:29998:127"/>
but what belongs to this life; that is the man apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
If God give thee thy eſtate, and if He give thee not
ſomewhat beſides thy eſtate, a principle that is a ſeed
of Eternal life in thee here in this world, certainly He
never intends good to thee in the world to come; There
are many men have a great deal in this world, and they
ſay, they hope God will be merciful to them in the
world to come; now this is a certain truth, that man to
whom God denies Spiritual mercies in this world, God
will deny Eternal mercy to him in the world to come;
this therefore ſhould be thy care, Doth God encreaſe my
eſtate in this world? Oh that the Lord would give a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
meaſure of grace too, elſe it is nothing; Lord
thou giveſt me here a great eſtate, if thou giveſt not to me
grace with it, a proportionable meaſure of grace to uſe
it to thy glory, I had better have been without this; Is
this thy care? I put it to thy conſcience; As thy eſtate
encreaſes, art thou ſolicitious at the Throne of grace, that
the Lord would give thee a proportionable meaſure of
grace, to mannage thy eſtate for His glory; then peace
be to thee, thou art not the man. And then further,
you may examin it.</p>
               <p>2. By the working of your hearts about your preſent
Portions. As firſt.</p>
               <p>1. Whether you enjoy what you have for it ſelf, and
whether your hearts be terminated in what you do
enjoy: One that is godly, and hath his Portion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
theſe things, he enjoyes the Creature; I but it
is God in it he enjoyes: It is ſweet to me, that I can ſee
and taſt the love of God in it: I but a carnal heart
enjoys the creatures, and runs away, and is termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
there, looks at the Creature, but at little in God;
as divers of your Hoſpital Children, here, look more
at the Men that were their friends, to bring them into
the Hoſpital, when they were Fatherleſs and Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
and Siſterleſs, than they look at the Founders
of the Hoſpital, they little think of them, to thank
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:29998:127"/>
God for them, but if they meet with him, that was
the next cauſe to bring them in, they will thank him
for his kindneſs. So it is with men, they look at that
Creature that was the firſt means of bringing them in;
but a godly heart looks at the root of all: I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it is ſaid of one that came into the Treaſuries of
<hi>Venice,</hi> he ſaw tables of Gold, and Silver there, and
he points down and looks at the bottom of the table,
and one asked him, Why is your eye ſo at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom?
Oh ſaith he, I am looking at the root of all
this. Oh! alas, it is a ſmall matter for a man that
hath a great Trade to have a great Portion: So many
men, look not ſo much at the Root; whereas a godly
man, though he hath but a little, yet he looks at the
Root, at the love of God, and the Covenant of grace,
that is the Root of all; and this is the thing that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies
his heart: When a man takes a portion of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
he puts it into the Poſſet-ale, the Poſſet-ale is not
the thing that makes the Phyſick work, though it is
that that is the greater part, but it is the Phyſick in it.
So it is the goodneſs of God that ſatisfies a gracious
heart, and not the Creature that is operative ſo much
upon a gracious heart: and then you may examine
how your hearts are ſet upon theſe things of the
world.</p>
               <p>2. Whether your hearts go out with full ſtrength to
them; If you make your bellies to be your god, then
your end will be deſtruction (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks:)
That man that hath his heart ſwallowed up in the
earth like <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that were
ſwallowed up in the earth, if the things of the earth
be a gulf to ſwallow thy heart up, there is another
gulf to ſwallow thee up hereafter.</p>
               <p>3. How do the loſs of the things of the world take thy
heart? Doſt not thou count thy ſelf an undone man,
when thou haſt loſt ſome comforts? Doſt not thou
come home to thy wife and children, and ſay, I am
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:29998:128"/>
an undone man: Why? what's the matter? I have
loſt ſome part of my eſtate: O carnal heart! one that
is gracious may have ſome croſſes, but no loſſes at all,
becauſe he enjoyes all in God, he hath God to make
up all his loſſes: And the truth is, if thou wert truly
godly, whatſoever afflictions thou meeteſt withal; (as
we ſay a man may put all in his eye) ſo you may (if
you be godly) put all your croſſes in your eyes, you
are ſo far from being undone. And further examin,</p>
               <p>4. Whether theſe things of the world, be not the only
ſutable things to your hearts; whether you bleſs not
your ſelves in theſe, as in your happineſs: The Ivie
will claſp about a rotten tree, and cannot be taken
off it without tearing: And ſo the heart of a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
will claſp about theſe rotten-comforts as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreeable thing; You may hear them ſometimes
tell with joy, That we were in ſuch a place, and we
were ſo merry, and had the braveſt meeting: And
what was there? Why there was ſinging, and roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and blaſpheming of the Name of God, and yet
it was the braveſt meeting that could be. When did
you ever come from an Ordinance of God, and ſay,
Oh! it was a brave day to me, the Lord hath ſpoken
to my heart this day: Did you never go from the
Word with as merry a heart, and can rejoyce for it
amongſt your friends, as you did from a merry mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?
You may fear you are the man, that have your
portion here. And then this is more cleer, for every
one to examin his heart in, and if I were to give but
any one Evidence, whether a man hath Grace or no,
I would give this aſſoon as any one; A man that hath
got ſome eſtate in the world, I put this to him:</p>
               <p>5. What doſt thou account to be the chiefeſt good of
thy eſtate, more than thou hadſt before, or more than
another man hath? A man that hath got an eſtate
more than he had, or more than his brother: there
are many good things in his eſtate, that he will think
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:29998:128"/>
good; Now I may live in better faſhion than I could
before, now I may have more freedom than I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
now I may have more credit in the world than I
had before, now I may have my own mind, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
my own luſts more than I had before, or than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man can do; Is not this the thing thou moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceſt
in? yea, is not this a truth, that ſome of your
hearts, if they were ripped up, this would be the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of them; that you muſt rejoyce in your eſtates,
becauſe by them you have fuel for your luſts? A poor
man hath not ſo much fuel for his uncleanneſs as you
have, nor ſo much fuel for his luſt of pride and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
as you have; and many rich men account the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
the good, and happineſs of their eſtates to conſiſt
in this very thing; that now they may have a larger
ſcope for their luſts, than ever they could before; alas
a poor man cannot go abroad and drink as you can
do, a poor man cannot lay out ſo much money on a
Whore, an Unclean wretch, as you can do, and you
rejoyce in this: and if this man have not his portion
here, what man hath? the Lord ſtrike ſuch a mans
heart. But on the other ſide, A gracious heart when
God bleſſes him in this world, though there be but a
little grace, it wil work thus, The Lord hath raiſed my
condition above my brother, &amp; therein the Lord gives
me a larger opportunity to do him ſervice, than my
brother hath or than I had before; there is ſuch a poor
man, he is an honeſt man, but God knows he can do
but little in the place where he is, he hath but little
means: but God hath given me means, and this means
enlarges my opportunity to do God ſervice, and for
this my ſoul bleſſeth God; I count my eſtate happier
in this, becauſe I now may be of more uſe, and do God
more ſervice than otherwiſe I could do; Have you
ſuch workings in heart, you rich men? if you have
not never be at quiet til you get your hearts working
in this manner; this will be a bleſſed teſtimony that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:29998:129"/>
God gives you a portion here, and intends another
portion for you in the world hereafter.</p>
               <p>6. What is that thing that you ſtrive to make moſt ſure?
That which a man ſtrives to make moſt ſure, that he
counts his happineſs to conſiſt in; Oh for thy Land,
and Debts, thou ſtriveſt with all thy might to make
that ſure, but as for the matter of thy Salvation, and
peace in Chriſt, thou haſt a good hope in God for, but
takeſt no pains to make it ſure.</p>
               <p>7. What doſt thou admire moſt men for? O! ſuch a
man is happy, he hath ſo much coming in, and hath
ſo much a yeer: But doſt thou call the vile man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py?
it is a ſign that thou haſt not thine eye enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Spirit of God; but now, Canſt thou look
upon even thoſe that are poor, and mean in this world,
that have the leaſt portion here, yet as moſt happy
Creatures, becauſe the Lord gives them the Grace of
His Spirit; and think, well, 'tis true, I have a greater
eſtate than ſuch a poor man that is my neighbor, or
than ſuch a poor man, but God knows he doth God
more ſervice than I do, he prayes more, and more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
in one day than I do in a whol yeer: Oh! the
Lord hath other manner of prayers, and ſighs come
from his poor Cottage, than ever he had from my
brave Pallace; I have my City-houſe, and Country-houſe,
but they were never ſo perfum'd with prayers;
Some that live in poor Cellers, ſend up more prayers,
and God hath more honor from them, than He hath
from me; in my family (perhaps) there is curſing, and
blaſpheming of God; in ſuch poor Cottages there is
(perhaps) bleſſing, and praiſing of God. Now ſee if
thou lookeſt upon them as the moſt happy people in
the world.</p>
               <p>8. What, art thou careful to lay up for thy Children?
That is like to be thy portion; If the things of the
world take up thy care for thy children moſt, that is
an argument, thou thinkeſt thy Children have a good
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:29998:129"/>
portion, if thou canſt leave them ſo many thouſands,
it is like it is thy portion too, if thou counteſt it theirs.
And then further,</p>
               <p>9. Examin thy ſervices what they are:</p>
               <p>1. Doſt thou put off God with ſlight ſervices? Then
know thy portion is like to be of Gods ſlight mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>2. Art thou hypocritical in thy ſervice? Doſt thou
aim at the praiſe of men in outward duties? That
is a ſign thou haſt thy reward here.</p>
               <p>3. And are thy ſervices forc'd, that thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd?
Is it meerly conſcience compels thee, and
not an inward agreeableneſs between the frame of
thy heart, and holy things? Then it's like a ſervants
portion is thine, and not a childs portion.</p>
               <p>10. Further, Haſt thou heretofore been a forward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
in Religion, and haſt thou forſaken the waies
of God? I'le give you a dreadful Scripture for this,
In <hi>Jer. 17. 13. All you that forſake the Lord, ſhall come to
be aſhamed, and they that depart from him, ſhall be written
in the earth.</hi> All that depart from God ſhall be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the earth. If thou haſt been forward heretofore,
and now thou comeſt to be more ancient, thou art
dead, and dull, and careleſs, here is a Text for thee, go
home and tremble leſt thou be a man, whoſe name is
written in the earth.</p>
               <p>11. Doth not God for the preſent Curſe thy portion?
thou findeſt the more thou haſt, the worſe thou gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt;
As if a man ſhould eat meat at ones table, and
aſſoon as he hath eaten it, begin to ſwell, he will
conclude certainly the meat was poyſoned: So when
thy eſtate riſes, thy heart riſeth with pride, ſurely it
was poyſoned with the curſe of God that was in it.</p>
               <p>12. Examin thy heart by this, whether hath God
convinced thee, of that which ſtops the great Current
of His mercy, I ſpake of even now; that ſoul that
hath its portion in this world, looks no further but to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:29998:130"/>
Gods general bounty, and looks not to what ſtops the
great Current of Gods grace, he is not brought to be
ſenſible of his need of Chriſt, and of his ſatisfaction
unto Divine Juſtice; but now the heart of God intends
Eternal good too, ſuch a heart the Lord cauſes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that there is ſuch an infinite breach between
God and it, as cannot be made up, but only by the
Meditation of the Son of God; and therefore Lord,
it is not in any righteouſneſs of mine, nor in any
thing of any creature in Heaven and Earth can do it,
that I expect to have my portion from, but in the
Mediation of the Son of God; that I look after, and
my heart cloſes with that Mediation, and I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that as the ſpring of all my worth; He is a man
indeed that is not like to have his portion in this
world, and I'le only name that one more, What ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou to this?</p>
               <p>13. That man that ſpends his daies without having
ſome fear, leſt God ſhould put him off with the things
of this world; there may be ſome danger of that:
<hi>Jude,</hi> 12. it is ſaid of ſome, <hi>That they did feed themſelves
without fear.</hi> You can go now to a merry meeting,
and can go and feed upon the cheer, and you eat
without fear, you'l never have ſuch a thought in your
heart, What if God ſhould put me off with theſe
things? I hear indeed there are ſome men are put off
ſo, what if it ſhould prove to be my portion? what a
miſerable creature were I? I fear there are ſome men
never had ſuch a thought in their lives; What if it
ſhould prove ſo, what a miſerable creature were I?
The wicked are deſcribed to be men that eat without
fear; and thus we have done the Fifth Thing: There
is only the Sixth, and that is,</p>
               <p>Sixthly. <hi>Exhortation to you all,</hi> and then I have done all:
And this Exhortation it muſt be divided.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:29998:130"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you that have ſome Evidences that God hath
given you a better Portion, that God hath not put you off
with the Portion of this world.</p>
               <p>1. Oh bleſs the Lord for His goodneſs to you; the
Lord He hath ſhewed you better things than theſe are,
your line is fallen into a good ground, you have a goodly
inheritance. When <hi>David</hi> looked at the proſperity of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, his concluſion is, in <hi>Pſal. 73. 13. I have clenſed my
heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency;</hi> but guide me
with Thy Counſel, and afterward bring me to Thy
glory.</p>
               <p>2. Be content with thy portion here, do not murmur
and repine, for though thou haſt not ſo much as others
have, yet thou haſt that that will make thee happy for ever;
I remember that <hi>Hierom</hi> in one of his Epiſtles, tells of one
<hi>Dydimus,</hi> that was a learned godly Preacher, but blind;
<hi>Alexander</hi> comes to him, meeting of him, and asks him,
What, are you not troubled for want of ſight? And he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
confeſſed, it was a very ſore affliction to him; then
<hi>Alexander</hi> begins and chides him, What hath God given
you that that is the excellency of an Apoſtle, of a Miniſter
of Chriſt, and are you troubled for want of your ſight,
that a piſmire may have, that a brute beaſt, yea the very
Piſmires; the want of thy ſight, of that that Mice and Rats
may have? are you troubled at that, and rather not taught
for to bleſs God that hath given you ſo great a mercy, as
to make you ſuch an inſtrument in his ſervice? So may I
ſay to you that are godly, Hath God given you Jeſus Chriſt?
hath God given you His Son? hath He given you His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
hath He given you Himſelf to be your portion? And
are you troubled that you have no more of that that beaſts
may have as well as your ſelves? Oh be aſhamed of any
mournful diſcontentments for want of the comforts of this
world. And then;</p>
               <p>3. Do not envy at any wicked men for their portion.
I remember a ſtory that I have heard of a poor Souldier,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:29998:131"/>
that was condemned to die, meerly for taking a bunch of
Grapes from a Vine; for there was a ſtrict Law, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhould take anything from that place they went
thorough, ſhould die for it; and he had taken a bunch of
Grapes, and he was condemned to die, and as he went to
Execution, he went eating of the bunch of Grapes, and
ſome came to him, and ſaid, Thou ſhould 'ſt think of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
elſe: he anſwered, I beſeech you Sirs, do not envie
me my Grapes, they will coſt me dear. So may I ſay of all
the men of the world, we have no need to envie them for
any thing they have, it will coſt them very dear. And
laſtly.</p>
               <p>4. Do you live like ſuch as God hath not put off with
the Portion of this world? Manifeſt it in your converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that you look for higher and better things, than the
things of this world, ſhew they are but ſlight in your eyes:
<hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Naphtali</hi> did jeobard their lives, they did
look upon their lives as little worth for that cauſe: So
look upon your eſtates as diſpicable, be willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them all for the publick good, in a publick cauſe,
yea, to jeobard not Eſtates only, but your Names, your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and your Lives; and thoſe that ſhall do ſo, thoſe
whom God hath given hearts to do ſo amongſt you, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſome of you may look upon them, as men in a ſad
condition, Oh ſuch a man in ſuch a place, is look'd upon,
and he is like to be undone, if not his life in danger; but
ſuch a one that ſhall out of a good principle be willing to
venture his life and eſtate, and appear in a good Cauſe,
that man ſhall be moſt honored, and look'd upon as the
moſt happy man of all; and indeed herein he ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be a man that looks for an higher portion than theſe
things here: as thoſe in <hi>Heb. 11. 14. By that they ſaid and did,
they ſhewed plainly, they looked for another Country.</hi> So, ſee you
men that might live as comfortably for outward things as
you, and (did their conſciences give way) they could be as
quiet as you, but conſcience puts them upon it, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God cals them to a publick place, they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:29998:131"/>
to put all at Gods feet; now though you may think
it hard, and they are in moſt danger, they ſhew plainly
they are men of another country, and ſhould be moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored;
and take but this principle with you, The more
any one gives up his eſtate, the more comfort he hath in
his eſtate, whether in the enjoyment of it, or in the loſs
of it: I expreſs it thus, When one reſigns up all he hath,
his Eſtate, Liberty, Name, Life to God, the oftner it comes
into Gods hands, the better it comes when God gives him
them again; A carnal heart when once he hath theſe
things, he will not truſt God with them, but he will have
them at his own keeping: but now a gracious heart,
though he hath all theſe from God, yet every day he is
willing to give up all to God, and to truſt God with them
again; though he be a rich man, he is willing every day
to come and beg his bread at his fathers gate, and give
up all; now he gives up all in the truth of his heart to
God, and God gives him it all again; ſo long as in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
way he enjoyes it, he hath it afreſh from God; now
this I ſay, The oftner any thing comes out of Gods hand,
the ſweeter and better it is! wicked mens eſtates come but
once out of Gods hands, and therefore there is not ſo
much comfort in them; but a godly mans eſtate comes an
hundred and an hundred times from God, for every reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
gives it to God, and God gives it him again; and
therein is comfort: and Oh! bleſſed are they that live ſo,
as that they declare they look for another Country, and
that their Portion is not here; let the men of the world
think them fooliſh; that they will venture themſelves ſo;
God and His Saints, have declared that their Portion is not
here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, To you all; the word of Exhortation from
God is:</hi> That every one in this place would put on to
make more ſure of another Portion, beſides the Portion here
in this world.</p>
               <p>Put on: Why?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:29998:132"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> You are all made capable of higher and better
things than the things of the world are; never a one here,
but hath an immortal ſoul, and therefore is capable of
communion with Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, and that
is another manner of buſineſs, than to eat and drink, and
have pleaſure with the fleſh here a while; Hath God made
your Natures capable of ſuch glory? Do not debaſe your
ſelves, and that Humanity God hath put into you, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your ſelves with husks, when there is meat enough in
your fathers houſe; and He may be your father for ought
I know: and therefore, put on. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let the pooreſt ſort put on, to have but a little
portion here, yet there is as fair a way for you to have the
God of Heaven and Earth to be your Portion, to have
whatſoever Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed by His blood to be
your Portion, to have Heaven, and Eternity, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity
to be your Portion; (I ſay) there is as fair a way
for it, as for the greateſeſt Prince in the Earth; you may come
to have a Portion: Here indeed many a poor Apprentiſe
may ſay, My Father is dead, and hath left me no Portion.
I but you that are poor Apprentiſes and others, and the
poor Hoſpital Boys, that live upon Charity, It's poſſible
ſome poor wretches there may have their portion in God,
and Chriſt, and Immortallity, aſwel as the greateſt and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt
of all; therefore raiſe up your hearts here, you that
are the pooreſt and meaneſt; and know, you are born for
high things: If I ſhould come and tell one that is a poor
Boy in a blew Coat; Whatſoever you are now, there is
ſuch a rich man will adopt you to be his Child, and make
you his Heir; that would raiſe up his heart: Well, how
meanly ſoever you live now, you may be a glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hereafter; if ſo be you have an heart to put upon it,
and to ſeek after it for your portion: Then you'l ſay, Lord,
what ſhould we do, that our portion ſhould be an higher
portion than in this world? The Firſt thing I would put
you upon, is this:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Let the whole Courſe of your life be ſteered (as it were)
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29998:132"/>
with the fear of God, leſt that this ſhould be all that you have;</hi>
as it was a ſign before, ſo now I may make uſe of it as a
means; (I ſay) let your courſe of life be ſteer'd (as it were)
with the fear of God, leſt that God with this ſhould put
you off: hold forth this in every action, that any one
may ſee by your Converſation, ſurely this man, this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hath ſome fears, leſt God ſhould put them off with a
portion in this world: And eſpecially you that have
great portions in this life, and you know you have done
God little ſervice; you know there are many poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that live upon Alms have done God more ſervice than
you; you have moſt cauſe to fear; They that are Rulers,
and Governours have moſt cauſe to fear, unleſs they
have mighty good evidence in their hearts: <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the 13. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe that are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours;
<hi>I wonder that any Governour ſhould be ſaved:</hi> he
hath ſuch a ſpeech there; we will not ſay ſo, but he ſaith
ſo, there is a great deal of hazard: Chriſt tels us too, that a
man that hath a great portion in this world, though it's
poſſible he may have more hereafter, yet it is doubtful. It
is the Counſel of one, to a King of <hi>Portingal,</hi> (ſaith he) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to grant me this favor, that every day you would
but think of this Text, <hi>What profits it a man. If he ſhould
gain the whol world, and loſe his own ſoul.</hi> Spend ſome little
time every day, to think of this Text, and pray to God
that he would give you, the true underſtanding and ſenſe
of this Text, and let it be the concluſion of al your prayers,
that God would ſhew you what there is in this Text, what
ſhall it profit a man, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and
loſe his own ſoul; The ſame counſel I give to you, Daily
pray to God, to make you underſtand what there is in this
Text, that there are men that have their portion in this
world.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Labor to take off your hearts from all theſe outward comforts
that are here;</hi> take off your ſpirits: <hi>He that will be rich ſhall
fall into many temptations:</hi> Know it is not neceſſary (ſo you
ſhould conclude every one in your own hearts, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary)
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:29998:133"/>
I ſhould have eſtate in this world, but it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
I ſhould make my peace up with God: it is neceſſary I
ſhould provide for my ſoul, but how things are with me
here there is no great neceſſity. And then;</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Set you the glory of Heaven and Eternity daily before your
eyes, and be trading for higher things than theſe are:</hi> you that
are great Merchants, you are trading for thouſands; when
as many poor people now that go up and down in the
ſtreets, and cry ſome mean thing, they think well if they
can get eighteen pence in a whole day, carrying things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their heads, and crying in the ſtreets: but a rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
can go out in the morning, and make a bargain,
and perhaps get five hundred pound in an hour: he is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for ſomewhat like. So the men of this world are
like the poor women that go with things, about upon their
heads, and get eighteen pence in a day; but a godly man
hath communion with God, and in a quarter of an hour
gets that he would not loſe for hundreds, nor for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.
It was a ſpeech of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to <hi>Anthony;</hi> Why <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
thou art not to fiſh for <hi>Gudgeons,</hi> and <hi>Trouts,</hi> but thou
art to angle for <hi>Caſtles,</hi> and <hi>Towers,</hi> and <hi>Forts,</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi>
thou art to fiſh for them; ſo may I ſay, If thou haſt an
immortal ſoul within thee, thou art not ſo much to angle
for to make proviſion for the fleſh, for <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi>
and <hi>cloathes, &amp;c.</hi> but for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Immortality,</hi> ſet
that continually before thine eyes. And the next thing is
this.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Honor God with thy ſubſtance here;</hi> lay out thy portion
here for God: and Oh that I could but convince you of
one Principle of Divinity more, and that is this, That
there is more excellency and good in one vertuous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than there is in all the creatures in Heaven and Earth,
(beſides the works of Angels and others of the Saints,
excepting them:) Take all Creatures, Sun, Moon, Stars,
Seas, Earth, all the riches in the world, Pearls, put all
together, this is the true Divinity, (I ſay) that there is
more excellencie in one vertuous Action, than there is
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:29998:133"/>
if thou hadſt all theſe things to be thy poſſeſſion; If men
were convinced of this, they would be abundant in good
works then: Thou thinkeſt it a brave thing, thou haſt ſo
much coming in by the yeer; do but one good action for
God out of an upright principle, and there is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in that one action, than there is in thy eſtate, if thou
hadſt ten thouſand times more added to it: Certainly, this
will make them that are rich, to be rich in good works;
ſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world,
that they be rich in good works:</hi> There is a richneſs in good
works, as well as in an eſtate; Oh! improve, lay out thy
eſtate for God: <hi>Ambroſe</hi> I remember upon that place, his
Sermons upon the rich man, ſaith he, <hi>Is it not more honor
that ſo many children ſhall ask of you as their father, than that ſo
many pieces of gold ſhall call you their lord?</hi> Theſe pieces of
gold they do (as it were) call you lord, and there are two
or three children ſhall call you father; Is there not more
excellency to have a couple of poor Orphants while you
are alive in this world, to call you father, than to have
ſo many bags of gold cal you maſter? Oh therfore lay out
your Portion, <hi>Give a portion to ſix and to ſeven.</hi> In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8.
there the Apoſtle tels the <hi>Corinthians, that God ſhould make
them abundant in all Grace; fill you with Grace that you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in all ſufficiency:</hi> But what for? In the 11. verſ. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enriched in every thing in all bountifulneſs;</hi> and then verſe
12. <hi>for the adminiſtration of this ſervice; that you may be enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in all bountifulneſs;</hi> Wherefore? for the adminiſtration
of this ſervice: Now the words in the Greek are, <hi>for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this Leturgie:</hi> ſo the words are in the Greek,
that you may abound, and have all grace to abound in
the adminiſtration of this Leturgie. My brethren, Oh
how happy were it if ſo be that men were plentiful in this
Divine Service, that I am ſpeaking of, and well verc'd in
this <hi>Leturgie:</hi> the Apoſtle cals bounty, a leturgie, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, that is Divine Service indeed, that is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Leturgie to be well verc'd in, and to be abundantly
verc'd in this kind of Leturgie; for ſo the words are in the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:29998:134"/>
Greek; and then again, If you would not be put off with
this portion in the world;</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Be ſure that all the ſervices you perform to God be choice ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;</hi>
If you expect choice mercies, let you ſervices be
choice ſervices; be ſure your works be ſupernatural works;
You'l ſay, How ſhall I know that? If I had time I could
make it out cleer to you, but only thus, A ſupernatural
work is that which hath a ſupernatural Principle, aims at
a ſupernatural End, and done in a ſupernatural manner;
A ſupernatural Principle, that is grace that makes it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to my heart, and not only that I do it out of convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of conſcience; and a ſupernatural End, that I aim at
God, and not at myſelf; but the ſupernatural manner,
what is that? I remember <hi>Seneca</hi> in giving of his rule, how
to know the affections, when they are Natural, and when
not, (ſaith he) you ſhall know a natural affection by this,
<hi>If it be kept within bounds, it is natural; if it be out of bounds,
it is not natural:</hi> I'le make uſe of it in another way, When
you come to the ſervice of God, if you think to limit God
in His ſervice, this is but a natural ſervice, you will go ſo
far, and there ſtop; but if it be ſupernatural ſervice, you
will let out your hearts (if it were poſſible) infinitely to
God; you cannot be infinite, that's true; but you will
propound no bounds, no limits to your ſervice; and this
is indeed the truth of Grace, when it hath the impreſſion
of Gods infinitneſs upon it; Gods infinitneſs is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
He is without all limits; So where God ſets no limits,
there the ſoul is without all limits, and bounds in the
way of Grace; that is, deſires to anſwer God (if it were
poſſible) by an infinite way; theſe are ſupernatural works:
And then, Would you not have your Portion in this
world?</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Be willing to caſt away whatever of your portion you have
got ſinfully:</hi> I in the Name of God charge this as a ſpecial
thing to take home with you; whatſoever man or woman
in this place, would not have his portion in this world,
but would have his portion in the world to come, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:29998:134"/>
of his portion he hath got in a ſinful way, caſt it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
preſently, never ſleep with it, lie not down one night
with it: That's an old rule, but a true one, All the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
you have in the world, and all your ſorrowing
for your ſin, will never obtain pardon without reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if you be able; Unleſs you do what you are able to
reſtore, you can never have comfort, or the pardon of
that ſin; If you have goe it when you were young, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,
firſt ſet up, away with it, elſe it will ſpoil all,
you will never have any other portion from God; Theſe
hands of mine had once that given to them, to be a means
to convey, to reſtore that which was got wrongfully,
fifty yeers before, the wrong was done fifty yeers ago,
and after fifty yeers, the Conſcience of the man troubles
him, and he comes to bring, to reſtore that wrong,
and deſires it may be conveyed to ſuch a place, where
he had done wrong; know therefore, that all the ſweet
morſels that any time you have ſo delightfully got down,
they muſt up again, and therefore willingly let them go
up; reſolve before you go out of this place, whatſoever
thou haſt gotten wrongfully, never keep it againſt thy
will, but do it willingly, elſe thou canſt not have any
comfort in the portion thou haſt, nor have any portion
in the world to come; if there be any true Divinity in
the world, this is true Divinity: and yet it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
any Covetous men, that have got much this way;
and if there be any wrong, thoſe that have done wrong in
things be truſted to them, as thoſe that are Maſters of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals,
be ſure you keep not that, for certainly you'l curſe
the time you ever took it; and therefore let the charge of
God be ſtrong upon you this day, to caſt out whatſoever
you have got falſly. I read in a ſtory of one that upon a
time, hearing that place of Scripture, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 8. read, <hi>Wo
to them that joyn houſe to houſe:</hi> he burſts out into a loud cry,
If wo be to them that joyn houſe to houſe, <hi>Then wo to me,
and to my children.</hi> So upon this that you hear this day,
There are a company ſhal have their portion in this world,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:29998:135"/>
and eſpecially thoſe that will keep any thing they have
wrongfully got, many may have cauſe to ſay, Wo to us
then, and unto our children.</p>
               <p>7. Be willing to joyn with thoſe that have ſuffered for
God; If you would have your portion in another life,
be willing to joyn with the ſufferers for Chriſt; So <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
did, though he were in the way to preferment, yet he
did chuſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of
God than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; joyn
rather with them, than with jolly blades of the world; It
is ſafer to joyn with the ſufferers, than to joyn with thoſe
that are the jolly and brave ſpirits. And ſo I have done,
only deſiring that the Lord would ſettle all home upon
your ſpirits; If ſo be, becauſe ſomething may not be ſo
pleaſing to the pallat of every one, as ſome other, but
if for that you ſhould reject what hath been ſaid, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and ſlight this Word of God, know that this Text
one day, may prove to be as ſcalding lead in your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
and that that is ſaid concerning <hi>Doeg,</hi> in <hi>Pſalm, 57.
2.</hi> may prove to be your portion; it is ſpoken of <hi>Doeg;
This is the man</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that did not make God his
truſt, but truſted in his great riches;</hi> this is the man; So you
may be pointed out one day, This is the man: <hi>Doeg</hi> was
a great Courtier, and becauſe he was an Officer of King
<hi>Sauls,</hi> and becauſe he had his favour, he truſted in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the King, and in his riches, and what did he care
for <hi>David?</hi> Yea, by the Text it appears he was one that
made ſome ſhew of Religion too, in the 1 of <hi>Sam. 21. 7. He
was detained before the Lord: Tremelius</hi> thinks, either out of
ſome Religious vow, or to keep the Sabbath, or ſomewhat
concerning the Law, he was detained before the Lord, and
yet he was a vile Malignant againſt <hi>David,</hi> and all becauſe
he truſted in the great countenance he had at Court: Now
this is the man that made not God his truſt, but that
truſted in his great riches: the Lord forbid this Scripture
ſhould be made true of any of you; I leave this Text with
you that are rich men, take heed you truſt not in your
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:29998:135"/>
great riches, I leave this Text with you, that are in places
of dignity and honor; take heed you have not your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this world. I leave this Text to Voluptuous men,
given up to pleaſures; take heed you hear not one day,
this, <hi>Son, remember, in thy life-time thou hadſt thy pleaſure.</hi> I
leave this with thoſe that dare not truſt God for a portion
to come. And above all, I leave this with all Hypocrites,
let them take heed it be not ſaid to them, <hi>Here is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
Conſider what hath been ſaid, and the Lord give
you underſtanding in all things.</p>
