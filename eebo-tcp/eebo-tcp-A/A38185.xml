         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onverſion is an hard work, but
it is glorious; it relates to the
two great Faculties of our mind,
the Underſtanding and the Will.
Our Underſtanding, that our Faith be found;
Our Will, that our Morals be good. I will
begin with our Morals, becauſe it is no
matter what our Judgment is when our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are bad; Lewd men credit no Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but diſgrace the cauſe they own. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
conſiſts of a redemption, and that
redemption from the iniquity of our ways;
that is to ſay, a Turning from Sin to Vertue,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58340:3"/>
from Satan unto God. A Turning from a
bad life is nothing elſe but a Separation of a
mans ſelf from profane uſes unto Holineſs;
As when a Child and Heir of Hell becomes
one of the Sons of God, in Scripture Phraſe
this work of Converſion is called a Ceaſing
from evil, and a learning to do well; A put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off of the old man, and a putting on of
the New; and it is called a new Creature, a
Conformity to Chriſt in his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;
or according to the ſame Apoſtle
elſewhere, <hi>Be not conformed to this World, but
rather transformed by the renewing of your minds.</hi>
Or laſtly, in our Saviours Language, A ſeeking
the Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs
thereof, and being holy as he is holy in all
manner of Converſation. Therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
as you deſire to have Peace with God
and your own minds, live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and godly in this World. Labour to
prove the truth of your Profeſſion by your
pious practices. Endeavour to become living
Images of God, Veſſels of honour, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Holy Ghoſt. I might argue againſt
Sin from the common miſchiefs of it, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58340:3"/>
remind Sinners of the Labyrinths into which
it leads them, and aſſure you that Gods Service
is perfect freedom. For if all the happineſs
which Chriſtian Religion propounds to us
were only confined to ſuch Promiſes as have
a relation to eternal Bliſs, it might be thought
that the Lord Jeſus was only careful to make
the end of a Chriſtian Race glorious, yet had
neglected to make the way pleaſant which
leadeth thither. But if it be truly conſidered
on the other hand, that thoſe very Precepts
which are enjoyned as the Rules of our duty
are in themſelves infinitely conducing to our
own preſent ſatisfaction, then we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that none can be miſerable in the next
World but only ſuch Sots as will not give God
leave to make them happy in this.</p>
            <p>For the Laws of the holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> are ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our Natures, that the Execution of
them are as great expedients of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
happineſs as Teſtifications of our duty, ſo
that our duty and our priviledges run parallel
in one Line. In the next place, as Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
relates to our Wills, ſo alſo to our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
that we may have ſuch Notions
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58340:4"/>
of God and his Worſhip as becomes the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of that duty we owe to our God.
And what dangerous Errors, Education, and
Prejudice may breed is very obvious to all
that have made remarks in the World. For
we know that a dangerous Principle hath
hurried many into deſperate Practices; Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Zeal for the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law made him
ſpurn againſt Chriſt himſelf. So that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities
and debaucheries of ſome men are
leſs dangerous than their Tenents. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that any thing that I ſay ſhould give the
leaſt countenance unto Vice, but to ſhew that
we may fly from one extreme to another.</p>
            <p>I may compare the enormities of Vice to a
Sore that is Ulcerated, Nauſeous, and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to all mens view: Errors in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(or a falſe worſhip of God) is like to
a Sore skinned over, though not ſo offenſive
to our Senſes, yet more dangerous to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
Our Saviour told the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
that Harlots and Publicans entered into
the Kingdom of God before them; not that
we are to think that the Kingdom of God is a
place for either Harlots or Publicans, as ſuch:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58340:4"/>
but that the recovery of the one is more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than the recovery of the other. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
perſon is ſick, but then he and all men
know it: The Heretick is ſick, but he thinks
himſelf well, and ſo neglects all means for a
remedy, and the cure of ſuch a one becomes a
wonder.</p>
            <p>The Subject I have choſe this day is copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and from it I might preſent you with
many particulars, but I muſt forbear and
come to the Application, which I muſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in my ſelf:
<q>When thou art converted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I hope this Scripture is fulfilled this day on
my ſelf, being a Monument of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties
mercy in bringing me from the
groſs Superſtitions of Popery to the glorious
light of the Goſpel; and ſeeing the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of my Text is the ſtrengthening of my
Brethren. I ſhall now give you ſome few of
the principal motives which drew me from
my former perſwaſions.</p>
            <p>You muſt know I was bred and Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in all the abſurd Doctrines and Practices
of the Romiſh Church, and no little Zealot
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58340:5"/>
in that way; I was ordained Deacon and
Prieſt, and made Confeſſor General through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> was a Frier of
the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and afterwards Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
of a Convent, and Chaplain to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
eminent perſons of qualety in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Upon a certain time I accidentally
came to a publick houſe to refreſh my ſelf, I
found that a lewd Prieſt had pawned the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
Hoſt to the woman of the houſe for
five and thirty Shillings: which I redeemed:
And with this remarke that Chriſt was made
by him, not an Offering for Sin, but a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for his Luſt. I need not tell you how
great the Scandal was to my ſelf, but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by conſidering that the Perſon was a
Superiour of an Order, and in great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among his People. There are many ſad
circumſtances in the ſtory, but I will forbear
at preſent to mention them.</p>
            <p>Upon this great diſguſt I began to diſpute
the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and all
the ridiculous conſequences of it became
evident to my underſtanding; for ſuppoſe a
Turk ſhould tell me that I make my God, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58340:5"/>
then eat him; and ſhould he challenge me to
produce ſo nonſenſical a Tenent in the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
I muſt either change my opinion of
Tranſubſtantiation, or quit my Chriſtianity.
Is it not ſtrange that Chriſt ſhould eat himſelf,
and that all the Diſciples ſhould eat him alive
before the Jews had Crucified him? I know
he calls the Bread his Body, but then he calls
the Cup his Bloud, and ſhall one be allowed
to be a figure, and not the other? But that
which expounds the whole Inſtitution are
theſe words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi>
that is to ſay, This Ordinance is a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative
Sacrifice of my ſelf; if Chriſt be
corporeally preſent, how comes there to be
any exerciſe of our memories? But others
have ſaid ſo much of this Subject that I need
ſay no more.</p>
            <p>Another great motive of my Converſion
was their Adoration of Images, ſo flatly
contrary to the Second Commandment. God
told his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old that they ſaw no
ſimilitude, for the prevention of all manner of
Worſhip by Images. They ſay, by <hi>Graven
Image</hi> is meant only an Idol, but then theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58340:6"/>
words following, <hi>Nor the likeneſs of any thing
before me,</hi> ſpoyls that interpretation. For if
by graven Images be meant only Idolls,
then the Commandment is altogether ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
for Idolls were forbidden in the firſt
Commandment by having no other Gods;
and if they ſay, they worſhip not the Image,
but the perſon repreſented by it: I anſwer,
this juſtifies all the Heathens in their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
for they ſaid they worſhipped nothing
made with hands, neither did they believe
them to be their Gods, but that their Gods
were preſent in them in an Extraordinary
manner.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I will ſpeak of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Purgatory, which upon ſerious exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
became ſtrange to me. Indeed I
read of a narrow way that leads to bliſs, and
a broad way that is the high road to miſery,
for that <hi>Via media,</hi> that leads to Purgatory, I
find it not in my Bible; yet I hold Purgatory,
but it is in my Saviours bloud: and it is that
Purgatory which only muſt purge my ſoul
from ſin; and if that Purgatory will do a
ſinners work, I will look for no other. Yet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58340:6"/>
for all this, Purgatory in the Popiſh Notions
of it is a gainful Doctrine; it is that fire which
makes the Popes Pot boyl; and therefore no
wonder if they be ſo loth to have it extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
            <p>Another motive that I had to abandon all
Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was
that intolerable practice of having the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in a Tongue unknown to the people:
and Chap 14 of the former Epiſtle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
ſeems to be wholly writ againſt that
Cuſtom. It is ſaid <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 26, 27. <hi>And it ſhall
come to paſs, when your Children ſhall ſay unto you,
What mean you by this Service? that you ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
and ſay, it is the Sacrifice of the Lords
Paſſeover,</hi> &amp;c. When I read this Scripture it
reminds me that Gods Service is a reaſonable
Service, and that we ought to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and meaning of that Service we perform
to God. Edification and Devotion are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
from the true Worſhip of God.
Now ſhould I in the language of this
Scripture come to the Common People at
the celebration of the Maſs, and ſay, What
mean you by this Service? What ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58340:7"/>
anſwer can be expected? Some of
late (I muſt confeſs) have tranſlated the
Popiſh Prayers into the Vulgar Language,
but the Pope has forbidden the uſe of them.
So that who ſhall ſo uſe them are not right
Catholicks.</p>
            <p>But above all the Tenents of <hi>Rome</hi> none
ſeemed more ridiculous to me than that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Infallibility, for if that be proved,
I ſhall ſubmit to any thing that ſhe ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon me.</p>
            <p>For had St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf been appointed
the infallible Judge of Controverſies, what
needed the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 15. It
would have been a much ſhorter cut to have
had St. <hi>Peters</hi> determination in the Caſe,
without giving the Apoſtles any further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in it. The Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> pretends
that he is St. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, and we have
more reaſon to believe him ſo then the Pope;
for Antiquity is clear that he was Biſhop of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> and the Scriptures are expreſs that
there he exerciſed his Function, and that there
it was that the Diſciples were firſt called
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58340:7"/>
Chriſtians. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaitb, that to him was
committed the care of all the Churches. St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
might have ſaid thoſe words with as much
innocency as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but it was Gods mercy
that he did not, for then the Pope would have
pretended a good Text for his Univerſal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorſhip.
But that which makes the Doctrine
of infallibility more vain are thoſe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
eſtabliſhments which are in that
Church; had I time I might give in endleſs
inſtances. But that which is the moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
to them is their non-agreement
among themſelves where this infallibility is
ſeated, which makes nothing more fallible
than the very Doctrine of Infallibility. And
I muſt tell you, that among the many other
Errors and ill Practices which <hi>I</hi> diſcovered in
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> their Cruelties were no ſmall
diſguſt to me, as if Chriſtianity had taught
them to forget Humanity; <hi>I</hi> cannot but with
horror think of thoſe barbarous Maſſacres
which were committed in my own Country,
as if Papiſts had guts, but no bowels; ſo that
it is not only their Prayers, but Faith that they
have written in bloudy Characters: You will
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58340:8"/>
hear them boaſt of Loyalty: Look into the
<hi>Iriſh Hiſtories,</hi> and then judge of thoſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
If by accident ſome have ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo in <hi>England,</hi> yet the conſtitution of
their Church looks with another aſpect, for
<hi>I</hi> am ſure <hi>I</hi> ever thought it a meritorious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to murther either Prince, or any Proteſtant
Subject, provided <hi>I</hi> was commiſſionated ſo to
do by the Pope, but how to ſerve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<hi>I</hi> underſtand not, the Pope and the
King; <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, that <hi>I</hi> my ſelf am an
inſtance of their intended cruelty, for after
my converſion from their fooleries, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by the good providence of God been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
in bringing ſeven Friats and Prieſts
from their Communion, and ſeveral of their
Laity, their malice was ſuch, that Preaching
upon a Sunday in a Proteſtant Church a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
was levelled at me as <hi>I</hi> ſtood in the Pulpit,
but through Gods mercy the Bullet went only
through my hair without doing me any other
miſchief; but when <hi>I</hi> ſaw my life was aimed
at, <hi>I</hi> was forced to quit both my new Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and my Country. But are theſe things
according to the Goſpel of Peace? They that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58340:8"/>
Preach Religion with fire and faggot ſurely
know not what manner of ſpirits they are of,
if our Saviour's Kingdom were of this world
his Servants would fight; and indeed we read
St. <hi>Peter</hi> uſed his Sword once in his Maſters
quarrel, but he got ſo ſharp a rebuke for it,
that <hi>I</hi> do not read that he ever ſo much as
wore one after. Muſt the Pope cut off Heads
becauſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> cut off an Ear? This is
ſtrange. The old <hi>Romans</hi> thought to propagate
the Faith by dying for it: Our new <hi>Romans</hi>
think to eſtabliſh theirs, but by a quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
method; Reaſon is the Crown of a man,
Religion is the Crown of Reaſon, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
is the Crown of Religion, Charity is the
Crown of Chriſtianity, and Charity we know
ſuffereth long, and is kind, and ſeeks its own
eſtabliſhment by means and methods the moſt
like to it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> muſt alſo tell you, that the Prayers to
Saints and Angels became very offenſive to
me, having in all the Scriptures not one Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
nor one Example to give countenance to
any ſuch cuſtom. <hi>I</hi> am ſure our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
weary and heavy laden ſinners to come
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58340:9"/>
to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. And when <hi>I</hi> can come
and have an acceſs to the Throne of his Grace
with boldneſs, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not think my ſelf to
ſtand in need of any other Spokesman; if <hi>I</hi>
can be free with my Prince, why ſhould <hi>I</hi>
trouble any Courtiers to preſent my Addreſſes.
Beſides, we have great reaſon to believe there
is an incommunicable gulf between the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Saints and us, for the Scripture tells us,
That <hi>Abraham knows us not, and Iſrael is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> could alſo give large Narratives of their
pious frauds, as they call them, by which they
delude the people to fix them in their groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Superſtitions. When <hi>I</hi> was made a
Frier, a great number of people were preſent
at the Solemnity; <hi>I</hi> appeared in a ſpruce
Garb, had there my Horſe, my Sword and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols,
and appeared with much Gayety and
Splendour. The head of the Convent adviſed
the People to take notice of my Pompous
condition, and that <hi>I</hi> was willing to lay aſide
all thoſe outward glories for St. <hi>Francis</hi> his
ſake, and accordingly <hi>I</hi> diſrobed my ſelf,
and put on the mean Garments which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58340:9"/>
to the Order, and then made three
Vows, of Obedience, Poverty, and Chaſtity:
After that took one and twenty Oaths; now
in the Oaths <hi>I</hi> ſwore never to come on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
never to wear Shoes, to obey my Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
in what ever he commanded me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
examining the lawfulneſs of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
not to be aſhamed to beg, never to be
out of my Friers habit. But that which was a
cauſe of a diſguſt at that time unto me was
this: The Superiour tells me, that I muſt take
my former Garments, that is, return in the ſame
Poſture I came, and go ſee my friends; and
though all theſe things were againſt my Oaths,
yet he would abſolve me from them. I muſt
confeſs this ſeemed to me a ſtrange cheat to the
People, that he ſhould tell them what ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<hi>I</hi> was guilty of in taking thoſe Oaths, and
yet he preſently abſolves me from them; and
this is the ſtate of all the Iriſh Friars. And I
may tell you what offence I took at thoſe vain
ſtories which they have of Miracles, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when I diſcovered their grand impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
therein: For about ſeven years ago a
Prieſt, near the City of <hi>Limbrick,</hi> by name <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58340:10"/>
Sarchwell,</hi> had for fifty ſhillings hired a
Woman to pretend her ſelf a Cripple from
her birth, and that ſhe had a Revelation
that if ſhe dipped her ſelf in ſuch a Well,
whilſt a Prieſt ſaid Maſs by the place, ſhe
ſhould be recovered of her infirmity; The
plot thus laid, and accordingly executed, ſhe
comes halting to the Well, returns out of it
perfectly cured, which became a Miracle to the
people; which did not only get the Contriver
of the Cheat a vaſt ſum of money, but alſo
confirmed the people in their Superſtition.
But after ſome time the Counterfeit had ſome
remorſe of conſcience, came to me to confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in order to abſolution, which I would
not grant till ſhe had declared the whole ſtory
to the Congregation, which ſhe did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
It is well known the poor miſerable
people are mightily deluded by theſe Cheats.
A Frier of great note and Zeal told me that he
was at a Franciſcan Convent beyond the Seas,
where was the Image of the bleſſed Virgin,
made with a Scrue in the head thereof, where
they put in ſome water, and having a ſtring
that came undiſcerned to a place where the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58340:10"/>
Friers ſtood (and when they thought the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had brought a good Offering) then by the
help of that ſtring they could unlooſe the
Scrue, by which the bleſſed Virgin ſeemed to
weep, and this was one of their Miracles.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Relator (though a Friar) ſaid
it was a great ſcandal to him, and accordingly
complained to the General of the Order, but
his anſwer was, ſhould he make a reformation
in that particular that Convent ſhould ſtarve.
It is ſaid, that the Monks of a certain Convent
had put the like fallacy upon St. <hi>Bernard</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who when he came into their Church had
prepared an inſtrument to carry a voice to the
Image of the bleſſed Virgin, who when he
came into the Church ſaluted him with a <hi>Salve
Bernarde;</hi> but he, apprehenſive of the cheat,
gave no other return to the complement than
this: It is a ſhame for a woman to ſpeak in
the Church. But of all their fine ſtories com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me to this new Miracle they talk of for
the confirmation of Tranſubſtantiation, the
Story is this: They ſay, that in a certain place
within the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Dominions, that as
the Sacrament of the Maſs was celebrated
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58340:11"/>
that all the perfect Effigies and proportion of
a man roſe out of the Hoſt, but when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came too near, that they might plainly ſee
the Miracle, he vaniſhed away, therefore for
ever hereafter it muſt be horrid Blaſphemy to
deny Tranſubſtantiation ſhall be hardly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſo much Vanity as to make any replicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſuch a ridiculous ſtory, only let it be no
offence to tell you what a remark a facetious
perſon made to the Rélator of it: <hi>You ſuppoſe,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>that it was Chriſt himſelf that appeared,
and it ſeems that upon the approach of the people
he vaniſhed a way, which is the only circumſtance to
make the ſtory credible, for he might ſuppoſe the
people were come to eat him, and ſo he vaniſhed.</hi>
Upon theſe conſiderations, and reaſons, and
others, more than <hi>I</hi> have now time to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>I</hi> renounce here in the preſence of God and
this great Aſſembly my former Popiſh ways,
and withal <hi>I</hi> declare my ſelf a Proteſtant;
and that you may believe me a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
<hi>I</hi> do further declare, that <hi>I</hi> am a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as
it is here by Law eſtabliſhed; And <hi>I</hi> muſt
further declare before the Searcher of all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58340:11"/>
hearts, that <hi>I</hi> ſpeak none of theſe things either
out of malice or prejudice, nor for any ſiniſter
end or corrupt deſign whatſoever, but that
Gods name may be glorified, his truth cleared,
and my Brethren edified, and that my own
Soul may be eternally ſaved. But will it not
be enquired by ſome, Whether <hi>I</hi> be not gone
from Popery to Popery, that is, unto the ſame
Church, though of another Denomination, it
being objected, that the Conſtitutions of this
Church are framed out of Popery, and the
Common Prayer Book compiled out of the
Maſs-Book? <hi>I</hi> anſwer, The Devil hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
devices to carry on his own intereſt, and
the Papiſts do contrive many Engines to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
Proteſtants; and <hi>I</hi> look upon this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to be hammered in their Forge to
make us worry one another, and to break our
Communion. But to give a full anſwer to the
objection, let me tell you, that <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Maſs-Book better than any here,
and can aſſure you the Argument is vain and
unworthy: My reaſon follows, firſt all is not
Popery that is in the Maſs-book, there are
ſeveral particulars of the Primitive Litturgy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58340:12"/>
that is not Popery: There are ſeveral places
taken out of the holy Bible, neither is that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
Secondly, there are ſeveral other good
things in the Maſs-book, and if it were not ſo
the Cheat would be evident to every Eye.
You know the Devil could tempt our Saviour
in Scripture language, ſhall we therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge
theſe Scriptures becauſe the Devil uſed
them? He transforms himſelf ſometimes
into an Angel of light, yet that makes him no
leſs a Devil, though harder to be diſcovered.
The reformation quarrels not with the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for any thing that is good,
but what is really bad; We differ not from
<hi>Rome</hi> in any thing but wherein ſhe hath dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
from her ſelf, ſo the Schiſm is in <hi>Rome,</hi>
not here: and from very good grounds I am
apt to believe that <hi>Rome</hi> hath altered almoſt as
much in her Religion as in her Language;
for you may as well ſay that the <hi>Italian</hi> is the
ancient Language of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the preſent
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is the ancient Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
The Church is compared to a Spouſe, the
Pope hath put her in a Fools coat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared
her face with filth and naſtineſs.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58340:12"/>
The Reformation waſheth her face, and takes
from her her ridiculous garments, but med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
not with her Eſſentials, nor any thing
elſe but what is an apparent ſcandal: But I
know not how to repreſent the condition of
our Church at the time of the Reformation
better than by comparing it to a houſe infected
with the Plague; The Charity and Wiſdom
of Authority orders this houſe to be cleanſed
by burning all the infected Rags, but the
Pewter, Braſs, or Iron, and other goods not
capable of any infection ſtill abide to the uſe
of the houſe. What remains of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
I leave to your own meditation to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
I have only this to ſay, That as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
have attempted my life, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that they will traduce my name, and
beſpatter my reputation, but I hope your
Charity will relieve me; and for my own
part, with the Almighties aſſiſtance, I will
be cautious that my life ſcandalize not my
Profeſſion, that from thence the Enemies
of the Lord may have no cauſe to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:58340:13"/>
I hope you will joyn with me in giving
to the God of my mercies all honour and
praiſe, the juſt Tribute of all created beings,
henceforth and for evermore.</p>

Chaplain to ſeveral perſons of quality of the

            <p>BY the Providence of God, I was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Proteſtant Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two years ſince, at which time
I obtained from the ſucceeding Guardian of
the Friery, whereof I was formerly Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

(a Guardian being uſed to be Elected e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
three years) a Teſtimonial of my good
behaviour before I declared my ſelf in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
to be Converted</p>
            <p>After my Converſion, I applied my ſelf to
the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Clonfeart,</hi> who gave me
a Curates place in <hi>Loughreah,</hi> with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preferment in the County of <hi>Galloway,</hi>
worth about 80<hi>l. per annum,</hi> where I, ſhortly
after, in uſing my Function in the Church, was
ſhot at by one <hi>Thomas Treſſey,</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
of that place, but not wounded,
for which he was afterward bound to his
good behaviour, by the ſaid Biſhop; after
which, the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> there, did ſeveral times
threaten me with death: whereupon, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of my Life, I was forced to retire
into <hi>Lymerick,</hi> whereby I loſt ſuch prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the ſaid Biſhop had beſtowed upon
me: But before I went from <hi>Loughreagh,</hi>
ſeveral of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Prieſts, and others, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thereabouts, which I am ready to name,
and do hereby Accuſe, did publiquely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that his Majeſty, his Royal Highneſs,

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58340:14"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> were privately of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which they uſed as an Argument to
make me fall back again to <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After my coming to <hi>Lymerick,</hi> I being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to <hi>Preach</hi> an Anniverſary Sermon in
Deteſtation of the late Rebellion there, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Popiſh Prieſts,</hi> and others, came to hear
me; and after Sermon ended, as I was going
from Supper, aſſaulted me in the Night-time,
and endeavoured to kill me, but by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, I defended my ſelf, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
unhurt.</p>
            <p>After that, I came to <hi>Youghall</hi> about
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, where one of the <hi>Papiſts</hi>

me, though he ſhould be hanged for it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
for which the ſaid <hi>Papiſt</hi> was by the

            <p>After which, to ſave my life, I was forced

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:58340:15"/>

wounded, and I hardly eſcaped their Fury;
whereupon my Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi>
