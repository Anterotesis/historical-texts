            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER, GENTLE or SIMPLE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>WE are fallen into a moſt ill-natur'd and cenſorious Age, apt to interpret every thing ſpoken or acted, deſign'd or written, in the worſt ſenſe; 'Tis rare to find a Man who will not take with the Left-hand, what is offer'd with the Right. Yet, being a Friend to Truth, (which was in danger to ſuffer by the Miſtakes and Errours of a late Book, Entituled,</hi> The Beſt Choice, <hi>&amp;c.) I have here ventur'd to make an Apology, (ſuch as it is) and to ſay all I honeſtly could, in the Vindication of the Saints therein mention'd; who out of an unuſual Modeſty, or for ſome other Reaſons, beſt known to themſelves, have for divers Months conceal'd their Talent; talk'd only of an Anſwer, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> Trial of Truth <hi>was calculated, and chiefly deſign'd for the Meridian of</hi> SCYDROMEDIA, <hi>but may indifferently ſerve any County or Corporation in</hi> England, <hi>as a fair Intimation to all Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Free-holders, to diſtinguiſh betwixt</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, Truth <hi>and</hi> Falſhood; <hi>and on that Side which is ſafeſt from Deceits, There to fix, there to vote in all Elections of Future Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments. If there ſhould be amongſt the</hi> Electors, <hi>Men diſturb'd in their Underſtandings by the Heat of Enthuſiaſm, or whoſe Wiſdom is altogether ſenſual and worldly; who preſumptuouſly make Heaven ſtoop to Earth, hiding their private and ſecular Deſigns under the Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49558:3"/>
               <hi>Name of</hi> Saints, <hi>or the</hi> Sober Party; <hi>I don't once concern my ſelf with them in this Endeavour to advance</hi> Truth: <hi>The former cannot, and the latter will not be convinc'd. There's no Ear ſo deaf, as that which Intereſt has ſtopp'd; and none ſo miſerably blind, as thoſe that reſolvedly ſhut their Eyes againſt the plaineſt Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Truth. The Words of an old Author are at this day verified of the</hi> Engliſh,

                  </gap>'d, whilſt 'tis in my power to make a tolerable Defence for 'em. And truly, Friends! I have a hard Task on't. The grievous Immoralities of Life, the Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes of Humane Nature, the many Deſigns of this wicked World, appear ſo plainly at the bottom of our Zeal, and Stifneſs for our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinions, that 'tis more ingenuous and adviſeable, to own ſome things to be ſordid and baſe in our Proceedings, than by an over ſtrict Juſtification of our Doings, we put the</hi> Church <hi>up on Enquiries, leſt after an impartial Search, we ſhould ſtand condemn'd by all Good Men. 'Tis but a folly to deny what we cannot hide; That ſecular Ends are very apt to mix with, and ſhelter themſelves under the ſhadow of Religion. This has been the Old Artifice for Miſchief in all Ages; we ſhould be wiſer than venture our Stake upon a Game ſo well known, that every Child in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, can now perceive the</hi> Cheat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Far be it from me to write one Syllable in Diſhonour to</hi> True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: <hi>That muſt needs be a Right Noble and worthy Thing in it ſelf, and very powerful with Mankind, when the bare</hi> Shew <hi>of it can ſerve to carry on thoſe Deſigns, which neither Wit nor Force can effect. All I ask of the</hi> Whole Body <hi>of Diſſenters, is, if poſſible,</hi> To be Honeſt; <hi>to aim at nothing but what's good and warrantable, to proſecute all their Affairs by lawful Means. Do no irregular, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy or baſe Act; but with Purity of Soul bear a principal regard to the Rules of their Duty, and the Dictates of a well-inform'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Build their Practice, not upon treacherous Quagmires, bold and impious Opinions, but upon ſolid, ſafe, approv'd, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try'd Principles, which tend to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding of</hi> Virtue, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>and</hi> Humane Society: <hi>So that they can be content to have their Thoughts ſounded, their Actions ſifted to the bottom, could even</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49558:3"/>
               <hi>wiſh that their Breaſts had Windows, that their Hearts were tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that all the World might ſee through them; becauſe the more curiouſly the Ways of an Honeſt Man are mark'd, the more exactly his Dealings are ſcann'd, the more throughly his Intentions are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated and known, the</hi> greater Approbation <hi>he is ſure to receive from Good and Wiſe Men. But Men made up of Deceit and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, deſire to keep on the Vizor; are fearful to be laid open, to have the Varniſh wip'd off, their Intrigues unravell'd, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions quite ſtript of the Veils that now enfold them. All agree in this, (even by the Light of Nature) That</hi> Honeſty is the beſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, <hi>and the moſt infallible Method of Safety and Security, in all the Tranſactions of this World: Yet it would puzzle a good Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher to find ſo much of it here in the Sunſhine of the Goſpel, as is apparent among</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Indians <hi>in their darkeſt Night of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Infidelity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I conclude this in the Words of</hi> Salvian, <hi>written as a Monition to all</hi> Chriſtians. <q>
                  <hi>How much is Religion concern'd in this, that without compariſon we ſhould be better than</hi> Heathens? <hi>But how</hi>

                  <hi>much (with Grief and Horrour I bewail it,) does it tend to the Prejudice of Chriſtian Life and Action, if we are worſe than</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens? <hi>This is to be worſe when we are more guilty.

            </head>
            <p>THIS Ancient <hi>BURROUGH</hi> (known formerly by other Titles) goes at preſent under a ſtrange Diſguiſe; an odd Name will beſt correſpond with ſome late Tranſactions there; a Place and People ſo much chang'd for the worſe, that if the Old <hi>Catieuchlani</hi> (who had it before the <hi>Romans)</hi> were now alive, they wou'd fancy themſelves unhappily caſt upon ſome wild new-found Land, inhabited by the Family of <hi>Errour</hi> and her Daughters, of which none were alike, unleſs in this, That all are Deform'd. If Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk, and Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> (whom we account Favourers of the worſt, that is, the Romiſh Religion) ſhou'd once more viſit our divided <hi>Scydromedia,</hi> and conſider the irreligious ſtate of it, at this time, they wou'd preſently croſs themſelves, and get out of it with all ſpeed, to avoid Dangers. If thoſe many Chriſtian Biſhops, who here held a Conference and Conſultation in thoſe elder Times, (Times of leſs Learning and more Honeſty) ſhou'd have occaſion with other Spirits to enter our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Caſtle and Corporation, they might ſee ſufficient Reaſons for the change of its Name, and cou'd not but wonder at the many Viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of Time, Place, and Manners.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Antbony Putt</hi> and I, will not pretend to be much ſeen in the Antiquities of our Town and Country; that's a Study we muſt reſign to a more Able, Faithful, and Judicious <hi>Antiquary,</hi> who has already detected <note place="margin">Sir <hi>H. Ch.</hi>

without leave. Well, waving Antiquity in this caſe, let's ſurvey the preſent State and Condition of this Burrough: What deplorable Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it has ſuffer'd within our Memory! How unnaturally have ſome Men degenerated from the Principles, Honour, and Temper, of their Anceſtors! Where the Grandfather and Father were conſtant Bleſſings, in their Piety, Beneficence, and Good Example, to all Men; the Son unlearns all his Parents Virtues, and becomes a Reproach to his Family, a very Curſe and Plague to the Plate he wells in. He that a few Years ago paſs'd for an undoubted Oracle, every Word of his was a Law with the Common People, was as Infallible as the Pope Himſelf, has now, alas! loſt Ground to amazement: His Cardinal Diſſenters begin to have other Sentiments; to think, in good earneſt, they may be ſafeſt without him; their Liberty as ſure, their Traffick more unlimited, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation more clear, if, by laying him aſide, they free themſelves from their unpolitick Practice of oppoſing the Church. The meaneſt of the People have their Eyes open; can now ſee as far into a Mill-ſtone as other Men; can tell ye, that all is not Gold that ſeems ſo; that there's difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Words and Deeds, Pretence and Truth, and do mortally hate to be deceiv'd: They ſee plainly what was meant by ſetting up the Burrough againſt the Corporation; the mighty Out-cry of, <hi>Danger! Danger!</hi> like, <hi>Fire! Fire!</hi> to amuze and confound the Multitude; that had they either not Voted at all, or join'd with the Mayor and Aldermen againſt Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> their Danger and Loſs had not been ſo great, in ſetting aſide a Man greedy of Honour, as the Injury and Miſchief of deſtroying the Unity and Friendſhip of the Town, dividing it into Parties, and begetting Hatred and Malice one againſt another. They now believe that the Civil Rights and Liberties of <hi>Scydromedia,</hi> may well be maintain'd without his Help; and that the Advice and Aſſiſtance of <hi>Honorary Freemen</hi> (in chuſing the fitteſt Men to ſerve in Parliament) can be no wrong to a Corporation: That to rob Men of their Peace, Reaſon, and Religion, is a greater Crime than to <note place="margin">See <hi>the Caſe of Elections ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>

Time and Conſideration do Wonders; ſome Men that heretofore wou'd venture ſtarving rather than not Vote for our Worthy Patriot, now are of Opinion they had better ſtay at home, and ſtand neuter; and then, tho' they ſtrictly oblige neither Party, yet by leaving it to others of better Judgment, they enrage none.

belov'd Honour: Being puff'd up with that, he and his <hi>Magna Charta</hi> paſs ſome coarſe Compliments on Mr. Mayor, the Aldermen, and all the Church-Party; calling them <hi>Arbitrary, Infolent Magiſtrates, Multipliers of Electors, Thieves, Treaſonable, Impudent Fools, Injurious, Time-ſervers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers on of Tricks, Men of black Deſigns; Men of no Reaſon, Frantick Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers.</hi> But we muſt ſuppoſe, that theſe Words are to be taken <hi>Ironically;</hi> that he meant juſt contrary to what he ſaid: And truly without the help of this deceitful Trope, we had been hard put to't, to take off the Abſurdities and Contradictions of that printed Paper.</p>
            <p>Now let's try at the Book, if we can anſwer that; juſtifie the Saints, and preſerve our Members, the Work's done; <hi>Sed hic Labor! hoc Opus!</hi> In order to it, let Sir <hi>A.</hi> put on as good a Face as he can, genteely frisk about the Town, viſit every diminutive Cottager, ſay, <hi>Sir, I'm your humble, moſt faithful, and moſt obedient Servant; you're all miſtaken in me; I am the ſame Man I was in King</hi> Charles II.<hi>'s Time; that no Revolution can change my Temper; that with all my Faults, you had better have one you do, than one you do not know.</hi> If he meets a Man that has but an Hoſe or Clout on his Head, let our obliging Knight bend his Body with Hat and Hand to the Ground, and in all Circumſtances act the Part of Popularity to the life. I Confeſs he's too great a Maſter that way than to need my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p>Let my Lady <hi>Caſtle</hi> ſpend no more of her precious Time in vainly Coaching to Park or Play, in making unneceſſary, unwelcome Viſits to the Gentry; theſe will never promote our Cauſe. Mrs. <hi>Maggot,</hi> or any other of the Holy Siſters, or whatever they are, that will help to carry on our Good Deſign, muſt have the Honour of being my Lady's Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; nay, ſhe ſhall attend them in Houſe, Street, Coach, in all Places, and ſeem fond, very fond of 'em, for want of better Society—Let the 'Squire forbear watching and waiting under his amorous Oak; the Prize is taken; and was I fit to adviſe a Counſellor, that Tree ſhould not longer ſtand as a living Monument of his dying Honour: Let him not altogether lurk within doors, but try his Skill upon the Diſſenting Females; ſome more than common Familiarity with them, may chance to turn the Tide for all this. The Leading Presbyterians are ſure Cards, to oppoſe Church and Kingly Government; the Independents may be eaſily wrought into any pious Miſchief; and the Quakers are generally too proud to ſubmit to the plaineſt Truth, or go one ſtep out of their own way. And yet the wiſeſt Heads amongſt 'em are ſtagger'd at the Book, and know not well what to ſay againſt it. But, to our comfort, I perceive all <hi>Sects</hi> are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to favour <hi>Popery</hi> (whatever their Clamours may be to the contrary) than to encourage the Church, and vote for the Defence of it.</p>

1. <hi>Firſt, For the Author.</hi> 'Tis hard to find out who this Friend <hi>Henry</hi> is, whether Quaker or not: If I own the Truth, he was a wiſe and honeſt Man and were it not in hopes of ſecuring Voices by People's Ignorance, I cou'd heartily wiſh all <hi>Engliſh-</hi>men knew and conſider'd ſo much as he has written: O Intereſt! Intereſt! I cannot like any thing that croſſes Thee. Plain Dealing's a Jewel; but have a care of the latter part of that known Proverb: Why ſhould any Man create Enemies to himſelf? Had he not medled with our <hi>Diana,</hi> and the Crafts-men, to expoſe them; had not he defended Monarchy, Epiſcopacy, and the Whole Religion and Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (at ſuch a conjuncture in which we are contriving to ſubvert 'em) I cou'd have more freely excus'd and pardon'd that Author. Now we muſt wait long enough for a Republick; we have been plagu'd with Biſhops for above Sixteen hundred Years already, and 'tis to be doubted we ſhall ne'er get rid of 'em while the World endures. We have blacken'd the Church with more than bare Suſpicions of Popery, and muſt never again uſe that Trick to deceive the People: All the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Kingdom (if they underſtand Senſe, and the force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) muſt confeſs that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is Orthodox and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, and that no juſt Imputation of Popery can be faſtned on her.</p>
            <p>I deſire the Author in his next Edition, to abate ſomething of his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Modeſty, in concealing his Name, and Reſidence. The Hornets may buzz about, but cannot ſting him; or if they do, he has many Friends; Men of Honour, Art, and Integrity, to take care, that the Venom may not prove Mortal. The Danger is not worth naming; when the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion-Broker is ſo pleas'd with his <hi>Gainful Recipe,</hi> that he offers <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> in Requital. Mr. <hi>Maggot</hi> ſeems concern'd, that the Author wou'd not give him leave to be grateful. Our Knight extravagantly promiſes a <hi>Full Bottle</hi> of the <hi>Beſt,</hi> and to give him the Honour of ſeeing the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his Reward. The Church-men are more oblig'd, for thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Reaſons on their ſide, which require ſome Time and Skill to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; <hi>Porringer</hi> and <hi>Mouth</hi> may be excus'd; for Charity's grown cold among their <hi>quondam</hi> Benefactors.</p>
            <p>If a <hi>Woman,</hi> one of the Fair Sex (as ſome ſay) was the Author; and is as lovely in Body as Mind; our good Members earneſtly deſire to be moſt intimately acquainted with her. If Law, Divinity, and Phyſick (as moſt think) were engag'd in this Compoſure; w' are over-match'd by far: All we can do, (beſides This Trial) is by way of Recrimination; which will neither invalidate the Book, nor extenuate our own Faults. <hi>Truth will prevail.</hi> We may endeavour to blemiſh their Reputations, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to render theſe Gentlemen as immoral and vile as we are; yet, without all peradventure, the <hi>Envy, Hatred, Malice, Lying, Spiritual-Pride, Beaſtiality, Deceit</hi> and <hi>Treachery,</hi> too commonly approv'd and practis'd among <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> do by as many Grains out-weigh the ſmaller Infirmities and Failures of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the ſolemn and deliberate Crimes of riper Years, do the Extravagancies of inadverting Youth.</p>

Whoever was the Compoſer, we ſhall hardly dance after his Pipe. He has ſet a fairer Copy than the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of <hi>Scydromedia</hi> will tranſcribe in one day. In compliance with their Temper, I'll try if I can ſpoil the Muſick; blot and blur the Book to make it leſs valuable: For, though I cannot diſcover the Author, I have found out,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly, The Errours of the Book,</hi> which I intend to bring in as Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt it—I ſhould begin at the wrong End; a prepoſterous Method is moſt agreeable to all our Proceedings. 'Tis very true, of Making Books there's no End. This is not the firſt time our choice Friends have been read in Print, and cannot be the laſt. I doubt not, but we ſhall daily afford freſh Matter for ingenious Men or Women to try their Wits on. Oh! If we had truly fear'd God, and kept his Commandments, we had never been troubled to anſwer this <hi>Untoward Book.</hi> It may not be judg'd a Matter of Imprudence, in entring firſt upon the Concluſion of it; there being but here and there a little in the Body and ſubſtantial Part, but what's too firm and unanſwerable. However, at preſent, we'll call it a ſilly, vain, ſcurrillous Pamphlet, meriting not ſo much Regard as the bare reading it amounts to, let the <hi>Church-men</hi> ſay what they will of the Validity of its Arguments, of the Truth of its Hiſtory; That this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference has done the Church of <hi>England</hi> Right, and the Inhabitants of <hi>Scydromedia</hi> no Wrong; there are yet ſome <hi>Errata's</hi> or Miſtakes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted or amended in the next Edition, elſe, by my Conſent, it ſhall never paſs Muſter amongſt the <hi>Saints.</hi> But for the better Satisfaction of the World, and that Truth and Juſtice may take place, the <hi>COURT</hi> has impanell'd a Jury of ſeveral Perſuaſions; that the Book, with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Matters therein repreſented, may have fair Play.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jury,</hi> indifferently choſen, are, Five <hi>Church-men,</hi> Four <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Four <hi>Independents,</hi> and Four <hi>Quakers.</hi> Honeſt Men and True, ſtand together, and hear your <hi>Charge! viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge.</hi> A late bold Pamphlet, call'd, <hi>The Beſt Choice for Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> written in favour of Church and King, queſtioning the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Saints, under the Names of <hi>Latitudinarians, Presbyterians; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, Seekers,</hi> &amp;c. who have here put themſelves upon this Trial of Truth—You are to enquire therefore, without Favour or Malice, Whether <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>not Guilty?</hi> And to take ſpecial Care, before Verdict given, That you duly and impartially conſider, the Matters and Things urg'd on both Sides; that Sentence may paſs accordingly. You, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Jury! I am farther to inform you, that the Matters in Queſtion are Matters of Fact, whereof You are the proper Judges: Attend then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the <hi>Evidence</hi> for the <hi>Saints,</hi> drawn out of the <hi>Errours</hi> and Inſufficiencies of that Book; no leſs than <hi>Fourteen</hi> of 'em.</p>

Uſes, leaving a well-gotten Inheritance to his Children. We have an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb, <hi>Bleſs'd is the Son whoſe Father goes to the Devil;</hi> true enough of ſuch Fathers, who (ſwell'd with Pride, hardned with other Vices, and given over to <hi>Invincible Prejudice, Invincible Perverſeneſs,)</hi> do ſeldom end with True Repentance: Yet you know, Gentlemen! That the Son is not to bear the Iniquity of the Father, to be puniſh'd for it, if he does no way partake in the Fathers Sins. 'Tis very rare, I confeſs, but not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for ſuch a Son to turn Honeſt, in making full Reſtitution to every injur'd Man, though he leaves himſelf as naked <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Crow. And if Miracles are not ceas'd, this may be Mr. <hi>Mouth</hi>'s Caſe, and when 'tis ſo, the Church has no farther Cauſe to grate upon him for his unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Deſcent, but be over-joy'd at the true Converſion of ſo great a Sinner.</p>
            <p>The Book finds mighty fault with the preſent Choice of rude and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Errour</hi> 2.</note> Commiſſioners, few real Gentlemen being employ'd in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. And what of all this? Tho', 'tis true, an honourable Cobler ſhould not go beyond his Laſt, nor by ill Management make the publick Taxes over-grievous to the People; yet there wants not a Salvo or two for this ſore Inadvertence: It ſerves (if for nothing elſe) to take off the Odium and Blame from the Gentry; and does good that way: It gives us a bitter Taſte of <hi>Popular Government,</hi> creates a nobler Eſteem for the Gentlemen of the County, than if we had never known the difference betwixt Rudeneſs and Civility, by the Carriage of theſe Men.</p>
            <p>Is't not a great Incivility to force a Knight and Baronet to confeſs he's no true Friend to a Corporation, where he expects Favour? That he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Errour</hi> 3.</note> never did or can do good there? What Boldneſs is this, Gentlemen of the Jury, to aſſert a thing ſo apparently abſurd! Pray who was it that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd the Soldiers? Who that procur'd the Aſſizes? Ask the General, conſult the Judge; they'll tell you, perhaps, they heard nothing of our Knight in all this: But may we not believe Sir <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Letter before their Sayings? <hi>Litera ſcripta manet,</hi> when Words vaniſh into Air, and are forgotten. I deſire our Truſty Secretary <hi>A. B.</hi> to produce that Letter in Court, ſhew publickly that 'twas no Sham: And then—</p>
            <p>The Book prates about one <hi>John Ponteus—</hi>There's no ſuch Man now <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Errour</hi> 4.</note> living: and 'tis a great Rudeneſs, if not Inhumanity, to diſturb a dead Man's Aſhes: Was he here, you'd ſee how much he reſents this Indignity, to have an ingenious Man's Name fix'd on an illiterate Broker. This Man ſnuffs at the ſign of the Devil's cloven Foot, very unwilling to own that this Emblem of Miſchief is made out by his endeavour to rend and divide the Church. He denies his having the Pictures of a Woman and Child in the Book mention'd; and thinks it time to forget the old Story of the poor Widow and Orphan, ſo much talk'd of to his diſgrace. He gain'd nothing by that Bargain; his offering Twenty Pounds for their Goods above his own Appraiſement, when he was entruſted in that Affair (as the moſt Righteous Man that cou'd be found among the <hi>Saints)</hi> ſhould be look'd on only as his Charity to the Widow and Orphan; and not to conclude from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49558:7"/>
that Offer, that he had left room in the Valuation to be a Knave to them.</p>
            <p>Another of the Book's <hi>Errata's</hi> is, the bringing a ſweet innocent Babe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Errour</hi> 5.</note> upon the Stage of Contempt, to expoſe him ſo ſoon as born. Poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! uncapable of making the leaſt defence for himſelf; 'twas unfairly done; no Man knows what Barr or Obſtruction this may prove to his enſuing Fortune.</p>
            <p>Friend <hi>Henry</hi> was too plain beyond Good Manners, in telling the Saints <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Errour</hi> 6.</note> what the Companion of Vice is; little thinking how near it borders upon Impudence, for him to undertake the Regulation of Elections, or what Miſchief he has done by declaring for the Church. All this ſtruck ſuch a Damp among the Diſſenters, that they ſeem'd for a while to be void of ſenſe. It brought ſo great a Diſorder into the peeviſh Conſtitution of our principal Patron, our modern <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> that in meer Spleen and Diſcontent he ſcarce ſtaid to bid adieu to the Saints. Ah! had we loſt twenty Sir <hi>Anthonies,</hi> and twice that number of hopeful 'Squires, (if ſuch and ſo many might be found) and kept this Champion of our Cauſe alive, our Sorrows wou'd be dry, not half ſo inſupportable as this Loſs to the whole Party.</p>
            <p>Old Father<hi>-Elymas,</hi> with his empty Porringer, looks wondrous ſour <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Errour</hi> 7.</note> and uneaſie, thinks it very hard meaſure to be damn'd for Feeling: He might well hope to be exempted out of the Catalogue of Offenders, ſince ſo many of his own Saints, are guilty of greater Crimes. Beſides, he ſtifly pleads <hi>Predeſtination</hi> for all things, and excuſes himſelf and others in this Argumentative Way; If Men lie under an inevitable Fate of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, 'tis very unreaſonable to condemn them for thoſe Faults, not in their own Power to avoid.</p>
            <p>This Book would ridicule Mr. <hi>Mouth</hi> for his want of Learning; He <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Errour</hi> 8.</note> ſcorns your <hi>Bono Fido's,</hi> or <hi>Stattu-Co's:</hi> theſe were merely put upon him. Pray, Gentlemen hear him ſpeak for himſelf and Friends.</p>

            <p>But why all this noiſe about the Church? as if the Church was injur'd <note place="margin">

Now, if Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> does ſincerely love the Church, (as every true Member of it ought to do) He'll certainly in all Things, in all Times, Caſes, and Circumſtances, eſpouſe her Intereſt; give her all the Demonſtrations of Kindneſs and Fidelity, that can be given: Can any Man conſent to pull down that Church, wherein (if at all) he hopes to be ſav'd? To deſpiſe or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, much leſs to ſpurn againſt a moſt <hi>Pious Mother,</hi> that has provided to make him happy in both Worlds?—If by a <hi>Moderate Church-Man</hi> is meant, One that cares not how little he's concern'd in the Communion of it; One that's indifferent or cold in all the Parts of its Worſhip; that is not ſtrictly ty'd up to the Rules and Orders of it, but is at Liberty to prevaricate, upon any Worldly Conſideration; That to pleaſe or gratifie a Party, can omit, alter, or abbreviate the Church's Prayers; play faſt or looſe with his Religion; can betray the Church, to ſerve himſelf. He's properly no <hi>Church-Man</hi> at all, no true, no ſound Member of it: Is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like a Wooden-Leg, ty'd on, and taken off at pleaſure, than by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ligaments and Nerves, knit to the Eccleſiaſtical Body. The Church often ſuffer'd, and can have no good from ſuch looſe, ſuch falſe Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. I ſee no Reaſon to engage the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to chuſe ſuch a <hi>Moderate Church-Man</hi> as before deſcrib'd; ſince it is not very probable, that a Man can be true to another Party, kind to other Religions, who is unfaithful to his own. But if by a <hi>Moderate Church-Man,</hi> is ſignify'd one, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true Chriſtian, cannot diſſemble with God and the World; gives <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> their due Reſpect and Deference; is yet of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, meek, patient and charitable Temper, as to pity and pray for his very Enemies; Is not for taking advantages of all Offenders; not for inſiſting ſtrictly on the <hi>Summum Jus,</hi> the utmoſt Rigour or Extremity towards them: But, demeaning himſelf ſo equitably and fairly in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, in Differences and Conteſts, and generally in his Dealing with all Men, as to promote the Wellfare of Mankind, and as much as is poſſible for an honeſt Man to do, for preſerving of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Amity one with another: Such a Benign, Lovely, Chriſtian Temper does the Church of <hi>England,</hi> above all others, commend and practice at this day; Has ever eſteem'd it her Glory to keep the <hi>Medium</hi> between the Two Extremes of <hi>Severity</hi> and <hi>Remiſſneſs:</hi> Such Moderation as the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> never us'd towards her, when they had the Power; nor
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49558:9"/>
can they ſhew it to one another, when ever their Circumſtances ſhall happen to require it.</p>
            <p>Oh! But Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> was a Fellow-Sufferer with the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> was <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Errour</hi> 14.</note> ſecur'd, and carried to Priſon, (when the Government was in Danger, and he ſuſpected as an Enemy) though he call'd himſelf a Church-Man. And have not <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Reaſon to look on him as a Friend, whate'er the Book ſays to the contrary? 'Tis no matter for conſidering the Cauſe; whether our Perſecution was or was not for Righteouſneſs ſake; whether <hi>Diſſenters</hi> then ſuffer'd as Chriſtians, or for ſome other Reaſon? But ſuffer they did, That remains ſo freſh in our Memories, that we can neither forget nor forgive it.</p>
            <p>We are unwilling to remember (on t'other ſide) how miſerably the Loyal Epiſcopal Party were plunder'd, ſequeſtred, decimated; dungeon'd, ſtarv'd and often ſtunk to death; what Oaths and Covenants were rigorouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on the Wicked; what reſtraints were laid upon their Liberties, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical; tho' all this while they had Law and Right ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them. But the Saints at that time (Ruling by the Law of Liberty and good Conſcience) publiſh'd an Ordinance of Parliament, in the Year 1645. <q>That if any Perſon hereafter ſhall at any time uſe, or cauſe to be uſed, <hi>The Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> in any Church, Publick Place of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or in any private Houſe or Family, within the Kingdom; the firſt Offence Five Pound; the ſecond Ten; the third to ſuffer One whole Year's Impriſonment without Bail or Mainpriſe.</q> 
               <hi>This had been hard indeed, if the Saints had not done it!</hi> But they were encourag'd by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who publiſh'd an Order, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 24. 1655. <q>That no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who had been ſequeſtred for Delinquency, been in Arms againſt the Parliament, adhered to, abetted or aſſiſted the Forces rais'd againſt them; ſhould keep in their Houſes or Families, as Chaplains or School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, for the Education of their Children, any ſequeſtred or ejected Miniſter, Fellow of a Colledge, or School-maſter, nor permit any of their Children to be brought up by ſuch—That no ſuch Perſon of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhou'd any where adminiſter Baptiſm or the Lord's Supper, or Marry any Perſons, under ſome ſtrange and hard Penalties, which I think improper to mention, and I hope our Judges will not inſiſt upon that Point; for then our Argument falls to the Ground, our loud Complaints of Suffering muſt perfectly ceaſe.</q> I have ever admir'd the Wiſdom and Policy of the Diſſenting Guides in this, as in many other things, like that of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy, <hi>To keep the People in Darkneſs,</hi> not permitting them to know the <hi>Truth,</hi> or read the Books that have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in defence of it; no, not ſo much as to acquaint themſelves with the Common Prayers, to underſtand them; and all that while the unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People might rail with a better Grace, with ſome ſhew of Honeſty; becauſe they not erring againſt Knowledge, their wilful Ignorance may be ſome, tho' a very lame excuſe for their Separation from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

'Tis needleſs to multiply Particulars; I might in the Presbyterian Mode increaſe the Number to Two and fortiethly, when all might be reduc'd to three or four Heads. If I'm not much miſtaken, the Book will be ſufficiently baffled, when I have added one more, which I take to be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar omnium, viz.</hi> How unconcluding and inconſequent is it, to ſay, That becauſe ſuch and ſuch Members have many notorious Faults, therefore the Diſſenters ought not to Vote for them? Alas! the Saints themſelves are not free from Vices of the ſame kind (tho' they don't own them) and ſo the moſt corrupt Members are the moſt agreeable Perſons to underſtand their Secrets, to be entruſted with their Deſigns. To ſay, A Man's bad, as bad as may be, and offer that as a Reaſon againſt the Diſſenters Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, is altogether as improper, as to deny Birds of a Feather their natural Society: For, if the Blood and Treaſure extorted by them, the Spoils and Ravages of the late War, the enſlaving and oppreſſing all Ranks of Men; and (what's above all) the horrible Murder of an excellent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Prince, amount not ſo high as to be accounted any Sin; what can it ſignifie to be corporally Vile? To be guilty of that common, that venial Sin of Uncleanneſs among them? But leſt this duller heavy Trot of Proſe ſhou'd tire the Patience of our prudent Judges, be pleas'd to take <hi>The Vindication of the Saints,</hi> in this ſmoother and more delightful Amble of a late Poet.</p>

The firſt Argument I ſhall offer for the <hi>Saints,</hi> is their <hi>Infallibility:</hi> Every Diſſenter from the Church, carries an undoubted Pope in his own Breaſt; ſo that 'tis ſtrange, nay almoſt impoſſible for him to be miſtaken, in my Opinion; Though all other Men find the woful Infirmities of Humane Nature, the Weakneſs and Short-ſightedneſs of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and the daily Experience how prone they are to Errours and Miſapprehenſions; yet the <hi>Saints</hi> are alway ſure, poſitive, and peremptory, that they are in the Right, and all others in the Wrong that differ from them: The early Prepoſſeſſions of their Opinions, the powerful Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of Education, an implicit, and unexamin'd Belief of what their Guides and Leaders teach 'em, have ſuch mighty irreſiſtable Force upon their minds; That they no more doubt the Truth and Goodneſs of any Cauſe they're engaged in, than they queſtion the Certainty of the Scriptures, or the plaineſt Demonſtrations in the Mathematicks. Can it be ſuppos'd that Men, who paſs for Saints, can have any Pride, Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Self-Conceit, to put them out of the Right Way; or that they can poſſibly think more highly of themſelves, and their Way, than in Duty they ought to think?

That the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are not void of Miſtakes, ſeeing they do apparently contradict and oppoſe each other, and frequently themſelves too in Matters of Religion.

               <p>'Tis ſtrange, that Men ſhould glory in their Shame, value themſelves for ſuch wild Notions as never before obtain'd in the Church of God! Herein you excell the Church, in Fancy, in Errours, but not in Truth. Our Doctrines are Faith, Hope, Charity, Humility, Peace, Meekneſs, Juſtice, Patience, Obedience, and Perſeverance to the End: Our Miniſters teach the ſame Truths that our Dear Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles taught, Sound and Orthodox; The Words of Eternal Life; tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly to Edification, to build Men up in the Unity of the Church; To grow in Grace, in Knowledge, and in all Vertue. I would to God, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> might be in Love with ſuch Edifying Doctrines as theſe are: But, alas! This talk of higher Notions, of greater Edification, is many times mere Wantonneſs, and Inſtability of Humour; and too often ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fancy than Effect: Men conceit that they are better edified, (not when they are more fully inſtructed in any weighty Point of Faith, or more perfectly inform'd in ſome neceſſary Duty, or more efficaciouſly mov'd to the Practice of what they know; but) when they are more gratified and pleas'd at the hearing of a Sermon, or the like. Thoſe that are troubled with theſe itching Ears, inſtead of being edified, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 5.</note> the moſt ignorant of all Men; they often make an unwiſe choice in their Teacher; and provoke God to leave them to the Vanity of their own Minds: when they depend rather on the ſuppos'd Abilities of a Man, than the Bleſſed Influences of the Holy Spirit; and look more at <hi>Paul that plants, and Apollos that waters,</hi> than at <hi>God that gives the increaſe.</hi> For it is the Bleſſing of God alone, and not any Man's Skill in diſpenſing them, that make the Word and Ordinances any way beneficial to us; with the help of his Grace, thoſe Means of Inſtruction, which we ſometimes the moſt undervalue, may be profitable to our Salvation; without it, our Ears or Fancies may be entertain'd; But we cannot be edified by the moſt

fluent and popular Tongue, nor the moſt melting and pathetical Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the World; but much leſs by ſuch Doctrines as were taught by the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> when the Church was down. I tremble to name them! That the <q>Scriptures cannot be ſaid to be the Word of God; and are no <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Catalog.</hi> and <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of Errours.</note> more to be credited than the Writings of Men, being not a Divine but Humane Tradition. That God has a hand in, and is the Author of the Sinfulneſs of his People; not of the Actions only, but of the very Pravity which is in them; That all Lies come out of his Mouth; That the Prince of the Air, that rules in the Children of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is God. That in the Unity of the Godhead, there is not a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons, but that 'tis a Popiſh Tradition; That the Doctrine of Repentance is a Soul-deſtroying Doctrine; That Children are not bound to obey their Parents at all, if they be ungodly. That the Soul of Man is mortal, as the Soul of a Beaſt; That there is no Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on at all of the Bodies of Men; nor Heaven nor Hell after this Life.</q> Theſe are only a Taſte; not all, nor the hundredth part, nor the worſt of thoſe Doctrines taught by <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in the late unhappy times; when the wholſome Food of the Soul, and the Diſpenſers of it were quite laid aſide: So much for <hi>Doctrine.</hi>

               <p>I am ſorry you ſhould ſo far undervalue the Prayers of our Church, and your own Judgment, in comparing any performances of Prayer in your way, to the moſt excellent Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> I durſt put it upon this Expedient; Let any Prayer made occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally and <hi>extempore,</hi> by the ableſt and moſt cautious (of thoſe that magnifie the Conventicle way, and deſpiſe ours,) be taken exactly in Writing, and publiſh'd to the World, I am very well aſſur'd, that one Man, without any great pains, may find more things exceptionable in that ſingle Prayer, in a ſhort time, than the ſeveral Parties of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> with all the Diligence they have hitherto uſed, have been able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the whole Service of the Church, in more than a hundred Years. Our Prayers, as to the Subſtance, are what Chriſt and his Apoſtles us'd, in a Language underſtood by all thoſe that are concern'd in them; to which we may all ſafely ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> But for ſudden Prayers, though they may happen to be good, yet for the greateſt part they are dangerous;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49558:13"/>
ſomething of Hereſie in every Sentence, ſome Indecencies and Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be in every Word. Reflect upon the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in that time when this Liturgy was out of uſe, and every one left to his own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 'Tis ſcarce poſſible to believe what wild and prodigious Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were upon all occaſions uſed in Holy things; eſpecially in Prayer, the moſt immediate Act of Worſhip and Addreſs to God. 'Tis an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the Majeſty of Religion, that there ſhou'd be any thing in it, Childiſh and Trivial, Abſurd and Frivolous; that its Sacred Myſteries ſhou'd be expos'd to Contempt and Scandal; by that Levity and Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that Heat and Boldneſs, thoſe Weakneſſes and Indiſcretions, thoſe looſe, raw and incongruous Effuſions, which in moſt Congregations of thoſe times did too commonly attend it. How can there be that Sobriety, that Senſe and true Devotion in an <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer, (where the Mind is employ'd to find out Words; and looks more like ſtudying or making of a Prayer, than Praying,) as in thoſe Publick Forms, which are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd and fixt; where the Spirit or Soul has no more to do, than to mount upon to Heaven with the Wings of true Devotion, and offer her Requeſts (in theſe Words) <hi>at the Throne of Grace?</hi> Was it any Amendment, inſtead of praying, <hi>From Fornication, Goood Lord, deliver us;</hi> to ſay, with a <hi>Diſſenter, Lord, Unluſt us?</hi> To leave out our admirable Collects for the peaceable and orderly Government of the Church, and inſtead of theſe, to blaſpheme the Almighty! by telling him, <q>If he did not finiſh the good Work which he had begun, in the Reformation of the Church, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>View of Troubles, 2d. Part,</hi> Edw. Gan.</note> he wou'd ſhew himſelf to be a God of Confuſion; and ſuch an one, as by cunning Stratagems had contriv'd the Deſtruction of his own Children? That God wou'd bleſs the King, and mollifie his hard Heart, that delights in Blood; For that he was fall'n from Faith in God, and become an Enemy to his Church?

               <p>I'm ſorry you have no better Argument than Obſtinacy. When People cannot but acknowledge the Doctrine and Worſhip of a Church to be according to Truth, 'tis a Weakneſs, an Abſurdity, to find fault with its Diſcipline, which was appointed for the better Performance of Religion: And the parting from that which is well eſtabliſh'd, the diſ-ſetling of that which is well fixt, is not the way to greater Purity and Perfection, but to the Corruption and Decay of Religion; unleſs you can ſhew, that the Church was ſo much over-ſeen, as to conſtitute Canons and Orders, inconſiſtent with, or deſtructive of the Eſtabliſh'd Religion. Wou'd the Church be ſo careful to Reform from Popery, and to deliver a Pure Religion down to Poſterity; and not likewiſe take care of ſuch a Diſcipline as might preſerve the Eſteem and Practice of that holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Prove any Order of our Church ſinful, or not correſpondent with Religion; that Order, that Uſage ſhall immediately be diſcontinu'd. This, I am ſure, you and all the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> cannot prove. The ſingle and plain Queſtion then is, Whether the Government of the Church, or That among Diſſenters, is to be choſen by any Wiſe Man? Look back upon the Changes made in Church-matters, by Diſſenters, in the late San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Times; Thoſe Changes, thoſe Alterations, were not ſo conducive in their Nature for the Edifying and Well-governing of the Church, as thoſe things which they illegally remov'd. As for Inſtance: The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by a Biſhop, accompanied with Presbyters, was more certain and ſatisfactory, than that by Presbyters, without a Biſhop. Was it not better to have Forms of well-compos'd Prayers, than to petition, or rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Almighty with Noiſe and Nonſenſe? Was it not better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the <hi>Creed</hi> ſtanding, than to leave it quite out of the <hi>Directory?</hi> Was it an Advantage to Chriſtian Piety, to change the Geſture of Kneeling in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, when the Sacred Elements are given, together with Prayer, for that leſs-reverent one of Sitting? of Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eſpecially with the Hat on, as the moſt uncomely Practice of ſome was and is? The <hi>People</hi> being taught to cover the Head, while the <hi>Miniſter</hi> was to remain bare among them.—Was the Alteration of giving the Elements, an Amendment? Read the <hi>Directory</hi> for Publick Worſhip, in the time when the Diſſenters did their beſt to excell the Church; <hi>Take ye, eat ye; This is the Body of Chriſt which is broken for you; This City is the New-Teſtament in the Blood of Chriſt, which is ſhed for the Remiſſion of the Sins of may:</hi> The Words denoting Chriſt's preſent Crucifixion; and either actually, or in the future certainty of it, give countenance to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs.—</hi>Nor was the Civil Pledge of the Ring in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage better'd by the Invention of ſome Paſtors, who took a Ring of their Women-converts, upon admittance into their Church. The Forbidding the Obſervation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Nativity, and other Holy-days, did not add one Hairs-breadth to the Piety of the Nation; but, on the other Hand,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49558:14"/>
it took at leaſt from the Common People one ready Means of fixing in their Memories the moſt uſeful Hiſtory of the Chriſtian Religion.—'Tis poſſible for meer Dwarfs in Underſtanding and Policy to contrive an Alteration in Government that may be pleaſing to themſelves for a time, during their Paſſion, and the Novelty of the Model in their own Fancy, not yet diſturb'd by ſome unforeſeen Miſchief or Inconvenience: But 'tis extreme difficult, upon the whole matter, to make a true and laſting Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, fitted and fram'd to all Caſes and Circumſtances of Affairs in Religious Obſervances. So that if we make a fair Compariſon, and let Experience and Reaſon rule in this Caſe, we muſt ſay, That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church is Beſt ſtill.</p>

               <p>If we have got no Ground of the Eſtabliſh'd Church in Matters of <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> I hope it may be granted we have the Advantage, by much, in the <hi>Purity of Life:</hi> We are holier and leſs offenſive than other Men.

               <p>'Tis worth our obſervation, That no Argument has hitherto been offer'd in favour of the Diſſenters, but carries a ſufficient Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion along with it. I have the Charity to think well of ſome Men, who, out of a true deſire of pleaſing God, having no worldly Deſign at the bottom, do in ſome Circumſtances differ from us. I am perſwaded there are many well-meaning Diſſenters, who from their Hearts deteſt all known Wickedneſs: And ſuch only will rightly conſider the Miſchiefs of Separation, which every one that truly fears God, ought moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to avoid. The Church of <hi>England</hi> loves Religion and Goodneſs in all Men; and declares, there's nothing more Valuable in the World; but cannot excuſe the Body of Diſſenters from being the Occaſion of many Impieties in the Nation. Their very Separation deſtroys the true Spirit of Religion, which is Charity; it lets looſe great Numbers, who cannot govern themſelves; moving them to live Atheiſts or Idolaters; to pour Contempt upon the whole Church of Chriſt; confirms Men in their evil Courſes, and expoſes the Church as a Prey to the Common Enemy. Gentlemen! give me leave to ſay, That to propoſe Maintenance of Charity and all Virtue, by overthrowing the Church, is as improbable a Project, as his who in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's time propos'd a Rebellion without <hi>Breach of the Peace.</hi> When the Government of King and Biſhop was ſubverted, there were preſently as many Religions as Men; mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Swarms of Errors and Hereſies broke in upon us, more than had been before known in the Church of God; and upon this, an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſorts of Wickedneſs over-ſpread the Land: So horrible was the Effect, that one of their own Authors tells us, <q>That for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years there had not been a Party pretending Godlineſs, Tenderneſs <note place="margin">Edw. Gangr.</note> of Conſcience, Strictneſs, above other Men, (as this Party did) that has been guilty of ſo many Sins, horrible Wickedneſs, provoking Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49558:14"/>
as they are. Hell ſeem'd to be broke looſe, to have invaded all Quarters, in deſpite of their <hi>Covenant,</hi> and all the little Schemes of their ſo-much-magnified <hi>Reformation:</hi> That they have overpaſs'd the Deeds of the Prelates, juſtified the Biſhops, in whoſe Time never ſo many, nor ſo great Errors were heard of; much leſs ſuch Blaſphemies, and Confuſions. We have worſe things amongſt us, more corrupt Doctrines, and unheard-of Practices, than ever were in all the Biſhops days. Our Reformation is become a Deformation: We firſt put down the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and then ſome put down the very Scriptures, ſlighting and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming them: Some caſt down Biſhops and their Officers; others caſt to the Ground all Miniſters, and all the Reformed Churches: Some had caſt out the Ceremonies in the Sacraments; others had caſt out the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments themſelves.</q> With abundance more, too tedious to repeat.</p>
               <p>Another of their Authors tells the Parliament, in a Sermon, <q>That the Covenant cries (God grant not againſt you) for the Reformation <note place="margin">Jenkyns Serm. 46.</note> of the Kingdom, the Extirpation of Hereſies, Schiſms, Profaneneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Impieties abound, as if we had taken a Covenant to maintain them; ſince it was taken, Theſe Sins, which we have Covenanted againſt; have more abounded, than in the ſpace of ten times ſo many Years before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another makes this Remark, <q>That one of the Fruits of this Bleſſed <note place="margin">1648.</note> Parliament, and of thoſe two Sectaries <hi>(Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents)</hi> is, That they have made more <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> than are in all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury! You may ſee by what means it was, that this Nation came to be peſter'd with Opinions and Practices, beyond the Example of former Ages, to the infinite Prejudice and diſhonour of our Religion and Nation: You may gueſs what a bleſſed Reformation we may expect from the Ruine of the Church: The ſame Cauſes, ſet on foot by the ſame Principles, will eternally produce the ſame Effects: And tho' Men at firſt may mean never ſo well, yet Temptations will inſenſibly grow upon them, and Accidents occur, which in the Progreſs may carry them infinitely beyond the Line of their firſt Intention, and engage them in ſuch Courſes, out of which, when they come to diſcern their Errour, it may be too late for them to retire.</p>

               <p>'Tis in vain to plead againſt Matters of Fact; but I would have you know, our Diſſenters are more for <hi>Spirit and Truth,</hi> more modeſt and peaceable, than thoſe of that Time; we are more conformable to the Laws, leſs turbulent and offenſive to Government; and, generally ſpeaking, did we believe that our Schiſm or Separation from the Church was a Sin, or the Occaſion of Sin, we ſhould no longer remain in the Practice of it, but preſently join with the Church, and never more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her Communion.</p>

               <p>You may gueſs at the Spirit and Temper of the Diſſenters, by their obſtinate and indefatigable Stiffneſs in Oppoſing the Church. Let the World judge; let themſelves be Judges in this Caſe: When the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49558:15"/>
Church requires no Popiſh, no Antichriſtian Terms of Communion; when the Diſſenters can offer no Argument that has not been abundantly anſwer'd; they entrench themſelves within their ſtrongeſt Holds of Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Reſolution, never, never to yield, tho' they are ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd and baffl'd. If the Diſſenters have any thing more of Moderation and Peace, than appear'd in the late Times of Anarchy and Confuſion, we are oblig'd to <hi>the Church, the Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> and to the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Laws, that lay ſome reſtraint upon them. But once remove This Church, or quite let looſe the Reins of Government, and we ſhall ſoon find what manner of Spirit does influence theſe Men.—The firſt Race of Diſſenters were far more for Unity and Peace, than theſe are; they meddl'd not with Things out of their Line, nor mixt themſelves with Matters of State: All they deſir'd was, to have no Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offer'd to their Conſciences. When they could not conform as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, they did as Private Chriſtians. Men that were moſt eminent amongſt 'em for <hi>Learning, Piety, Preaching, Writing, Experience, and Fame,</hi> have done more towards the Unity of the Church, than our Modern Diſſenters do at this day. They have own'd our Communion lawful; they have receiv'd the Communion kneeling; they have bred up their Children to the Miniſtry of the Church; they have join'd in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; they have been married according to the Form of it. <hi>The ancient Nonconformiſts would not</hi> ſeparate, <hi>tho' they feared to</hi> ſubſcribe.</p>
               <p>But now the Government has been ſo kind to ſettle Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by a Law, our Conſcionable Men turn their Backs upon the Church, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſtry, by Mr.</hi> Nye, <hi>Mr.</hi> Robinſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Mr.</hi> Corbet<hi>'s Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt's Plea for Lay-Communion, Mr.</hi> Marſhal, <hi>Hiſt.

This is the Senſe which the beſt and moſt pious Chriſtians that ever liv'd had of it; <q>That 'tis better to ſuffer any thing, than that the Church of God ſhou'd be rent aſunder: That 'tis every whit as glorious, and a far greater Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to die for not dividing the Church, than for refuſing to ſacrifice to Idols: That a Perſon going from Church to Schiſmaticks, tho' in that capacity he ſhould die for Chriſt, yet can he not receive the <note place="margin">Dionyſius <hi>the good Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>Vid.</hi> Euſeb. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 45.</note> Crown of Martyrdom: That ſuch a one has no Part in the Law of God, or the Faith of Chriſt, or in Life or Salvation: That without this Unity and Charity, a Man cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; tho' he ſhou'd deliver up himſelf to the Flames, or caſt his Body to Wild Beaſts, yet this wou'd not be the Crown of his Faith, but the Puniſhment of his Falſhood; not the glorious <hi>Exit</hi> of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Courage, but the Iſſue of Deſpair: He may be kill'd, but not crown'd: He rents the Unity of the Church, deſtroys the Faith, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the Peace, diſſolves Charity, and profanes the Holy Sacrament.</q>

But then we muſt not fix upon dubious, diſputable Texts, but the plaineſt and moſt eaſie; whoſe Senſe and Meaning is agreed on by Men of all Judgments: Texts deliver'd in ſuch clear and univocal Terms, that oppoſite Parties do apprehend them in the very ſame way; and theſe cannot well be Matter of Cavil and Diſpute.</p>

who is outwardly of a ſeeming good Life, is yet of very ill Judgment in Points eſſential to Chriſtianity; as, to deny the Sacraments and other Parts of Religion, inſtituted by the Spirit of Truth; he muſt needs be miſinſtructed by the Spirit of Errour and Faſcination; let his outward Converſation be what it will, let his viſible Courſe of Life be never ſo <note place="margin">1 John 4. 6.</note> plauſible or ſevere. On the contrary, If a Man be Orthodox, and at the ſame time Diſhoneſt; of ſome good Opinions, but evil Practice; holds the Truth, but in Unrighteouſneſs, ſo as to allow, abet, and encourage Villanies; he is not ſeaſon'd by the Holy, but the Unclean Spirit; let his Judgment be what it can: For an honeſt Heathen is not ſo bad as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Knave. If a Man makes Diviſion in a Church or Kingdom, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the Bond of Peace, and ſhall endeavour to crumble Religion into as many ſmall Pieces, as idle Heads can ſuggeſt; they are miſled by that Spirit whoſe Name is <hi>Legion;</hi> that old cunning Serpent, that deceives the World, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9.

Laſtly, If Men do cite and urge Scripture againſt the whole Tenor and Stream of it, and wander into the wrong way, even by that very Word which does direct them into the right one, we may ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what manner of Spirit they are of; the Spirit of Slumber, the Spirit of dead Sleep, that has blinded the Mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 10. Theſe Rules are proper for the Trying of our <hi>Quakers,</hi> and other Men's Spirits. But, Gentlemen of the Jury, there's one thing more to be added; That Vices are apt many times to paſs for Vertues; many Lies, to Fleſh and Blood, are more plauſible than Truths; hardly any thing can be ſo falſe, but may have Colours and Probabilities to ſet it off; and that a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ignorant People do often ſwallow the groſſeſt Errors, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of the greateſt Truths; taking them all down at once, without chewing. For this reaſon, you cannot paſs a right Judgment upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Spirit, until you have ſearch'd into the main or general Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of their Lives, as well as the meer Conduct and Carrying on their Deſigns; with the Means they make uſe of, as well as the End they ſeem to aim at; with all their Actions in a Lump, as well as with the moſt ſpecious and faireſt of them. And when this is done thorowly, then let the Hypocrites and Impoſtors be what they will, let the Features of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be never ſo artificially and neatly drawn, let the Colours be laid on with never ſo delicate a Pencil, and let that Pencil be manag'd with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo exquiſite Addreſs; 'twill be moſt eaſie to find the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Picture and the Life: Let <hi>Zeuxes</hi> lively Grapes be never ſo apt to deceive the Birds, yet the Deadneſs of his Boy will unfold the Cheat. And truly the Arts of Deceiving are very obvious: Men that will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated and deceiv'd by them, muſt be Men of the loweſt Size in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>

               <p>I confeſs, Theſe are Truths not to be deny'd; many Particulars to be avoided, and many to be practiſed, by every good Chriſtian. I know that the World is grown to that paſs, that the repeating of the plaineſt Texts is accounted by many as unconcluding in Divinity, as in Philoſophy: But 'tis time for us to lay aſide all our Sophiſtry, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Wiſdom of God before our own. O! my deluded Brethren! have we not troubled the Nation and our ſelves too much with unreveal'd Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; hearkning to Fables, and rejecting the Truth? Have we not been for making a Church, a Saint, a Miniſter, a Heaven, a Chriſt, a Light, a God, in our own Imagination; while the Truths in Scripture are nothing worth in reſpect of Theſe? Have we not delighted in Tattlings, Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49558:19"/>
buſying our ſelves in Things which concern us not? Are not our Opinions new Opinions, contrary to the Church? Don't we uſe our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for a Cloak of Diſorder, a Cloak to Sacrilege, a Cloak to uſurp the Divineſt Imployments? To cry, All are one in Chriſt Jeſus; therefore all are one in a Kingdom, a Church, a Family? We are all free from beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Rudiments, the Rudiments of the Ceremonial Law; therefore we are free from Ceremonies of Order and Decency among Chriſtians; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Tythes to be paid, no Prieſts to be maintain'd; tho' the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt be not a <hi>Levitical,</hi> but long before a <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood, a Prieſthood after his Order that received Tythes, a Tything Prieſthood, before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was inſtituted; and that not for a ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but for ever, after the Order of <hi>Melchizedech.</hi> We have declaim'd againſt <hi>Prieſt,</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Miniſter;</hi> we ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> and yet have <note place="margin">Heb. cap. 5, 6, 7.</note> deny'd his Miniſters to be <hi>Prieſts of an Inferior Order:</hi> Our Lives have been queſtioning, tatling, oppoſing, railing, damning Lives: And truly, Friends, ſuch Lives are contrary to the Light of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Light of the <hi>Word,</hi> or any Light, but that which the Scripture calls <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> And however we may come off before an <hi>Earthly Judge,</hi> 'twill be too hard for you to anſwer theſe Things at an higher Tribunal. Then, Brethren, 'twill be better for you to ſay, Lord, we have believed, truſted, hoped in thy Word; than, We have diſputed, queſtion'd, and contemn'd it: Better for our Light to ſay, O Lord, we have receiv'd thy Prophets in thy Name, give us, we beſeech thee, a Prophet's Reward; than, We have ſlain thy Prophets, revil'd and ſet at naught thy Miniſters, and their Miniſtry. Therefore, as you love your Salvation, as you deſire the Favour and Fruition of God; if your Souls, Reputations, and Conſciences are dear to you; no more of theſe Things, which the Light of Eternal Truth tells us we muſt <hi>avoid.</hi>

               <p>I wiſh we could do ſo: But, alas! when I examin'd my Life by the Rules of Truth, I found little of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in me, while I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd to my own Light. For, is this Brotherly Love, to ſeparate from the Church, and think nothing worth our Labour, but what oppoſeth it? Is this to prefer one another in Honour, when we think our ſelves ſo holy, that we abhor the Congregations of Church-men; think we are polluted, to join in Prayer and Communion with them; ſo wiſe, that all Words beſides our own are vain Words, all Books but ours are meer Errours; that we, and none elſe, have the Light, the Word, the Truth, all Privileges? Is it to live peaceably as is poſſible, when we think it an excellency to diſturb Order, to find fault with every thing but our own Inventions, and agree in nothing but to diſturb that which is eſtabliſh'd? Is this the Peace we are to exerciſe? Is this the Quietneſs of Illuminated Chriſtians? The True Light ſhews us, That if we have Faith, we muſt have it to our ſelves, not to diſturb the Church of God with it. <hi>We may all be Chriſtians, and yet have our ſeveral Opinions:</hi> But if we have our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions different from the receiv'd Opinions of the Viſible Church, we ought
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49558:19"/>
to keep them to our ſelves; not to divulge or diſperſe them, to diſturb our Brethren. How can we ſay, that we hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith without wavering, when we ſcarce know what Article of Faith we have not rejected? We diſpute of Heaven or Hell, of any Light or Way to Heaven, but that within us. Firſt, We contemn'd and threw off the Biſhops, the Worſhip and Diſcipline appointed and approv'd by them: Next, We contemn'd the Presbyters, which we us'd as a Means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Biſhops: We rejected the Independents, which ſhew'd us a different Way from Presbytery. Is there any thing we now approve in any of them, but the <hi>Extempore's?</hi> And not them neither, but as they ſerve a Turn. Is this holding faſt, to ſeek all new? to reject old Doctrines, old Principles, Rules, and Ceremonies? We are Waverers, Queſtioners of all things, Holders of nothing.—The Truth tells us, We are to ſtudy Quietneſs, to eſteem a Miniſter very highly in Love for his Works ſake, to withdraw from every Brother that walks diſorderly, to follow the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God: But our Lives do directly oppoſe the Truth: <hi>Nobis quiet a movere, merces videbatur:</hi> We have always been for Troubled Waters; if we cou'd but queſtion or contradict, put an odious Gloſs or Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Church, That was a Pleaſure to us. We love the Clergy ſo well, that we wou'd detain their Tythes, that Poverty might make them Bleſſed: We rail againſt Tythes, not that we think 'em unlawful, but for other Reaſons: We have a long time made it our Buſineſs to revile the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> to finite the Shepherds that the Sheep might be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and to draw the Hearts of the People from them. Are not we to withdraw from every Brother which walks diſorderly? And does not he walk diſorderly, who walks contrary to thoſe Duties which the Apoſtles have taught in their Epiſtles? Are we not to follow the Churches of God? But we have followed every Separation; a Meeting-houſe, a Deſart, a Secret-chamber, a Schiſm-ſhop, a Seducing-ſchool, any Place but a Steeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. How do we follow the Apoſtles, if we don't as they require? Do we practiſe that Lowlineſs, Meekneſs, and many other Chriſtian Duties? Do we agree with others as far as we can, and wait till God ſhall be pleas'd farther to reconcile us? We ſhou'd not permit Women to lay aſide their Silence and Subjection, and to become Speakers in our Seducing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes: I'm ſure they don't inſtruct in Meekneſs, but queſtion with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, evade by Ignorance, gloſs by Impertinence, and conquer by no <note place="margin">Impudentia pro telo; Ignorantia pro ſcuto.</note> Diſpute, but violent Bawling, and invincible Inſolence. Women's Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting loſt us Paradiſe; and Women's Preaching can do no leſs than loſe us the Truth of our Doctrine, and the Peace and Safety of the Church. And if my Brethren would duly conſider the Plainneſs and Authority of theſe unerring Rules of Chriſtian Light and Life, and what the Spirit has ſaid to the Churches in the Holy Scripture, they wou'd ſoon be of my mind; the Difference betwixt us and the Church of <hi>England</hi> wou'd here be ended.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the ſame Book, they tell us of a Twofold <hi>Schiſm,</hi> Negative and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive. <q>Negative, when Men do peaceably and quietly withdraw from
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49558:21"/>
Communion with a Church, from which they are departed. The other is, when Perſons withdrawing, do conſociate and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves into a diſtinct and oppoſite Body, ſetting up a Church againſt a Church; which (ſay they) <hi>Camero</hi> calls <hi>a Schiſm,</hi> by way of Eminence. And farther tells us, there are <hi>Four</hi> Cauſes that make a Separation from a Church lawful; 1. When they that ſeparate are grievouſly and intolerably perſecuted. 2. When the Church they ſeparate from is Heretical. 3. When 'tis Idolatrous. 4. When 'tis the Seat of Antichriſt. And where none of theſe Four are found, there the Separation is inſufficient, and Schiſm. Now we are fully aſſur'd, that none of theſe Four Cauſes can be charg'd upon our Congregations; Therefore you muſt not be diſpleas'd with us, if we blame you as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>poſitive Schiſm.</hi>

               <p>All which is as true now, as it was then; and as applicable to us and them, and it was to them and their Diſſenters.

               <p>This I take to be none of the leaſt Abſurdities the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are guilty of. Are there no ſuch Mixtures, no Offenders, no ill Livers amongſt you? Are they all holy, harmleſs, and pure that come to your Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? If not, you have the ſame Reaſons <hi>to ſeparate, to come out from among them,</hi> as to <hi>withdraw from the Church,</hi> for fear of <hi>Pollution;</hi> and by the ſame Argument, you muſt never join in any Communion while the World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures. The want of Diſcipline, we may thank you for; You, You <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> are the Cauſe that ſo many Immoralities are now tolerated; That Excommunication, and other neceſſary Cenſures of the Church (which formerly kept People in good Order, and preſerv'd the Honor and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion) are by your Encouragement of Diſobedience, both omitted and mock'd at. And were you truly Men of tender Conſciences, this one Conſideration would make your Hearts ake. Look into the State of the Church, under the <hi>Jewiſh Adminiſtration,</hi> and you'll find, that the Sins of neither Prieſt nor People, owning the True God, became at any time the occaſion of Separation to them. What Sins could be greater than thoſe of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons? And yet did not the People of God, <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> by Name, refrain to join with them in the Publick Worſhip? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17, 24. In <hi>Ahab</hi>'s time, when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> halted betwixt God and <hi>Belial,</hi> yet then did the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> ſummon all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to appear on Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and held a Religious Communion with them, in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Praying and Offering a Miraculous Sacrifice, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. All along, when both Prince, Prieſts, and People were very much deprav'd and debauch'd in their Manners, we don't find that the Prophets at any time exhorted the Faithful and Sincere to ſeparate from the reſt; or that they themſelves ſet up any ſeparate Meetings, but continu'd in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church, preaching to them, and adviſing them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>Look into the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> you'll ſee in the Apoſtolick Churches of <hi>Corinth, Galatia,</hi> and the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> many of the Members were grown very Bad and Scandalous; yet we don't read <hi>the Example of any Good Man</hi> ſeparating from the Church, or <hi>any one Precept</hi> (rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49558:23"/>
from the Apoſtles ſo to do. They don't tell them that the whole Body was polluted, by thoſe filthy Members; and that if they would be ſafe themſelves, they muſt withdraw from their Communion; but exhort 'em to uſe all Means to reclaim them: And if neither private nor publick Admonitions and Reproofs wou'd do, then to ſuſpend them from the Communion of the Church, till by Repentance and Amendment, they render'd themſelves capable of being reſtor'd to Peace and Pardon.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour knew the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> to be a corrupt Church; Prieſts and People lewd and vicious, yet kept in Communion with it, and commanded his Diſciples ſo to do. We read that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> who rul'd the Eccleſiaſtical Chair at that time, had <hi>perverted the Law, corrupted the Worſhip of God,</hi> were <hi>blind Guides, devoured Widows houſes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 15. 6, 7, 8.</note> were <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and ſuch as only had a <hi>Form of Godlineſs;</hi> yet did not our Saviour ſeparate from their Communion; but was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> freely ſubmitted himſelf to all the Rites and Ceremonies of it. He was circumcis'd on the <hi>Eighth</hi> Day, redeem'd by a certain Price, being a Son and a Firſt-born, obſerv'd the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and other Feaſts enjoin'd by their Law; Yea, and that of the <hi>Dedication</hi> too, which was but of Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; was baptiz'd amongſt them, preach'd in their Temples and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, reaſon'd with 'em about Religion, exhorted his Diſciples to hear their Doctrine, though not to follow their Practices. Now, what greater Cauſe, on the Account of Corruption and Manners, could be given to ſeparate from a Church, than was there? Yet how carefull was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, both by his Example and Precept, to forbid and diſcountenance it?</p>
               <p>Conſider the Repreſentations of a Church, given in Scripture, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; to ſhew, that it is a Mixture of Good and Bad; 'Tis call'd a Field, in which Wheat and Tares grew up together; a Net, wherein are Fiſhes of all ſorts; a Barn, wherein there is Corn and Chaff; a Vine, that has fruitful and barren Branches; an Houſe, in which are Veſſels of Gold and Silver, and of leſſer Value; a Marriage-Feaſt, at which were wiſe and fooliſh Virgins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> compares the Church to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, wherein were preſerv'd the Clean and Unclean. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Vanity I may ſpeak it, though we have too many wicked People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yet there are at the ſame time, a far greater Number of truly pious Chriſtians (that live up to the Strictneſs of Religion) to be found in the Communion of this Church, than amongſt all the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>As for the two places in Scripture, produc'd for your Separation; read like truly Wiſe Men; conſider the Coherence and Deſign of them, and it will plainly appear, that by the <hi>firſt</hi> Text is meant, That Chriſtians in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſhou'd not meddle with Unclean and Abominable Practices that were us'd by the Heathens in the Worſhip of their Falſe Gods: Theſe they were not to touch; to have no Fellowſhip with them in theſe, but rather to reprove them; that is, in Judgment to condemn, by Word to reprove, and in Converſation to avoid them. So that this is nothing at all touching the <hi>Duty of one Chriſtian communicating with another;</hi> though it has too often been ſo abus'd and miſ-interpreted. And for the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49558:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>ſecond</hi> Text, it is certainly to be underſtood alſo of <hi>Idolaters;</hi> and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to moſt Interpreters, <hi>of the Roman Idolatrous Polity;</hi> and is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to all Chriſtians to forſake the Communion of <hi>That Church,</hi> leſt they endanger their own Salvation, by Communicating with her in her <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Worſhip.</hi> And if this be the true Senſe of the Words, it abundantly juſtifies our <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> but affords not the <hi>leaſt Plea</hi> for <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to <hi>ſeparate from Ours.—</hi>And now I paſs to</p>
