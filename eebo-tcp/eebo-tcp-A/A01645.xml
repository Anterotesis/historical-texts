         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the answer of <hi>Vespasian</hi> to <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> desiring en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and accesse for <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> two Philosophers: <gap reason="foreign">

have never been bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against scholars and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: but the inward temple of his divine breast was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked unto me, and through that I saw his heart flaming with affection towards me. The experience of that his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Philanthropie moved me formerly to desire entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a stranger, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wonted Philoxenie, not for <hi>Dion</hi> or <hi>Euphrates</hi> the Philosophers, but for <hi>Gerard</hi> the Divine, having then new put on an English mans habit. I obtained my desire. At SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISBURIE he was welcome. In citie and countrey after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he found good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. After three yeares he came again to <hi>Cambridge.</hi> I furnished him with ink and paper. Then he resolved to take another progresse. On
<pb facs="tcp:3220:3"/>
New-yeares day I left him on his way to <hi>Rochester.</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised not to divert to any place till he had seen your <hi>Lordship,</hi> and presented my most humble service. Happy <hi>Gerard,</hi> that may see your <hi>Lordship.</hi> O that I might but see once again those heavenly eyes whose first aspect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence blessed me! O that I might but kisse those saving hands which raised me! O that I might but visit that temple, and worship that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine breast, where my soul found sanctuary! If <hi>Gerard</hi> may, in part I shall. That which I cannot see with mine eyes, my dayly thoughts shall present unto me: Him whom I cannot reverence with cap and knee, I will alwayes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in heart and minde: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the feet of my bodie
<pb facs="tcp:3220:4"/>
I cannot walk, I will travel with all dutifull affection. But what shall I do to expresse my thankfulnesse? He that hath scap'd shipwrack will hang up his sails to Neptune for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument: I have none other sails but such as are made of thin paper, and those scarce yet drie. He that hath passed through the pikes, and is come off safe and sound, will offer a <gap reason="foreign">

He that is recovered of a dangerous sicknesse, will do his devotions at Aescula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius his temple: My prayers shall alwayes be directed to Almighty God, who hath the hearts of all men in his hands, who opened the good Dean of SALISBURIES heart unto me: Unto him shall my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

early and late be directed, to open unto the Bishop of ROCHESTER the treasury of all blessings temporall and eternall: And I hope the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God will accept this tribute of a devout soul. <hi>Serva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> hath nothing else to give: But he shall alwayes remain</p>

                     <l>Thy Saviour on the crosse did choose,</l>

That head, at which the angels tremble, is crowned with thorns. That face, which was most beautifull above the sonnes of men, is defiled by the spittings of the ungodly. Those eyes, which were more bright then the sunne, are darkened in death. Those eares, which were wont to heare angelicall praises, do ring now with the proud speeches, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision of sinners. That mouth, out of which did proceed most divine ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; that mouth, which taught the angels, hath no other drink but gall and vineger. Those feet, which are to be adored, are fastned with nails. Those hands,<note place="margin">John 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> which stretched forth

the heavens, are stretched forth on the crosse, and nailed. That body, which was the most sacred temple of the deitie, is whipped, and wounded with the speare: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remains there any part in him save onely a tongue, and that, to pray for them that crucified him. He that reigneth with the Father in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, is by sinners grievously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the crosse: God dies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crosse: God suffers: God poureth forth his bloud. Judge the greatnesse of the danger by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the prize. Judge the danger of the disease by the value of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. Surely those wounds were great indeed, which could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be cured, but by the wounds of the living and quickening flesh. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that disease must needs be great, which could not be cured but by the death of the physician.</p>
                  <p>Consider, thou faithfull soul, Gods most fierce anger against us. After the fall of our first father, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, onely begotten, and well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved sonne of God becomes suter unto his Father for us: And yet his anger

John 2.2.</note> became our <hi>advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> and took the cause of us misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinners upon himself: And yet his anger was not turned away from us. Our Saviour took upon him our flesh, that by the glorie of the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, communicated unto the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he might expiate and purge our sinfull flesh: that by the saving vertue of his most perfect righteousnesse communicated unto our nature, he might wipe away that venemous qualitie of sinne which cleaveth to our nature, and in stead thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre grace upon us: And yet his anger was not turned away from us. Our sinnes and the punishment of our sins he taketh upon himself. His body is bound, whipped, wounded, pierced, crucified, buried. His bloud, like a dew, distilled most copiously down all his members at his passion. His most holy <hi>soul is made sorrowfull above measure, yea even unto death.</hi>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Our Saviour cry'd, Repent, repent,</l>
                     <l>As John that 'fore our Saviour went.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>THe foundation and beginning of holy life is saving repentance. For where there is true repentance, there is remission of sinnes: And where there is remission of sinnes, there is the grace of God: And where there is the grace of God, there is Christ: And where Christ is, there is his merit: And where there is Christs merit, there is satisfaction for sinnes: And where there is satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for sinnes, there is righteousnes: And where there is righteousnesse,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3220:18"/>
there is joy and tranquillitie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: And where there is tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of conscience, there is the holy Spirit: And where the holy Spirit is, there is the sacred and holy Trinitie: And where the holy Trinitie is, there is eternall life: Therefore where there is true repentance, there is eternall life. Where there is not true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, neither is there remission of sinnes, nor the grace of God, nor Christ, nor his merit, nor satisfaction for sinnes, nor righteousnesse, nor tranquillitie of conscience, nor the holy Spirit, nor the holy Trinitie, nor eternall life.</p>

By mortall sinne man loseth God: God is the infinite and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible good: Therefore to lose God is an infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible evil. As God is the chiefest good, so sinne is the chiefest evil. Punishments and calamities are not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3220:20"/>
absolutely evil: for many times there comes good of them. Yea rather it appeares that they are good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they come from God who is the chiefest good; from whom can proceed nothing but that which is good. They were in the chiefest good, to wit, in Christ: And the chiefest good cannot partake in that which is evil truely so called. And moreover they leade us unto the chiefest good,<note place="margin">Luke 24.26.</note> that is, to <hi>life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.

                     <note place="margin">Acts 14.22.</note> Therefore sinne is the chiefest evil, because it withdraws us from the chiefest good. The nearer thou comest unto God, the further thou departest from sinne: The nearer thou comest unto sinne, the further thou departest from God. How saving therefore is repentance, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws us from sinne, and brings us back again unto God! Sinne is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the greatnesse of him that is offended: But him the heavens &amp; the earth cannot contain: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner such is our repentance as he unto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3220:20"/>
whom we return by repentance. The sinner is accused by his conscience, which he hath defiled; by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, whom he hath offended; by the sinnes, which he hath committed; by the creatures, which he hath abused; and by the devil, by whom he hath been seduced. How saving then is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which frees us from such accusations! Let us make haste there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us make haste to such a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving medicine for such a grievous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease. If thou repentest at thy death,<note place="margin">Aust. of repentance.</note> thou dost not leave thy sinnes, but thy sinnes leave thee. Thou shalt scarce finde any one that repented truely at his death, unlesse it were the thief upon the crosse. <hi>Fourteen yeares have I served thee,</hi>

Every day doth our flesh heap sinne upon sinne: Let the Spirit therefore every day wash them away by repentance. Christ died that sinne might die in us: And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3220:21"/>
shall we suffer that to live and reigne in our hearts, for the destroying whereof the sonne of God himself died?<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> Christ enters not into the heart of man by grace, unlesse John Baptist prepare the way by repentance. God poureth not the oyl of mercie, but into the vessel of a contrite heart. God doth first mortifie us by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.6</note> that afterwards he may quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us by the consolation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

Holy Father, poure not I beseech thee thy wrath upon me, seeing that thou hast smitten thy Sonne for me.</p>
                  <p>O holy Jesus, deliver me from the wrath of God, thou that didst take it upon thy self for my sake upon the crosse. O holy Spirit, protect me by thy consolation against the wrath of God, thou that in the gospel hast declared mercie to the contrite and penitent.

                  <p>AS often as I think of the Lords passion, I presume much of the love of God and the forgivenesse of my sinnes. He bowes down his head to kisse me:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bernard</hi> upon the Passion.</note> He stretcheth forth his arms to embrace me: He openeth his hands to give unto me: He openeth his side that I may see his heart flaming with love: He is lifted up from the earth that he may draw all unto him: his wounds are blue with grief, and shining with love: Therefore by the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wounds we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the secrets of his heart. With him there is most plenteous redemption, because his bloud di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled not down drop by drop, but flowed down most plentifully from five parts of his body: As the grape cast into the wine-presse is squeez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">

grievous anxietie and sorrow even unto death, that he might make us partakers of everlasting joy in the heavens. He would be betrayed with a kisse, which is a signe of friendship and good will, that he might blot out the sinne by the which Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed our first parents under the colour of friendship. He would be apprehended and bound by the Jews, that he might set us at liberty which were bound in the chain of our sinnes, and subject to be cast into everlasting damnation. He would begin his passion in the garden, that he might purge away sinne which took its beginning in the garden of paradise. He would be comforted by an angel, that he might make us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels fellows in the heavens. He was forsaken of his own disciples, that he might glue unto himself us, who had most shamefully revolted from God. Before the Councel he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by false witnesses, that Satan might not accuse us by the law of God.

He was scourged by the hands of the unrighteous, that he might free us from the scourges of the devil. He cried out for grief, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us from everlasting exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He poured forth tears, that he might wipe away tears from our eyes.

All good in

Doth not he wrong himself which loveth any thing unworthy of his love? Now the soul of man is more noble then all the creatures, because it was redeemed by the passion and death of God: Why therefore should it love the creatures? Is it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that majestie unto which God hath exalted the Saints? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we love, we love either for power, or wisdome, or beauty: And what is more powerfull then God? what is more wise then God? what is more beautifull then God?

the beautie of the creatures compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the beautie of God, is defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.

The love of God is the chariot of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias ascending up into heaven. The love of God is the joy of the minde, the paradise of the soul, it excludeth the world, it overcometh the devil, it shutteth hell, it openeth heaven. The love of God is that seal by which God sealeth the elect and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers:<note place="margin">Rev. 7.3.</note> God at the last judgement will acknowledge none to be his, but those that are sealed with this seal.

is not true, unlesse it doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it self by love. There is no true faith, unlesse there be a firm confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and there is no confidence without the love of God.

The love of God is the life and rest of the soul: When the soul departs from the body by death, then the life of the body departeth: When God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts out of the soul by reason of sins, then the life of the soul depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Again, God <hi>dwells in our hearts by faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 3.17.</note> God dwells in the soul by love, because <hi>the love of God is diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the hearts of the elect by the holy Spirit</hi>:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.5.</note> There is no tranquillitie to the soul without the love of God: The world and Satan do much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet it: But God is the chief rest of the soul: There is no peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but to those that are justified by

                  <p>But faith is not a naked opinion, and profession, but a true and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehension of Christ propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in the gospel, a full perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the grace of God, the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent rest of our soul, and peace which relies onely upon the merit of Christ. This faith is begotten of the seed of Gods word: For faith and the Spirit are one, and the word is the coach by which the holy Spirit is brought unto us. The fruit doth follow the nature of the seed: Faith is a divine fruit: Therefore the seed must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and that is, <hi>The word.</hi> As in the creation light was made by the word of God; for God said, <hi>Let
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3220:46"/>
there be light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1.14</note>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So the light of faith ariseth from the light of the word of God: <hi>In thy light shall we see light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 36.9.</note> saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist. Seeing faith doth joyn us unto Christ, seeing it makes us one with him, therefore it is the mother of all vertues in us. Where there is faith, there is Christ; where Christ is, there is an holy life; to wit, true humility, true gentlenesse, true love. Christ and the holy Spirit are not severed: where the holy Spirit is, there is true holinesse: Therefore where there is not an holy life, there is not the sanctifying Spirit. And where there is not the Spirit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there Christ; where there is not Christ, neither is there faith. Whatsoever branch doth not suck its life and nourishment from the vine,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.4.</note> is not to be judged a part of the vine: So neither are we yet joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Christ by faith, unlesse we suck our life and nourishment from him. Faith is a kinde of spirituall light: For our hearts are enlightned by faith: Therefore it spreads abroad the rayes of good works: But where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3220:46"/>
the rayes of spirituall life are not, there is not yet the true light of faith. Bad works are the works of darknes: But faith is light:<note place="margin">2.

Bad works are the seed of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: But faith is the seed of Christ: And <hi>what communion is there between Christ and Satan</hi>?<note place="margin">2.

                     <note place="margin">1. Joh. 5.4</note> And how can there be true faith there, where the flesh overcometh the Spirit, and leadeth it as it were captive? By faith we have Christ, and in Christ eternall life: But no impenitent sinner that persevereth in his sinnes, can be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of eternall life: How then can he be partaker of Christ? How can he be partaker of faith? Kindle in us, O Christ, the light of true faith, that by faith we may obtain eternall salvation.</p>

as it were of himself an equivalent price: and God the Creatour suffers in the flesh, that the flesh of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should not suffer for ever.

delivered the creature from that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evil. Is not this infinite mercie farre exceeding all the finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and thought of man? Our nature is become more glorious by Christ, then it was dishonoured by <hi>Adams</hi> sinne.

God in the old Testament made <hi>a covenant</hi> with his people <hi>by circumcision</hi>:<note place="margin">Gen. 17.11.</note> So by baptisme in the new Testament we are received into the covenant of God. Baptisme succeeded in the place of circumcision: He therefore that is in the covenant of God, need not be afraid of the devils accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>In baptisme we put on Christ:</hi>

the throne of the Lambe: The church is the throne of the Lambe, in which onely the grace of holy baptisme is to be had. The prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw <hi>waters going out of the temple,</hi>

The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure crow goes forth like the Devil: But the dove like the holy Ghost flies and brings the olive-branch, that is, peace and tranquilitie unto our mindes.

                  <p>OUr Lord ascending up into the heavens, and entring into his glory,<note place="margin">Acts 2.4.</note> sent the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> unto the disciples upon the day of Pentecost. As in the old Testament God when he proclaimed the law in <hi>mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi>

                     <hi>came down unto Moses:</hi> So when the gospel was by the apostles to be propagated throughout all the world, the holy Ghost came down upon them. There, was thundering and lightning, and the loud sound of the trumpet; because the law doth thunder against our disobedience, and makes us subject to Gods indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation: But here, is the sound of a gentle winde; for the preaching of the gospel doth lift up the souls that are cast down: There, was the fear and trembling of all the people; <hi>because the law worketh wrath:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.15</note> But here, the whole multitude doth flock
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3220:73"/>
together to heare the wonderfull things of God; for by the gospel we have accesse unto God: There, the Lord descended in fire, but it was in the fire of his wrath and furie; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the mountain moved, and did smoke: But here, the holy Ghost descendeth in the fire of love, so that all the house is not shaken by the wrath of God, but is rather reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the glory of the holy Ghost. What wonder is it if the holy Ghost be sent from the court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to sanctifie us, seeing that the Sonne was sent to redeem us? The passion of Christ had not profited us, unlesse by the gospel it had been preached unto us; For what use is there of a treasure that is hid? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our most mercifull Father did not onely prepare a great benefit by the passion of his Sonne, but also would have it offered to all the world by sending the holy Ghost. The faithfull mother giveth unto her tender infant both her dugs. God who is faithfull doth send unto us both the Sonne and the holy Ghost. But the holy Ghost came upon the

apostles, when they were assembled together at prayer <hi>with one accord</hi>:<note place="margin">Acts 2.1. Zech. 12.10.</note> For he is the <hi>Spirit of prayer,</hi> he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is that bond by which our hearts are united with God, as he doth unite the Father with the Sonne, and the Sonne with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For he is the mutuall substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall love of the Father and the Sonne. This our spirituall conjunction with God is wrought by faith: But faith is the gift of the Spirit. It is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by prayer: But true prayer is made in the Spirit. In the temple of Solomon, when incense was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto God,<note place="margin">1. King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.11.</note> 
                     <hi>the temple was filled with the glory of the Lord:</hi> So if thou offerest unto God the sweet odours of prayers, the holy Ghost shall fill the temple of thy heart with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Let us here admire the mercy and grace of God: The Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to heare our prayers,<note place="margin">Psal. 50.15. Rom. 8.34 Gal. 4.6. <hi>Austine.</hi>
                     </note> the Sonne maketh <hi>intercession for us,</hi> and the holy Ghost <hi>prayeth in us.</hi> The angels carrie our prayers unto God, and the court of heaven is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3220:74"/>
open to receive our prayers. God of his mercie doth give unto us the affect of prayer; because he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto us the spirit of grace and prayer: He giveth unto us also the effect of prayer; because he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes heare our prayers, if not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our will, yet according to that which is most profitable for us. The holy Ghost came <hi>when they were all met together with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the same place.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2.1.</note> For he is the Spirit of love and concord that joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us unto Christ by faith, unto God by love, and unto our neighbour by charitie. The devil is the authour of discord and separation: by our sinnes he separates us from God; by hatred, contention, and brawling, he sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates men one from another: But the holy Ghost as in Christ he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the divine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by his wonderfull <hi>overshadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 1.35.</note> So doth he by his gifts poured upon us, conjoyn men with God, and God with men. As long as the holy Ghost remaineth in man by his grace and gifts, so long doth man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main united to God. As soon as man
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3220:75"/>
by sinne falleth from faith and love, and shaketh off the holy Ghost, he is separated from God, and is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that most blessed union. He that hath the holy Ghost hateth not his brother. Why? Because by the Spirit he is made partaker of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall bodie of Christ, whose mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers all the godly are:<note place="margin">Eph. 5.29.</note> And <hi>who ever hated his own members</hi>? Yea more, He that is governed by the Spirit of the Lord, loveth even his enemies. Why?<note place="margin">1.

                     <hi>And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing which he hath made:</hi> He that hath the Spirit of God is readie to be servant unto all, he to his power doeth good unto all, he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for all to make use of, because God is the fountain of all mercie and grace to all. Now the Spirit of God effects in man such motions as he himself is: As the soul gives unto the body life, sense, and motion: So the Spirit makes man spirituall, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons his minde with divine saltnesse, and directs all his members to the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3220:75"/>
performance of all duties towards God, and towards his neighbour. From heaven came that sound which was the signe of the coming of the holy Ghost: Because the holy Ghost is of an heavenly nature, to wit, of the same nature with the Father and the Sonne; from whom, that is, the Father and the Sonne, he proceedeth from all eternitie. Moreover, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men to think upon heavenly things, and to seek those things which are above. He which cleaveth unto earthly things, and is by his love united unto the world, is not yet made partaker of the heavenly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. He came in the type of breath:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ambrose.</hi>
                     </note> Because he affordeth unto the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted quickning consolation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we live according to the flesh by the reciprocall breathing out and sucking in of the aeriall spirit. He came under the type of spirit and breath: For he giveth unto us, To live according to our better part. <hi>The winde bloweth where it listeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and thou hearest the sound thereof, but thou knowest not whence it comes, or whither it goes: So is every one that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3220:76"/>
is begotten of the Spirit.</hi> And it was meet that he should come in the type of breath: Because he proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne by one breathing from eternitie. It was a powerfull breath: Because the grace of the holy Ghost comes with power. The holy Ghost moveth the godly, in whom he dwelleth, to all that is good; and so moveth them, that they regard neither the threats of tyrants, nor the treacheries of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, nor the hatred of the world: He conferreth upon the apostles the gift of tongues:<note place="margin">Psal. 19.24.</note> Because <hi>their sound was to go into all lands:</hi> And so the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of tongues</hi> (which was the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of pride and rashnesse in the building of the tower of Babel) was taken away;<note place="margin">Gen. 11.7·</note> and the dispersed nations, by the gift of the holy Ghost, through diverse tongues were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together into the unitie of faith. It was meet that he should come in the figure of tongues: Because the <hi>holy men of God did speak as they were inspired by him</hi>;<note place="margin">2.

of the ministers of the church. For these so great gifts blessed and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the holy Ghost together with the Father and the Sonne for ever and ever!</p>

                  <p>IT is an exceeding great benefit of God towards us,<note place="margin">

                     </note> in that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to conferre with him fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly by pious prayer: He bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon us the gift of prayer, and the fruit of prayer. Great is the force of prayer which is poured forth on earth, but hath its operation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The prayer of the righteous is the key of heaven: Prayer ascendeth, and deliverance descendeth from God: Prayer is a saving buckler, by which we repell all our adversaries darts.<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.16. Exod. 17.11. <hi>Ambrose.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>When Moses stretched forth his hands, Israel prevailed against the Amalekites:</hi> If thou stretchest forth thy hands towards heaven, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan shall not prevail against thee. As the enemie is kept off by the wall:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hierome</hi> upon Ezek.</note> So the anger of God is repelled by the prayers of the saints. Our Saviour himself prayed, not that he had any
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3220:85"/>
need, but to commend unto us the dignitie thereof. Prayer is the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of our subjection: Because God hath commanded that we should every day offer unto him our prayers, as a spirituall tribute. It is the ladder of our ascension unto God: For pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is nothing else but the souls travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling unto God.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nazian.</hi>
                     </note> It is the buckler of our defence: For the soul of him that continueth in prayer, is secure and safe from the assaults of the devil. It is our faithfull messenger unto God:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bernard.</hi>
                     </note> For it goeth up unto his throne, and solicits him to aid us. This messenger never returns in vain: For God alwayes heares our prayers, if not according to our will, yet to our profit and salvation. We may assuredly hope for one of these two: Either he will give us that we ask, or else that which he knoweth to be more profitable for us. God gave his own Sonne that most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gift, being not intreated: What will he do then if he be intreated? We cannot doubt of the Fathers hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,<note place="margin">Num. 7.89.</note> or the Sonnes interceding: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions thou mayest with

                     </note> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for thee with one eye to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold heaven and earth: So it cannot be that with one and the same will a man should love himself inordinately, &amp; love God also. Love is the chiefest good of our soul: Therefore we must give the chief good of our soul to the chiefest good, that is, to God. Thy love is thy God, that is, whatsoever thou lovest chiefly thou settest in the place of God: But God is truly the chief being. Whosoever therefore lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himself, judgeth himself to be

Whatsoever thou lovest chiefly, thou makest it to be the end of all other things, and thou judgest it to be the last complement of all thy desires: But it is God onely who is the <hi>beginning and the end</hi> of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.8.</note> he is the first and the last, he onely filleth the desire of our hearts, and there is no created thing that can satisfie thy desires: Therefore thou must preferre the love of God before the love of thy self. God is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the end: In him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must our love begin, and in him also must it end. The essence of God is without all the creatures, as God was in himself from all eternitie: So withdraw thou thy love from all the creatures. Such as thy love is, such are thy works: If thy works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from true faith and love of God; they are acceptable unto God, and appear great in his eyes, though in the eyes of all men they seem but small: If they proceed from self-love, they cannot please God. Self-love defileth the most excellent works.

When Christ was in the house of <hi>Simon</hi> a certain <hi>woman</hi> broke a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of <hi>precious ointment,</hi>

                     <hi>and anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the head of Christ:</hi> The work seemed to be small, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it was acceptable unto Christ; because it proceeded from true faith, pure love and serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. Sacrifice in the old Testament was a work acceptable unto God; and yet God was not well pleased that <hi>Saul</hi> set apart the spoils of the Amalekites to offer sacrifice unto God. Why?<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.15.</note> Because this did not proceed from the love of God: For if he had loved God truly, he would not have contemned the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God about the burning of all the spoils: He loved himself, and his own devotion. Love is a kinde of fire: For so the Church prayeth; Come, O holy Ghost, and kindle in the faithfull the fire of thy love. Fire doth not cleave fast unto the earth, but alwayes tends upwards: So thy love must not rest in thee, but it must be lifted up unto the Lord. Again, to denie ones self, is to renounce his own honour: Unto the chief good
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3220:107"/>
alone is due the chiefest honour: And God is the chiefest good. He that seeketh his own glory, cannot seek Gods glory, as our Saviour said unto the Pharisees,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.44.</note> 
                     <hi>How can ye beleeve, which receive honour one of another</hi>? Behold the example of Christ, and follow it: He often witnesseth of himself, that he seeks not his own glory,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.41.</note> that he <hi>receiveth not honour from men,</hi> and that he is humble in heart.<note place="margin">Mat. 11.29.</note> All thy gifts thou receivest from God: Therefore render them again unto God. The rivers of all goods do flow from this fountain of Gods goodnesse: Therefore let them all flow back again into the sea. The herb which is called Tornsol, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liotropium, doth alwayes turn it self unto the sunne, by vertue whereof it draws its life and nourishment: So do thou with all thy gifts and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour turn thy self towards God, and attribute nothing unto thy self. If thou hast any thing of thine own, thou mayest seek thine own honour, and attribute thy gifts unto thy self: But seeing that thou hast nothing of thine own, but all from God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3220:107"/>
thou must seek, not thine own honour, but the honour of God. The seeking his own honour doth turn a man away from God: We have an example in <hi>Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> who said,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.30</note>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Thy soul can nothing satiate</l>
                     <l>But God who did thy soul create.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>IN the transitorie things of this world the soul often seeks for rest, but findes it not: Why? Because the soul is more worthy then all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore she cannot finde peace &amp; quietnesse in them as being more vile. All worldly things are flitting and transitorie; but the soul is immortall: How should she then finde true rest in them? All those are terrestriall, but our soul hath a celestiall originall: How should she then satiate and fulfill her desire in them? In Christ she <hi>findes rest,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11.29</note> he can satisfie and fulfill her desire. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wrath of God she rests in the wounds of Christ: Against the accusations of Satan she rests in the power of Christ: Against the terrour of the law she rests in the gospel of Christ: Against the sinnes which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3220:109"/>
her she rests in the <hi>bloud of Christ which speaketh better things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.24.</note> before God, <hi>then the bloud of Abel:</hi> Against the terrour of death she rests with confidence in the session of Christ at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And thus our faith findeth rest in Christ, and our love findeth great rest also. He that by his love cleaveth unto earthly things, hath no true rest; because earthly things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have it not in them: They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fully satiate the souls appetite; because they are all finite: But our soul being created after the image of God, doth desire that infinite good in which is all good. As therefore our faith ought not to relie upon any of the creatures, but upon the merit of Christ onely: So also our love should not be settled upon any of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor upon our selves. For self-love hindereth the love of God: We must preferre the love of God before all. Our soul is the spouse of Christ: To him alone therefore must she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here. Our soul <hi>is the temple of God:</hi> Therefore she must give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to none but him.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.16.</note> Many seek
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3220:109"/>
for rest in riches: But without Christ there is no rest to the soul.<note place="margin">Mat. 8.20.</note> Where Christ is, there is povertie, if not in act, yet in affect. He being the Lord of heaven and earth, had not where to rest his head: And so would he commend and sanctifie povertie unto us. Riches are without us: But that which will quiet the soul must be within. To what shall our soul cleave unto at death, when we must leave all worldly things? Either our riches forsake us, or we them: often in our life, but alwayes at our death. Where then shall our soul finde peace and rest? Many seek for rest in pleasures: But pleasures can bring no rest or delight unto the soul; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may unto the body, for a time: At length grief and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row follow as companions. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures belong unto this life: But the soul was not created for this life, because she is by death compelled to depart. How then should she finde rest in pleasures? Without Christ there is no rest to the soul: But what was the life of Christ? Extreme grief from
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3220:110"/>
the first moment of his nativitie, even unto his death. By this means he the true prizer of things would teach us what to think concerning pleasure. Many seek for rest in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: But miserable are they that at every change of popular breath are compelled to want their rest. Honour is without, and a flitting good: But that which will give rest unto the soul must be within.<note place="margin">

Consider the corner wherein thou keepest: What is the proportion thereof to a whole province, to all Europe, and to all the habitable world? That is true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour indeed which God shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after give unto the elect. The rest of a thing is in its end: neither doth a thing rest naturally, untill it hath attained to its end and place. God is the end whereunto the soul was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: For it was made after the image of God. Therefore it cannot be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and at rest but in its end, that is, in God. As the soul is the life of the body:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Austine.</hi>
                     </note> So is God the life of the soul.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3220:110"/>
As therefore that soul doth truly live in which God dwelleth by spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace: So likewise that soul is dead, which hath not God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in it. And what rest can there be to the soul that is dead? That first death in sinne doth necessarily draw with it the <hi>second death</hi> of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Rev. 20.15.</note> Whosoever therefore doth firmly cleave unto God with his love, and inwardly enjoyeth divine consolation, his rest can no outward things disquiet. In the midst of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, he is joyfull; in povertie, rich; in the tribulations of this world, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; in troubles, quiet; in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches and contumelies of men, still; and in death it self, living. He regards not the threats of tyrants: Because he feels within, the riches of divine consolation. In adversitie, he is not made sorrowfull: Because the holy Spirit within, doth comfort him effectually. In povertie, he is not vexed: Because he is rich in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God. The reproches of men do not trouble him: Because he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth the delights of divine honour. He regards not the pleasure of the

He gapeth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter earthly treasures: Because his chief treasure is hidden in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. He feareth not death: Because in God he alwayes liveth. He doth not much desire the wisdome of the world: Because he hath the Spirit within to be his teacher. That which is perfect taketh away that which is imperfect.

He is not drawn away by the allurements of the world: Because he heares with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him the voice of Christ which is sweeter. He fears not the power of the devil: Because he feels Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.

                  <p>IN every thing thou takest in hand have a great care of thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If the devil incites thee to any sinne, stand in fear of the inward check of thy conscience. If thou art afraid to sinne in the presence of men, let thine own conscience much more deterre thee from sinne. The inward testimonie is of more efficacy then the outward: Therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

thy sinnes could escape the accusations of all men, yet they can never escape the inward witnesse of thy conscience. Thy conscience shall be in the number of those <hi>books,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 20.12.</note> that shall be <hi>opened</hi> at the judgement to come, as is testified in the Revelation. The first is the book of Gods om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience; in which the thoughts, words, and deeds of all men shall manifestly appeare. The second book is Christ,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.8.</note> which is <hi>the book of life</hi>; in this book whosoever shall be found written by true faith, shall be carried by the angels into the court of heaven. The third is the book of the Scripture, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script rule whereof our faith and good works shall be judged: <hi>The word that I have spoken,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 12.48.</note> saith our Saviour, <hi>shall judge them at the last day.</hi> The fourth book containeth in it the testimonies of the poore, which in the day of judgement shall <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us into an everlasting habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3220:114"/>
salvation, so much let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our conscience. For if a good conscience be lost, faith is lost; and if faith be lost, the grace of God is lost; and if the grace of God be lost, how can we hope for everlasting life? As the testimony of thy conscience is, such judgement mayest thou expect from Christ. Sinners shall become their own accusers, though none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them, or bring ought against them.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chrysost.</hi>

There are three judgements; The judgement of the world, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy self, and the judgement of God: And as thou canst not escape the judgement of God: So neither canst thou escape the judgement of thy self; although sometimes thou
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3220:114"/>
mayest escape the judgement of the world. No walls can hinder this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse from seeing all thy actions: What excuse can save thee, when thy conscience within doth accuse thee? The peace of conscience is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of everlasting life. Thou mayest more truely and heartily rejoyce in the midst of troubles, having a good conscience, then thou canst in the midst of thy delights, having an evil conscience. Against the backbiting of all that bear thee ill will, thou mayest confidently oppose the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and excuse of thy conscience. Enquire of thy self concerning thy self;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bernard.</hi>
                     </note> because thou knowest thy self farre better then any other man doth. At the last judgement what will the false praises of others profit thee, or the backbitings of others without a cause, hurt thee? By Gods and thine own judgement shalt thou either stand or fall: Thou shalt not stand or fall by the testimonie of others. The conscience is immortall, as the soul is immortall: And the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of hell shall torment the damned as long as the accusation of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3220:115"/>
conscience shall endure. No exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fire doth so afflict the bodie, as this inward fire doth inflame the conscience. The soul which is burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is eternall; and the fire of the conscience is eternall. No outward scourges are so grievous unto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as these inward whips of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are unto the soul. Avoid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the guilt of sinne; that so thou mayest avoid the torment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. By true repentance blot thy sinnes out of the book of thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that they may not be read at the judgement, and that thou mayest not be afraid of the voice of Gods sentence. Mortifie the worm of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science by the heat of devotion; that it do not bite thee, and so beget eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall horrour. Extinguish this inward fire by thy teares; that so thou mayest attain to the joyes of an heavenly cooler. Grant, O Lord, that we may <hi>fight the good fight,</hi>

Christian without faith; and no faith without charitie. Where there is not the brightnesse of charitie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there the heat of faith: Take away light from the sunne, and thou mayst take away charitie from faith. Charitie is the outward act of the inward life of a Christian man.<note place="margin">Jam. 2.26.</note> 
                     <hi>The bodie is dead without the spirit</hi>; and <hi>faith is dead without charitie.</hi> He is not of Christ, that hath not the Spirit of Christ; &amp; he hath not the Spirit of Christ, that hath not the gift of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.

is not sufficient, unlesse there be also outward contribution: Neither is outward contribution sufficient, unlesse there be also inward compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Faith receiveth all from God, and charitie giveth it again unto our neighbour. By faith we are made partakers of the divine nature: But <hi>God is love.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Joh. 4.8</note> Therefore where cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie sheweth not it self without, let no man beleeve that there is faith within. No man beleeveth in Christ, which loveth not Christ: And no man loveth Christ, unlesse he love his neighbour. He doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the benefit of Christ with true confidence of heart, whosoever doth denie unto his neighbour the office which he oweth unto him. That is not truely a good work which proceedeth not from faith:<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> Neither is it truely a good work which proceedeth not from charitie.

                     </note> It is no good fruit which springeth not forth from the root of charitie: For charity is the spirituall tast of the soul: For unto it alone is every good thing sweet, every hard thing sweet,

all adversitie sweet, and all pain and trouble sweet; yea more, the taste of charitie maketh even death it self most sweet:<note place="margin">Cant. 8.6.</note> 
                     <hi>For love is strong as death,</hi> yea stronger then death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause love brought Christ to die for us: And love doth so stirre up the true godly, that they doubt not to die for Christ. All the works of God proceed from love, yea punishments themselves: So let all the works of a Christian man proceed from love. In all the creatures God hath set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the glasse of love. The sunne and the starres shine not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but to us: The herbs purge not themselves, but us: Aire, water, beasts, and all creatures serve man: Do thou also give thy self wholly to serve thy neighbour. <hi>Tongues</hi> profit not without <hi>char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For such faith is the faith of working miracles, and not of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Charitie is better then the gift of doing miracles: Because that is the undoubted mark of true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but this is sometimes granted to the wicked. It profits not to give all that one hath unto the poore, if there be not charitie: For the outward action is done in hypocrisie, if there be not inward love. Rivers of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty profit not, unlesse they spring from the fountain of charitie. <hi>Charitie is patient:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4</note> For no man is easily angry with him that he loveth truly. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is bountifull:</hi>

God commanded two altars to be built in the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and fire was carried from the outward to the inward: God hath congregated a twofold Church, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant and a triumphant: The fire of love shall at length be translated from the militant to the triumphant. Think upon these things, O devout soul, and study after holy love: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thy neighbour be, yet he is one for whom Christ vouchsafed to die: Why then dost thou deny to shew thy charitie to thy neighbour, when as Christ did not stick to lay down his life for him?<note place="margin">

The crosse begets in us an hate of worldly things, and lifts up our minde unto heavenly things. When the flesh is mortified, the spirit is quickened; and when the world waxeth bitter, Christ becometh sweet unto us. Great is the mysterie of the crosse, for by it God calls us to contrition, to true fear, and to the exercise of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Let us open to him when he knocketh, and we shall heare what the Lord will say within us. The sight of the crosse is contemptible in the sight of the world, and in the carnall eyes of the outward man: But it is glorious in the sight of God, and in the spirituall eyes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. What was reputed by the Jews more base and vile then the passion of Christ? And what was

more glorious and precious in the sight of God? For it was the price paid <hi>for the sinnes of the whole world:</hi>

We shall never fully and perfectly feel the consolation of the spirit, unlesse our flesh be afflicted without. If the love of the world dwelleth in us, the love of God cannot enter in. A full vessel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be filled with new liquour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the first be emptied. Let us therefore poure out the love of the world, that we may be filled with the love of God. Therefore God by the crosse doth extinguish in us the love of the world, that there may be

                     <hi>which alwayes speaketh loud</hi> before the throne of God: Sure indeed, because it is signed with the sure seals of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:3220:145"/>
If I had apprehended and laid hold upon Christ of mine own free will, I might yet fear, lest my will should change, and so I should loose Christ: But he that was found of him that sought him not, will not assuredly withdraw himself again after he is once found.

                     </gap> death every houre: Because it waits for thee every houre. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when thou risest, O man, think that it is thy last day: And in the evening when thou goest to bed, think that it is thy last night upon earth. Whatsoever thou doest, whatsoever thou goest about, look about thee, and consider with thy self first, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wouldest do such things or no, if thou shouldest die that houre, and so go to Gods judgement: What! Dost thou think that death doth not approch, because thou thinkest not of it? or dost thou think that it draweth nearer, because thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est upon it? whether thou thinkest upon it or no, whether thou speakest of it or no, it hangs alwayes over thy head. Life was lent unto thee,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3220:146"/>
not given as a free-hold. Upon this condition thou didst enter in, that thou shouldest go out:<note place="margin">Job 1.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Naked thou camest, and naked thou must go.</hi> This life is a pilgrimage: when thou hast travelled a good while, then thou must return home again. Thou art but a farmer and tenant in this world, and not a perpetuall lord: Every houre think with thy self whither thou hastenest every moment. In this we are deceived, in that we think we die then, when we breathe out our last: Every day, every houre, every moment we die: Whatsoever is added unto our life is taken from it, and as it increaseth it also decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth: we fall not into death suddenly, but walk into it step after step. This life of ours is a way, and every day we must ridde some of it: Life and death seem to be most distant, but they are as neare as neare can be: For one passeth away, and the other cometh on. As it is with those that travel by sea, they oftentimes come to the haven, and yet they neither feel, nor so much as think whither they are carried: So likewise it is
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3220:147"/>
with us: whatsoever we do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we eat, drink, or sleep, we draw nearer alwayes to our death. Many have passed away their life, even in the time whiles they were seeking after things belonging to the susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this life. No man enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains death joyfully, unlesse he hath long before prepared himself for it. In this life die daily unto thy self; that so in death thou mayst live unto God. Before thou diest, let thy sinnes die in thee: In thy life time let the old <hi>Adam</hi> die in thee: So at thy death Christ shall live in thee. In thy life time let the <hi>outward man</hi> daily <hi>decay,</hi> that at thy death <hi>the inward man</hi> may be <hi>renewed</hi> in thee.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.16.</note> Death translateth thee from time to eternitie: for <hi>as the tree falls, so it lies:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles 11.3.</note> How carefully then ought we to think upon the houre of death! Time passeth away, but the infinite space of eternitie remains behinde: In time therefore make thy self rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for eternitie. What we shall be for ever, whether blessed or misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it shall be decreed at the houre of death: In that one moment, is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3220:147"/>
eternall felicitie either enjoyed or lost. Wherefore, O faithfull soul, how solicitous and carefull oughtest thou to be in preparing thy self for that houre! Thou wilt easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn all worldly things, if thou considerest with thy self that thou must die: Consider that thine eyes shall be darkened in death; and thou wilt easily <hi>turn away thine eyes from beholding vanitie:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 119.37.</note> Consider that thy eares shall wax deaf at thy death; and it shall be easie for thee to stop thy eares against impious and filthy speeches: Consider that thy tongue shall be tied at thy death; and thou wilt have more regard unto thy words: Set before thine eyes the cold sweat and anxietie of those that are ready to die; and thou wilt easily contemn all worldly delights: Look upon the nakednesse of them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this world; and povertie in this life will not seem grievous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: Consider the trembling of the whole bodie at the point of death; and thou wilt easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the splendour of the world: Consider the mourning of the soul
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3220:148"/>
being compelled to go out of the house of the bodie; and thou wilt easily beware of the guilt of all sinne: Consider the corruption that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after death; and thou wilt easily bring down thy proud flesh: Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how naked thou art left at thy death, being forsaken of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and thou wilt easily turn away thy love from them, and turn it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Creatour: Consider how narrowly death looks to thee, that thou carrie away nothing with thee at thy death; and thou wilt easily contemn all the riches of the world: He that in this life dieth daily through his sinnes, doth passe from death temporall unto the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death eternall. No man is translated unto everlasting life, but he that begins here to live in Christ. That in death therefore thou mayest live, be ingrafted into Christ by faith: Let death be alwayes in thy thoughts; because it is to be expected alwayes.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Death is gain:</hi> It is gain to have escaped the increase of sinne; it is gain to have left the things that are worse, and to have passed to the better. Although those whom by death thou hast lost were very deare unto thee: yet let God be more deare unto thee, whose will it was to take them unto himself. Be not angry with the Lord for taking away what he hath given: He hath received his own, he hath taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from thee. Do not take it ill that the Lord doth require what he did onely lend thee: It is onely the Lord that foreseeth evils to come: It was his providence therefore to take away thy friends that they might

Therefore think not onely upon the time of thy friends forsaking thee, that is, at their death; but think also upon the time when they shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored again unto thee, that is, at the resurrection.

By the power of God the light of the fire shall be separated from the burning qualitie; the light shall serve for the joy of the saints, and the burning qualitie for the torment of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It shall shine to the damned, but not as an object of comfort, that they may see it and rejoyce: But to the increasing of their miserie, that they may see and grieve the more. The sight shall be deprived of the light of the sunne, moon, and all the starres, as also of the sight of Christ and all the saints: And it shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with weeping, smoak, and the sight of the devils and all the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The eares shall heare schreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, and frequent blasphemies of the damned, and the horrible roaring of the devils The taste shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with hunger and thirst, and shall be deprived of all the pleasure of meat and drink.

So great shall the pain and torment be in the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that their minde can think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing but that whereunto the force of pain driveth them.

                     </gap>t there should be no end of the punishment of the damned; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as long as they could, they would make no end of sinning. The damned sinned in their eternitie, that is, as long as they lived: Therefore it is just that they should be punished in Gods eternitie. Their sinne had an end, because their life had an end: But they would have made no end of sinning, but that they were forced to make end of living, that so they might have sinned without end. The matter of hell-fire is eternall, that is, the stain of sinne: And therefore meet it is that the punishment should be eternall. The filthinesse of the sinnes of the damned can never be removed out of the sight of God: How then can the greatnesse of punishments appointed for sinne be removed? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, sinne is an infinite evil; because it is committed against an infinite

                  <p>CHrists resurrection profits thee nothing, unlesse Christ also rise in thee. As Christ must be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, born, and live in thee: So also must he rise in thee. Before resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction goes death, because none riseth again but he that is fallen: And so it fares in this spirituall resurrection.

The newnesse of the spirit will not come forth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the oldnesse of the flesh be first hidden. It is not enough for thee, to have Christ once risen in thee: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the old <hi>Adam</hi> cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in one moment. The old <hi>Adam</hi> will revive in thee daily: And thou must daily mortifie him, that Christ may begin to live in thee daily. Christ ascended not into heaven, neither entred he into his glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he rose from death: So neither canst thou enter into celestiall glory, unlesse Christ first rise in thee and live in thee. He is not a member of the mysticall bodie of Christ, in whom Christ liveth not: Neither shall he be brought by Christ into the Church triumphant, who hath not been a member of his bodie in the Church militant. Betrothing goes before matrimonie: And that soul shall not be brought in unto the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the heavenly Lambe, which is not in this life <hi>betrothed</hi> to Christ by faith,<note place="margin">Hos. 2.19. 2.

                     <hi>for he died for our sinnes, and rose again for our justification:</hi> So he also, in whom Christ is spiritually risen, is justified from his sinnes. For how can sinne have place there, where the perfect righteousnesse of Christ liveth and flourisheth? Now this righteousnesse of Christ is applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by faith. Christ rising from the dead, got the victory over Satan: for in his descent to hell, he destroyed his kingdome, spoiled his palace, and broke his weapons in pieces: And so also in whomsoever Christ is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually risen, against him shall not Satan prevail: for how can he be overcome of Satan, in whom Christ liveth who overcame Satan? At Christs resurrection <hi>there was a great earthquake</hi>:<note place="margin">Mat. 28.2.</note> So the spirituall resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection with Christ is not without the earnest commotion and contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart.

                     <head>PRAYER XIIII. He renders thanks to God, for preserving us from sundry evils.</head>
                     <p>TO thee (O eternall and mercifull God) I render eternall thanks, for that thou hast hitherto preserved me from infinite evils and dangers, and hast kept me safe by the guard of thy holy angels. Thy privative blessings, by which thou dost keep me from evil, are more in number then thy positive, by which thou dost conferre good upon me. As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evils of soul and bodie as I see in others; so many tokens do I see of thy mercie toward me: For my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from those evils is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed as due onely to thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. How great is the power of the devil! How great is his subtiltie! As often therefore as that malignant and most subtile spirit, and our most potent adversarie doth labour to do us any mischief; so often by the buckler of thy benignity, and by the guard of thy holy angels being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, I have been able to escape his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3220:214"/>
nets. But who can reckon up the treacherous assaults and invasions of the devil? Who can therefore reckon up the riches of thy bounty? When I sleep by night, the eye of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence doth watch over me, that the infernall enemy which goeth about like a roaring lion, may not be able by his strength and subtilty to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse me. When by day Satan by his tentations doth set upon me, the strength of thy right hand doth most bountifully comfort and strengthen me, that the deceitfull tempter may not allure me into his snares. When an innumerable host of evils hangs over my head, thy blessed angels encamp about me like a fiery wall.<note place="margin">Psal. 34.7. Zech. 2.5.</note> There is no creature so vile, so weak, and so little, of which I do not stand in danger many wayes. How great and immense a benefit is it therefore, that thy providence doth preserve me safe from them!

How great is thy goodnesse, that to me poore miserable man, and a sinner, having had so often experience of thy mercy, thou hast given boldnesse to hope even after heavenly things, and to conceive an assured hope of habitation in the everlasting mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy heavenly house!

That promise of life comes of thy meer free-will: And therefore it depends not upon the merit of my works. I am by faith as surely ascertained of the benefits promised of thy grace, as I am assured by the sight of mine eyes of those which I already have. Thou feedest me with the bodie and bloud of thy Sonne.

If thou bestowest upon me such great things in the poore cottage of this world: How much greater wilt thou bestow in the palace of the heavenly paradise! Whatsoever thing to be hoped for thou hast promised, is as certain unto me, as all those things, which thou hast given me for my use in this world.

                  <p>We confesse, Almighty Creatour, that thou madest us at the first after thine own image, thou clothedst us with innocencie as with a garment,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3220:257"/>
thou seatedst us in paradise a place of all delight and pleasure: But we have defaced thine image, we have cast off our first covering, we have thrust our selves out of that pleasant place. We ran away from thee, and were not obedient unto thy voice: We were lost and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before we came into this world: Our first parents sinned against thee, and we sinned in them: They were corrupted, and we are inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their corruption: They were the parents of disobedience, and we are by nature the children of wrath: Sinfull and unhappie children of sinfull and unhappie parents! Thou mightest in thy displeasure after their fall have plunged them into the bottomlesse pit, and made them the fewel of hell, and sent their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie after them: And neither they nor we could justly have complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Righteous, O Lord, art thou in thy judgements: And our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie is from our selves. But great was thy mercie unto us. We came into this world in a floud of uncleannesse, wallowing in our

mothers bloud; and thou didst set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a fountain for us to wash in: We were washed in the laver of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme; and we have returned with the swine to our wallowing in the mire. We came from a place of darknesse into this world, we lived as children of darknesse, we sat in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and in the shadow of death: Thou gavest us thy word to be a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern unto our feet, and a light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our paths, that in thy light we might see light; that so walking in the way of truth, we might attain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting life: But we have loved darknesse more then light, and have not been obedient unto thy word. We came into this world crooked even from our mothers wombe; and thou gavest us thy law to be a glasse wherein we might see our deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a rule whereby to square all our actions, words, and thoughts: But we have shut our eyes that we might not see, and we have refused to be ruled by thy law: The law of sinne in our flesh doth daily captivate us. The root of originall sinne which lieth hidden in us, doth every day

What couldest thou, O Lord, have done more for us, or what could we have done more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee? Thou didst send thy Sonne in the fulnesse of time to take our nature upon him, to fulfill thy law for us, and to be crucified for our sinnes: We have not followed the example of his holy life, but have every day afresh crucified him by our sinnes.

Pardon the sinfull course of our life past, and guide us by thy holy Spirit for the time to come: Amend what is amisse, increase all gifts and graces which thou hast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given, and give unto us what thou best knowest to be wanting.
