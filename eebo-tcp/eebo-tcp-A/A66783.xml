         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

JOHN BRADSHAVV Eſqu.
LORD PRESIDENT
OF THE
Councell of STATE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe <hi>Parliament</hi> having lately graciouſly conſidered
my humble Suit and long patience? (and I, by the
refreſhment thereby obtained, getting ſome leiſure
to entertain my naturall <hi>Genius</hi>) an earneſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
immediately poſſeſt me to perform ſomwhat,
which might ſhew me thankful to God, and to thoſe friends,
by whoſe <hi>Mercy,</hi> I and my Family have been preſerved, from
periſhing under our late <hi>Preſſures;</hi> and he who wrought that
Deſire in me, offered therewith to my thought, an <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking</hi>
ſutable to my inclination; with hope, that he would
inable to the perfecting thereof in due ſeaſon, though inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
will be many, and the time, whereto I muſt confine
my ſelf, very ſhort.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> hath enacted a <hi>publique Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi>
throughout this <hi>Common wealth,</hi> on the thirtieth of
this <hi>January</hi> (being the laſt day of the late <hi>Kings</hi> life, as
alſo the firſt of <hi>Englands</hi> reſuming her long loſt <hi>Liberty</hi>)
a Day, which may by good reaſon be made an everlaſting <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary,</hi>
in remembrance of that, and other great <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</hi>
And, therefore I thought it would neither be an
impertinent expreſſion of my Gratitude, nor unacceptable
where I owe it, to prepare proper <hi>Hymnes</hi> for that daies Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration,
with ſome other brief <hi>Commemoration,</hi> to keep
in mind GODS late Mercies to this <hi>Republique,</hi> when that
daies ſolemnity ſhall be forgotten; and thereupon compoſed
(among other aſſaies, yet unfiniſhed) the three following
<hi>Hymnes,</hi> which I thus communicate, before the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of what is further intended; in hope it may be a means
<pb facs="tcp:95643:3"/>
to prepare the hearts of ſome for a more due obſervation of
that Day, by giving them ſpace to conſider, how pertinent
they are to the duty then required; and that they may be
thereby in readineſſe for thoſe who ſhall be willing to make
uſe of ſuch helps to <hi>Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hymnes</hi> are ſo <hi>proper</hi> to <hi>publique acknowledgements</hi> of
extraordinary <hi>Deliverances,</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi> (ſpirituall, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall)
that by the Primitive <hi>Churches,</hi> Jewiſh and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
they were this way commemorated, and left upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
even to this day; as appears in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> by the <hi>Hymns,
Songs,</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> of <hi>Moſes, Deborah, Hannah, David,
Eſay, Hezekiah, Simeon, Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> with others.
The practiſe alſo of <hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi> in, and after the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> time, makes it evident, that they ſung <hi>Hymnes</hi> and
<hi>Songs</hi> upon the ſeverall occaſions, happening from time to
time. And though Scorners, and ignorant perſons do in this
Age viliſie, or contemn the gift of <hi>Poeſie;</hi> yet the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and moſt pious, among all <hi>Nations,</hi> have alwaies pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed,
and do ſtill approve the uſe of that Faculty, to rouze
up ſpirituall affections in the ſoul, toward the illuſtrating
of Gods Praiſes: and they who diſpiſe it, are diſpiſers of
that <hi>Gift,</hi> which God hath given for his own glory, with
our advantage: For, it is none of thoſe accompliſhments,
which may be acquired by meer human induſtry, (though it
may be much better'd thereby) but is one of Gods <hi>Peculiars,</hi>
and infuſed in the mothers womb, as is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by learned and underſtanding men, many of which
have long ſtudied for it in vain, by meer helps of Art.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe conſiderations, and by the example of many
<hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> (for in ſome other languages, one word
ſignifies both) who very well knew that advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
may be made by the right uſe of that <hi>Faculty,</hi> upon
ſuch occaſions of praiſe as have been vouchſafed to this
<hi>Nation;</hi> I have thereby ſought to illuſtrate Gods <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi>
with an aſſurance, that it ſhall prepare the hearts of
many, to a more cheerfull performance of what is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and help to charm down thoſe diſtempers which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the <hi>Common Peace,</hi> and hinder our reconcilement, both
to God, and to each other; and I hope it will not ſeem Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
in me to offer them to that uſe.</p>
            <p>For, though it be no rare thing to ſee many run on er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
before they are ſent; and to obtrude their undigeſted
<pb facs="tcp:95643:3"/>
Conceptions upon publique Auditories; yet private perſons,
qualified by their Education, Converſation, and Gifts, may
with modeſty and ſubmiſſion make tender of that which they
conceive edifying; yea, and ought, (as I think) ſo to do, their
conſciences perſwading it to be their duty: becauſe I find
it was a Liberty, Apoſtolically allowed, and taken for
private Chriſtians to communicate their ſeverall Gifts in
<hi>publique Congregations;</hi> and that he who brought a <hi>Hymn,</hi>
brought that which was acceptable, as appears in that place,
where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> preſcribes what Order is to be obſerved
at ſuch <hi>Meetings.</hi> According to that approved practiſe, I
offer the enſuing <hi>Hymnes,</hi> compoſed and fitted to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
of vulgar capacities; and yet (I hope) not ſo inartifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
compoſed, as to make them deſpiſed of the learned. I
have alſo out of ſuch tunes as the people are acquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
choſen thoſe which are beſt ſutable to the matter and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſitting the firſt <hi>Hymn</hi> to a ſtrain, beſeeming the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of Exultation: The ſecond, to higher ſtraines of
rejoycing, and the laſt to the fulneſſe of praiſefull
<hi>Thankſgivings;</hi> all which I humbly ſubmit to your grave
Cenſure.</p>
            <p>And I dedicate, and firſt ſend them to your Lordſhip, for
many good Reaſons. Firſt, by your approbation of their uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe,
I ſhall be the more comfortably confirmed in that
hope which I have thereof already. Secondly, your exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reſpect may make others perhaps take the more heed of
them; and by growing acquainted with them for your ſake,
reſpect them afterward for their own. Thirdly, you were
one of the moſt eminent perſonall inſtruments under God, of
that <hi>Juſtice</hi> upon which the many <hi>Mercies</hi> followed, which
are the ſubject of theſe <hi>Hymns;</hi> and I thought they would be
the more acceptable unto you, in regard no man had been in
greater danger, if God, by not appearing for us, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
our Adverſaries to prevail. Laſtly, an Obligation
lies upon me, to give you ſome viſible teſtimony of my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe
for benefits conferred.</p>
            <p>For, Sir, notwithſtanding it offends your modeſty, to hear
me make offers of acknowledgements, (though it be in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate)
yet I will now take the boldneſſe to tell it openly,
that, if God by his compaſſion, moving in the heart of your
Lordſhip, and one other Noble Friend, (whoſe modesty hath
likewiſe yet ſtopt my mouth) had not freely vouchſafed ſupplies
<pb facs="tcp:95643:4"/>
during my late ſtreights, I and my Family, (conſidering in
what hazzard all my other hopes then lay) had, in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
long ſince been quite ruined, or expoſed to moſt deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wants; as would be manifest, if the circumſtances of my
ſuffering ſhould be fully declared, and I ſhould not now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have had courage enough in me to have compoſed
theſe Hymnes, or to have ſung a joyfull ſong in the <hi>Land of
the Living, this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are, therefore, not ſo much mine, as yours, and his;
Take them therefore at your own, and with them my prayers,
that God would return your mercies a thouſand fold into
your boſomes, And make them comfortable unto you, both all
the daies of your lives, and at the hours of your death. I
have nothing elſe to retribute but Prayers, except it be by
adding ſo much to the honour of your <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> as
the ſingle teſtimony of an honest man (never aſperſed with
flattering) may confer: If that be any thing worth, I can
truly ſay, that I have ſeen you active in the moſt eminent
proſecution of human publiqke Juſtice under the <hi>Sun;</hi> and
that I am a witneſſe alſo of your extraordinary private mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
by being twice thereby delivered from probable deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Vpon contemplation whereof, I am warranted to aſſure
you from him who can make it good, that if you perſevere
(whereof I doubt not) in your heroicall progreſs, all the
power, threats, and miſchievous practiſes of your moſt inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and malicious Adverſaries, ſhal be but as fire and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls
co-operating with better Ingredients to make refined
Gold for your immortall Crown; and that their revilings,
ſnarlings, and detractions, ſhall make it more glorious then
Diamonds, Pearls, and Rubies, &amp; ſhine brighter many Ages
hence, then it can now. It ſhall queſtionleſſe be ſo; and
therefore if ought happen hereafter, that may ſeem bitter to
the fleſh in more then ordinary meaſure, or threaten any ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
event, be aſſured, they are but operations of that Fire
which is uſed in preparing the eſſentiall Materialls of your
expected Crown. He ſo preſageth, whoſe predictions you
have ſeen verified in more dubious matters; and he is
alſo unfainedly</p>
