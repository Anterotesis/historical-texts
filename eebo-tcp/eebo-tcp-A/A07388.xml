            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

also mooued by persuasion of certaine pylottes, and Masters of shippes, I determined to
translate this booke of the arte of Nauigation, compiled by Master Peter de Medina a spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarde,
in the yeere of our Lorde Iesus Christ. 1545. And because the worke is so prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalle
that in our time, the like in all respectes hath not beene sette forth in our tongue,
considering it instructeth, and teacheth all the whole arte of Nauigation in all pointes, and
is in as like sorte necessary for the Mariner, as the accidens is for the Gramarian, the
weapon for the soldier, the Toole for the workeman, the Guide for the blinde, the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

worlde, the Seas, the Windes, the Altitudes of the sunne, Moone, and Starres, are to
bee seene, and knowne, as farre as naturalle reason may extende to. And beesides, the
pleasure that I minded to doe, to the aforesaide persons, who mooued mee thereunto, as
also to satisfie my good and continual desire, which I haue, to helpe, and bringe to light
this good and profitable arte of Nauigation, whereby all men that are desirous to knowe,
the secreete of this noble arte, may profite themselues threewith by reading it in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe

fruite theer by, and that by little and little, these sciences shall remaine aswell in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

setting all other priuate busines aside I tooke in hande to translate this booke, being peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

And seeing I am desirous to bee of the number of those, I sought by what
meanes I might put it in effect, and for that my abilitie is not sufficient to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

greater seruice: I determined to make a booke of the Arte of Nauigation,
and to offer it in the seruice of your highnesse. Two thinges haue mooued
mee to this most mightie Lorde. The first is, to see howe great seruice your
highnesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> receiue by the Nauigation, at also howe great profite commeth thereby to all the common

               </gap>alth of Christendome. And this beeing so, it appeareth that by the Nauigation, your Royall Seno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is amplified and extented into so great parte of the worlde. And that whiche is newlye discouered is
more then fiue thousande leagues of the Sea coaste, where doeth containe so many regions, kingdomes, and
prouinces, where are founde so many nations and diuersitie of people, and many other thinges in suche sorte
by good reason it is called the newe worlde. So that by meanes of the Nauigation, there hath been brought
and is brought into your highnesse Countrye of Spaine, so many shippes laden with Golde and Siluer, that
the same thereof cannot bee accounted. As also such great quantitie of sweete Drugges, and other things
of great value and price: And this is litle in respect, right excellent Lorde, of the great number of people
whiche doe saile, not only to places knowne, but also to suche as are farre of, and vnknowne, and of such
at is no knowledge of, they procure by sailing to seeke and knowe, And seeing how long and dangerous wayes
they make by Sea, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The cause is, there are no instructors thereof, nor bookes whereby they may attaine to it, so that your
highnesse may vnderstande, although the Nauigation bee of such antiquitie, and more then three thousande
yeares <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it began, and a thing of such importance, that the life of man goeth therevpon. And who
can manifest the number of shippes and people, which only doe saile out of Spaine to all partes of the world,
or who can recken the multitude of people which doe consist only vpon the Nauigation, with their goodes,
riches, trades, merchandize, and other thinges: And for all this, there are no maisters whiche doe teache
this Arte, nor knowledge of an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that vnto this daye haue written the manner of sailing: Euen so, the

and iudgement, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f it happeneth many times in one shippe two or three Pilottes, the one saith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               </gap>eth, according to his reckoning,
the lande is farre of from him, and the cause thereof is, that there wanteth true knowledge of Nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and hereby it happeneth many times both shippes and people are loste, and others sustaine great dangers
and losses. All whiche beeing by mee considered, and chiefly seeing the Maiestie of the Emperour, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnto your highnesse, and our Lorde many tymes putteth his imperiall person vnto the danger of the
Sea. Wherefore I beeing desirous to serue your highnesse in this, and to doe good to suche as are Sailers,
by giuing them rules and aduises howe they may make their Nauigation certaine without hazarde of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
I haue framed and deuised an Arte of Nauigation so orderly, that the Pilottes and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whiche doe saile, shall finde them selues so able therewith, that of it selfe, or with verie litle helpe,
they shall knowe and verie plainly vnderstande that whiche they treate of, seeing it is so necessarie, and so
much standeth them vpon to knowe, as a thing whiche doeth importe to many their honours, liues, and

finding my selfe of small sufficiencie, I greatly disputed with my selfe, if for my small knowledge I should
holde my peace, seeing that I knewe it to bee ouermuche boldnesse to make a woorke and to directe it to
your highnesse, but animating my selfe, and trusting in your accustomed clemencie and magnanimitie, I
put my selfe vnder the shadowe of your fauour, and so most humbly beseeching you to receiue this my litle
seruice with that Royall curtesie that vnto others you are accustomed to doe. And beeing perused by
your highnesse, it maye winne so muche fauour whereby it maye passe safely through all

            <p>For the first, who is sufficient to speake of so great a misterie that a man with a compasse, and certaine strekes
marked in a carde, doth knowe howe to goe rounde about the world, and knoweth both by day and night whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he shall come, and from whence he shall depart, and howe much he shall go from one place to another, and
that he goe certainly in his right way, by so long and so large a thing as the sea is, where is no way no signe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
it is a misterie very difficult. And so it was considered by <hi>Salomon:</hi> who saith, that one of the hardest things
to be found, is the way of a ship in the sea, for she followeth not any way, nor leaueth any signe where she went,
And who is able to speake of so great a secret, that with a rounde instrument no greater then the palme of a mans
hande called <hi>Astrolabio,</hi> the roundnesse of the heauen is measured, being so great th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the vnderstanding of
man cannot atteine thereunto. And therewith is taken the heigth of the sunne, passing it by a very litle and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
place, being much greater then all the earth and the sea. And it is knowen howe nere and howe farre off it is
from vs: And in like manner the heigth of the starres are taken, and by this we are so certainely guided, that so
much as one point fayleth not. Likwise who can speak of the secrete &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inenes of the compasse, that being made
with as much paper as a mans hande, and with certaine streekes marked thereon, doth note the windes. And
with a litle iron put into it, is made an instrument that doth moue of it selfe, with onely the naturall vertue that
a stone hath giuen vnto it, and mouing without the helpe of any thing, sheweth where is the East, the West, the
North, and the South. And likwise the thirtie two windes which the Nauigation hath, and this is sheweth not
onely in one place but in all places, and it sheweth it so certainly that thereby they do it, and are certaine of their
purpose and pretence as many as are saylers in the sea. For the second, the certainetie of this art is so great, that
it seemeth the knowledge of one man not to bee sufficient to ordaine it, nor yet of many men, more then God
prouided a speciall grace and vnderstanding for that purpose, it is proued wherein it happeneth that a pilot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
sayling, and a storme taketh him three hundreth leages in the sea, and the day very cloudie, and the night so
darke that standing in the poope of the shippe, which is the hinder part, he seeth not the fore part of her, and
scantly the maste, and making many turnes in the seas, running from one part to another, rising and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending,
with a vehemencie of the windes and strength of the sea, and yet for all this, by the certainetie of the
arte, he knoweth the way that she hath gone, and the place where she is, and being come to the lande, shee
goeth to the port although it be in the night, not seeing the lande, likewise it happeneth many times, as the pilor
goeth sayling, he findeth a rocke or shoolde CC. leagues in the sea from any lande, and marketh the place where
he is, although he seeth not wherewith to marke it, for he seeth but the heauen and the water, and in it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing wherewithal to marke or make any signe, because al doth moue, but marketh it in his carde by the land,
he seeth in it and according to the art, which the carde hath, it is so certaine, that he and others both by day &amp;
night do knowe howe to preserue and keep them selues from that place going aside from it, because they would
receiue no hurt, although it be vnder the water, that nothing of it is seene, whereby is concluded that although
the other artes haue trueth, this hath more by reason of the demonstration so certaine, which sheweth to keepe
a man from hurt and danger that he seeth not. For the third, I say there is no art of any that man vseth, so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
nor so good as this art of Nauigation is, and this to be true it seemeth well, because by it we haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of diuerse and sundrie thinges in the worlde, and also of the trade with all partes of the worlde. And if
nauigation shoulde cease, men shoulde be driuen to liue straightly, for that they should lacke many things which
are necessarie for the life of man.</p>
            <p>Also here is to be noted, that amonge al artes which men doe vse and practise, none is of so great peril and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as the art of Nauigation, and chiefely in these dayes, seeing it is so greatly encreased and well neere the hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:6833:4"/>
roundnes of the worlde is sayled about: it is strange to consider that the auncient writers, neyther sawe it, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
thought of it, but rather helde it for vnpossible: it is worthie to be noted, that I haue seene many times a Pilote
come from the East India, who hath bene one yeere vpon the way, and from our Indias foure or fiue monethes,
passing such great daungers and troubles that many times they haue beene at the point of death, and being come
home to their naturall countrey, all hath beene so forgotten of them, as if it had past in adream, and so they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to returne with so geart good will, as though they went to a thing of pleasure. I thinke that couetousnesse
of goods is not the cause thereof, nor any other worldly gaine, but I take it to come of the will of God, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be a thing so naturall to feare death, and great labour, yet all these labours and feares which they passe
in the same Nauigation, are by them forgotten, for if they shoulde remember and feare them, there is none that
woulde sayle on the sea: And seeing the wise pilot that so often times putteth his life in hassarde; and not onely
his owne, but in his knowledge is put in trust the liues and goodes of many: wherefore if any person will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the arte of Nauigation, let him peruse this booke and arte, and studie therein, and he shall finde plainly
all things set forth necessarie for the same, whereby pleasing God he will graunt, to his way the ende which hee
desireth.</p>

which in astronomy did floorishe,

That vppon the nienth sphere
there is another tenth, whiche is the

prooue that there are tenne heauens
moueable by the moouinges of the

the first chapter of the sphere, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> late
Astronomers saw fixed stars in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to haue three moouings, whiche
were found in the eyght sphere, whiche
are these folowing one is the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable,
that is to say of the tenth sphere
which is the moouing of euery day, the
which in foure and twentie houres ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth
a reuolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> east to the west
and this is made vpon the two poles of
the worlde Articke and Antarticke.</p>
               <p>It hath another moouing of the
nienth sphere, and is called the
second moueable, for it is alwayes
according too the succession of the
signes from the Weste into the Easte, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
the moouing of the first moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
which moouing is made vppon
the poles of the Zodiacke, and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as King <hi>Don Alonso</hi> sayeth,
is called <hi>Auge</hi> of the fixed starres, the
third moouing is of him selfe, and is
called the moouing of tripidacion, or
according to the saying of the sayde
King the moouing of accesse and recesse
of the eyghte Sphere, and is made
vpon twoo little circles in the conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uety
of the nienth sphere, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>Aries and Libra</hi> equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in such sorte that as to euery
one of the heauens shoulde not bee
geuen more then one moouing of it
selfe, and the eyght heauen should haue
three moouings.</p>
               <p>Heereof it commeth that twoo of
them are vnproper to him but are
caused of other twoo superiour hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
that is to say of the nienth and
tenth, vpon these tenne heauens or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable
spheres wee put the eleuenth,
which according to the learned is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the imperiall heauen, that is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his great brightnes, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
continueth firme in one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of order, without any moouing,
and of this there are some reasons,
whereby wee are perswaded, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there are two thinges noted.</p>
               <p>The first is, that any manner of
thing that mooueth from a place
modueth his place eyther in all, or in
parte, so that whiche doeth mooue
mooueth into some place, forotherwise
it were immoueable, therefore any of
the moueable heauens mooueth place
eyther altogether in him selfe or his
partes, therefore he is in some place but
not in any inferiour sphere, for the
place must compasse about that which
is put into the place, therefore hee in a
superiour sphere. And it is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
that there bee some heauen sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
and greater, wherein it maye
mooue.</p>
               <p>The second reason, is that there
is put a difference in the heauen, that
is to saye, before and after, on the
ryght side and on the lefe, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of as muche as toucheth vs, but
for the nature of the thinges, So the
Philosopher sayeth in the seconde of
the heauen and the worlde, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee preserued by the moueable
spheres, the cause is that in the moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Spheres, the parte that nowe
is at the ryght side, shall bee at the left.
And the parte that is nowe aboue
shall bee vnderneath, as experience
sheweth, wherevppon it followeth,
that it is conuenient there bee a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
heauen, whiche in the behalfe
of the thing, is founde the difference
that is alleadged. This is the
imperiall heauen, as it is sayde,
whiche is higher then all other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.
It hath greate dignitie,
by reason of his brightnesse, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
establitie, and purenesse, heere
is the Celestiall Courte, where
they dwell that are of good fortune,
enioying of GOD, whereas the
Apostle sayeth, nor eye hath seene,
nor eare hath hearde, nor canne
enter into the hearte of man, that
whiche GOD hath made ready for
such as loue him.</p>

               <p>The long experience and obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and continually the one doth keep with

so the Philosopher vnderstandeth in

therefore I say that these Astronomers
vnderstood that in the eyght heauen
was onely the continual moouing, that
is from the East to the Wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d more but
one.</p>
               <p>There was other Astronomers,
that were not content to put only eight
sphers but they atteined to the nienth.
And the reason was because they sawe
the eyght heauen to haue two moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges
different, the one is as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd
from the East to the Weast, and
the other contrary to it: (that is to say)
from the West into the East, and
this motion is so slowe, that in A
hundred yeeres it is scarsely to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
               <p>This moouing <hi>Ptholomie</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in the seauenth of the Almagesto,
with most strong and certaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
so that these twoo different
moouinges beeing considered, they
came to the knoweledge, that the
eyght heauen was not the first mouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for the first mouable hath one only
moouing of himself most simple, the late
Astronomers by their large speculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
founde fyxed Starres whiche moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
sometimes from the Weast too
the North, And to the South, and
more swiftely to the Easte then too
the Weast, and at other times more
swiftely towardes the North then
too the South, The whiche De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
because with onely
twoo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> aforesayde it could
not bee determined, they put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thirde: moouing, and this is
one of him selfe whiche is made in
twoo small cyrcles in the heade of
<hi>Aries and Libra,</hi> So that as the
tyght Sphere hath three moouings, it
is not onely necessary to put the nienth,
but also the tenth: the reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
one simple body, ought to haue
but one only simple moouing, and
that is vntoo him proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
so sayeth the Philosopher in the
first of the heauen and the worlde,
if they haue any more moouinges,
they are improper to him.</p>
               <p>And seeing that the eyght hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
is a simple bodie, as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
vnderstandeth it in the same
place, it is conuenient that of these
three moouinges, one of them be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and naturall to him and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two improper. Likewise the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:6833:8"/>
that is not proper to him, vnto
another is proper and naturall. And
seeing that it is not an inferiour sphere,
it is conuenient to graunt, that vppon
the eyght heauen are other twoo moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges
of whome is caused these twoo
moouinges aforesayde, so that as the
Philosopher saith, the eight heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was
the fyrst moueable. It is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode,
that hee and the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of his time, beleeued that the
eyght heauen had onely the moouing
of euery day. And they came not too

speak perticularly of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and especially of that
which serueth for our purpose, of the
which I say it is manifest to our sight
that the heauens mooue, and it is to be
vnderstood, that a moouing is a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from one place to another, so that
all thinges which mooue passeth from
one place to another, or from one limet
to another, this moouing may be in one
of these three sortes, by meanes of a
circle or straight waye or from aboue
downward, and so contrary. The first
of those three, which is the moouing in
circle manner, mooueth not place accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to all his quantitie, but according
to his parts, as it appeareth in a whele
vnles it be al mooued from one place to
another y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they make it go rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, so they
mooue all his partes, such is the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the heauen, so that, whiche is
now in the east afterward shalbe in the
west, and although the heauen moueth
not place according to all the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which it hath, yet it is well mooued
which in it is mooued. And this hath
commonly been doubted, if the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable
of the heauens, were mooued by
one only moouer or by many: And if by
many howe manye there are, and in
what sort they mooue it. Of the which
it is to be noted that the heauens in the
first moueable are moued of one mouer,
and that they are not mooued of many,
for one only is sufficient, &amp; many would
be superfluous, so saith the Philosopher
or the first of his naturall phylosophie,
that it is better to put one beginning
then many, and a fewe rather then an
infinite number, therfore it is better to
put one onely moouer then manye
who maketh this first moueable: there
are diuerse opinions, one saieth
God alone, bringing therefore that
which <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith that the first moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ought to be of an infinite strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
seeing that God is of an infinite
strength and hath created al thinges of
a reasonable strength, it seemeth that
God onely is he that mooueth the first
moueable. Others there are that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
that the firste moouer is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
intellectiue whiche mooueth,
the whiche they prooue in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
If the first moouer were God
it would folow either that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouing of
heauen were done at one instance, or the
doings of God be measured with time.</p>
               <p>Therefore it cannot be sayde that the
heauen is mooued at one instant, seeing
that all Astronomers holdeth and the
sight sheweth it, that in foure and
twentie houers there is one reuolution
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>complished. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the seconde can be.
For the saide Philosopher in the fourth
of the naturall philosophie sayth, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
is not in time nor his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are measured with time, but this
is it which most commonly is vnder
stoode, that an angell maketh the first
moouing, and likewise al the other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
haue intellectiue motion whiche
mooueth them in their owne moouings
and here by it appeareth howe orderly
they mooue since the time that GOD
made them, vntil the like moouing doe
cease when his will shalbee.</p>
               <p>Therefore I say that the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable,
of the first moouing which is of
the tenth heauen according to that as
hath been spoken of, geueth a turne
once in foure and twenty houres round
about the world, from the east into the
west, &amp; with this his mouing he catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
&amp; carrieth with him al the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
heauens and maketh them giue
a turne to the world in the time that hee
geueth it. Although that their owne
moouinges be contrary to this, this is
shewed because we see that the starrs,
the sunne, the moone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
haue their first originall, and are
created in the east. And by little &amp; little
they rise vp and assend vntill they come
to the meridian and so with one accord
they descende and come to the west, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6833:9"/>
alwayes they make this moouing in
the same foure and twentie houres
as the tenth heauen doeth, so that
continuallye they obeye the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges
of the first moueable.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted, that for as
muche as it is saide of this forceable
moouing or catching which the firste
moueable doeth, vntoo the other
inferiour heauens, it is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
that in the Celestiall bodies
is no forceable moouing or violence,
nor any resistance or contradiction,
but all with one conformitie or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde
doe follows the fyrste moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
               <p>And so when it is sayde that
the first moueable doeth catch the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inferiour heauens it ought to be
vnderstoode soundly as if he should say
the inferiour or lower heauens are
mooued of the higher by an accedent, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
so as the marriner mooueth the
shippe moouing her selfe, wherin he sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
or as the water in a vessell, the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
being mooued the water also moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
so it is to be vnderstoode, that the
inferiour heauens doe mooue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
by the moouing of the firste
moueable, so by that aforesayde it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that alwaies there may be a dout
saying.</p>
               <p>(<hi>A doubt:</hi>) how can it be that the
tenth heauen moouing it selfe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
without ceasing from the easte to
the west, that the other inferiour hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
moouing them selues with him
doe make their owne moouinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
so that in one selfe time there is
made by one selfe body different moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Declaration</hi> for the declaration of
this, the present exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple is to be noted, if
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wheele of a mil there were set a flee
or an Aunt, although that the wheele
doeth make his moouing very quicke
and hastie yet the Aunt or Flee may be
going at their leisure, and make their
moouing contrary to that whiche the
wheele doeth. As also if the wheele
carrieth them rounde about and in a
short space geueth a turne yet they
may make an ende of their moouing at
their leysure, so that in this sorte the
moouing which the tenth heauen doth
make which is in euery foure &amp; twenty
houres, the inferiour heauens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they are mooued of him they
make their owne moouinges contrary,
the whiche euerye one of them by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
doeth make an ende in different

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He eyght heauen, which
is the starrie heauen, is
called the firmament by
reason that in it are the
fixed starres, in such sort
as none by him selfe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
but altogether, of these it is to bee
vnderstode, that although we see them
bright, yet there is none of them that
haue any light of them selues, but the
Sunne giueth light vnto them all, for
he onely hath light and no other bodie.
This light God made the first day, as
it is written in Genesis the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And the texte sayth that God saw
the light and it was good. <hi>Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
speaketh of the light that it is a
corporall substance, souereigne and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
multiplied in vertue, and shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with brightnes without resistance
it is communicable and delightfull and
therefore among all other bodies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
nothing so profitable, so quiet, so ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
as the light: The light is sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
abrod from the heauen to the earth
it is the beautie of all visible creatures,
and is the cause wherewithal the other
bodies or the world be praysed, seeing
that I say that the stars haue no light
of themselues, more then that which
they receiue of the sunne. So <hi>Albertus
Magnus</hi> writeth in the second of the hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen
and the worlde, The sixt chapter,
where he saith, al the stars of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are
lightned of the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, as also the moone,
but there is a difference in receiuing of
their light, &amp; so they differ in receiuing
their vertu, as they differ in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noblenes
of nature in such sort as, some are most
pure and most noble, &amp; these, receiuing
their light at one instant it doeth pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
them, from the superficie which is
opposite to the sunne euen to the other
superficie, so that all the starres remain
cleane and full of light, others also are
penetrated with the sunne, although
that by their nature they decline to som
colour, but howsoeuer it bee, the sunne
doeth penetrate them at one instant, &amp;
filleth them full of light euen as a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
is lighted with fire, and heere it is
to be noted that in this eyght heauen is
the Zodiacke where the twelue signes
are, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houses of the sun. These signes
are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded euery one of a certaine
number of starres, &amp; besids the signes,
there are other 36. images, which are
also compounded of starres, so that ther
are in all. 48, and these starres, which
doe compounde these signes and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are in number. 1021. of these spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>Alfragano</hi> in the third booke of the
assembling of the stars, that the least of
the fixed Starres to a notable sight is
greater then all the earth. And if al the
bodie of the earth were put into the
place where the fixed Starres are,
although it had light by reason of
the great distance, it would bee so little
that we should not see it, but this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
is not to be vnderstoode of the
planets, for all of them bee not greater
then the earth, nor it is to be vnderstod
of all the fixed starres, therefore it is to
be sayd of them that are most notable
to the sight. For there are some fixed
starres so little, that wee see them not,
there be others also that although wee
see them by reason they are little, they
are not accounted of the Astronomers,
but onely such as are great and these be
not all of one greatnes or quantitie, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6833:10"/>
of diuerse quantities, and therfore they
be diuided into sixe differences. So

things may be douted. (<hi>The first doubt</hi>)
To the fyrst, seeing that these signes or

Sunne in fourth, how can the sunne en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
into the signes, seeing there is so
great distance betweene the sunne and

if euery one of the signes be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

one signe is called <hi>Aries,</hi> whiche is as
much to say a Ram, and another <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
which is asmuch to say a Bull. And
likewise of others: seeing that in the

it be true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the signes be in the 8. heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; the Sunn in the fourth, it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode
that the moouing which the
Sunne maketh in all the yeere is, that
he mooueth himselfe vnder the starres
of the signes, and so when we say that
the Sunne is in such a signe, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that then he mooueth himself
vnder the starres of that signe, as also
any of vs may stande vnder any signe
or vnder the Sunne, And the distance
that is from the one to the other doeth
not let it. (2. <hi>Declaration</hi>) To the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
it is so, that in the heauen are no
beastes, but these are so named by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the effectes whiche the Sunne
worketh, being in euery one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signes
which doe followe and answere by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
or likenesse to one of these beasts,
and by demonstration of suche an

such a beaste, or to another thing that it
is likened vnto, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chapter folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is declared, that the Sunn entring
into euery one of these signes, doeth
cause diuers effectes. Therefore it is
to be noted, that of these twelue signes
foure of them are moueable, foure fixed,
foure common. The moueable are <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Cancer, Libra and Capricorne,</hi> these
signes are called moueable, for the sun
entring into euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is said,
that the disposition of the ayre doeth
vary and not continue in one estate, and
likewise the Sunne entring into <hi>Aries,</hi>
it mooueth from winter into sommer,
and entring into <hi>Cancer,</hi> it mooueth
from Sommer into Estio, and entring
into <hi>Libra</hi> it mooueth from Estio to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonno
which is haruest time. And en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into <hi>Capricorne</hi> it mooueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonno
or haruest time into winter. The
fixed signes are <hi>Gemini, Virgo, Sagitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
and <hi>Pisces,</hi> they are called fired, for the
Sunne entring into any of them, it is
sayde, that the time and the disposition

<hi>Taurus, Leo, Scorpio,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aquarius,</hi> they

the qualities of the times, A signe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

therby their impressions are printed in
beastes, birds, and plantes, and in men

But although they do to incline &amp; moue,
they doe not constraine nor binde by

wise man is lord ouer the starres He is
wise that followeth not sensualitie, but
reason, euery of these planets haue a
sphere of his owne, wherin he moueth
in circle wise, And the superiour circle
mooueth round about so nere to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
that betweene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
is no space nor any thing emptie.
so that these heauens do shut one with

sort, that any thing how litle or smal so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
it be, cannot put it self between the
one and theother, as it appeareth in the

more it is to be noted, that although
the heauens are so ioyned together, &amp;
neer one to the other, that this ioyning
together doe not let them of their moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
so that they mooue very distinctly
in differente times the one from the
other, without any let of their moouing
or standing still one onely pointe in such
sorte, that the tenth heauen maketh his
moouing in twentie and four houres, &amp;
the nienth heauen that is neere vnto
him, in fortie niene thousand yeres, and
likewise the eyght heauen doeth make
his moouing in thirtie &amp; sixe thousand
yeeres, and another in seauen thousand,
and the seauenth heauen which is next
to him maketh an ende of his moouing
in thirty yeres. These are things which
doe teach vs the greatnes and power
of the maister &amp; maker of such workes,
vnto whom the sayde woorkes giueth
praise, so did the royal Prophet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the eyghteene <hi>Psalme</hi> where hee
sayth, <hi>The heauens doe shewe and manifest

that euery one of these heauens haue
<pb facs="tcp:6833:12"/>
twoo moouinges one is the first moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
which is made from the east in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the west, turning againe into the cast
as it is declared: The other moouing
which is proper to euery one, is made by
a circle oblique, contrary to the first, that
is to saye, from the west into the east:
Of this is to bee noted, that according
to the opinion of <hi>Frauncis Capuano,</hi> it
was necessary that in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were
twoo contrary moouinges, one in the
first moueable, and another in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
spheres, and this for twoo reasons,
The first is, because the first moueable
doeth mooue so swift, and with so great
hast, that scarsely his moouing can bee
considered, seeing that in twentie and
foure houres hee passeth all the space
that he doeth occupie, whiche causeth,
that he caryeth with him, all the lower
heauens, and the fire, and the measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
region of the ayre, as it is written,
in the first of the Metheoros, so that if
the eyght &amp; nienth sphere and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
of the planets did not mooue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the opposite parte, with a contrarie
moouing, the sayd first moouing would
not onely mooue vnto the Celestiall
Spheres, and to the fire, but woulde
mooue all the ayre, water, and earth
rounde about, with his daily moouing,
and there woulde remaine nothing
quiet nor firme. The second reason is
because the starres with their moouing
doe cause influence in the inferiour, and
so they make impressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they mooue,
but if euery one did mooue, according
to their onely moouing, that is to saye,
from the Caste into the Weste, so that if
they mooued altogether with one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie,
they would bring foorth one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
and vniforme effecte, the which
shoulde bee an inconuenience. For that
onely generation is not sufficient, but
it is conuenient, that there bee corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so it was conuenient, that
all the Spheres, shoulde modue in
their daylye moouing, rounde about
the earth once in a naturall daye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all of them may communicate

therefore I will nowe
speake of the elementes,
howe they are ordained and deuided,
of the which it is to be vnderstood, that
the elementes are foure and no more,
by reason, that first of all they haue
foure qualities, and it maye bee sayde,
that they Ioyne in sixe kinde of waies.
Let vs see if all sixe be possible. One
ioyning is hote and cold, another moist
and drie, the thirde hote and drye, the
fourth hote and moyst, the fifth moyste
and colde, the sixth colde and dry. The
twoo first be not possible, because there
cannot bee twoo contraries in one
subiect. The foure which remayne are
possible, in the whiche the actiue one
with the other ioyneth with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> passiue.
These foure do constitute the four first
essentias which are called elementes,
And this is by reason of their fyrste
simple bodies, euen as it seemeth in
their quallities. That is to saye, in the
fire, in the ayre, in the water, and in the
earth, because we see that the fire is hot
and drie, the ayre hote and moiste,
the water colde and moyste, the earth
colde and drye, by the which difference
of qualities of the first bodies, they are
parted in the same maner. All these ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
doe moone, by the higher moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6833:12"/>
except the earth which is immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable.
So sayth <hi>Albertus</hi> the great in
the first of his Metheoros, the fourth
Chapter, it is necessarie that wee saye
the moouing, which wee see from
the inferiour, that is to say, the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

appoint some place, where the waters

it is conuenient to graunt that vpon

I say that these Elementes eyther of
them doe compasse in roundnesse equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from euery parte of the earth, sauing
the water in that parte of the earth,
which is discouered, for the breathing
and life of all liuing creatures, of this it
is to be noted according to the saying of
<hi>Albertus</hi> the great, that the water did
couer all the earth, and also he sayth in
the second of the Metheoros the thirde
treatie the seconde chapter, wee see
the order of the elementes are in suche
sorte, that alwayes the ioyning of the
one is in the hollownes of the other, &amp;
this is by reason his roundnes doeth
girde him therevnto, and because this
is naturall, and sometimes it was so, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
at somtime the earth was couered with
water, and all bodies naturally haue
one proper place, whereby it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that all be filled, for otherwise there
woulde be some thing superfluous in
nature, so it is euident, that the proper
place of the waters is the superficie of
the earth, for alwayes they mooue by
that place.</p>
               <p>Also when at any time two elements
doe not agree in any quallitie, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is called simbol, wherewithall the
one doeth ioyne with the other.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is necessarie, that there
bee some meane that they communicate
and ioyn together, and seeing the earth
and the ayre haue no simboll, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
that they ioyne together by
meanes which is the water that hath
a simboll with both, and so it is shewed
that according to nature all the earth
was couered with water: Of this may
be asked what is the cause, why the
roundnes of the elementes, fayled more
in the water then in the others: it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared
that GOD did make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>Therefore as God by his only grace

I leaue this part of the discouery of the

               <p>Of this haue past many questions,

                  </gap>ause is, the roundnes of the earth, &amp;
that the earth is rounde from the north
vnto the south, and so contrarywise
it sheweth it selfe, for vnto those
which are towardes the north, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
alwayes some starres, which are
neere to the pole artick, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other stars

howe much more he came towards the

see the starres of the south, that first
he coulde not see, as contrariwise, it
would happen to such as went from the

is the roundnes of the earth, likewise if
the earth were plaine from the easte to

would rise vnto those in the east partes
as to those in the west, whereby it
seemeth false, by the fyrst reason.</p>

the earth doe seem plain, vnto the sight
of men, it is for the great quantitie that
it containeth, in respect of our sight. And
if any should say that the mountaines

in the North, which is as much
to say, as the greatest parte of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

This <hi>Albertus</hi> the greate declareth in
the second of his Metheoros, chapter
sixe, saying that the sea runneth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
North into the South, and the cause is
that the north is higher then the south
and the reason wherefore it is higher,
is, because that with the colde of the
north there is more water ingendred,
then that which can containe in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and height of the riuers, and in
the south the water consumeth and is
wasted with the heate of the sunne, and
for this cause in the north, one water
pusheth out another, to the place which
is lower then it selfe: And so accidently
it mooueth, from the place of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
For as it is moist, it runneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it come to be deteined in some drye
place. The reason why the water is so
consumed in the south parts is, because
the sunne alwayes mooueth in his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<hi>Excentrik</hi> so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his center is not in one
place of the earth, in such sort that if the

be towardes the one parte, and the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
towardes the other, in respect of the

by reason of Geometrie, that the greater

which ingender in her, and those
which enter into her foorth of the riuers

the sea should be fresh, and not salt.
Also as it is certaine that God made all
things to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best, it seemeth to be better,
that the sea were freshe then salte. To
this answereth <hi>Albertus</hi> the great in the
second of his Metheoros, in the thirde
treatie and fifteenth Chapter, where he
sayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> matter that causeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea to bee
salt is. According to the truth, there are
twoo kindes of vapours, that is to say,
hote and moyst, and hote and drie, and
in the sea one of these doth rise from
the superficies, &amp; the other riseth from
the bottome, This is by reason of the
heate of the sunne, and of the starres,
which are an efficient cause of these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
and for the vapour of the water
it is very subtile, betweene these two,
and therefore being risen into the ayre is
consumed of the sunne, and the vapour
of the earth remaineth, or more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his exhalation dispersed, extended, &amp;
mingled in the water. As it appeareth
by an example in the meate digested,
that the thin substance thereof, is raised
vppe and extended, into the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and is that which nourisheth, and
the grosse substance remaineth, and also
that which is vndigested: euen so doth
the vapour of the earth remaine grosse,
and extendeth into the substance of the
water of the sea, and the coldnes of the
water compassing it round about, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
into it coldnes, and with the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
it burneth, by reason they bee two
contraries together, they are made
stronger then before, for the heate of the
salte exhalation, being come forth of the
depth of the sea, by vertue of the Sunne
fortifieth it selfe, with his contrary,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6833:15"/>
which is the cold, and so ouercommeth
the like heat which is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as is required
in the generation of a salt fast, as the
Philosopher hath it in the second of his
metheoros the first chapter speaking in
this matter, of this there is a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that if a freshwater were passed
through ashes it would make it salte,
the like is of the water of the sea, in the
time it was made salt, and because that
some say, there is a pure element in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substance,
and the element of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is in the sea, and that in the middest
of the sea, the water is simple and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tast, wherefore hath it not there an
obiection of contrarietie. This seemeth
to me not to be so, for the heate of the
Sunne, and the starres, are sufficient
to make exhalations come forth of the
bottome of the sea, which being ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the coldnes and moisture of
the water caused a salt tast in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
parte of the water: As well &amp; with
more reason they will make it in the
middest or in the bottome of the sea, and
so I hold with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
a great Astronomer, that there
is now no element pure, &amp; for as muche
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water is salt, it is more conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
&amp; better for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nauigation, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fresh,
that is because the salte water is more
heauie and grosse then the freshe. And
that it is so, <hi>Albertus</hi> the great saith in
this manner, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> salt water is more
heauie and thick then the freshe, it is ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered
by many experiences, of the
which one is. If the freshe water be
mingled, with salt and made a strong
mixture in such sorte that all the salt be
melted in the water, and in to it is cast
an egge fresh layde, it will swimme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the water, by reason of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
that the water hath which is done
with the mixture of the salte, and if the
sayd egge be put in freshe water it will
sinke, it is sayd that it must bee a newe
laid egge, for if it be old or crackt, it
will sink. And by the same reason is
shewed, that the shippes doe rather
sinke in freshe water, then in that
which is salt for the fresh rather deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it selfe and riseth vp rather then
that which is salt.</p>

in this it followeth the circle of the

no augmentation nor yet maketh

their quiet place. And the place cannot

with that whiche it shutteth

it ouerfloweth not by reason that

The third reason is because the

when the winde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
his blast, it is not equall, but
sometimes harde, and other times
more calme. And sometimes it ceaseth,
and other times it turneth to blowe, so
that it bloweth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuallye after one

wherfore the winde mooueth to his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite,
for so we cal it whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the east
he goeth to the west: And from the north
to the south, and likewise contrary, of
this it seemeth that there is no reason,
because the Uapour whiche is the
roote of the winde either followeth his
moouing which is to bee eleuated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is hote, and according as it is
straight so it ought to goe vpwarde, or
follow his matter which is earthly, &amp;
at it is straight, ought to desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
what doth make the winde to
mooue more to one side then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
rather then to moue it self straight
so that the east likewise should mooue it
selfe towardes the north, or towardes
the south, as towardes the west, and
likewise of the other windes. Item all
thinges whiche are ingendred in one
place naturally mooue not vnto the
place opposite: so that if the easterly
winde be ingendered in the east, and the
northerly wind in the north, they ought
to mooue to their owne place, and
not to the place opposite. By the
which it is to be said that the windes
mouing of them selues to their opposite
is violent, and against nature, or the
matter of the windes is maruellous &amp;
vnknowne to vs. (<hi>The first declaration.</hi>)
The first is to be vnderstoode that as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
matter of the winde, which is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
of the earth, riseth vp by little &amp;
little, maketh a weake &amp; little moouing:
But as he is encreased in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
so with a great force hee descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
and maketh a strong winde. Also
the winde bloweth not continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
because the matter which riseth vp
is not alwayes equal nor is equally put
forward, for the colde is more or lesse, &amp;
the vapour not equally congealed. And
therfore the winde at one time bloweth
hard, and at another time soft, (<hi>The. 2
declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>) The 2. is to be vnderstoode,
that the wind to mooue to his opposite
is for two causes. The 1. is as <hi>Alpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi>
sayth, the stars doe mooue in circle
manner; &amp; so the wind doth immitate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
circle mouing, The 2. as <hi>Albertus</hi> saith,
that it is more naturall, because the va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pour
is ingendred of heate, &amp; is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
&amp; thrust out of the cold, &amp; the cold
is behinde the heat, &amp; therefore is thrust
out to his opposite, so that he cannot go
vpright for the cold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in the ayre nor
can descend, for the heat that riseth vp,
nor can returne backward for the colde
which is behind him: and therfore it is
necessary, that he moue in circle manner
to his opposite, &amp; as much as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
is said that nothing moueth forth from
the place of his generation it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that which is of the nature of ayre,
mooueth it selfe to the place of ayre, and
the ayre hath place in all partes, and the
vapour hath the nature of aire as much
as apperteineth to his seldom mouing
so that he moueth not forth of his place.</p>

it may be asked what is the cause that
many times the winde maketh his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

we see that the winde raiseth vp from
the ground the dust and the straw, and
carrieth them vpright one heigh which
is commonly a whirlwind, and this is
as well caused or done in the sea as in
the Lande. And in the Sea it is

it the water riseth upwarde, as many

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beneath vpward, as the
mouing in roundnes before is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
To this is to bee noted that this
moouing, which the winde maketh is
not naturall to it, but accidentall and
violent: for because it is done by force,
by meeting together in this manner:
when one winde commeth from one
part, and another fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
&amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the one, doth meete
with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the other as euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hath no free running, by the let of the
winde he findeth contrary: then he that
is strongest thrusteth forwarde the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and so they put themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
roundnes, and make a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde
vntill they be deuided. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by an example in the water
when it runneth, that if it finde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
body that doth make any resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
it maketh a whirling, moouing it in
roundnes: euen so the winde as it fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
resistance of another winde or of
some mountaine, or of any like thing,
that doth resist his course, it cannot goe
forward. Therefore hee maketh that
round whirling. and this causeth in the
Sea many times that shippes be sunke
downe vnder the water, when they find
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vnder such a whirlwinde or
spout: for the water which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winde rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
doth ouerwhelme &amp; drown them.
Likewise when there are moouinges
of contrary windes, they cause to rise vp
stormes in the Sea, which the saylers
many times may know before hand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
and beholding the moouing of
the cloudes if they be contrary and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to the winde that is beneath. For
when it is so, it is a token that contrary
windes doe runne abrode, of the which

declared, the windes of
the cards of nauigation,
their names, &amp; differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
I wil speak in what
manner and order these
windes doe compasse about the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the world, to know how to saile
by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of this is to be noted, that this
round body of water and earth, hath in
roundnesse three hundreth and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
degrees. Therefore hee that is in
any part or place, and woulde sayle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
the North. All inconuenience
being taken away, shall sayle with the
winde at South, &amp; with no other. It
is to bee vnderstood, sayling before the
winde. Although that hee not hauing
the wind at South: But some other
wind sayling by the bowling: may goe
rising vp by other courses, making
boords, one boord vnto one wind, &amp; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
boord vnto another: vntill he come
to the place where he pretendeth to go.
Likewise, he that wil sayle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> north
to the south, must be with a Northerly
winde, or in the manner aforesaide.</p>
               <p>The nauigation of the east or west, is
in this maner: a shippe departeth from
the Islande of <hi>Saynt Thomas,</hi> or as
they cal it <hi>Saynt Thome,</hi> which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

on her way, you shal vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, then all
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dnes wil serue you, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> west wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you departed, vntil you come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
point where you came forth, in such sort
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in a place where a man is, a circle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
imagined, which gyrdeth the
worlde, all this circle is sayled with one
winde, but if from the halfe circle, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or after he will returne by the way
that he went, he shall returne with the
winde contrary. For it is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode,
that from the place that a man
departeth vntill the halfe circle bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he goeth departing from the place,
from whence hee came, and the other
half he returneth towards it againe, as
the figure following sheweth it.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>I say that one departeth from <hi>A.</hi> to
goe towarde <hi>C.</hi> and goeth by <hi>B.</hi> in <hi>A.</hi>
which is the place from whence hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth:
the wynde beginneth, &amp; being
come to <hi>C.</hi> which is his opposite, if hee
returne from thence to goe to the same
<hi>B.</hi> the wind which is contrary, wil serue
him. But if he goe sayling from <hi>C.</hi> to <hi>D.</hi>
and from <hi>D.</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> you shal vnderstande
that with the winde hee began to saile
by, he shall goe al the roundnesse, vntill
he returne, where he came foorth. The
same accompt, shall be made, if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to sayle towardes the West, and
that which hath beene saide of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation
by the equinoctial, the same
must bee kept by any manner of circle,
whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>And it is to bee noted, that onlie
from the East and West, there are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
or courses greater and lesser: the
greater circle passeth by the Center,
and the lesser passeth not by the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But all circles greater or lesser,
haue three hundreth and sixtie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of length, but in the leagues
that euery degree hath, there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of more &amp; lesse, euen as the circle
sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth neere to the equinoctial, or to the
<pb facs="tcp:6833:22"/>
poles. But the windes which must
serue the turne ought to be of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
circles and none of them of the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
circles. The nauigation by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
windes is in this sorte. If one
sayling towardes the northeast, gaue a
turne about the worlde, going alwaies
by the same course, he shall returne by
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> southwest, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted:
and the same will bee done by
the contrary. And in the rest let the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
be kept as before hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
The same doe I say by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation
towardes the southeast, that
he shall returne by the northwest. And
for an example of this, let it be asked: if
two shippes bee in one port, and one
departeth towardes the north and the
other towardes the south, these shippes
if they shall meete, and if they doe meet
for to goe equall way how much shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one of them sayle? I say that these
may meete, and that sayling by these
courses, when euery one of them haue
gone .180. degrees they shall be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And in like manner, this acount
is to be kept departing by other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And so it is to be vnderstoode, that
whensoeuer two shippes or more doe
goe forth of one port, and do sayle by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
courses, when euery one of them
haue gone 180. degrees, they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
and ioyne in the place opposite,
from whence they departed: this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as it is sayde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the windes of
the nauigation bee of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater circles,
for all of them doe passe by the center, &amp;
so euery one going the half circle which
is the sayde. 180. degrees shal finde him
selfe in the point opposite from whence
he came forth.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the instrumentes
which are necessary for
the nauigation, one is
the carde: for without it
good nauigation cannot
be made, seeing that in
it the Pilot or sayler doeth see the place
where he is, and the place whether hee
pretendeth to goe, &amp; seeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> height of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
that euery place hath, so that hee
knoweth if he shall goe foorth right, or
if he shall goe rising or descending: hee
seeth also what winde or windes will
serue him in his course, and where hee
shall leaue one and take another: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
seeth the distance of the way which
he shal goe, how many leagues it hath,
and so he ordaineth in all thinges that
which is best and conuenient for him.
But it seemeth that with reason there
may be had a doubt in the cardes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the nauigation is made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And say
that they be not certain nor true for this
cause following. (<hi>A doubt,</hi>) This being
prooued that the worlde is a round bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and not onely the heauens, but also
euery one of the elementes, so that the
water whereby we sayle is round, and
the winde wherewith it is sayled moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
it selfe in roundnes &amp; this being so
we see that the cardes of nauigation
be not made round but plaine: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the round to the plaine is great
difference, as appeareth by this present
figure,</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>If two shippes should departe from
<hi>A.</hi> vnto <hi>C.</hi> and the one of them went by
<hi>B.</hi> and the other by <hi>D.</hi> so great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
will be of the way that the one maketh
to the other by how much the distance
is from the <hi>B.</hi> vnto the <hi>D.</hi> &amp; seeing that
the way which by the sea is sayled is
from the <hi>A.</hi> vnto <hi>C.</hi> by <hi>D.</hi> because the
water is round, &amp; the cardes doeth not
shewe it to bee so, but it sheweth it in
plaine manner which is from <hi>A.</hi> vnto <hi>C.</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:6833:22"/>
by <hi>B.</hi> whereby it seemeth that the way
which the ship maketh, is halfe more
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the card sheweth. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
the ship goeth it in circle manner,
and the card sheweth it by diameter,
&amp; the diameter hath but only the thirde
part and one seuenth part of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
Likewise the aforesaid seemeth
to be so: because the rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bodie is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then all other bodies, and as the
world is a round body, there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
figure so great, that may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to it: and so the card which is made
in plaine, cannot bee equall with the
round. Also the courses of the nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they are put in the cardes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
hundreth leagues: they departe
one from the other twentie leagues, in
such sort that from the place where the
ship doth depart vnto the xc. degrees
whiche doth amount to 1575. leagues.
An these leagues they depart one ship
from another, or one course from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
315. leagues. And seeing there are
32. courses, the world, that is to say, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
earth &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water should haue in round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
ten thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; fourescore leagues:
this is false, because this roundnesse
hath 360. degrees of 17. leagues, and a
halfe, euery degree, which doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to 6300. leagues and no more.
Of all the aforesaid, it seemeth that the
cardes of nauigation because they are
made in plaine: should be false and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.
(<hi>A declaration.</hi>) To this is to be
noted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the cardes of nauigation
are true and altogether perfect: and the
art wherwith they are made and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
doth conteine all certeintie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
aunswearing to the first is: that the
nauigation which the ship doth make
in roundnesse, and the card doth shewe
in playne: is to be vnderstood, that the
same quantity or distaunce of way, that
euery part hath in roundnesse, the selfe
same is reckoned and giuen in playne:
aswell in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the leagues and degrees the
distance that euery thing hath in rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
without taking from it any thing.
And this may wel be done, for although
that one body be round, there may bee
giuen to it the self same proportion and
greatnesse in playne, as <hi>Ptholome</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it foorth in the playne sphere. And
<hi>Iordan</hi> in the treatie which he made of
the same matter. This seemeth to be by
an example in an apple, that although
it be rounde, the length &amp; breadth that
his roundnesse hath, may bee put in
playne forme: euen so in the cardes of
nauigation, although in their figure or
shape they be not rounde, yet in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
of the way, they giue and hold
in equalitie with the round: And the
round body to be greater then another
body. It is to be vnderstood, that those
bodies being equall in circumference,
for not beyng equal, another figure may
wel be greater then the round. And for
as much as I say, of the courses of the
cardes. It is likewise to be vnderstood,
that these be ordayned in Geometry, &amp;
because it is so singuler among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimaticals,
they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be false as those
Authours whiche I haue spoken of
doe shewe. And if by a point of the card
there are founde more Leagues in the
courses then the world hath: This is
not hurtfull to the carde, for this arte
and shew of the courses, is not only for
this number of sixe thousand and three
hundreth Leagues which the worlde
hath: but for any manner of number, so
that although the world had a hundred
thousand leagues, or had a thousande,
the selfe same woulde serue those cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in one number as in another: as it
appeareth, that such as saile one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
leagues doe goe in their waye
as well as those which goe vnto the
East <hi>India,</hi> which sayle fiue thousande.
And as <hi>Magalanes</hi> sailed, and suche as
went with him in the yeere 1521. when
the straight was discouered, which of
<hi>Magalanes</hi> is named, that then sayling
from <hi>Spayne,</hi> they gaue a turne about
the world: of that as is said, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
plainely, that the cardes of naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
are so well ordayned, that theyr
agreement and perfection is a thing
maruellous: seeing a thing so great as
the earth and the Sea is, beeing
marked in so little roome as a Carde

ought principally to look vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 3. things.</p>
               <p>First of al, the place where he is, and
the place whither he mindeth to goe, &amp;
to know the distance, that is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one
place to the other.</p>
               <p>The second, in what height of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
he findeth himselfe, and in what
height the place is which hee mindeth
to goe vnto.</p>
               <p>The third is, to know the winde or
winds that shall serue him in his naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
al the which he may see &amp; know
in his carde.</p>
               <p>And this beeyng knowne, let him
looke if he haue a winde that is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for his nauigation, and hauing it
let him proceede vppon his voyage as
weather, &amp; time will permitte him. And
it is to bee noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many times it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
that for the nauigation which
should bee made, the wind serueth not
according to the course, which the ship
should goe: And therefore it is sayled
with another wynde whiche is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>Likewise it happeneth, that as a ship
goeth sayling, there commeth such wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that causeth her to goe foorth of
her right way: and take her course by
another, by the which how much more
she goeth, so much the land y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they goe
to seeke changeth it selfe into different
courses of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe. This is because
the shippe goeth not her right course to
the place, whither she prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to goe:
so that the selfe same place, varieth or
changeth it selfe from one cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e into
another. And likewise sometimes it
waxeth neere, and other times farre
of.</p>
               <p>And when it is so, that the pilot say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
with a winde, different to that
which is conuenient for his course, and
sayling would knowe in what poynt or
course, the land whither he mindeth to
goe, lieth from him: and howe manye
leagues hee hath from him to it, in the
figures &amp; accounts following, hee shall
finde it: the which shall profite him to
knowe the certayne place where hee is,
and thereby hee shall knowe howe to
choose the true course, (when weather
serueth him) for to returne to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
place whither he mindeth to goe,
which is to be vnderstood in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
I say that you will sayle to a land,
which beeing seene in your carde, and
the place marked where you are: You
shall find y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it is from you towards the
North or South, or any other course,
and so sayling towardes one place, you
runne towardes another: and put the
case that the land whether you pretend
to goe, be from you towards the North,
so that you should sayle with the winde
at South, &amp; because this winde blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, you sayle with another winde:
Therefore if the nauigation bee by the
first course more neere to the winde it
selfe, in the first figure you shall finde
marked this first course, and neere to it
the leagues which you shall goe for to
get the land, whither you pretende to
goe towards all the courses of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe:
as also how many Leagues the
land is of from you, and in the manner
that the nauigation is declared by this
course, so all others are declared.</p>
               <p>And when in sayling you haue not
the proper winde which shoulde serue,
marke by the winde which you haue,
how many poynts it is of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proper
wind, wherewith you should saile, and
seeke it in one of the figures, that is
here put, which shalbe one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the crosse, &amp; nere to the figure
where the like winde is, you shall finde

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6833:23"/>
in this manner.</p>
               <p>In the first account, you shall finde
how many leagues you shall goe by the
course where you sayle.</p>
               <p>In the second account is the course
where you haue the lande whether you
pretend to goe, (I will say) that hauing
gone those leagues which there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
you shall come vnto the lande,
which you seeke after by the course that
is there marked: the which you shall
knowe what course it is, by the
number that he hath, seeking the same
number in the figure that is nexte to
it.</p>
               <p>In the third account, you shall finde
how many leagues you are distant of
the same lande whether you goe, so that
hauing gone the leagues of the first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
you shall haue the land whether
you goe at the course which standeth in
the second: And you shall be from the
same land the leagues that are marked
in the third account.</p>
               <p>This being knowne, three thinges
are to be noted.</p>
               <p>The first, because heere cannot be put
any rule for the number of the leagues
that are from the place where you are
vnto the place where you pretende to
goe: because at one time there will be
more distance then at another time.</p>
               <p>Therefore this account is taken out
for the number of a hundreth leagues, I
will say that the place where you are
vnto the place whether you wil goe, is
a hundreth leagues of way. And it is to
be noted, that although this accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, doe
serue for this number of a hundreth
leagues, it serueth likewise for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
number of leagues, that the way
hath, in this manner, if the waye
be of 200 leagues you shall goe it twise
as much as the numbers of the first
account doe shewe: And then you shall
haue the lande whether you goe in the
course which is marked in the seconde
account, and you shall be from the sayd
land, twise as many leagues of them
which are accounted in the thirde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
and if the way be of 300 leagues
you must goe thrise as much as the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the first account shewe so that
of euery hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth leagues, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
of the way you shall geue as
much more number of that which is in
first and third account, &amp; then you shall
haue the lande at the same courses or
pointes, which are marked in the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
account, and if in the way bee fifties, or
more or lesse you shall geue a halfe, a
thirde, a fourth, or a fifth, or according as
the number is.</p>
               <p>The second is, that in the figures
which are put here, the nauigation go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
marked by the windes of the one
parte of the compasse: and by the other
parte of the course where you shall finde
the lande.</p>
               <p>This is to be noted that the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is when you shall faile by the
parte where the courses goe, and so it
serueth for all partes.</p>
               <p>The thirde is, that towardes the wind
that these figures doe shew forth right,

               <p>AND for the better declaration of
the rules aboue written, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
figure is to be noted in the whiche
I say, that you finde your selfe, in the
poynt, <hi>A.</hi> And the lande whither you
will goe, you haue it, I put the case at
the North, in the poynt <hi>B.</hi> and there is
from you to it an hundreth leagues, so
that your way should be from <hi>A.</hi> vnto
<hi>B.</hi> that is to say, sayling from the south
towardes the North, and because you
haue not this winde, you sayle by the
first course, and the account beeyng
put in the first rule, doth teache you,
that if you goe fiftie leagues by this
first course: that the Lande, which you
had first towardes the North, you shal
haue it at North and by East (you sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by the course of North, &amp; bywest)
and there shalbee from you to it fiftie
Leagues, and if you goe by the same
course sixtie seuen Leagues, then you
shall finde it towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North North-East,
and then it will be from you to it
fortie leagues. And if you sayle seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
sixe leagues, you shall haue it tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
the Northeast and by north, and
there will be fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you to it twentie eight
Leagues. And so in the rest, this rule
teacheth you how many leagues shuld
be sailed for to get to the lande whether
you goe to all these courses. The second
figure and rule is, when you shall sayle
by the seconde course distant from the
proper winde: in the whiche you shall
find the account that shalbe kept in that
way. And the third for the third course,
and so for all the rest: and it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that to this winde at North, which
was put for an example, shalbee giuen
the proper name of the winde, whereby
you should saile, and to the others the
<pb facs="tcp:6833:28"/>
names of the windes, that are next to
him.</p>
               <p>Also it is to be noted, that alwayes
it must be considered what distance is
from the place where your are, vnto
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place whither you mind to goe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you may make the account, euen as

knowe sayling by any manner of
course where the Meridian is.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND seeyng that in the
rules before writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath
beene declared howe the
Pilot shall knowe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he shall sayle, and
to what point or course of
the compasse he hath the land whither
he goeth, and how many Leagues the
lande is from him. Here I will speake,
that departing from one place for to
sayle to another by anye manner of
course, you shall knowe howe muche
you depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Meridian wherin
you were, and knowe the Meridian,
wherein you finde your selfe: for this is
a thing most necessary in the nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the height or altitude only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
And because this rule of the
Meridian, may bee the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
you shall note this example. I
saye that eight shippes beeyng in one
porte, and they goe foorth sayling, the
one from the North to the South, the
seconde by the first quarter, the third by
the seconde: and so all the other by
different windes, when euery one
of these shippes haue gone one degree,
or two, or more, being equal in degrees:
they shalbe East and Weast all of them
one with the other, although not equal
in way, for the one hath gone muche
more then the other, in such sorte, that
that which hath sayled by the seconde
course hath gone more waye, then
that which sayled the first, &amp; the thirde
more then the second, and so of the rest:
by how much they goe from the first, so
much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more way is to be gone to raise
vp, or to descend a degree. This is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by reason of the obliquitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as more largely shalbee declared in
the 14. Chapter of this third booke, and
this being knowne (I say for to know)
howe farre a man is from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Meridian,
from whence hee departed, imagine
that his nauigation shoulde bee by the
same Meridian: that is to say, from
the North, to the South, or from
the South to the North: and that hee
saileth by the first, the seconde the third,
or fourth course, or by any of the other:
according as the course lieth whither
you minde to sayle, to one place, or to an
other. And this is to bee vnderstood in
the fourteene courses colaterales, from
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> South, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the South,
to the North, according as in the first
figures which are put heere doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:
for because for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other 14. courses
<hi>Colaterals,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the East to the West, in
the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d figure or fable they are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
therfore I say, when you shall sayle
by any of the 14. courses heeretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
two thinges must be considered.
The first in what height of degrees you
were, when you were in them, and in
what height you doe prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly find your
self in: and looke how many degrees of
differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. The
seconde is to looke by what course you
haue come vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where you are,
and this being knowne, looke into the
account hereafter written in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and in it you shall finde how many
Leagues you haue departed from the
Meridian, which you had in place from
whence you departed.</p>
               <p>An example. I say, that you departed
from the point of these first marked fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
following, &amp; so you were in 20.
degrees of height, &amp; after that, taking
your altitude, you found your self in 15.
degrees, or in 25. in such sorte, that you
found to haue raysed or destended fiue
degrees, and this was sayling by the
fourth course, whose name you shall
know looking on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth where he is
marked in the figures which are heere
put, &amp; the course being knowne &amp; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with y^ which you haue sailed, looke
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table which is next in the 4. course
at the fiue degrees, and you shall finde
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6833:28"/>
that you haue gone from the Meridian
from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce you departed 87. leagues.
And for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better vnderstanding of this
rule, immagine that from this point of
the twentie degrees, where you were,
or from any other place from whence
you departed, that when from thence
you departed, there departed, likewise
another shippe from the same point sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by the same Meridian, and that
when you had gone the fiue degrees
she likewise had gone other fiue, in such
sort that you haue her East and West
with you, and so it is to be vnderstoode
that these 87. leagues are of distance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you to this shippe, because you are so
farre distant of that Meridian, And so
knowing the distance which you haue
from the Meridian, where you depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
foorthwith you shal know the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
wherin you are, and in this sorte
immagine that any manner of course
that you shall saile, by any of these that
are marked heere vnder in the two first
figures, you haue this shippe East and
West with you, and this shall be your
guide for to know how farr distant you
be from the Meridian where you were,
this is by seeing how many leagues
you haue raised or descended, and the
course wherby you haue sailed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sought in the figures and table fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
by it you shall know the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
certaine wherin you are.</p>

is) when you goe sailing you shall mark
in howe many degrees of height you
finde your selfe in, and after that when
you turne to take the sayde altitude, you
shall marke howe manye degrees you
haue risen or descended from the place
from whence you departed. And this

of an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, that taking your altitude

are not put more numbers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto ten

any manner of place where a man stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
is a point or beginning where the
courses or winds of the nauigation doe
proceede and come foorth. Therefore
the Pilot ought to looke in his card the
place where he is, &amp; the place whether
he mindeth to goe vnto, and this being
knowne, he ought to seeke for the course
that maye goe moste right to it from
whence he doth depart vnto the place

from one place to the other, let him put
the foreparte of his shippe into it as his

as weather will serue him.</p>

whether he mindeth to goe, and by the
saide course let him follow the degrees

he finde another that goeth more right

haue great care, to see how much waye
euery course serueth him, and where he
shall leaue that way and take another,
and that he keepe a good reckoning &amp;
knowledge of the way that hee maketh
as much as is possible, and at all times
when neede requireth to make a point
in his carde and mooue his course, let
him doe it keeping alwaies a good
reckoning of his waye, and this to

continue vntill hee finde a course that
may cary him directly to the place that

ought not to keep himself towards
the courses that are nearest adioyning
to him where he is, but vnto those that
are nearest to the place whether he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
And it woulde doe well to pricke
his carde often, and prouide diligently
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his course: &amp; let the Pilot note, that
for to chose y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> course y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right way as he
ought to doe, he hath need to know pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
the Meridian wherin he is: for not

seemeth that so much as is erred in the
knowledge of the place where the shipp
is, as much more she is distant from the
place that she goeth to seeke: and this
is one of the causes, whereby the Pilots
doe finde themselues in great errour in
theire nauigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and loose much time,
and other inconuententies happen
to them. Therfore let the Pilot take
this for a good aduise, in long wayes to
keepe for him selfe a booke of account of
his nauigation, where he should be put
in remembrance of the winde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> serueth

the most which she can runne is foure

The reason is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as they begin in one

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is different from that: so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

the way that is sayled by them, shalbe

you doe seeke by it: seeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ports,
baies, Ilandes, &amp; shooldes, &amp; the other
thinges of the cardes, where these said
courses doe beginne, beeing looked on
where they end, they bee foorth of their
owne places &amp; true altitude, making it
equall with the altitude where the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation
began. Also looking in euerie
course of the card, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> distance of leagues,
that are from one place to another, or
from one porte to another, I say, from
the place where the course began, vnto
the place where it endeth: and these

leagues of the courses be not agreable

that doe reach fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one graduatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to

The Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel royall of the <hi>Indians,</hi> of
his Maiestie, wherevpon it hath beene
commaunded that the said cards be not
vsed by reason they haue two different
graduations, and therefore are false
and erronious as it is said. Therefore
I say, that the Pilot or sayler ought to
looke well that the carde whereby hee
doth sayle, be of one only graduation: I
wil say if they haue two graduations or
more: let them bee equall or vniforme
and not different, the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other.
And likewise the other instruments, let
them bee certayne and true, that they
cause no errour, whereby may followe
hurt and daunger, as it is most certeine
that with false instrumentes it maye

sunne is the fountaine of
light, the fairenesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
day, the orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
the measure of time,
the vertue and strength of all thinges
which are borne, and according as the
Philosopher saith, is cause of all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and corruption. It is of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great quantitie, so much that <hi>Ptho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome</hi>
saith in the <hi>Almagesto</hi> and <hi>Alfraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
in the difference 22. that the sunne
in an hundreth sixtie &amp; sixe times grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the earth, his mouing is more
swift then any arrow, and we doe not
see him mooue by reason of his greate
brightnesse which is of more strength
to be seene, then our sight can see: And
to our iudgement hee goeth by leasure.
But the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way being know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
which he goeth, his lightnesse is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable:
so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the greate distance
that is from vs to him, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
his moouing. And it is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the sunne hath two moouings
contrary, which are one forcible, and the
other proper: the forcible mouing is it
that we see that euery day he maketh a
forcible going by the first moueable, &amp;
in euery 24. houres, hee goeth round
about the world from the East into the
West. The other mouing which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
with proper to himselfe, woorketh
contrary to the first, that is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
from the West into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> East, in his
circle <hi>Excentrico:</hi> the which moouing, he
maketh in three hundreth sixtie and
fiue dayes &amp; sixe houres, &amp; lesse a little
quantity: And this mouing he maketh
in this maner, from the eleuenth day of
Marche, that the sunne passeth by the
line Equinoctial vntil the eleuenth day
of June, the sunne goeth rising vp, by
the parte of the North, and so putting
himselfe from the said line, the eleuenth
day of June, he commeth to the tropike
of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and in this rising vp that he
maketh these three monethes hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
from the sayd line twenty three
degrees and thirtie three minutes:
which is his greatest declination, or
distaunce that hee maketh from the
fayde line; and from the twelfthe of
June, vnto the thirteenth of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
the sunne descendeth from the
sayde Tropike vnto the line: and from
the fourteenth of September, vnto
the thirteenth of December: the sunne
<pb facs="tcp:6833:36"/>
descendeth by the parte of the South
from the line to the Tropike of <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne,</hi>
from whence he departeth other
twentie three degrees, and thirtie three
minutes, which is likewise his greatest
declination of that parte: and from the
fourteenth of December, vnto the tenth
of Marche, the sunne goeth using vp
from the Tropike of <hi>Capricorne</hi> vnto
the line: so that of the twelf-monthes
of the yeere, sixe of them, the sunne go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the line to the parte of the
North, and the other sixe to the parte
of the South. And all the moouinge
which the sunne maketh, is from one
Tropike to another: in the whiche are
47. degrees, and 6. minutes. This is
the latitude of the <hi>Zona,</hi> whiche the
auncient Writers called <hi>Torrida,</hi> which
is as muche to saye, tosted, because
alwayes the sunne maketh his moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
by her within these Tropikes,
without going worth of them at anye
time.</p>
               <p>And it is to bee vnderstood, that the
time which the sunne goeth towarde
the parte of the North, and the time
hee goeth towarde the parte of the
South, Is not equall, for the sunne
goeth towarde the parte of the North,
a hundreth eightie and seuen dayes,
and hee goeth towardes the parte of
the South, a hundreth sixtie and eight:
where it appeareth that the sunne go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
more time of the yeere vnto the
parte of the North, then vnto the part
of the South. The cause is, because
this circle <hi>Excentrico:</hi> wherein the
sunne maketh his moouing, is so shut
into the <hi>Sphera,</hi> that of one parte hee
commeth more neere to the firmament,
then of the other, for the which cause be
is described foorth of the Conter of the
worlde.</p>
               <p>The parte of this circle that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
more neere to the firmament, is
called <hi>auxe,</hi> which is as much to say e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuation,
and this hee doth, when hee
commeth to the tropike of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and
that when he is most distant is called
opposite of <hi>auxe,</hi> and this is when hee
commeth to the Tropike of <hi>Capricorne:</hi>
so that when the sunne is in <hi>Auxe,</hi> hee
is more neere to the firmament; and
when hee is in his opposite, hee is
more neere to the earth, in suche sorte
that in the Sommer the sunne goeth
farre from the earth, and in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is more neere to the earth. This
is to bee vnderstoode in respect of vs in
the Winter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> respect of suche as
inhabite towardes the parts of the
South in Sommer. The Cardinall
<hi>Peter de Aliaco</hi> proueth, that aforesaid in
the twelfth question, in the first article
of the seconde notable, where hee
sayeth that the sunne maketh his moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
beeyng come to the ende of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>
is in the <hi>Auxe:</hi> of his <hi>Excentrieo,</hi>
and in the ende of <hi>Sagitarius</hi> is in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite.</p>
               <p>This seenteth by the demonstration
that <hi>Ptholome</hi> putteth in the thirde
distinction of the <hi>Almagesto.</hi> And seeing
that the <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Excentrico</hi> of the
sunne is distant from the <hi>Center</hi> of the
worlde, by so muche when the sunne in
his <hi>Auxe</hi> is more distaunt from the
earth; and when hee is in the opposite,
hee is more neere to it. And so it is
prooued that the sunne is more neere
to the earth in our Winter, then in
Sommer.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eing there hath beene
declared the difference
of shadowes which the
sunne maketh, or maye
make by all the yeere in
any manner of place that
a man is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which shadows are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be knowne. For to knowe precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
how to take the altitude of the sunne,
I will speake, what thing the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the sunne is, and the manner
that must be had, for to take it well. For
this is to bee noted, that <hi>Ptholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>
saieth in the firste of <hi>Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi>
that wheresoeuer a man is, hee seeth
halfe the heauen and the other halfe is
hid from him, in such sort that of three
hundreth and sixtie degrees that the
heauen hath in roundnes wee alwaies
see the hundreth and foure score which
is the halfe wherein is contayned our
<hi>Hemispherio,</hi> so that wheresouer a man
is, and in any manner of time, from his
heade or <hi>Cenith,</hi> vnto the horizon are
ninetie degrees, and so from what place
that a man is in euen vnto the sunne,
when he riseth in the morning, that hee
doe begin to appeare in the horizon are
ninetie degrees, and how much more
the day goeth forwarde, and the sunne
goeth rising, so much more he commeth
neerer towardes our <hi>Cenith.</hi> And this
rising vp that the sunne maketh, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the altitude of the sunne, because he
goeth rising, and going vp vppon the
horizon, the which altitude he that shall
take him at the middest of the day, let
him vnderstande that the degrees that
he shall finde in his <hi>Astrolabio,</hi> lesse then
ninetie, those should be from him to the
sunne, for that the sunne shall be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
distant from his <hi>Cenith,</hi> which is
from the right of his heade. Therefore
I say to know the altitude that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne
hath euery day vpon the horizon which
the pilot or any otherperso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would
take it, ought, first of all to looke on syue
thinges which are these following.</p>
               <p>The first, that it be taken in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of the day.</p>
               <p>The second, that hee see to whiche
parte of the line, the sunne goeth that
day.</p>
               <p>The third, to what part the shadows
goe.</p>
               <p>The fourth, what declination the sun
hath.</p>
               <p>The fifth, that he knowe how to ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plye
the rule that is conuenient accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the time and place wherein he
findeth himselfe. Vnto the first I say,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the altitude of the sunne ought to be
taken at the middest of the day iustly,
this is because vntill the sunne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the Meridia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he goeth alwaies
rising aboue the Horizon, and if hee bee
taken before or after hee wil not bee so
<pb facs="tcp:6833:40"/>
iustly taken, but although that in this
be some difference of time being but a
little thing before or after, it is no great
inconuenience, because the most times
it cannot be punctually knowne whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he
commeth to the Meridian. Although
you looke on the clock, the Astrolabio,
or any other instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but alwaies doe
you procure to take him at the houre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaide.</p>
               <p>To the second, it ought to bee seene
at what parte of the line, the sunne go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
if it be at the north or at the south,
considering that the time, which the sun
goeth to the part of the north, is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
eleuenth of March vnto the thirteenth
of September, and from the fourteenth
of September vnto the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th of March
hee goeth to the parte of the south.</p>
               <p>Vnto the thirde, he that taketh the
altitude ought to see to what parte the
shadowes are from him, (that is to say)
the shadow of his person, or of the maste
of his ship, or of any other thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is put
vpright. And so by the shadowe hee
shall knowe at which parte of the line
hee is, for being knowne to which parte
the sunne goeth, it may be easily known
by the sayde shadowe, towardes what
parte he is of, as in the fourth chapter
hath beene declared.</p>
               <p>To the fourth, the yeere ought to be
looked vnto, if it be a leape yeere, or
the first, the second, or third yeere after
the leape yeere, and according as the
yeere is, let him looke on the moneth,
and day wherein he is: and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
the sunne hath towardes the
parte where he goeth, that is how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees and minutes hee is distant
from the sayde line.</p>
               <p>To the fifth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee apply euery rule of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
altitude in his proper time and place,
and this the pilot ought alwais to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and knowe the rules of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
not onely the woordes but the
meaning of them for he that onely kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
the rule, and doth not attaine to
the reason or foundation thereof, as it
ought to be vnderstoode, it procureth to
him many harmes, and hee knoweth
not of what they proceede, and finding
him selfe in the errour he putteth faulte
in the instrumentes and rules, the fault
being in him selfe, because he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them not.</p>
               <p>And because these rules of the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne goeth towards one part, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:6833:46"/>
the shadowes towardes another, the
declination is to be ioyned with the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and if they passe nientie degrees,
those which are more, you are distant
of the line, towardes the parte which
the sunne goeth and if they bee nientie
iust, you shoulde be in the line, and if
they come not to nientie, those which
are lesse you are distant at the contrary
parte where the sunne goeth, as in
this rule is declared, and therefore in
this example following is to be noted.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may be asked by what
reason all the rules of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

goe reduced to this
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of nientie degrees,
more then to any other, for that it is so
written, that the degrees of altitude
are to be seene, wherein the sunne is
taken in the Astrolabio, how many doe
lacke, vnto nientie and in other rules is
sayde that the altitude and declination
is to be ioyned and seene if they amount
to nientie degrees, or if they passe nien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
degrees, or if they come not to nienty
degrees, in such sorte, that all the rules
are made and ordained to this number
of nienty, therfore it ought to be known
wherfore more to this number the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other. For the vnderstanding of this
doubt is to be immagined that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
a man standeth is the middest
of the worlde, and he seeth half the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
in such sort, that as the roundnes
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde hath three hundreth &amp; six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

to be vnderstoode in this manner, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
that in what place so euer a

this circle, which circle is his horizon.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Therefore I saye that I am in the

<hi>A.</hi> which is the horizon vnto my heade
are nientie degrees, and from my <hi>Cenith</hi>

from my heade vnto the pointe <hi>D.</hi> other
nientie, and so there is nientie degrees
from my heade to any parte of my hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.
Therefore declaring the doubt, I
say that the reason why the rules of the
<pb facs="tcp:6833:47"/>
altitude of the Sunne are reduced to
this number of nientie, is because the
Sunne cannot rise vp aboue the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
more then nientie degrees, which
is vntill he come right ouer our heads,
and so when we take him in nientie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Astrolabio, wee saye that wee
haue the sunne right ouer our heades,
&amp; when we take him in lesse, that which
is lesse then nientie is the sunne distant
from vs: so that because the sunne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rise vp, vpon the horizon more then
nientie degrees, with the which as I
haue saide, he commeth vntill he be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

sayde, two thinges are to bee noted, the
fyrst is, that from the time the Sunne
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> foorth, vntyl it be the middest

                  </gap>, Meridian, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayee
the Meridian is in the middest
of the bow, which the Sunne maketh,
from the time that hee commeth foorth
vntill hee is sette<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the man is in the middest of the
roundnes, which roundnes is his hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</p>
               <p>The seconde is, that this Bowe
which the Sunne maketh vppon our
horizon, is not euery day equall, but at
some times is greater then at other
some, euen as the daye is great or litle,
but although that the bowe bee great
or little, alwayes the Sunne goeth ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vp, vntill he come to the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and from thence hee descendeth.
And it is to be noted, that alwayes
the Sunne commeth forth, and setteth
in equall distance from vs, but at the
middest of the day, he is not alwaies
in equal distance of vs, but at one time
hee is neere, and at another time farre
off, this is from the right of our heads,
which is to be vnderstood in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
I put the case that I bee distant
from the equinoctiall line tenne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and the Sunne hath of decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
the same daye the same tenne
degrees, towards the part that I am,
and beeing so, when the Sunne came
foorth this daye, and beganne to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the horizon, then hee was from
mee nientie degrees, and from thence
hee went rysing vp vntyll the middest
of the day, and beeing come to my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,
hee shall bee precisely right ouer
my head.</p>
               <p>Insomuch that if a lyne be imagined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that rightly doth descende fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sun

vnto the earth, this line woulde come
vpon my head, and this woulde bee so
at all times, when I were as distant of
the line, as the declination is, which the
sunne hath this day, because I am in
that way where the Sunne that day
doth make his moouing, by the which
that day at the middest of the day, I
shall haue it vpon my head: but if I be
distant of the waye of the sunue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that when he came foorth, hee
was from me ninety degrees, it is to be
vnderstood, that when it is the middest
of the day, I shall not haue it right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
my head, but I shal haue it as farre
of, as the distance is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place, where
I am, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of the way of the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne,
in such sort that if the distance, which is
of the place or way, where I am, to the
place or way where the Sunne came
foorth, were fiue degrees, or tenne, or
more, or lesse: Those same the Sunne
shalbe at the middest of the day distant
from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right of my head, so that, if there
were layd two straight lines or strekes,
from the East into the West, the one by
the place where the Sunne commeth

I am: the degrees of distance y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shoulde

distance of the Sunne to my <hi>Cenith.</hi>
And doe you note, that in this distance,
which the Sunne maketh from mee is
not to bee looked, howe muche there is
from mee to the Sunne, but doe you
looke how much the Sunne is distant
at the middest of the day, from the right

an hundreth sixtie and sixe times grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the earth: and that the Sunne
is so great, it appeareth well, seeyng
that continually hee geueth light to all
the starres of the heauen, the heauen
beeing so greate, and the starres so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, as the royall prophet saith,
that God only doth reckon and number
them. Likewise the greatnesse of the
Sunne doth shewe, in the which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that there bee alwayes put
all the roundnesse of the water and
earth betweene the Sunne and the
Heauen in such sort, that continually, he
putteth himselfe before, according to the
sight of man, whereby wee see not anie
more then halfe the heauen: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the earth and the water are so
great bodies, yet they occupie not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
thing, nor deteyne the light of the
Sunne, that it doe not passe to geue
light to all the starres. This is because
the earth and water are so little things
in respect of the sunne, that well neere
they maye bee compared to a graine of
mustard seed, put before a great torche
lighted, which doth let nothing of the
light thereof, but that it doth extende
to all partes. Therefore all the earth
beeyng so little in comparison of the
Sunne, and the man beeyng well
neere of no quantitie in respecte of all
the earth, it seemeth to be farre out of
reason, to say that a man shoulde haue
the Sunne right ouer his head in anye
time or place, euen as there shoulde bee
no reason to saye, that a greate shippe
going by the Sea, may bee right

<pb facs="tcp:6833:48"/>
which were in the depth of the water:
or that a great cloude shoulde be right

as wel it seemeth, that there is no reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to say, that the sunne is right ouer the
heade of a man: seeing that the sunne is
alwayes, and sheweth it selfe vpon the
halfe of all the earth, by the which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
likewise it seemeth, that it ought
not to be thought, that the sunne in one
time is in the Equinoctial, and another
time at the North part, and another at
the South parte, seeing that these are
partes of the earth, and the sunne not
only is greater then these parts, but in
very great quantity, greater then all of
them, as it is saide, and so it is prooued
&amp; seemeth that it is an improper thing,
to say that the sunne is right vpon our

of the earth.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>A declaration.</head>
                  <p>For the declaring of this doubt, is to be
noted, that although the sunne is of so
great a quantitie, as before hath beene
declared, this doth not let, that a man
may haue him right ouer his head, and
in the discourse of the yeere he be in one
part or other of the earth, the which is
vnderstood in this manner, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the sunne is not to be considered
how great it is in it selfe, but how great
it is to vs, I will say according to our
sight, and according to the effect which
it maketh with vs. (An exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of this
is) that many times it happeneth to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that goe sayling, and they see very farre
of in the Sea a ship, and although shee
be very great, and goeth very swiftly, it
seemeth to him that beholdeth her, that
she is little, and that shee moueth not:
the same doth happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs with a great
cloude, which the wind doth carry with
great lightnesse: this is caused for the
great distaunce that is from the one to
the other, in such sort, that we iudge not
as it is, but according as the sight doth
represent it to vs: euen so the sunne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be very great, and mooueth
with great haste, we iudge not of it, but
according to our sense, for because in as
much as toucheth the hastinesse of his
mouing, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth is wel neere a point
of the circle, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne maketh, it is
certayne, that it cannot bee perceiued or
knowne according as his moouing is,
this is by reason of the greate distance
that is betweeene him and vs, and so
by this greate distance hee commeth to
diminish himselfe so muche in our sight
that he may be right ouer the heade of
of one man, and not right ouer the
head of another, that is one league
from him.</p>
                  <p>This is shewed, that in taking the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the sunne, one man will take
him very precisely right ouer his owne
head, &amp; another although hee bee neere,
will finde him sarre of from him, this is
bicause he was more right ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head
of the one then of the other. Likewise
this is shewed by the shadowes, the
which doe shew infallibly the moouing
which the sunne maketh from one part
to another: in such sort, that in one place
one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue his shadow so right,
that at the middest of the day, the sunne
doth make no shadow to any part, and

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the sixth Chapter of
this fourth booke, I said
how it is necessary when
the altitude of the sunne
is taken to knowe the
yere, if it be the leap yere,
or the first or seconde, or thirde after the
leap yere, because the dayes of one yere,
with those of the other haue not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and minutes equall, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because as in the third chapter of
this fourth booke hath beene declared,
that the yere called Solar, hath three
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth sixty fiue daies, &amp; sixe houres,
and that those sixe houres of euery one
yeere, from foure to foure yeres, do make
a natural day, and that such a yeere is
called a leap yere, so that the first yere
after the leape yeere, hath three hundreth
sixtie fiue dayes and sixe houres. And
the seconde yeere, three hundreth sixtie
fiue dayes and twelue houres, the sixe
of the first yeere, and sixe his owne, and
the third yeere, three hundreth sixetie
fiue daies and eighteene houres, the
twelue of the two yeres the first and
seconde, and the vi. his owne, and the
fourth yeere three hundreth sixtie sixe
dayes, so that in this fourth yere is shut

fourth yere being past, The first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and so the other yeres successiuely
as it is said, and for this cause they bee
not equall in degrees and minutes all
dayes one with another: Therefore it is
conuenient, as it is before declared,
when the altitude of the sunne is to bee
taken, that it be seene what yere it is,
and seeke what daye and moneth you
are in, and there you shal finde the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Philosopher saith,
that the art doth emitate
nature as much as hee
may, Likewise the saide
art many times helpeth
the defects of nature, this
is prooued, wherein we see that a man
which by nature doth want his sight,
the art doth help and remedy his want,
that is, by looking on a payre of specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
whereby in such sort, the sight is
gathered together, and is cause that he
seeth, the which he doth not without
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that it is scattered abroad. The
selfe same which is said of the sight, may
be said of the memory, that many times
it lacketh in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but it is certain that in
some it commeth by nature, but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by their owne vncarefulnes that
they forget themselues so much, that in
things which standeth them much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they take no heede. And concerning
this I doe remember as we came say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in a shippe, nienteene men, which
were seuen passengers, and twelue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
and hauing bin many dayes at
the sea, because the weather was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
there happened a cause whereby
it was conuenient that the purser shuld
write it downe in his booke for to giue
reason thereof when time should serue,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6833:59"/>
and he with the other that were there,
knewe not what day of the moneth it
was, nor there was any y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had it in his
remembrance, nor knew what day was
the first day of the moneth, vntil I told
him, nor any booke in the ship to looke
in whereby it might be knowen. And
this being brought for my purpose, I
say that here before hath bene declared.
that one of the thinges which ought
to be seene and knowen, for to take the
altitude of the sunne, is the declination
or distance which it hath that day from
the equinoctiall line, for not knowing
the declination how much it is, the said
altitude can not be knowen, whereby it
is necessary that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pilote or any other
person which shal take the said altitude
should knowe in what moneth he is in,
and howe many dayes of the moneth it
is, without hauing any errour or
want therein. And because of that
as I haue spoken of before, which
happened, it may happen the like in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or likewise if hee that taketh the
altitude be alone, or with little company,
and do not remember the reckoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayde,
for this it seemeth to me to be
a conuenient thing to helpe the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
by putting here the calender before
written, wherby may be kept a certaine
remembrance &amp; a reckoning of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
and day wherein he is, by looking
what day euerye moneth beginneth,
without any need to aske it of any. And
because such as do goe by some wayes
which hath not much used it, are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to set marks to know it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
So in this Calender, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
knowledge thereof, I haue put
marks which are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saints daies. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I saye to knowe what day in the
weeke is euery holy day of them afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayde.
The letters must be seene which
standeth before those daies of euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
&amp; see what letter of these serueth
in this yere for sunday, and is called the
the Dominicall letter, which shall bee
knowen by the rule afore written, and
being knowen, to stay in it which is sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
&amp; in another which is next mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>day,
&amp; in the other tewsday. And so al the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
dayes of the weeke named by the
seuen letters ABCDEFG. And by
reckoning in this maner, see what day
is the letter that is next to the holy day,
and in that yeere that is the proper day
of such a feast, the leape yeeres as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

those endes of the <hi>Ex</hi> are called poles,
the one is called Articke, and the other
Antarticke, and in the middest of these
two poles all the roundnesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
is deuided into fiue partes, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers
and Philosophers doe call
them <hi>Zonas,</hi> &amp; they are deuided in this
manner. The first zone is from the pole
articke, vnto the circle articke, and this
hath in latitude twentie three degrees,
and thirtie three minutes. The seconde
from the circle articke to the Tropike of
<hi>Cancer,</hi> hath in latitude fortie two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
&amp; fiftie foure minutes. The third
from the Tropike of <hi>Cancer,</hi> to the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pike
of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> hath in latitude forty
seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> degrees &amp; sixe minutes. The fourth
from the tropike of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
Antarticke, hath in latitude fortie &amp;
two degrees, and fiftie foure minutes.
The fifth from the circle Antarticke to
the pole Antarticke, hath in latitude,
twentie three degrees, and thirtie
three minutes: so that from one pole to
the other, are a hundreth and fourescore
degrees.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Zonas</hi> the first is called Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentrionall,

the fifth Australl. And it is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that these two poles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,

according to <hi>Albertus</hi> the great in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

the first treatie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sixe chapter, they are
to bee considered in this manner, in as
much as toucheth the moouing of the
circle of the fired starres.</p>
               <p>The pole Antarticke is the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
and the pole Articke is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour,
and according to the circle of
the Planets, the pole Articke is the
Superiour, and the Antarticke the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour,
and it is to be vnderstood that
such as dwell in the Equinoctiall line,
onely the place of the one pole they
see, and so we doe onely see in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
the place where wee imagine the
one pole to be: &amp; this is called Articks,
likewise Septeritrional, or Boreal: It
is called Articke, because it is neere to
the image called Arture. It is called
Septentrionall, by the seuen starres of
the <hi>Vrsa minor,</hi> whiche doth mooue
round about the sayde pole. It is called
Boreall by the winde <hi>Boreas,</hi> which we
cal North. The other pole is called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartico,</hi>
which is against, as though it
were put contrarye or opposite to the
Articke, and Australl, because from that
part commeth the winde called <hi>Austro:</hi>
it is also called Meridionall, because it
is towardes the parte of the middest of
the day, it is to bee vnderstood, that it
standeth towards the parte of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath beene declared
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chapter before this,
that how many degrees
are taken of the altitude

which taketh her distant
of the Equinoctiall line, because for this
effect to know the distance of the sayde
line, the sayde altitude is taken, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this present, I will speake how
this altitude which is taken of the pole
is to bee vnderstood. Of the which it
is to bee vnderstood, that when a
man is in the Equinoctiall line, he hath
both poles in the Horizon, as before
hath beene declared, and by how muche
hee is going from the sayde line, and
comming towardes the pole articke or
North pole, which is this that wee
speake of, by so much the sayde pole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
rising vpon his Horizon, so that if
the man bee distant of the line twentie
degrees, the same twentie hee hath the
pole, aboue his Horizon. Of this is to be
noted, that the degrees which are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the altitude of the pole, are not
to bee vnderstoode of those whiche are
from him, that taketh the altitude vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
to the pole it selfe: But it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that those haue gone raysing vp
the saide pole aboue his Horizon. For
because like as in the altitude of the
sunne, is not noted how much the sunne
is raysed aboue him that taketh his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
but it is to be seene, howe muche
he is raysed aboue the Horizon, whiche
is seene by these degrees, which are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the <hi>Astrolabio,</hi> so that in the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the North, it is not to be looked,
howe muche the pole is risen vpon him,
which taketh his altitude, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
hee is risen aboue his Horizon, in such
sorte, that to knowe the height of the
pole, there is no account or reckoning,
to bee taken betweene him that taketh
it and the pole, but the reckoning is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the pole and the Horizon. For if
the man shoulde keepe reckoning with
the pole, it woulde be said in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
from the Equinoctiall line, to the
pole, are nienty degrees, therefore if he
which taketh the altitude is twenty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Equinoctial line:
then it shoulde bee threescore and tenne
degrees from the pole, and woulde say,
seeyng I am in seuentie degrees of
altitude, I am so manye from the

               <p>This ought not to bee vnderstood
so, for it woulde bee a verye great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

so the vppermost part of the wheele his

the <hi>Mechanica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that which is saide, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
mooueth it selfe equally, it is to be
vnderstood in equallitie of time, but
not in equality of place, in such sort, that
in equall time they make their partes
in equall moouing, because these parts

mouing is one, and is to be vnderstood
wholly together: so that it cannot be,
that at one time one parte is mooued, &amp;
at another time another, but at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of one parte, all the other partes,
and all together are mooued: so that
when the Heauen mooueth, because his
moouing is a pure mouing, of his place
to his mouing all the partes doe moue
place.</p>
               <p>Item although that one selfe intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
doe moue the partes of the poles
&amp; likewise the others, which are more
distant, because all be continuall, they
are mooued together. And it is so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these partes are not put asunder,
nor deuided y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one from the other. And
if they were it is certayne that the lesser
partes should mooue more hastily then
the greater partes, the which is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the sayd intelligence doth mooue
them together, &amp; the moouer hath his
proportion to all, and not to part.</p>
               <p>And this is manifest, because in the

of an infinite smalnesse, for that to any

               <p>To the second doubt which is in the

there is not, respectiuely there is. And
to saye that the North starre is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

but to our respect, and so hee that

<hi>Cenith:</hi> the North starre should not be
from him more high nor more lowe, at

when the North starre doth goe from

wee saye that hee is aboue the pole,

which is from the West to the East, in
the other halfe turne that he maketh by
the foote, we say, that hee is vnder the

               <p>To the third is to be noted, that the
north starre doth goe rounde about the
pole, but although the turne, which hee
geueth, be in equall roundnes, he goeth
distant from the pole, more in one place
then in another, this is to be vnderstod
not as much as toucheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roundnes,

of the pole, in this manner.</p>
               <p>When the star is in any of the armes

more high nor more low then the
pole but in one equallitie with him.</p>
               <p>And for as muche as toucheth his

by the part of the head, or by the part of
the foote, so much he goeth aside of, from
the straightnesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pole. In such sort,
that when he is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is

that the circumference is greater in the

although the guardes be not seene, yet
by these three starres, or by any of

which is to be knowne in this manner.
These three starres which before are
spoken of, are called the third, the sixt,

the <hi>Sesta</hi> or sixe, two courses or winds

either the earth doth couer it, or

this. The pilot or other person, that
shoulde take this altitude, let him take
a staffe or rodde of the greathes of a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

let him ioyne his feete together,

equall from the poynt of his feete, as
farre as the rodde will reache, and let
him make two poyntes, the one where
he hath his feete, and the other as

put, let him take his altitude, making
the Horizon in the highest parte of the

this is his Horizon, wheresoeuer hee
findeth himselfe. And it is to be noted,
that if the night were as darke, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

time of the yeere, what houre of the
night it is, and for to know it, is to bee
noted that which followeth.</p>
               <p>First of all, looke vpon the North
starre and imagine vpon him a Crosse
in this manner.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Of this crosse the vppermost part, we
cal head, and the lower most part foote,

               <p>This being had, is to be vnderstood,
that betweene these foure courses or

deuide or parte these in the middest
which wee call lines, in this manner.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>So that there is a line betweene the
right arme and the head, and a line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the head and the left arme, and
a line betweene the left arme and the
foote, &amp; a line betweene the foote and
the right arme: this imagination bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made, it is to be vnderstood, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
greater starre of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two guardes, which
is the foremost, which before hath been
named the starre of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clocke, this starre
in twenty foure houres doth passe these
eight partes, tarrying three houres fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the one to the other. So that it at xii. of
the clocke in the night, hee bee in the
head at three, hee shalbe in the line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the head and the left arme, and
at sixe in the sayd arme, &amp; in that sorte,
the rest is to be reckoned.</p>
               <p>Of this doth remayne, that beeing
knowne in what part this starre should
be when it is midnight, foorthwith wil
be seene, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if he be there it is mydnight,
and if he be not come thither it is not, &amp;
if he be past, it is more then mydnight.
For this, it is necessary to knowe two
thinges: the one is, to know in euerie
moneth of the yeere, in what parte the
guarde starre ought to bee in, to knowe
when it is mydnight: &amp; the other, howe
it is to bee knowne, what houre it is,
more or lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mydnight. Of the first
this is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that is to bee vsed in this, is, that
at the middest of the moneth of Aprill,
when it is mydnight, then the sayde
guarde starre will be in the head, with
the North starre, and from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
euery fifteene dayes, the middle
of the night, is one houre forwarde: for
in euery day hee goeth forwarde foure
poyntes or minutes, and geuing to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
houre threescore poyntes, so that it
commeth to passe in euery fifteene daies
one houre forwarde. But in this I say
that I haue made experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce sometimes
with clockes of precise houres, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them punctually, at the poynt that
the Sunne setteth, and I finde that
vnto the twentie daye of Aprill, the
guarde and the starre, doe come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
at mydnight in opposite, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the difference is little: I doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the order of the figure following.
To the seconde is to bee noted, as
before hath beene declared, that in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
three houres the starre called the
guarde, doth passe from one course to
another, by the whiche there is to
bee deuided with the imaginatiue, that
space in three partes, and euery parte
of space will be one houre. In such sort,
that the place of the guarde starre bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
knowen where hee shoulde bee at
mydnight, is to bee knowne, if hee be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6833:68"/>
there, or if hee bee one houre, two, or
three, behinde or before, and so it wilbe
knowen what houre it is: and to know

euery halfe moneth of the yeere,
it must bee seene in this figure of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

is to be vnderstood, that the starre of

And likewise because the other instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,

<figure/>
I wil speake of the defectes that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
may haue, and how the pylot ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

which is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for one of these
sixe causes, the Compasse cannot iudge
the North.</p>
               <p>The first is, by the stiles not beeing
well touched with the Lodestone, that
he lacketh the vertue. And this ceasing
whiche is the cause, the effect ceasseth,
<pb facs="tcp:6833:70"/>
which is to shew the North.</p>
               <p>The seconde, because the capitall is
wrested, and not vpright, that he doth
not suffer the rose to goe right in his
steppe.</p>
               <p>The thirde, because the steppe is
brode, so that the rose cannot moue with
quickenesse.</p>
               <p>The fourth, because the rose lieth
downe, and hangeth more to one side
then to another.</p>
               <p>The fifth, because the chest of the rose
is open, in such sort that the aire entreth
into it.</p>
               <p>The sixt, if the sphere or the hinges,
whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eby the said boxe or chest is sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
are not so light that the chest and
the rose may goe equall.</p>
               <p>To the first, the pilot ought to carrie
in his chest a Lodestone, &amp; that he haue
experience that it be good, and with the
face thereof to rubbbe or touch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> points
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe subtlely vntil there cleaue
to it, a little of the saide stone, &amp; see that
it be with the face of the said stone, the
which hee ought to haue marked, to
which parte it is, for if it bee with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part it maketh not the true effect.</p>
               <p>To the second, which is the capital to
be layde downe, for to know when it is
so, take a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe &amp; put the one point in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of the capitall, and the other in
one of the circles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rose, &amp; therby you
shal know to which part he is wrested,
&amp; how much it is needful to dresse him,
&amp; it is to be vnderstood, that if the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
be not very vpright, the rose wil put
him cleane out of his place, although he
be very well touched.</p>
               <p>To the third, if the steppe bee broade
or flat, he ought to be finely filed, so that
it be seene, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the rose run not hastie nor
to slowly, and if by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yling of him, it bee
seene that the rose doth run ouer much,
touch him subtilly with some yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the
poynt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may be somewhat brode, so
that the rose may run ordinately.</p>
               <p>To the fourth, if the rose goe somewhat
laide downe, &amp; doe not goe very equall,
you may put to him some waxe, or
pitche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a thing that may cleaue fast
to him in the vnder part, vntill that hee
goe vpright, without leaning to one
part more then to the other.</p>
               <p>To the fifth, he ought to look that the
boxe or chest where the rose goeth be so
neere, that there goe not in any ayre as
well by the parte of the glasse, as by the
parte whiche is shutte, and if it bee
open in anye parte, with the sayd waxe
or pitch, it ought to be shutte.</p>
               <p>To the sixt, I saye that hee ought
so looke to the <hi>Sphera</hi> or hinges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the said chest or boxe goeth put, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the which it is sustayned or helde
vp that it bee so good and light that
the sayde boxe or chest goe alwayes
equall, in suche sorte, that although
the shippe doe hilde or doe lye downe
to one side or to the other, the sayde
boxe and rose bee alwayes right, for if
the yrons, wherein they mooue, be hurt
they cause that when the shippe doth
hilde to one side or other, the boxe
and the rose cannot iudge the North in
his proper place.</p>
               <p>So that it is conuenient that the
sayde Compasse or needle bee precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made without hauing defecte or
lacke, or if there bee any inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
although it bee verie little, it
causeth muche errour.</p>

               <p>The seconde, howe that in euery
foure and twentie houres, the Sunne
doth passe all the courses of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe.</p>
               <p>To the first is to bee noted, that this
name East and West is taken two
wayes, (that is to say) natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue:

and is vnderstood by the Equinoctiall

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middest betweene the two extreame

               <p>The respectiue is by any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of parte where a man is, now neare
the line, now farre off, so that if a man
be fiue degrees from the line, or tenne,
or more or lesse, all that he is in the same
degrees, hee shall be towardes the east
and respectiue towardes the west, in
such sorte, that all that hee is from the
place, where the Sunne riseth to the
Meridian where the man is, hee shal be
towardes the east, and that which hee
is from the man vnto the place where
the sunne setteth, hee shal be towardes
the west, and this likewise, is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode
being in the equinoctial, as
also foorth of the equinoctiall.</p>
               <div type="example">
                  <head>An example.</head>
                  <p>Of this may be asked, if the citie <hi>Seuill</hi>

towardes <hi>Leuante</hi> or <hi>Poniente,</hi> it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that it is not in the east &amp; west
naturall, and as much as toucheth the

is towardes the west, I will say, that
likewise it is towardes the <hi>Leuante,</hi> &amp;
it is towards the <hi>Poniente,</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner.
Of that which it is most occidental
is towardes <hi>Leuante,</hi> and of that which
is most orientall, is towardes the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niente,</hi>
so that if <hi>Seuill</hi> bee in thirtie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
degrees of the equinoctial, towards
the part of the north, all that it is in the

it is with <hi>Seuill</hi> east and west, in such
sorte that all that it is from the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
of <hi>Seuill</hi> vnto the parte of <hi>Poniente,

that which is from <hi>Seuill</hi> towardes the
parte of the <hi>Leuante, Seuill</hi> hath it tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<hi>Poniente.</hi> We haue an authour of
this, who is Saint Luke in the first
chapter, where he sayth, that the three
kinges came from the orientall partes
to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> it is to bee vnderstoode,
that as <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was more occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
then from whence they came, so
they came from the orient, to occident,
which is from the east to the west.</p>
                  <p>Therfore I say to our purpose it is not
to be vnderstoode that the course which
is marked in the compasse, is the east
&amp; west, respectiue, or accidentall, but the
natural which is by that straight course
which the Sunne doth describe in that
moouing which he maketh the eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th
of march, and thirteenth of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
for that is east &amp; west, that is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in the compasse, (that is to say) by
the equinoctiall, so that from the east
vnto the north are nientie degrees, and
seuen courses, besides the east and the
north, and the like vnto the south, And
if the east of the compasse were respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
the nientie degrees, nor the seuen
windes or courses, shoulde not bee
reckoned the which woulde bee a verye
great errour.</p>
                  <p>To the seconde, I saye that how
muche a man is farthest of the equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
so much the dayes will bee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to him when the Sunne goeth of
this parte where he is, and by reason
that the dayes are greater to him,
the rising of the Sunne maye bee dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to him, in this manner, those
whiche inhabite vnder the equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
or in any other parte, when the
Sunne doth describe the sayde lyne,
alwayes hee commeth foorth to them
in the east, and setteth to them in the
west, and they haue twelue houres
of day, and twelue of night, so that
in the foure and twentie houres wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Sunne maketh his daylie woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
hee passeth all the eyght windes
or principall courses of the nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
In suche sorte, that from three
to three houres, hee goeth from one
winde to another, and so hee riseth
and commeth foorth to vs at si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of
the clocke, at the east, and at niene
at the southeast, and at twelue at
the south, and at three at the south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west,
and at sixe at the west, and
there he setteth. So that in xii. houres
he goeth foure courses, but out of the
equinoctial, how much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day is greater
<pb facs="tcp:6833:71"/>
so many more courses the sunne goeth
in the day, and lesse in the night, so that
if the day be of fifteene houres, the sun
goeth in the day fiue courses and by
night three: and if the day be of eighteen
houres the sunne goeth in the day sixe
courses and by night two: and if the day
be of one and twentie houres, the sunne
goeth in the day seuen courses, and by
night one: and if the day be of foure and
twentie houres the sunne goeth twenty
foure houres in the day, whiche are
eyght courses, and that day there is no
night: as it happeneth to those whiche
inhabite in the circles, when the sunne
commeth to the tropikes. And that
which is vnderstood of the dayes when
they goe increasing, and the nightes
deminishing, the same is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
by the courses which the sunne
goeth by night when the day goeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing,
and the night increasing: as
shall be declared in the sixt chapter of
the eyght booke, so that the quantitie of
houres being knowne which the daye
hath, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pilot may knowe to what course

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is an opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
such as sayle that
the compasses doe north
stear, and northwestear,
and it is sayd that in the
Meridian of the Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des
of the Acores, that there the Compasse
doth shewe the pole in his place. And
from thence passing towards the west,
it doth Northwestear, this is that hee
sheweth not the pole in the place where
hee was first, but that hee goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
towardes the Northwest. And
if they come from the saide Meridian,
towardes the East, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
doth Northeastear, that is, to
make the sayde difference towardes
the parte of the Northeast, so that they
saye, that onely in that Meridian
the Compasse doth shew the pole, and
not in any other place: but to one part
or other: and howe muche more they
departe from him, so muche the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
haue more the sayde defect, but
those whiche vnderstande this, giue
no cause nor any reason, nor howe
much this difference is, which the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

maketh, nor howe farre it goeth,
so that they knowe not what to saye
more, but marking their Compasses,
it seemeth that whiche is sayde to bee
so.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I haue procured to seeke
some Authour or reason, or some thing
wherin this should haue a foundation,
and I say that of this variacion which
is spoken of the compasse. I finde not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing written, nor reason, nor experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that is certaine: therefore here I
will speake my opinion, touching this,
perswading my selfe to that which is
most naturall and true of the nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Therefore comming to the cause, I
say putting an example, if I make two
compasses of one selfe stile, and of one
temperance, and touched with one
selfe stone, and two shippes goe sayling
with them, departing from the sayde
Meridian one towardes the east, and
the other towardes the west, that these
compasses shall make, different effectes
in such sort, that in the one, the stone
and the stile, shoulde haue vertue to
cause northeasting, and in the other
to cause northwesting which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effectes, it seemeth not to mee,
that there is any foundation, or reason
to haue the like. But let vs see if
this bee in any thinge of the nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
lette vs seeke it in three partes,
which is in the pole or the compasse,
or in the waye where sayling now is
vsed.</p>
               <p>To the first, to saye that the pole
doth make any variation or distaunce
from his place or poynte, this ought
not to bee thought, because it should
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6833:71"/>
bee to put out of order all the order of
the <hi>Sphera,</hi> in such sort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixed cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
should be moueable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> besides this,
if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pole should moue with him that sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> east, it would moue it
selfe in the same tune with him whiche
saileth towardes the west. This is
vnpossible how much more, that the
pole cannot mooue to one parte or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
because it is a point immagined
alwaies fixed in one place.</p>
               <p>To the seconde, I say that it ought
not to be thought or vnderstoode, that
the compasse by himselfe maketh the
sayde difference, for it is certaine, that
the sayde naturall vertue or propertie
which the stone and steele haue in the
place where the compasse was made,
the selfe same they haue in the sayde
Meridian, and in the new Spaine, and
in Calicut, and in all partes. And there
is no reason to say, that this propertie
is of such qualitie, that in the saide Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
it hath one vertue, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which are well neere infinite, it
hath it in euery one, different, for if it
were so, it woulde bee to geue a greate
inconuenience, the which is that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> no
parte foorth of the sayde Meridian,
there coulde bee made a true compasse,
seeyng that in no parte the compasse
doth shew the pole but there, and to say
so it were a very greate errour, because
an instrument, so important to the naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
should not bee sayde, that in no
parte it coulde be made certayne, for if
it were so, it were to geue to the naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
an instrument with a knowne
errour.</p>
               <p>To the thirde, that is by the way
where you sayle, this is knowne, that
in any manner of place where a man
is, there hee hath his Meridian, the
whiche goeth precisely to remayne at
the poynt, whiche is the pole, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making any distaunt or difference
in any thing.</p>
               <p>And if it shoulde bee sayde, that by
reason of the waye which the Shippe
sayleth, the compasse maketh the saide
difference as well towardes the one
parte, as to the other, this woulde be
to make manye Meridians different,
the one from the other, and so they
shoulde goe to remayne at different
poles in such sort that how many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
the compasse went making,
by reason of the way: so many different
Meridians, the waye shoulde haue:
and too euerye Meridian of necessitie,
there shoulde a pole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> geuen, where
hee shoulde make an ende, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it woulde bee an infinite processe,
so that there shoulde bee geuen an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of poles. And to thinke
this shoulde bee a verye greate errour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so that it appeareth well, that neither
by the parte of the pole, neither of the
compasse, nor of the waye where you
sayle, the sayde compasse doe make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
variation or difference from his
proper place, but making more inquirie
of this variation, which of the compasse
is spoken: I say that commonly is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that the compasse doth shewe
the pole, but of this there is no writing
which doth say so: that which I finde
written of the Lodestone, and of yron
is, that <hi>Plinie</hi> in his thirtie sixe booke
of the naturall historie saith, and also
Saint <hi>Isidore</hi> in the sixteenth of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timologi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi>
that the Lodestone by one
hidden vertue or propertie, that it hath
doth specifie that it draweth to it yron
of this <hi>Auicen</hi> speaketh in the Booke of
<hi>Viribus Cordis,</hi> the tenth Chapter, hee
asketh what the cause is, wherefore
the Lodestone doth draw vnto it yron,
to the whiche hee aunsweareth, that
there is no other thing can bee sayde,
but because it hath a naturall vertue
to drawe it to him, and hee saieth that
some vnderstoode that hee draweth it
to him by reason of heate or coldnesse,
or because of similitude, that both of
them haue in nature, or for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
all the whiche hee saith is false,
for that hee draweth it not, but onely
with his propertie, and declaring
what thing propertie is, he sayth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
is found in nature in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
bodies, proceeding in them, a most
<pb facs="tcp:6833:72"/>
high and full influence, so that wee see

with the yron to shewe alwayes
one point, which is answerable to the
place where we doe shewe in the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
the winde at north: so that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeing
the pole is imagined in the heauen, and
is not seene, &amp; the compasse doth shewe
him in the horizon without any rising,
one only degree aboue the horizon: it is
cleare that neither the compasse doth
shewe the pole nor by the said compasse
the pole can be seene when it is equall
with him, nor when it is at one parte
nor at another, euen as I shoulde not
know, when I am right with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
I see not, nor when to one part nor to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
This being vnderstood, I mind
to declare here whervpon they ground
them selues, which are of opinion that
the compasse hath a Northeasting &amp; a
Northwesting, and the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they say, that they know it, which is
this. The pilots which doe ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e their
compasses doe behold the North starre
to marke them by her, but because this
starre doth alwayes mooue, as before
it hath beene declared, therfore they tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vntill the guardes be in the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east,
or in the Southeast, for then they
thinke, that the saide starre is in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
of the pole, vnder or aboue him, and
then they imagine a streke which des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth
from the saide starre vnto the
Horizon, &amp; they imagine another streke
which goeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poynt of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the compasse, vnto that poynt of
the Horizo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so that in these two strekes,
which they put in that poynt, they looke
if that poynt be straight vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North
starre, and so they speake what their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is without hauing in this anye
other account or reason.</p>
               <p>To this is to be noted two thinges.
The first that the guardes being in any
of these sayde courses are not in opposite
of the North starre, and the pole rather
is a poynt different, for because to stand
in opposite, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> guards ought to be in the
Northeast, and by North, or in the
Southwest and by South.</p>
               <p>The seconde, that this making iust of
the compasse is alwayes done by night,
because by day there is no starre seene.
And from the starre vnto the Horizon
the distance is very great, by which the
true poynt that is corespondent to the
sayde starre, cannot be knowen in the
Horizon: But that at one time is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
one, and at another time another.
Likewise for the greate distance, that
is from the sayde compasse vnto the
poynt which is imagined in the horizo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
And as that poynt is imagined, and
inuisible, alwayes the sight goeth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
without establishing it selfe,
whiche hath happened sometimes to
me, making experience in this. And
therefore I saie, that according to the
perspectiue rule, the precise poynt of the
Horizon cannot be taken with the only
sight which is imagined vnder the said
starre, nor it can make iustly equall,
the poynt of the flower of the compasse,
by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no certayne poynt, and
the distance very great, which is to that
as is imagined. For the sight fayleth
when the obiect is very dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Wherby
I conclude, that it cannot bee precisely
knowen in the compasse, by the manner
as it is said, if he make the said distance
of the pole, nor howe muche it is, nor
I by this waye coulde euer attayne
to it.</p>

               <head>The fourth Chapter, of the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which may followe by the

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong other inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that will follow in
the nauigation, if the
Compasses should make
the sayde variation or
difference, I finde foure
verye principals, which are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>The first if it be true, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
haue a Northeasting, &amp; a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>westing,
likewise it may bee sayde, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6833:72"/>
they haue a southeasting and southwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
and the reason is this, it is certain
that the variation or difference which
the compasse doth make to the parte of
the north, the same ought to bee made,
towardes the parte of the south, I will
say that how much the north pointe of
the compasse departeth from his owne
pointe, so much the south pointe of the
sayde compasse goeth distant to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parte, and so the north poynt of the
compasse doth northeast a quarter or
more, and the south pointe doth south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
the like, for the north point cannot
goe aside, but the south pointe doth the
like. And so when you shall sayle tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
the parte of the south, seeing that
there the north star is not seen to marke
by her, either it must be sayde, that of
that part the compasse doth not make
variation, or if it doe, that in the south,
it is to be known: and so when you shall
sayle to the riuer of plate, otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Rio de Plata,</hi> or to the straight of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galanes,</hi>
or by the south sea, or to the cape
of <hi>Buena Esperanca</hi> which is in englishe,
good hope, and from thence to <hi>Calicut</hi>
or the <hi>Maluco,</hi> then wil be said, that the
south point of the compasse doth south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east
or southwest, and to say so shoulde
be a great errour.</p>
               <p>The second if the north point of the
compasse doe make the sayde distance of
his proper place and point, it is certaine
that the selfe same difference and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
all the other windes of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation
shoulde make from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places, because howe muche any
winde doth departe from his proper
place, the selfe same all the others
shoulde doe by the agreeable order,
and equall distance, that they haue
in the compasse, the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and so none woulde answere
to the certaine pointe, that is shewed
in the Horizon, so that likewise, there
woulde mooue from theire place, the
east, and the west, and all the other
windes, this woulde bee a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience,
for the compasses, woulde
neuer agree with the cardes, this is
because alwayes the windes of the
cardes are fixed in one pointe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
moouing from thence, therefore if
the windes of the compasse doe make
many differences, it is certaine, that
they cannot be agreeable, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing:
The place whiche you goe
to seeke cannot in any manner of wise,
bee precisely hitte, but with greate
compasse, this will cause it by reason
the carde sayth one thing and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
another, and so there cannot bee
had a certaine accounte, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and leagues whiche are sayled,
rather all the accountes or recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges
of the leagues whiche is geuen
for a degree in euery course, shoulde bee
false seeing the pilot doth not sayle by
the course, whiche he thinketh he doth,
and so the reckoning whiche is made
by such a course, should not be certaine,
and if hee woulde geue allowaunce it
woulde bee nothing woorth, for hee
knoweth not of what parte nor howe
much, and so it woulde bee to adde one
errour to another.</p>
               <p>The thirde, if the variation or
difference whiche is spoken of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
were certaine it woulde followe,
that the compasses which were verie
distant of the sayde Meridian at the
east or at the west, they shoulde haue
great difference, if it be true, that howe
much more they are distant, so muche
more they haue the sayde defect, and
so all the earth, that shoulde be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
with these compasses, and should
bee sette downe in the carde, shoulde
not be in his true pointe, the reason is,
because the principall windes of the
carde (that is to saye) the north and the
south, the east and the west, are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in foure fixed pointes equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
which are the two poles and the
equinoctiall line: and according to
these all the other windes of the carde
are marked and parted, for if there
were put into the cardes any other
thing it woulde bee to make an errour
at the beginning, whiche is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
in a thing so certaine, as the
nauigation is, so that all these windes
are alwaies stedfast and fixed, in their
<pb facs="tcp:6833:73"/>
owne poyntes, without making va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
or any difference, so that all
which is placed with the compasse by
reason of his difference, will not be
aunswearable with the certayne point;
according to the windes which are in
the carde.</p>
               <p>The fourth, if the variation of the
Compasse bee true, immediatly would
follow greate difference betweene the
course and the altitude, because if I,
by my way or course doe seeke a lande,
whiche I knowe is in thirtie degrees,
or more or l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse, and I sayle by one point
the whiche I haue chosen agreeable
to the Altitude. It is certayne, that
by reason of the variation of the sayde
Compasse. I shall not goe by this
course to that Lande whiche I goe to
seeke, but rather when I haue gone,
the sayde way, I shall finde my selfe
foorth of that place, whether I goe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different, of the whiche, the errour
of the Compasse was cause thereof.</p>
               <p>And so in long wayes will alwayes
happen great hurtes &amp; inconueniences.
Therefore I say, seeing that the said o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
hath no more reason nor founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then that which is before saide, that
such as doe followe it, let them looke to
the hurtes and daungers whiche may
followe them.</p>

and this they say they doe to geue
allowance to that whiche the Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
doe Northeast, so that the Compasse
doth remayne, made in suche manner
that the stiles, and the slower are not
vniforme in shewyng the North point,
because the flower doth shewe him to
one part, and the stiles doe shewe him
to another: this is a knowne errour,
and it ought not to bee done in no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of wise, for the reasons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The first, if it be true, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
doe northeast and northwest: it
is also said that they doe as well north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east
as northwest, so that the difference
which is giuen to the one part, the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
is giuen to the other, and if it bee
so, by what reason shoulde bee giuen to
it the allowance, alwayes to the one
parte, and not to the other, therefore it
is certayne, that it to the nauigation
that is made towardes the West, the
allowance doth profite that whiche is
made towards the East, it would hurt,
seeing they are different the one with
the other, so that what it doth benefite
the one, it will hurt the other. Likewise,
with the selfe same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passes, which they
goe one any voyage, with the selfesame
they returne, without taking away, or
putting to any thing in them, thereby it
is cleere, that the saide errour is to bee
perceiued, seeing that the allowance
cannot serue to both partes.</p>
               <p>The seconde, if it bee true that in the
Meridian of the <hi>Acores</hi> the Compasse
doth not make anie difference from the
pole, I say that this cannot be knowne,
by the sayde compasses. (The reason is)
because the vertue of the Compasse is
in the stiles, and not in the flower, and
the pilot looketh not vnto the stiles, but
to the flower, because hee cannot see
the stiles, and the flower sheweth one,
and the stiles another, whereby as hee
ruleth himselfe by the flower he cannot
knowe the truth.</p>
               <p>Likewise what reason is there,
that there is geuen there to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
as much allowance, as in other
partes which are farre of. Of this doth
follow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the allowance or difference
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6833:73"/>
put in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe cannot be knowne,
when the pilot is in the saide Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
Therefore it is so as it hath beene
said, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the stiles doe shew, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
doth not shew. And so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be knowen, if it be not in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the saide Ilandes, by reason of the
difference that is betweene the stiles &amp;
the flower.</p>
               <p>The third I say, that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
wherfore so much allowance should
be geuen to the Compasse in the sayling
of a hundreth leagues, as in the sailing
of two thousand by the which reasons,
it is not conuenient, that to any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe
the saide allowance or difference be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
betweene the flower and the stiles,
but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be made euen very precisely,

howe muche the more shee went from

to appeare, and the neerer shee was,
the lesse it did appeare. This is not so,
because the Moone hath no cleerenesse

nor brightnesse of her owne, as in the

beene declared, the whiche is seene by
experience, because the Moone doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

the light of the Sunne, as there is
a lette, that shee cannot receiue it, she
remayneth darke. This light is let by
meanes of the Earth, as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and Astronomers doe shewe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the moouing which the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6833:74"/>
into the point, that the earth is directly
betweene the Sunne and the Moone,
the light of the Sunne geueth in the
earth, and so the Moone remayneth in
her owne likenesse, whiche is darke, so
that of her selfe, shee hath no light nor
cleerenes, but the sunne which is ouer
her, doth light her, although not euery
day alike towards vs, because as the
Moone is a body darke, when shee is
right vnder the sun, she is lightened of
the vppermost part, &amp; remayneth darke
towards the earth, &amp; therfore in her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
with the sunne, we see her not.
And it is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moone, she &amp; the Sun rise not in
one selfe place, but they rise at one selfe
time, &amp; so by meanes of the light of the
sun, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moone doth not appeare, because
comming foorth at one selfe time and in
one place the sunne woulde be eclipsed,
and so the eclipse of the sunne happeneth
in the coniunction of the moone, when
shee is in the heade or tayle of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.
And as by her moouing, shee goeth
away from the sunne, shee beginneth to
appeare vnto vs, and appeareth in the
manner of a thinne horne, and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she goeth from the sunne, the more
she shineth to vs. And at the eyght day
she shineth parted in the middest, and
at the fifteenth day she is full, for then
she is farthest of the sunne, the which is
prooued because it happeneth, when the
sunne doth set to vs in the west, shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
to come foorth in the east, and
then all the brightnes, which the moone
receiueth of the sunne descendeth tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
vs, and after she beginneth to goe
neerer to the Sunne, by the same
manner that shee went departing, and
when the light goeth vpwarde the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
descendeth, and so she turneth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
in the like sort as she went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing.
And it is to bee noted, that the
moone doth passe the circle of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> zodiack,
in tweentie seuen dayes &amp; eight houres,
and although that in this time, she ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
an end of her circle, there is geuen
to euery moone twenty niene daies &amp; a
halfe. The reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, because in those said
twentie seuen dayes &amp; eight houres, she
doth not ouertake the sunne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
passeth forward other two dayes,
and foure houres, a little thing more or
lesse, and so twentie nine dayes decying
past, aud twelue houres, and a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
in some more, and in others lesse,
the coniunction of the Moone and the
Sun is made. This is according to the
halfe mouing of the Moone, wherwith
is made equall, the mouing of all the
dayes, because according to the true
mouing which she maketh, at sometime

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a necessary thing to
take out the reckoning
of the Moone by the
Golden number, for that
the Golden number is
a thing whereby many
reckonings are made, and therefore
it is called the number of Golde, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I minde to declare in this Chapter,
that of the Golden number whiche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to our purpose, where I saye that
this reckoning of the Golden number
is, from one to nieneteene, so that the
Golden number is accomplished in the
time of nieneteene yeeres, and the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeeres beeing past, returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
to one and so for euer. The reason
why it hath this number, &amp; no more nor
lesse is because the nineteene yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
past, the Moone turneth to one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
day, of the yeere, of the Sunne, and in
this time shee finisheth and endeth all
those diuersities of coniunctions and
fulnesse, and other aspectes, which shee
hath with the Sunne in one only day,
degree, and minute, in this manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>I put the case that the Moone made
coniunction the first daye to Ianuarie
of this yeere. The yeere followyng
<pb facs="tcp:6833:75"/>
shee will not make the same coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the same poynt, but before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so we will speake the like of the
fulnesse, and other aspectes. And as
these bee not in an infinite number, it
is certaine that they are comprehended
vnder some number, or space of time.</p>
               <p>These are those sayde nieneteene
yeeres, in the which are to be noted, as
it is saide, all the diuersities of aspectes,
aswell of coniunctions, and fulnesse,
as of any other cause, which the moone
maketh with the Sunne, in such sorte,
that the nieneteene yeeres beeyng en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The Moone doth not turne to
make a new coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or opposition in
any degree or poynt of the Zodiacke,
that in the sayde time, shee hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done, and by this reason this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
of the golden number is ended

&amp; we call them nepe tides: so that
from the first day of the Moone vnto

the full Moone to the thirde quarter,
they goe decreasing, and from that to
the coniunction they goe increasing: &amp;
declaring this more at large, I saye
that the first daye of the Moone, is the
head of the water, and the second day,
the increasing is as greate, and the

fourth day it decreaseth, and so it goeth
euerye daye decreasing, vntill the

then it is altogether nepe tydes: and
the nienth is the like, and the tenth

it goeth increasing euery day vnto the

the accountes which before hath beene

much as to the naturall course of the

is not in all partes, or in all coastes that
the tides are equall, although they bee
in one Meridia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they come not so at one
time, by reason of the great currents, or
the straightes of the Sea, great gulfes,
or entraunce of Lande into the Sea, or
windes, or for other cause, by the which
alwaies the practise of the Land ought
to be looked vnto.</p>
               <p>Likewise, it is to be vnderstood, that
there ought to bee giuen allowance to
the riuers, because they make not the
tides according to the barre, and there
should be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them allowance, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

beginneth to ebbe more speedily, and in
the riuers it cannot bee done, by reason
of the holding backe or stay of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waters
that commeth from aboue, and the like
is to bee giuen at the flowing, this is
common, but the allowance is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

some doe flowe and ebbe more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>This is by reason that some riuers
haue more current then other some,

take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in 2. sortes,
that is to saye, a
natural day, and
an artificial day.
The naturall
day is a time of
foure &amp; twentye
houres, and is
called a naturall day, because hee is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
in all partes of the earth, habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the which day diuers nations doe
reckon by different wayes. The Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienses,
and Egyptians doe reckon it
from the setting of the sunne, vntill the
next day, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same houre. The Greeks,
Persians, and Babilonians from the
time that it riseth. The Romaines doe
<figure/>
reckon it from mydnight. The Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
doe reckon it from the middest of
one day to the middest of the next day:
the reason wherefore the Astronomers
doe reckon them so, is that which <hi>Ptho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome</hi>
writeth in the seconde and thirde
of the Almagesto, and Alstragano in
the eleuenth difference where they say,
that the cause wherefore the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
doe begin the naturall day, the
<pb facs="tcp:6833:81"/>
sunne being in the Meridian, &amp; not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he riseth, nor when he setteth, is because
the dayes in the rising of the sunne, and
setting of him, are different according as
euery habitation is neere, or distant of
the Equinoctiall line, &amp; the Meridians
in all the habitations are vniforme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all them doe passe by the poles:
so that the day is greater or lesser in one
habitation then the another, because as
it is not equall, which the Sunne doth
light in the Horizontes, Obliques, so it
is not equall in all partes, when hee ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and when he setteth.</p>
               <p>In such sort, that how much the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
of the Horizon is, so much is the
variation of the daies in length or short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and if this shoulde hee made euen
for all Horizontes, it were conuenient,
to haue for euery one a Table of equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the dayes, where shoulde bee
well neere an infinite number, so that
the Astronomers to flie so great adiuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
began the day, in the middest of the
day, because one is sufficient for al parts,
and seeing that wee haue spoken of the
natural day, let vs speake also of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
day.</p>
               <p>The artificial day is the time which
the sunne doth shewe light vnto vs, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aboue our Hemispherio, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the artificial day, because he is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in diuerse parts, &amp; because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
doe make their woorks in him, the
which is deuided into foure parts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to 4 differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, which the Sun ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.
In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first he shineth, in the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he
heateth, in the third hee burneth, in the
fourth hee warneth, the night conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
hath foure partes. The first is
the first sleepe, the second is mydnight,
when all thinges holde their peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is no apt time to woorke anye

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the day doth begin to
appeare. There is another time called
<hi>Cropusculo,</hi> and is, when it is neyther
day nor night: so betweene day and
night, as betweene night and day.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Cropusculo</hi> is that bright time,
whiche wee haue in the Morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sunne riseth, as likewise that
whiche wee haue in the Euening, after
that the Sunne is set: vntill the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the night doe come.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Cropusculo</hi> is greater or lesser,
according as the day is greate or little,
and so in the Sommer wee haue a
greater <hi>Cropusculo</hi> then in the Winter,
and in that parte it shoulde bee greater,
where the dayes are greater, and so we
see, that in Flaunders in the Sommer,
at te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the clocke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night, although it
be two houres after Sunne let, there is
so muche light, that any letter may be

               <head>The second Chapter, howe in the artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

what thing a daye is,
and howe the naturall
day, and artificiall day,
are vnderstood. In this
I will speake howe the
sunne comming foorth in the Horizon, &amp;
rising vp by our Hemispherio, commeth
to the Meridian, and from thence desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the orrident, where
he setteth to vs, and as this is done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
to suche as inhabite in the
worlde, of the which it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode,
that the going foorth which the
sunne maketh, euery day by our horizon,
is not equall one day with another, and
that this is true, experience doth shewe
it. And to be likwise so, the quantitie or
greatnes is not equall one day with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but of this is to be noted, that in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> degrees or distance of the equinoctial,
wherein the sunne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth foorth euery
day, in the same he setteth, likewise it is
to bee noted, that although the day bee
great or litle, alwayes a man being in
one place, the sun commeth euery day at
the middest of the day, into one self Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,
without any manner of varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:6833:81"/>
Likewise it is to be vnderstood, that
because the sunne commeth not foorth
equally at one time to all such as inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
in the world, nor all of them doe see
him at one time, so the middest of the
day is not made at one time to all. In
such sort, that how much the more anie
place is more easterly, then other, by so
muche, such is inhabite there, doe see
the sun rather, &amp; doth begin to appeare
rather to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then to suche as are more
westerly. And in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner successiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
euen as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sun goeth rising aboue the
Horizon of some, so hee goeth shewing &amp;
appearing indifferent partes to others:
so that when to vs it is the middest of
the day, suche as are more westerly, to
some it wilbe xi. a clocke, to other x, &amp;
to others it. And so how much more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
he is of vs towardes the west, so
much the later the sunne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth foorth
to them, and so by the saide reason, hee
commeth later to their Meridian, I say
more late to our respect, and such which
are from vs more easterly, because the
sunne came foorth to them first, then to
vs, they had the day first. And in this
manner, is to be vnderstood that at the
xxiiii. houres, that the sunne goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the world, when to some it is day,
to othersome it is night, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to some
it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, to others it is the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and when he riseth to some, he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to othersome, and when to some it
is midday, to others it is midnight.
This is because as the sunne mooueth
himselfe rounde about the world, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
goeth lightning the halfe of the
roundnes, doth cause the said differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.
And it is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the moouing
which the sunne maketh, he mooueth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
house by the roundnesse of water
and earth, 262 leagues, because the vi.
thousand three hundred leagues being
parted, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roundnesse hath in the
xxiiii. houres of the natural day, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to euery houre 262 leagues. And
so by this reckoning, looking what
houre it is of the day in the place where
a man as, he shall knowe what houre it
is in any other parte, knowing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the leagues which are to that
said place.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was an opinion of

that vnder the Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,

<hi>Torrida Zona</hi> was inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable,
the whiche they
beleeued, because y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there the sunne doth
send his perpendiculer beames, there
should bee such excessiue heate, that it
was not habitable: of this opinion was
<hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Ouid,</hi> &amp; other singular men.
Others there were, whiche healde that
some parte was habitable, following
<hi>Ptholome,</hi> which in the booke that was
compared to the arte of the <hi>Sphera,</hi> saith,
it is not conuenient, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we should thinke
the <hi>Torrida Zona</hi> to be altogether inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable.
Other there were, which heald
that there it was not only temperate, &amp;
without too much beate, but also most
temperate. And this is affirmed by S.
<hi>Isidore,</hi> in the first of the <hi>Etimologias,</hi>
where hee saith that the earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
is in the East part vnder the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall,
a most temperate place, and
<hi>Ptholome</hi> likewise saith in the thirde of
the <hi>Quadri partiti,</hi> that all the temperate
complections doe proceede of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall.
The experience doth nowe
shew vs, that not only vnder the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall,
but al the <hi>Tortida</hi> which is from
one Tropike to the other, is habitable,
riche, and plentifull, because well neere
all the yeere, the dayes and nights are
almost equall: so that the freshnesse of
the night, doth temper the heate of the
day, and so continually the earth hath
season to bring foorth and increase her
fruites.</p>
               <p>But it is to bee noted, that touching
the equalitie of the dayes &amp; the nights,
there may be had a doubt, and say that
the sunne in no time doth make equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the day with the night, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the artificiall daye is greater
then the night by these reasons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6833:82"/>
It is certaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a shining body being
greater, lighteth the darknesse more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
halfe, and as the sunne is greater then
all the earth, so that as it hath beene
saide, that it is the opinion of Alfraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
in the difference twentie two, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Sunne is 166. times greater then the
earth, so that the Sunne doth light the
earth more then the halfe.</p>
               <p>The lesser parte remayning darke, in
suche sorte, that the Sunne is seene in a
greater parte of the earth, then in that
part where he is hidde, and as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Sunne is cause of the day,
and his absence causeth the night, it
followeth, that the sunne neuer maketh
equalitie of the day, and of the night.
Likewise the aforesaid is proued, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a case is giuen, that the halfe of the
Equinoctial, is aboue the Horizon, and
the other halfe beneath, for the greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Sunne is the greater parte
where hee lighteth, then in that whiche
he hideth himselfe: it seemeth euident,
that the parte is greater that the sunne

                  <p>Contrary to that which is said are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I will speake of three in short
time. The first is, that our sight doth
manifest, how all dayes are not equall,
but some daies greater, and some lesser,
by the which whersoeuer is giuen grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

there be giuen an equalitie, so that as
there is a day greater then the night, &amp;
a night greater then the day, of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
must be giuen day and night equall,
because it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not passe from one extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to another, but by the meane: To
the seconde, the Philosopher saith in the
sirt of the naturall philosophie, that the
sunne being come to the Equinoctiall,
the moouing which hee maketh aboue
the earth, is equall with that which he
maketh vnder. And in like sort, the time
of the day is equall with the time of
the night.</p>
                  <p>The thirde, aunswearing to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
aforesayde, I say that it is true,
that the Sunite lighteth more then
halfe the eart, as the perspectiue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sheweth it, but it is to bee denied,
that the day in the Equinoctial is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the night, not because when so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
any part of the light of the Sunne
is seene, the day beginneth, but it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
when the <hi>Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

And so likewise when he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
the night beginneth. The reason
is because the Planets, and the starres
doe occupie a great quantitie, and their
place, and moouing is not to bee taken,
by any manner of parte, but it ought to
bee taken by the <hi>Center,</hi> and so it is said

the worlde, whiles the Sunne goeth
towardes the North parte, it wilbee to
him one day, that whiche his Horizon
doth discouer of the Equinoctiall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
without night, and if that
were of the quantitie of one signe that
day woulde bee of one Moneth. And if
of two signe, it would bee of two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes,
and so the rest: and hee that
were vnder anye of the poles, all the
yeere would be to him one day and one
night: In such sort, that if he were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pole articke, the sixe monethes
whiche the Sunne goeth to the part of
the North, woulde bee to him one day
without any night, and the other sixe
which he goeth towards the part of the
South, woulde bee one night, without
day, and so contrary it woulde bee, if he
were vnder the pole antarticke, so that
halfe the yeere, it would bee to him one
day, and the other halfe, one night. The
cause is, by reason the roundnesse of the
worlde, how much it goeth towardes
the poles, so muche it goeth to be lesser,
and so the Horizon of such as are neerest
to the poles, doe discouer more parte of
the turne whiche the Sunne giueth in
the heauen, when hee goeth from that
parte: In suche sorte, that the earth,
nor the water, doth not occupy the sight
of the Sunne, all the time that hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
rising vp, and turneth descending,
vntill hee commeth where his Horizon
doth not discouer any thing of the circle
or turne, that the Sunne maketh to the
worlde, and so how much more, the part
is which is seene of this turne, so muche
the day wilbe greater.</p>

And according to the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie of houres
which the day increaseth, from the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
day to the greater, those being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of the 6. monethes, which
the day doth increase, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider how
muche it is that it increaseth euery day,
giuing equall number or quantitie of
time to one day, &amp; so much to another.
And likewise when the day goeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
how much it is that it decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth:
in such sort, that the lesser day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

these 6. houres which he increaseth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
into 6. Monethes, the dayes
shoulde increase one houre euery Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
And so by the contrary in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
6. Monethes, it woulde decrease
an houre euery Moneth: (This is not
so) for in truth only in the Moneth of
March, the dayes doe increase as much
as they did increase in the 2. Monethes
of Januarie and Februarie, and by the
contrary, they doe decrease so muche in
the onely Moneth of September, as
they doe decrease in July and August:
also in the Kalenders, in the head of all
the Monethes is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the dayes
haue in euery Moneth, so many hours,
and the night so many. Of this is to be
vnderstood, that neyther the dayes are
equall in all the Moneth, nor the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the houres are one in all places.
For in the citie of <hi>Ceuill,</hi> the dayes are

&amp; in <hi>Burgus</hi> another, and so procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the place where the daye is of
24. houres: so that the dayes of euerye
Moneth be not equall in houres, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
dayes bee not equall in all partes, the
cause is, as the sunne maketh differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

of all the time that hee will increase, &amp;
from the 12. of Aprill, to the 12. of May,
he increaseth the thirde parte, and from

so that such as haue sixeteene, the

               <p>And it is to bee noted, that howe

which first of all, it is to be noted, that
for to take out the houre when the sun
shall rise, is to be reckoned from xii. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

that for when hee riseth take out of xii.

might bee a doubt say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
seeing that in some

dayes be great, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

part of the world the sunne shineth in al
the yeere more time then in other. To
this is to be noted, that although it bee

of the yeere, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dayes &amp; nights be greater

the sunne by his owne mouing, that hee
maketh in the yeere, at equal time of the

partes, so that as long time of the yeere
he is seene in the part where the dayes

great, the which is knowen in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
consider that which euery part hath
in it, of the day, and that which it hath
of the night in this manner, such as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite
vnder the equinoctiall, as they
haue continually, the dayes equall with
the nights, euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> xii. houres,
it is certaine that halfe the time of the
yere they haue day, and they see the sun,
and he sheweth light to them, and the
other half they haue night, that they see
him not, and such as dwell in fourtie
and two degrees which haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
day of xv houres, they haue also day
of niene houres, and so as the day goeth
increasing from xii. to xv. houres, so they
come decreasing vnto niene, in such sorte
that the said time, which they haue of
day, the same they haue of night, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
those which inhabite in
sixtie degrees which haue the greatest
day of xx. houres, they haue likewise
day of foure houres, and as the sunne
goeth lighting of them, &amp; the daies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
vnto twentie houres, likewise
they goe decreasing vntill the day be no
more but iiii. houres, and the night go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
increasing and diminishing the like.
And of those which inhabite in sixty sixe
degrees and a half, haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest day
of twentie foure houres, likewise they
haue night of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said xxiiii. houres, and
such as haue day of one moneth without

without day, and such as shoulde haue
sixe monethes of day without night,
shoulde haue other sixe monethes of
night without day, and so the time bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
considered which euery part hath of
day, and being seene, that as much iustly
it hath of night: So shalbe founde that
not onely in the torrida zona, by the
which the sunne continually moueth,
but likewise in the other partes very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and farre off, and also vnder the
poles them selues, so long time of the
yeere it is that the sunne is seene, as the
time that he is not seen, in such sort, that
the sunne giueth his light in equall time
in all parts, and not in one more then in
