            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

            <head>An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion wrytten by the Lady Iane, the night before ſhe ſuffred, in the end of the new teſtamente in Greke, whych ſhe ſent to hir ſiſter Ladye Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine.</head>
            <p>I Haue here ſent you, good ſiſter Katherin, a booke: whych although it be not outwardly trymmed with golde, yet inwardlye it is more worth then precyous ſtones. It is the booke, deare ſiſter, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of the lord: it is hys teſtament &amp; laſt wyll, whyche he bequethed vnto vs wretches, whyche ſhall leade you to the path of eternal

ioye. And if you w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a good minde reade it, and with an earneſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er folowe it, it ſhal bryng you to an immortal and euerlaſting life. It wil teache you to lyue, &amp; learn you to dye: it ſhall wynne you more, then you ſhoulde haue gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the poſſeſſions of youre wofull fathers landes. For as if god hadde proſpered hym, you ſhould haue inherited his la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, ſo if you apply diligentlye thys boke, ſekyng to directe your lyfe after it: you ſhalbe an inheritour of ſuche ryches, as neyther y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous ſhal wythdrawe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, neyther the thefe ſhall ſteale, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet the mothes corrupte.</p>
            <p>Deſyer wyth Dauid, good ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to vnderſtande the lawe of the Lorde your God. Liue ſtyl to dye, that you by death maye purchace eternall lyfe: or after your death enioie the life purcha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced you by Chriſtes death.
<pb facs="tcp:848:127"/>
And truſte not, that the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of youre age ſhall lengthen your life. For aſſone, if god call, goeth the yonge, as the olde: and labour alwaye to learne to dye, deny the world, defye the deuyll and deſpyſe the fleſhe, and delite your ſelfe only in the Lorde. Be penitent for your ſynnes, and yet deſpayre not. Be ſtrong in faith, and yet preſume not. And deſyer wyth S. Paul, to bee diſſolued &amp; to be wyth Chryſte, wyth whom euen in death there is lyfe. Bee lyke the good ſeruant, and euen at midnight be waking: leſt wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death commeth and ſtealeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you like a thefe in the nyght, you be wyth the euill ſeruaunt found ſlepinge, and leaſte for lacke of oyle ye be founde lyke to the fine folyſh wemen, and like him that had not on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weddyng garment, and then be caſt out from the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryage. Reioyce in Chryſte as I

truſt ye doe. And ſeyng ye haue the name of a Chryſtian, as nere as ye can folowe the ſteppes of your maſter Chryſt, and take vp your croſſe, laye your ſynnes on hys backe, and alwayes embrace him. And as touching my death, reioyce as I dooe (good ſiſter) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhalbe deliuered of this corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon, and put on vncorrupcyon. For I am aſſured, that I ſhal for loſyng of a mortall lyfe, wynne an immortall lyfe. The whych I praye god graunt you, ſende you of his grace to liue in his feare, and to dye in the true Chryſtyan fayth: From the whyche, in gods name I exhorte you, that ye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſwarue, neyther for hope of lyfe, nor feare of death. For if ye wil deny hys trueth to lengthen your lyfe, god wyll denye you, and yet ſhorten your dayes. And if ye wyll cleaue to hym, he wil prolonge your dayes to your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
