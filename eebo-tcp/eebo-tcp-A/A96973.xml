            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is that Man I mean, whoſe life ſpeaks the ſame <hi>Creed</hi> with his mouth, and whoſe Actions are the Chriſtian; and not your Chymical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Religion, that hath been twice <hi>Dipp'd,</hi> yet never <hi>Baptized;</hi> whoſe deeds of darkneſſe Eclipſe his <hi>New Lights;</hi> or rather whoſe very <hi>Lights</hi> are a cloud to conceal that darkneſſe, which is daily mask'd, and vail'd, and foil'd off to the world even with Light it ſelf. Being therefore ſuch a Chriſtian, as I ſuppoſe thee, you are to know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as to the <hi>Deſigne</hi> of printing theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> and ſomething alſo as to the <hi>Sermons</hi> themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And firſt for my <hi>Deſigne,</hi> I hope thou wilt not put any ſuch vain-glorious
<pb facs="tcp:119668:3"/>
thoughts upon me, nor uncharitable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſelf, as to ſay it was to appear in Print; a moſt ridiculous piece of Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, eſpecially in this <hi>Age,</hi> and this <hi>Way</hi> too, (the <hi>Way</hi> of Preaching): which I do acknowledge (as 'tis generally uſed in this Nation) to be the loweſt part of a <hi>Scholar,</hi> (if indeed it be any part at all) and that it is much harder to teach to <hi>Spell,</hi> according to the right rules of <hi>Spelling,</hi> then to make every day of the week a sermon, as sermons are uſually now made. Much leſſe, <hi>Reader,</hi> would I have thee cenſure my <hi>Deſigne</hi> here to be guilty of that unpardonable ambition, as to make thee believe I were able to pen either like that incomparable <hi>Pair</hi> of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or the other incomparable <hi>Pair</hi> of <hi>Students,</hi> who were the <hi>Prime Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of this Nation in their ſeveral <hi>Waies</hi> of <hi>Preaching.</hi> The chiefe thing then that I drive at in printing theſe sermons, is to ſhew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Univerſitie</hi> and <hi>Citie-breeding</hi> up of <hi>Preachers;</hi> and to let the people
<pb facs="tcp:119668:3"/>
know, that any one that hath been bred a <hi>Scholar</hi> is able to preach any way to the capacitie and content of any <hi>Auditorie:</hi> And <hi>ſecondly</hi> that none can do this but they onely that have had ſuch Education. For truly as to thoſe ſo much talked of now-adaies extraordinarie <hi>Inſpirations,</hi> this <hi>Age</hi> is ſo exceſſively ſinfull, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly wicked, beyond the <hi>daies</hi> of our <hi>Fore-fathers,</hi> that I cannot ſee that man that is any waies fit for ſuch <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> And therefore upon this account there will appear to be a very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie, if not neceſſitie of <hi>Humane Learning;</hi> eſpecially foraſmuch as it is too clear and evident ſince theſe <hi>Times,</hi> that all men will not be brought by the ſame way of preaching to heaven: ſome are well ſatisfied with the plain eaſie way of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Uſe;</hi> others are not taken with any sermon, but what is fill'd with depth of Matter, height of Fancie, and good Language. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it were not an ill wiſh for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> if all her <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:119668:4"/>
were <hi>Scholars</hi> likewiſe, able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themſelves upon any occaſion, any way, to take every ear, and prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every minde and fancie. So ſhould I ſee an <hi>Engliſh Clergie-man</hi> to equal at the leaſt the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> or <hi>Capuchine,</hi> who by his exact skill in the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> can command a confuſed <hi>Rabble</hi> (met to ſee an <hi>Interlude,</hi> or <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank)</hi> from their ſport to a sermon, and change the <hi>Theater</hi> into a <hi>Church;</hi> having a greater power over the paſſions of their <hi>Auditorie,</hi> then the <hi>Actor</hi> hath upon the <hi>Stage;</hi> being able to turn even the <hi>Player</hi> himſelf into a <hi>Monk,</hi> and the <hi>Mimical Jeſter</hi> into a religious <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie.</hi> By this time <hi>(Chriſtian friend)</hi> I hope thou ſeeſt that my deſigne in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe few ſheets publick, was not in any vain-glorious way for thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, but inſtruction onely, to teach thee the neceſſitie of that known diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between a <hi>Scholar</hi> and a <hi>Preacher.</hi> Not that I aſſume to my ſelf the firſt, no more then I dare the Learning of any of
<pb facs="tcp:119668:4"/>
thoſe whom I have here propoſed to thy imitation; but to ſhew thee what a <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> may do more then a meer <hi>Preacher,</hi> and that there is a vaſte difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Shop-board-breeding</hi> and the <hi>Univerſities;</hi> the preaching of the one being hardly learn'd under a double <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip,</hi> whereas the other <hi>Knack</hi> may be compaſs'd far ſooner then the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt <hi>Trade,</hi> a truth which theſe <hi>Times</hi> have abundantly clear'd: and this I look upon as a juſt judment upon ſome <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants</hi> in this <hi>Nation,</hi> who held the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in hand they were the onely deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Church-men</hi> among us, becauſe ſomewhat more forward then the reſt of their <hi>Brethren</hi> in a popular way of <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;</hi> when now a company of <hi>Cloaks,</hi> ſcarce free of the <hi>Citie,</hi> have yet made themſelves free of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and have out-done thoſe other <hi>Predicants</hi> even in their own way <hi>both</hi> of <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Preaching.</hi> And truly were it not for the ill example in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; thoſe bad couſequences that might follow
<pb facs="tcp:119668:5"/>
upon ſuch an example, I would teach my very <hi>Barber,</hi> and <hi>Shoomaker,</hi> and <hi>Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> the <hi>Preaching-trade;</hi> that ſo the Common people ſhould ſee how ſlight, and eaſie, and contemptible a thing it is to be a <hi>Preacher,</hi> as Preachers are now adaies; and that their <hi>God-amighties</hi> of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> which for theſe late years they have ſo much adored, are of no higher Gifts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor of a more divine <hi>Miſſion,</hi> then what may proceed from a <hi>Thimble,</hi> a <hi>Shuttle,</hi> or a <hi>Laſt.</hi> And therefore ſay I (were it not for the ſcandal) I would teach my <hi>Mechanick Relations</hi> to preach: by which Act though ('tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd) I ſhould appear no good <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> yet herein I ſhould perchance ſhew my ſelf no bad <hi>Common-wealths man:</hi> foraſmuch as there is no way left under heaven to undeceive the people, and take them off from their ſuperſtitious idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing this kinde of <hi>Preaching,</hi> but this. For when they ſhall clearly ſee, that any one of any <hi>Trade,</hi> and he too ſometimes very deboiſt and vicious, can ſerve the
<pb facs="tcp:119668:5"/>
                     <hi>turn</hi> of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> they will then begin alſo to know, that it is not <hi>Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> knows full well, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly doth make this uſe of it at this day in this <hi>Nation.</hi> Which ſad truth as often as I ſeriouſly think upon, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly brought upon my knees, and to my praiers, for God's mercie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of our <hi>Pulpit-ſins;</hi> in that we have praied and preach'd the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of three flouriſhing <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> into complicated <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Confuſion,</hi> &amp; this too mingled with the blood of near upon an hundred thouſand <hi>Proteſtant Chriſtians</hi> (ſo much is the number of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Romes</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries leſſened ſince the year 1640). I would to God that all ſuch of my own <hi>Coat,</hi> whom this concerns, would but cordially think upon it; and know for certain, that though their <hi>bonus Genius</hi>

                  <p>Theſe words are a precept, or command: in which, may it pleaſe you to obſerve, firſt the Subſtance or main buſineſſe of it in the word Faſt, <hi>jejunabunt,</hi> they ſhall faſt; next the Circumſtance, or time meaſuring this Faſt, implied in the Adverb [then] <hi>&amp; tunc jejunabunt,</hi> and [then] ſhall they faſt.

to Faſt, yea and to Feaſt too, but they'l do neither.

ſure. How theſe men can anſwer my text I know not, ſure I am Expoſitors give it up for a main precept of faſting, and by ſuch an one enjoined, who could command a Faſt to the Sea and Grave, two great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers, and both ſhould abſtein, the one from a <hi>Peter,</hi> the other from a <hi>Lazarus.</hi> A precept then perchance they will grant it, but by whom to be obeied: <hi>tunc jejunabunt then they ſhall faſt,</hi> they, Chriſts diſciples dead long ſince, and their.

And ſo much for the Tenſe <hi>ſhall,</hi> next for the Verb <hi>Fast,</hi> and about this I told you there was a queſtion: Now that all queſtions may be fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, 'tis neceſſary the terms ſhould be fore known, <hi>an ſint, &amp; quid ſint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> whether there be any ſuch things or no, and what thoſe things be; the ſame method muſt we obſerve about our terme of <hi>faſt,</hi> adding withall the <hi>cur ſit,</hi> the ground and reaſons of faſting: Firſt then let us enquire alter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119668:13"/>
the <hi>an ſit,</hi> whether there has been ſuch a thing in the world as Faſting, and that there has, I could bring down, if I ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as others have done in leſſer caſes, from the very beginning of the world. <hi>Nam à principio fuit ſic,</hi> it was ſo even in Paradice, and the firſt precept God gave our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers after their Creation was that in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Yee ſhall not eat of the tree of good and evil,</hi> not eat, that is faſt. And ſurely had their meat and drink been to have done the will of him that ſent them, that other place of Scripture had not followed, <hi>Meat for the bellie, and the bellie for meat, but God ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both it and them,</hi> there had been no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, nor cutting off from eating now. Thus was it before the Law, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe under it: for you ſhall finde <hi>Moſes</hi> commanding the children of Iſrael, and that twice in one book, to keep a ſtrict faſt every year on the tenth day of the ſeventh month: and a ſtrict Faſt it was, even like unto that in Paradice, <hi>In the day thereof that he eats, the partie muſt die the death,</hi> Levit. 16. Now more then this one day, though wee read not that <hi>Moſes</hi> ordained, yet Prophet <hi>Zechary</hi> in his 8 <hi>Chap.</hi> has his Faſt of the fourth, his Faſt of the fifth, and his Faſt of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119668:13"/>
the tenth month; and not onely Prophet <hi>Zechary,</hi> but Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> and Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> may be brought in for faſters, this laſt for his three full weeks of abſtinence, <hi>Eliah</hi> for his 40 daies; for which act alone he might very well be interpreted by Chriſt of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, they both being our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours fore-runners, <hi>John</hi> in his Doctrine, <hi>Eliah</hi> in his Faſt. Now for the <hi>quid ſit,</hi> what faſting is; all that I have met with, define it to be, <hi>An abſtinence from meat and drink, joined with an inward grief and ſorrow of heart:</hi> which laſt part is made good from the very text: Our Saviour was ask'd, Why faſt not thy diſciples? and he ſaid, Can the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Bride-chamber mourn. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was of Faſting, &amp; his anſwer of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; as if faſting and mourning had been all one: and that this outward faſt of the bodie is an abſtinence from all natural food clearly appears out of <hi>Eſthers</hi> 3 daies faſt, a long Lent for a Queen. Now leaſt any ſhould ſay we are the children of grace, as little bound to your old Teſtament Faſts as your old Teſtament meats, let ſuch but turn over their Bibles, and they ſhall meet one bringing both Aſhwedneſday and Lent home to them in the Goſpel, I mean the

and faſting wee muſt take it, if wee would have it worke kindly. Nay Saint Baſil in his firſt <hi>dejejunto,</hi> ſaies, it works not at all upon a full ſtomack: <gap reason="foreign">

The meaning is according to S. <hi>James;</hi> As faith without works, ſo repentance without faſting is little better then dead: and again, As faith without works ſo faſting too without works is dead: and this is another end of our faſts, the exerciſe of our charity &amp; alms. To keep a faſt for a nation and relieve it not, is but to repeat that Sarcaſme in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of S. <hi>James, Depart in peace,</hi> when they are already deſtroied by war; <hi>warm your ſelves and fill your bellies,</hi> without fire or meat. Could we everimagine how our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould rout an enemie, or our faſts raiſe a ſiege? <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt ſight againſt <hi>Amalek</hi> as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> pray; it were well then if they would order it, that our hands may be lifted up no leſſe then our votes and praiers, and our Cheſts lie as open as our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors. For this is to faſt ſaies God by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, To deal thy bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, to bring the poor to thy houſe;</hi> Iſrael was not chid for eating, but laying up of their

Mannah; and therefore ſaies a Father, <hi>Ita jejuna ut alio manducante prandiſſe te gaude as,</hi> ſo faſt, that the poor may fare the better for it; let thy Eves be their Feſtivals, thy Lent their Eaſter. And now we have got a faſt for our time, let us ſee whether wee can finde a time for our faſt, a <hi>tunc</hi> for our <hi>je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junabant,</hi> which is my laſt part to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the circumſtance or time of this faſt, implied in the Adverb <hi>then, And then they ſhall faſt;</hi> and then. Allowing the thing, we can't chuſe but allow it a time, for there is a time for every thing under the Sun: <hi>a time to weep, and a time to laugh, a time to mourne, and a time to dance</hi> (ſaies the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher) to dance when the Bridegroom is with us, to ſit down and mourn when hee is taken away, when the marriage feaſt is at an end; and this is that <hi>then</hi> in my text, <hi>then ſhall they faſt;</hi> that is, when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom is taken away; and the Bridegroom is taken away, ſaies our Church Homilie, when we are caſt down with ſickneſſe, grief of minde, or the like. As for ſickneſſe 'tis a plain caſe that takes away the ſtomack quite, and the time of grief is a time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting too. Thus <hi>Hannah</hi> when ſhe was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided by her adverſarie, wept: and how
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119668:18"/>
then? and did not eat ſaies the 1 of <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 7. nor drink neither, I believe, unleſſe her tears. So <hi>Ahab</hi> alſo when he could not obtein the Vineyard, mourn'd: I, that's granted you'l ſay; for 'tis wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and <hi>Naboth</hi> denied that; mourn'd? yes and faſted ſaies the text, no meat would down with him he was ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed. And ſo 'tis here, while Chriſt was with the Apoſtles, they could not grieve, for they had the fulneſſe of joy; but when that fulneſſe of joy was to be taken away, then they ſhall mourn, <hi>&amp; tunc jejunabunt</hi> and then they ſhall faſt, mourn and faſt all one in the text. Another time of Faſting is the time of danger; for when men are in jeopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what pleaſure can they take in meat; knowing not how ſoon they may eat their laſt. When the children of Iſrael ſaw the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians, at their heels, they had no time then to think of their fleſh-pots and onyons. And this then, this time of faſting is the moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in all the Scripture; if a plague, famine or Rabſhekah bee fear'd, ſanctifie a faſt in all haſt, put on ſackcloath, ſend for the Arke. And thus was it with the Apoſtles, Chriſt was their rocke and ſure tower of defence from all danger, and the feare of it: but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119668:18"/>
when this rocke was removed, when Chriſt was once taken away, then they were at St Pauls <hi>quotidie morimur,</hi> every hour in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be drawn to the ſtake, <hi>&amp; tunc jeiuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> and then they did faſt. Now if for the effect of ſin we faſt, for the cauſe for ſinne it ſelfe much more: and this then, this time of faſting for our ſinns, ſhould wee duely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, our <hi>tunc</hi> would bee <hi>nunc,</hi> our <hi>then</hi> would be <hi>now,</hi> and as now <hi>ita nunc &amp; ſemper &amp; in ſecula,</hi> ſo both now and for ever; for ſhould wee live alwaies, wee ſhould ſinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and ſo faſt alwaies. But this becauſe wee cannot, nay, were it poſſible wee could, I beleeve wee would not; for were wee left to our ſelves, our <hi>then</hi> would be then when wee <hi>liſt,</hi> and if wee liſt and not elſe; I ſay therefore cauſe wee neither can faſt alwaies, neither will faſt of our ſelves ſcarce at any time; the primitive Church thought it fit to enioyne the people their ſet <hi>there;</hi> their ſolemn daies of faſting, which are theſe fortie daies now at hand, &amp; the wedneſdays &amp; fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies of every weeke, <hi>&amp; tunc jejunabant,</hi> and then ſaies the Church, they ſhall faſt.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119668:19"/>
of this <hi>then</hi> in the text; for as for the wedneſday and friday in that <hi>magnâ &amp; ſanctâ hebdomadâ,</hi> that great and holy week, as the Fathers call it, the Paſſion-week, the weeke next before Eaſter, 'tis confeſs'd on every ſide the bridegroome was taken from them; for on wedneſday counſel was taken againſt him, money was taken for him, and then <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſaies the Evangeliſt, he was taken, as good as taken away then; but upon the friday following, as we all know, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and taken away quite; and therefore then in a more eſpecial manner they did faſt: and not onely then, in the Paſſion-week, but then on thoſe daies (at leaſt one of thoſe daies, the friday) ever after. For this then muſt be interpreted of the whole time after the taking away of the bridegrooms bodily preſence; <hi>tum, tamdiu;</hi> then all that time and courſe of years till his ſecond coming. Now for this time of Lent ſomething may be ſaid to bring it near the text: as that then when we faſt for the Bridegroom, we ſhould faſt w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Bridegroom (as he did) fourtie daies; thus applying that precept of our Saviour (that we ſhall faſt) to his own example, how we ſhould faſt. And this example both the Apoſtles after Chriſt, and the Church after
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119668:19"/>
the Apoſtles have ſtrictly followed: whoſe intent it ever was in the celebration of theſe her holy Solemnities, not onely to inform us in the myſteries commemorated, but alſo, and that chiefly, to conforme us thereby unto him who is our head, and the ſubſtance of all our rites and cuſtoms.

For repentance is the agonie, the bloodie ſweat, the croſſe of every Chriſtian: whereby he dies unto ſin, and is crucified with his Saviour.

He had brought the Iſraelites with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of their long-look'd for inheritance, but himſelf muſt enjoy the beatifical viſion, and that Jeruſalem whereof the promiſed was but a type. The governors of God's Church would be thought but poorly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, were their wages onely the milk and honie of a temporal Canaan. He that ſends them to dreſſe his Vineyard is pleaſed to ſtand indebted for a better peny then this earth is maſter of. To receive this, our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet muſt aſcend Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> and die. And here ſince God had ſo well provided for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Moſes</hi> will do his beſt for God's people; being not ſatisfied with his own happineſſe, unleſſe his charge may proſper; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

to have been their convoy all his life, except he might direct the way at his death alſo. 'Tis a clear Sun-ſet that commends the day, and the chief grace of the Theater is a good com off: wherefore our Prophet reſervs his beſt Scene for the laſt Act, and in in the evening of his life ſhines moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; breaking forth upon the Tribes with a double ray of counſel and bleſſing. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the former Chap. <hi>Set your hearts to do all the words of the Law, &amp;c.</hi> How divine a care it is while we are on earth to improve others for heaven, and after the aſſurance of our own eternitie, to help our brother to the ſame happineſſe. But counſel is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth, unleſſe a bleſſing follow it; as that Sermon is unedifying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For of <hi>Reuben</hi> it is ſaid, Let not his men be few; of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> that he was the beloved of the Lord. Thus ſtill the retinue, the ſervants are entail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt-born, but the laſt is heir to his parent's love, that is the young maſter, this the darling. All but <hi>Levi</hi> were for temporal ends, &amp; their legacies are anſwerable: <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:119668:22"/>
gives them as much as they cared for. <hi>Zebulun</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſſachar</hi> ſhal be fill'd with the treaſures of ſea &amp; land, &amp; that's enough to ſtop their mouths. <hi>Benjamin</hi> ſhal be bleſs'd with repoſe &amp; ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and hee'l gladly ſit down with that. Laſtly ſurround <hi>Judah</hi> with a ſpatious crown, and large territories, you ſet him upon the higheſt pinacle of his ambition. But now it is not wealth, nor eaſe, no nor honor that beſt ſuits with the Ephod: all worldy bleſſings are jewels of too low a price, too faint a blaze and luſtre to be ſet there; <hi>And therefore of Levi he ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The text conteins the Levites portion, and may be divided into three parts; the Donor, the Donative, and (as our Law terms it) the Donee, or partie endowed. The Donor you have implied in the Pronoun <hi>Thy,</hi> and that's God, who relates to each part; for 'tis <hi>Thy Thummim,</hi> and <hi>Thy Urim,</hi> and <hi>Thy holy One,</hi> all are Gods. And ſo 'tis not our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection nor innate holineſſe, nor our own illumination or private ſpirit, neither is this holy One one of our own making, any invention of man, but an order founded by God himſelf. Secondly the Donative is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Thummim and Urim, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are perfection and illumination as the Rabbins, holineſſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119668:23"/>
and learning as our own men interpret; the two main things enquired after, not onely by the Univerſitie in degrees, but the Church in all her Ordinations. And laſtly the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie endowed with theſe gifts, the holy One, includes the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance that of the Old, by correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this of the New Teſtament. For Thummim and Urim reſpects the Clergie in general, and is as large as bot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. Of theſe particulars very briefly, and firſt of the Donor as he ſeverally relates to Thummim, Urim, holy One<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Non per nos-ipſos necviribus natura, ſed perſpiritum ſanctum</hi> was the doctrine of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church: our will here being like a lower ſphere, <hi>quae non niſi mota movet:</hi> if no inſpiration no co-operation; and our graces are as the money in <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s ſack, of anothers putting in; all ſpringing from Chriſt, as the branches from the Vine, and ceaſe to be graces when they forget their Author. Our ſtrength then is but borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our going but leading in God's hand; who is to us what his Cloud was to Iſrael; if he pleaſe to make a ſtand, we know not which way to turn our ſelves; meer nature cannot direct to heaven: and therefore wee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119668:23"/>
ſay well in our praier, <hi>for thine is the Power, and the Glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> it being by that Power wee come to this Glorie. Secondly as our Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim, ſo our Urim too is from God; for there is no illumination but proceeds <hi>à Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre luminum,</hi> ſaies Saint <hi>James,</hi> from Him that enlightens every one that coms into the world <hi>à Patre per modum naturae,</hi> as the child from the father; <hi>à Patre luminum per modum emanationis,</hi> as the ſhine from the Sun. As well then the Fierie-tongues as the Dove come from on high, Learning no leſſe then Innocencie. Thus if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> have a door of Utterance, God himſelf keeps the Key: if <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s lips want purifying, no leſſe then a Seraphin muſt expiate them, and hee too with no fire but the Altars: neither Prophets nor Apoſtles can ſpeak <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as 'tis in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. the wonderful works of the Lord, unleſſe the Holy Ghoſt firſt bring the Tongues. But now <hi>quis vituperavit?</hi> not the moſt factions but will agree that Thummim &amp; Urim, all perfections and illuminations, even thoſe dim ones of their own private ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are of God, but this holy One not ſo far fetched; &amp; therefore you take too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, yee ſonnes of <hi>Levi, ſeeing all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is holy, even as your ſelves.</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:119668:24"/>
And it muſt needs be granted they are ſo; all the Congregation of the Lord ſanctified as well as his Prieſts, yet not to the ſame degree of holineſſe, but they <hi>ſicut populus,</hi> as Gods people, theſe <hi>ſicut Aaron,</hi> as his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſervants; they are holy 'tis true, but theſe holieſt of holies. Hence it was that when the Law kept Ordinations, certain pieces of the Sacrifice were put into the Prieſts hands; and now inſtead of that, a Bible into ours: Not onely as a rule to direct, but a ſacred witneſs of that profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into which wee are by a Divine hand inveſted. Hence alſo it is that we ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten meet with a <hi>mittet operarios,</hi> and a <hi>dabit Angelos,</hi> all of Gods miſſion. And indeed who more fit to appoint Laborers for the Vineyard, then the Lord of the Farme; who Steward for the houſe, if not the Maſter. None then may uſurpe this holy charge, aſſume this honour. We are Embaſſadours; and 'tis treaſon to enter upon an Embaſſy, before commanded by our Prince. And therefore to bee <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> a man's own ordainer, as <hi>Baſil's</hi> word is, to clap down into <hi>Moſes</hi> chair upon a vain Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſme is prophane preſumption; and not to undertake our Office, but to invade it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119668:24"/>
ſo eſteemed of God, as may appear by that feareful Ironie to the falſe Prophets, <hi>I ſent them not, yet they run;</hi> run, knowing nor why, nor whither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> in <hi>Samuell,</hi> and at length like him too, they can tell no tidings. Thus neither unbidden nor yet unprepared gueſts, may come to this Supper of the Lord: For a wedding garment is required. Whom God imploies in his ſervice hee calles, and whom he calles he cloathes; gives them as well abilities of doing, as autority to do: which leads me to my ſecond part, the double Donative, <hi>Thummim</hi> and <hi>Vrim,</hi> life and learning, the two maine things enquired after by the Biſhop in all Ordinations; <hi>And of Levi hee ſaid, Let thy &amp;c. Thummim</hi> and <hi>Urim,</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on takes place of Learning, and he muſt firſt be good to himſelf, that will be ſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For which end the antient Fathers, led by example of the Prophets and Apoſtles (ſaies our Canon) appointed Ember-weeks before Ordination, a ſtrict ſevere govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our owne affections, ere we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority to guide the peoples: example being the life of doctrine; and therefore the Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants of old were called <hi>operarii, quia opere magis quam ore praedicarent,</hi> as <hi>Stella</hi> gloſſer,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119668:25"/>
and that both in reſpect of our calling and charge. For our calling as 'tis moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſo moſt eyed, and worſt cenſured. If an Apoſtle rub but an eare of corn on the ſabbath, 'tis breaking of the day; the peoples moates are the Prieſts beames, and anothers indifferency is my evill: ſomthings being expedient in reſpect of the man, which are ſcandalous meerely for his coate. None therefore to keepe within ſo ſtrict lines as the Aaronite, being one ever under mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors. <hi>For behold</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>we are made a gazing-ſtock to the World, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to Men?</hi> to men, which are our charge. Governors live not their owne lives alone, but the peoples; their actions being not perſonal, but epidemical, and whether good or bad are held authentick; it being enough for the rout that their betters did ſo. <hi>Do any of the rulers believe on him</hi> was thought ſufficient argument why others ſhould not? Thus if Jeroboam tranſgreſſe, he makes an Iſrael to ſinne; and if Aaron ſet up an idol, a whole nation will worſhip it. Holineſſe then becomes every man wel, but beſt of all publick perſons; and that not onely for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of good, but liberty of controlling ill. The ſnuffers of the ſanctuary made to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119668:25"/>
purge others, muſt be of pure gold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs. Thus Herod feared John, not 'cauſe he was a powerful teacher, but a Juſt man. This holineſſe caſts a more dazleing luſtre then any other accompliſhment what-ever. But let that paſſe, and ſuppoſe this Thummim be not with the holy One, admit the Prieſt ſinnefull; ſhall the people notwithſtanding follow his doctrine, his doctrine whoſe life is not the uſe, his voice whoſe hand points a contrary way? Nothing more, for what if the ſacrificer bee unclean, is the offering ſo? was the glory of Iſrael, the Arke, any whit leſſened when it came from the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines? did the breath of the Lord his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers paſſe by the leſſe regarded, 'cauſe a Saul Propheſied? Scripture is ſcripture though the Divell ſpeake it; no mans ſinns ſhould bring the ſervice of God into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nor may good be refuſed 'cauſe the meanes are accidentally evill. <hi>Non ergome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita perſonarum ſed officia ſacerdotum conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur,</hi> ſaies <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his 5 Chapter <hi>de iis qui myſteriis initiantur:</hi> and 'tis a groſſe dull capacity that can't diſtiuguiſh 'twixt the worke and the inſtrument, the weakeneſſe of the perſon and the power of the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>Urim is a large word, and reciprocal with ſapience in <hi>Tully,</hi> the ſcience of humane and divine matters; whence it ſeems the Levites divinity and ſcholarſhip are not <hi>ſynoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's,</hi> at leaſt not this and preaching?

the reaſon? The leſſe learning the leſſe ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend: and indeed good Letters have not a little pined away, ſince Divinity began to officiate at the tables end for the trencher. Now 'tis true Scripture was ever the Levites predominant element; but if you'l make him a perfect mixt body, the Arts too are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ingredients. And therefore though <hi>Hadrian</hi> the ſixt, in his tract <hi>de ver a philſophia</hi> cries down humane learning with a noiſe of Fathers, yet he concludes, <hi>utilem eſſe ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam gentilium, dummodo in uſum chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num convertatur,</hi> that to ſhave and par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus I find him on the croſſe in the greateſt agony for his perſecutors, their blaſphemies wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with his benedictions; the Jewes curſe aſcending heaven, and Chriſts bleſſing keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it downe: who not ſuffering them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their damnation, reſolved upon with ſo much <hi>plaudite</hi> &amp; acclamation, <hi>his blood be upon us and our children,</hi> opened the mouth of that blood into a praier, and made it crie,

Now for the ſecond act of our Saviours humility, the deniall of his eminent gifts, what greater could there be, then the forbidding his patients to declare their cure, and deſiring his miracles might be as inviſible as his Godhead. As if a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous health were the ſhame of the phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and a Lazarus raiſed to life, the ſpoiling of his practiſe. Or elſe how is it we read in the Goſpell, of our Saviours unlocking the mouth of the dumb, and then crying, See you tell no man; which was to tie up that organ, which he had before looſed; as he did in drawing the curtaine from the blind mans eyes, &amp; yet commanding him not to ſee and take notice of his phyſitian; or in reſtoring the withered hand, and ſtraitway drying it up againe, in forbidding it's uſe; and ſaying, point not at me.

In heart, aflecting no vain glory in my miracles, no high opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my great parts; which inſtructs us not to commit Idolatrie with our own boſom, and to fall down to the thoughts of our hearts; by which wee deifie theſe moulds of earth, as if we could raiſe eternitie out of aſhes, or build immortalitie on pillars of duſt; wherefore learn of Chriſt to think meanly of our ſelvs, and miſtruſt even what we know: and this, ſaies <hi>Aquinas, refraenat animum,</hi> is a bridle to curb and keep in our hot-mettel'd and unweighed minds, from running upon every dangerous precipice; the want of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility expelled our firſt parents paradiſe, the angeltheaven, and may us too from the ſame joyes for ſom mens eminencies are their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a good name as dangerous to them as a bad, their greateſt parts being made their greateſt ſins; and the rationall ſoul to anſwer more at the laſt day, for it's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, then ignorance.

And thus about an age ſince, that rebellion of the frantick Sectariſts in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> was anabaptiz'd with the ſanctified name of a Reformation, and thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Armies ſlick'd over with the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible title of lawful brotherly Aſſemblies, and a Chriſtian Congregation: their burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Libraries was pretended for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of Learning; perſuading the people, that to take up arms againſt <hi>Charles</hi> their Emperor was onely to protect his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and to deſtroy his perſon, that they might the better preſerve his dignity, &amp; make his Crown the greateſt Prince in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And yet theſe were eſteem'd (no Saints indeed but) meer innocent holy men.</p>

Leav him not therefore for his errors in doctrine, nor yet for his errors in life: ſeparate neither from a particular Church nor a particular Congregation, either for the Prieſts ſin, or the peoples; refuſe not to take the bleſſed Euchariſt from him, or receive it with theſe.

'Tis a priveledge of the Church triumphant to be all faire, and have no ſpot in her; the beſt proportion'd body hath not every part of an equall comlineſſe, nor is beauty made up of one colour. Our ſpouſe in this booke of Canticles wears a black eye in a cleare complextion; that is but her naturall beautie-ſpeck: the moon's a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body for all her moles; the Church a faire Lilly, for all the thorns.

Our Saviour could be of the ſame table with Publicans and ſinners, yet none of their counſell, eat of their meat without taſting their gall and bitterneſſe.

Thus do Common-wealths inherit a greater ſhare of the Almightie's Providence, then ſingle families; their laws being wrap'd in his decrees, and their policies in his counſels; plotting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving nothing but what meets with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal thought.

And thus it holds in all, ſave where is lack of love, or power; but with God is want of neither: not of love, for he that toucheth Iſrael toucheth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Gods eie; nor of power, the agent being omnipotent, able to compaſſe his will both without means, and contrarie to all. Thus rather then his children ſhall periſh, either by a deluge, or a drought, by too much, or too little water, the red ſea ſhall be divided into walls, and the ſtonie rock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſprings: and if the Church hath yet any adverſaries more mercileſſe then water, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus when the believing world was gathered together in <hi>Noah's</hi> floating Iſle, what a wonder of providence do I here meet with! one poor family call'd out of the world, and as it were eight granes of corn fann'd from a barn-full of chaffe, and yet for the increaſe but of theſe eight granes was the whole earth preſerv'd under the flood, elſe a ſhower of fire had purg'd that world, which could not be cleans'd by a deluge.

out this uproare of heaven and waters; knowing that planted paradiſe was not ſo firm as his Arke, whoſe anchor was his God, and he that owed the waters ſteering the veſſel. After this when the Church was upon the Altar, and now about to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when the ſword was drawn, and the blow ready, how did the Almighty prevent the execution; the ſacrificer <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the mean time, whom it neareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, being leaſt touch'd; faith having wrought that in the Patriarch which cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie would in others, not to be ſenſible of his own action: he contemns all fears, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks all impoſſibilities; his heart telling him, that the ſame hand that had rais'd <hi>Iſaac</hi> from the dead wombe of <hi>Sarah,</hi> could raiſe that ſame <hi>Iſaac</hi> again from his own urne; and the God, who promis'd to increaſe a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon to the number of the ſtars, might (for all he knew) make this ſingle perſons very duſt to conceive and bring forth, and ſo perform that almighty promiſe out of the aſhes of his ſacrifice.

Egypt, where their burthens were turn'd into bondage, and their bondage into blood; their ſouls alſo being ever on the rack of continual fear and ſuſpence, leaſt their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies might be thrown into the ſame Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kills they had built, and become the fire to harden their own handy-work: yet here how did God tie up Pharaoh's hands with plagues; and the ſame voice that cried, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed,</hi> commanded like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and my <hi>Anointed</hi> touch not mine; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their poiſons into cordials, and their enemies malice to their greateſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in that he made them grow under their burthens, and propagate through that inhumane deſtruction of the male-fruit of their bodie: So ſtill does Gods Vine bear the better for the pruning-hook, and looks much freſher by being let blood.

                  <p>And that I think is good counſel at any time: and as ever, ſo moſt eſpecially now, when brotherly affection is become ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable and double-faced, as 'tis hard to find a true friend; and liberalitie is grown ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and improper, that 'tis ſhewen now adaies rather to enrich a Cloſet or Parlour then a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> in clothing of walls ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then men. Now the friends here meant are the Angels ſay ſome, who are made out friends by works of mercie towards our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but the common <hi>tenet</hi> is the friends in my text are the poor, <hi>quos Deus permiſit egere ad illorum &amp; noſtram probationem,</hi> whom God ſuffers to want, for the exerciſe of their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119668:46"/>
patience and our charitie: and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie expoſition of <hi>make you friends,</hi> it, give Alms, make you friends by works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; which ſhall be the ſubject of the firſt part of my diſcourſe; and ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe the doctrine as well as the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it is almoſt forgot. The Divinity of Juſtification by Faith alone, like one of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> lean kine hath clean devoured the fat ones. And therefore my firſt particular <hi>poſition,</hi> or <hi>doctrine</hi> rais'd from this general <hi>theſis,</hi> ſhall be to rectife your underſtanding in this deep point of Juſtification by Faith, and Juſtification by Works, to reconcile theſe two, and make them one.</p>
                  <p>The Poſition is this, That Faith &amp; Works<note place="margin">1. Doctr-</note> muſt alwaies be united, ever go hand in hand in a believer. It is evident to all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be blinde, that the eie alone ſeeth in the bodie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et the eie which ſeeth is not alone in the bodie without the other ſences; the fore-finger alone pointeth, yet that finger is not alone on the hand; the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer alone ſtriketh the bell, yet the hammer that ſtriketh the bell is not alone in the clock; the heat alone in the fire burneth, and not the light, yet the heat is not alone without the light; the helme alone guideth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119668:46"/>
the ſhip, and not the tackling, yet the helme is not alone, nor without the tackling. Thus we are to conceive, that though Faith alone doth juſtifie, yet that Faith which juſtifies is not alone, but join'd with Charitie and good Works. Saint <hi>Bernard's</hi> diſtinction of <hi>via r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gni</hi> and <hi>cauſa regnandi</hi> cleareth the truth in this point. Though good Works are not the cauſe why God crowns us in heaven, yet we muſt take them in our way to heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16. It is as impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to deny the neceſſitie, as to maintein the merits of good Works.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon of the point wherfore<note place="margin">1. Reaſon.</note> Faith and good Works muſt alwaies be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, alwaies go hand in hand in a Believer, is, becauſe that God hath joined good works and ſalvation together in his Word, and what God hath join'd let not man put aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Now doing and life, working and ſalvation, running and obteining, winning and wearing, overcoming and reigning in holy <hi>Seripture</hi> evermore follow one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: wherefore the young man puts the queſtion to our Saviour, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 17. and the people likewiſe, and the Publicans, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>and the Souldiers to Saint <hi>John, Luk.</hi> 3. 10, 12, 14. and the Keepers of the priſon to Saint

                  <p>A ſecond reaſon of the point is, becauſe<note place="margin">

                  <p>Let us therefore take from hence firſt a<note place="margin">1.

I grant, when we have done all we can we may, nay we muſt ſay, we are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervants, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10. None may truſt in their own righteouſneſſe, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary all ought to pray that they may bee found in Chriſt, not having their own right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſſe, <hi>Epb.</hi> 3. 9. yet their righteouſneſſe

muſt exceed the righteouſneſſe of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> or elſe they ſhall never enter into the kingdom of heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place this will ſerve for a<note place="margin">2. Uſe.</note> word of Reproof for all thoſe that ſeparate Faith and Works. Tell not me, whoever thou art, of Faith without thy Works, nor of Praiers without thy Almes, nor of piety without thy compaſſion, nor of real with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy charitie; if the hands be not <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s as well as the voice, I fear thou wilt appear before God for no better then a meer Impoſtor and Cheat. If wee are good trees by our fruit men ſhall know us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. by your fruit, not by your bloſſoms of good purpoſes, or your leaves of good profeſſion, but by the fruit of your actions. What is your devotion when it is peeviſh; or your zeal when it is malicious, or your puritie when it is ſchiſmatical, or your conſcience when it is factious, a mover, a ring-leader of ſedition. Too too many in this rotten age wherein we live are ſpeakers, not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; as if <hi>oſtendere fidem</hi> the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> his <hi>ſhew thy Faith by thy Works</hi> were <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

man queſtion thee of thy faith, ſpare thy lips and let thy mouth make anſwer. If words might be credited, if a bare profeſſion of the Goſpel might be believed, no man would want faith; every one would crie with the <hi>blind man to Chriſt, Lord I believ:</hi> what mouth would not make one lie for its maſter? <hi>Niſe videro,</hi> unleſs I ſee, ſaith <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſo unleſs I ſee and feel thy ſaith, I will not believe.

                  <p>In the third place you may here take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">3. Uſe.</note> your ſelves a word of Admonition, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of theſe hypocrites, and this is our Saviour's own uſe, <hi>Mat. 7. 15. Beware,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>of thoſe that come to you in ſheeps cloathing;</hi> in ſheeps cloathing with ſuch a caſt of mortification and integritie, as if their converſation ſpake nothing but inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and immaculateneſſe, <hi>when within they are ravening wolves.</hi> A handſom gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no argument of a ſtraight bodie, nor are thoſe alwaies the beſt men that make the moſt ſhew of Religion.

Therefore I ſay again, take our Saviour's advice; <hi>Beware of thoſe that come to you in ſheeps cloathing: you ſhall know them by their fruits,</hi> ſaies Chriſt; fruits indeed to the eie beautiful and glorious, but to the finger duſt and ſmoke, like thoſe hypocritical ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that well-complexion'd duſt of <hi>Sodom:</hi> and ſo much ſhall ſuffice for our firſt doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

poſition, rais'd from this firſt general part of the Text.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Obſervation that I ſhall<note place="margin">2. Doctr.</note> draw from this general point of Charitie and Almſdeeds, is, that this work is not a free-will offering, left to our ſelves to bee done, or left undone, as we think fit, but it is our dutie, and we are bound to do it if we are able: and this is proved from 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6. 17, 18. It is the rich man's charge, precept, and dutie; and therefore what is here with our Saviour a counſel, was with his Apoſtle a precept. <hi>Charge the rich,</hi> ſaith the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Epiſtle to <hi>Tim. that they do good.</hi> It is not left to their free choice to do good if they pleaſe, but it is laid upon them as their charge and dutie, they muſt do good Work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and wo to them if they do not.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon of the point is, becauſe<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> God haih not made them owners, but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and ſervants not of their goods, but the giver, not treaſures, but ſtewards and Almoners.</p>
                  <p>And this diſpenſation and ordering of<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> God's, that rich men ſhould be his Stewards, may very well ſerve for a word of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and exhortation to thoſe rich
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119668:49"/>
men to go on and glorie in this office of Stewardſhip, eſpecially when they ſhall conſider that the praiſe of a Steward is more to lay out well, then to have received much, knowing that <hi>Well done faithful ſervant</hi> Mat. 25. 21. is a thouſand times a ſweeter note then <hi>ſoul take thine eaſe,</hi> Luk 12. 10. for that firſt is the voice of the Maſter recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing, this laſt of the Carnal Heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming; and what followed to the one in the Goſpel, but his Maſters joy; what to the other, but the loſſe of his ſoul. But what need here either our <hi>Saviours</hi> counſel, or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> precept you'l ſay, for we ſhall have friends enough no doubt, ſo long as this Mammon in our Text is our friend: wee ſhall indeed; and therefore,</p>
                  <p>Our third Obſervation on the point ſhall<note place="margin">3. Doctr.</note> bee, that in making of friends by works of Charitie, we muſt uſe diſcretion and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and this will teach us Firſt, Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively who in this particular are not to bee our friends: Secondly, Poſitively who are to be theſe friends in the Text. Firſt then Negatively, thoſe are not to be our friends, who when we fail will not receive us into habitations; who will bee ready to embrace all the favours and good turns you ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119668:50"/>
upon them, but will return none back again. Theſe are ſuch friends of whom holy <hi>Job</hi> in his 6 <hi>Chap.</hi> complain'd of; like the brooks by the which the merchants do tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel into <hi>Teman,</hi> frozen in winter, and dried up in Summer: friends no longer then you can befriend them, like leavs that fall from the trees when they begin to wither, and with <hi>Saint Peter know not the man;</hi> ſuch as will bee your ſervant in a complement, and not look upon you in a buſineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e. Theſe are the firſt ſort of friends that are not to bee made of the unrighteous Mammon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence and reaſon forbids it. Secondly you muſt not make thoſe your friends, who though they may perchance receive you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to habitations, yet they cannot receive you into everlaſting habitations; though they are able to give you houſes, they are not able to give you heaven; and theſe are the rich in this world, of whom our Saviour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns you, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 82, to 35. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to engage none of theſe to our friendſhip, but ſuch as when we fail, ſhall receive us into everlaſting habitations, and theſe are the poor and needie: which ſeemed ſuch a paradox to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided <hi>Chriſt, ver.</hi> 14 of this <hi>Chap.</hi> whoſe

                  <p>Now from this laſt Obſervation may be<note place="margin">1. Uſe.</note> gathered by way of Uſe, the happineſſe both of Poor and Rich.

                     <hi>To direct</hi> you therefore, in this great and neceſſary duty of Chriſtianity, I ſhall hold out unto you 4. <hi>generall rules</hi> of giving almes, and out of each of theſe 4. <hi>generall rules</hi> draw out ſeverall particular directions. The 4. <hi>generall rules</hi> are theſe. Firſt the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſtewards rule,</hi> in my text. Secondly <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> rule. Thirdly <hi>Chriſts</hi> rule. Fourthly <hi>Gods</hi> rule.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, the <hi>unjuſt ſtewards rule,</hi> that<note place="margin">1. Rule.</note> will teach you how to give almes, from theſe particular directions. Firſt ſaith the 5. <hi>ver. of this Chap. he called his maſters deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> and ſtayed not till they call'd him <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:119668:52"/>
and <hi>Lot</hi> are ſaid to fit in the doore of the Tent to call in ſtrangers; they need not knock: commonly they that crave leaſt have the moſt need. For there are many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that have nothing left them, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and modeſty, and towards ſuch we muſt add two circumſtances of Charity. First to enquire them out. Secondly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey our reliefe ſo to them, as we do not make them aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſecond particular direction from this <hi>unjuſt ſteward</hi> was this, that what he did was with diſpatch; he called his Maſters debtors, and bid them <hi>ſit downe quickly, verſe 6. vt hilarem it a celerom dato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem diligit Deus;</hi> God delights in expedition as well as cheerfulneſſe: give almes with a cheerful heart and countenance, not grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, or of neceſſity, for God loveth a cheerful giver, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2. 7: and therefore give quickly, when the power is in thine hand, and the need is in thy neighbour, and thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at the door. He gives twice, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſpeedily. The more ſpeed, the more comfort. Neither the times are in our own diſpoſing, nor our ſelves. If God had ſee us a day, and made our wealth inſeparable, there were no danger in delay. But now our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119668:52"/>
incertainty if it quickens not deceivs us. How many have meant well &amp; done nothing, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their crown with lingring: to whom that they would have done good, it is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o great praiſe as it is diſhonour, that they might have done it; their deaths oft-times prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deſires, and making their good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions the Wards of their Executors, who many times prove the executioners of their wills and eſtates.</p>
                  <p>From hence then take a word of advice<note place="margin">1. Uſe</note> and caution; let their wracksbe ourwarning, who are equally mortall, equally fickle. It is a wofull and remedileſs complaint, that the end of our dayes ſhould out-run the beginning of our good workes: which are commonly ſo don, as the poor may thank our death-beds for them, and not us; our diſeaſe rather then our Charitie. For he that gives not till he dies, ſhewes that he would not give then if he could keep it: and they that give thus give by their <hi>teſtaments</hi> it is true, but I can ſcarce ſay they give by their <hi>wills:</hi> the good mans praiſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. was that himſelf diſperſed his goods, and not left them behind him; and his diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſeconded with this retribution of Gods, <hi>his righteouſneſſe indureth for ever.</hi> The

Saints of God are like <hi>Dorcas</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> rich in good works which ſhee did herſelfe, and not entruſted others to do them, being her own executrix.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let this be an uſe of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and encouragement, to do good in<note place="margin">

Do good therefore in your life: early beneficence hath no danger, many joyes <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 8. For firſt, the conſcience of good don. Secondly the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and bleſſings of the relieved; Thirdly, the gratulations of the Saints, are as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perpetuall comforters, which will make your life pleaſant, and your death happy; when every one of you may ſay to his Soule with that rich man in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but upon better grounds, Soul take thine caſe, for thou haſt treaſure laid up, not for many yeares, but for ever.</p>

If thy purſe will not hold out to a ſepulchre for Chriſt, with <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> yet with the <hi>Maries,</hi> a pound or two of ſpice would bee ſeen. If ſilver and gold thou haſt none, yet with Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> ſuch as thou haſt give unto the poor; and with that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi> let at leaſt thy ſhadow be a covering for their nakedneſſe, if thy ſubſtance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach to a garment. It was our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> promiſe in the Goſpel, <hi>That he which gave a cup of cold water, ſhould not loſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> and certainly I can never be ſo poor as to want this.

                  <p>Laſtly, though he was bountiful, yet with diſcretion and difference; fiftie to one, and but twentie to another; the moſt to thoſe who were moſt likely to help. Do good to all, but eſpecially to thoſe of the <hi>houſhold of faith,</hi> was the Apoſtles advice, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 10. let the righteous man have the greateſt ſhare in your Mammon of unrighteouſneſſe. Our rule then of doing good, muſt be a rule of wiſedom and charitie; of wiſedom in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good choice of the parties, of charitie in hoping the beſt of them. <hi>Charitatis error ſalutaris eſt,</hi> wee ſeldom fin in charitie: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their praiers whom thou haſt relieved are not acceptable to God, yet thy Almſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds are; the beggar may be damn'd, when the giver ſhall be ſaved.

Such perſons when they are reduced to very great want, muſt be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch proportions as may not relieve their dying luſt, but may refreſh their faint and dying bodies. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the beſt objects of charitie are poor houſe-keepers that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hard, and are burdened with many children; or gentlemen faln into ſad pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, eſpecially if by innocent misfortune; (and if their crimes brought them into it, yet they are to be relieved according to the former rule;) perſecuted perſons, widows and fatherleſſe children, putting them to honeſt trades or Schools of learning; and ſearch into the needs of numerous and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner families; and when thou ſpieſt a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

                  </p>
                  <p>Our ſecond general rule is taken from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Rule.</note> in that charitable advice of his, <hi>Eccle. 11. 1. Throw thy bread upon the waters;</hi> from whence you may obſerve, Firſt that it is not <hi>da,</hi> a thing utterly given away, bur <hi>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> a thing ſent abroad, like an adventure at ſea, which ſhall another day return with great advantage. And then Secondly it is bread, not a ſtone: when thy brother asks, thou muſt give him an Alms to fill his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, not a reproach to break his heart. Hee that gives Alms muſt do it in mercie; for Alms without mercie, are like praiers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out devotion, or religion without humility. Thy charitie then muſt be diſtributed in mercie, that is out of a true ſence of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie of thy brother, firſt feeling it in thy ſelfe in ſome proportion, and then eudea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to eaſe thy ſelfe and thy brother of the common calamitie. If thou haſt no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yet thou muſt have mercie, and art
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119668:55"/>
bound to pitie the poor, and pray for them, and throw thy holy deſires &amp; devotions into the treaſurie of the Church; &amp; if thou doeſt what thou art able, be it little or great, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or ſpiritual, the charitie of alms, or the charitie of praiers, a cup of wine, or a cup of water, if it be but love to the brethren, or a deſire to help all, or any of Chriſt's poor, it ſhall bee accepted according to what a man hath, not according to what he hath not. For love is all this, and all the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: and it will expreſſe it ſelfe where it can, and where it cannot yet it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, it muſt be <hi>de pane tuo,</hi> of thine own bread, not anothers; thou muſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do an hundred men, their wives and children, and build a poore hoſpitall to keep ſeven; but of this more hereafter.</p>

But now although in giving almes to beggars, and perſons of low ranke, it is better to give little to each, that we may give to the more, ſo extending our almes to many perſons; yet in caſes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as in building Hoſpitalls, Colleges, and houſes for devotion; and in ſupplying the accidentall wants of decaied Perſons, fallen from great plenty to great necſſity; it is better to unite our almes, then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe them, to make a noble reliefe and maintenance to one, and to reſtore him to comfort, then to ſupport meerly his natural needs, and keep him alive only, unreſcued from ſad diſcomforts.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly 'tis ſaid here, <hi>Throw thy bread upon the waters, i. e.</hi> upon the ſtanding waters, ſaith a Father, the running waters will ſhift for themſelves: they that abide in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether <hi>Hoſpitalls, or Univerſities,</hi> are like ſtanding waters, moſt ſubject to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: and yet by the way theſe laſt are

not to undergo neither thoſe unjuſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of dumb dogg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this ſhall ſuffice for our ſecond generall rule, <hi>Solomons rule of giving almes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our third generall rule of direction<note place="margin">3. Rule.</note> in this particular, is Chriſts own rule, which you have ſet down <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16. where in the Firſt place note that they muſt be works; which is a word that implies difficulty, and pain, and labor, and is acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt he would buy <hi>Aranna's</hi> threſhing floor at a valuable price, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14. and then he would dedicate it to God. To give old cloaths paſt wearing to the poore, is not ſo good a worke, as to make new for them. To give a little of your ſuperfluities, not ſo acceptable as the <hi>widowes</hi> gift, who gave all. To give a poor Soul a farthing at that door wher you give a plaier a ſhilling, is not equall dealing, for this is to give God <hi>the refuſe of thy wheat. Amos</hi> 8. 6. but do thou ſome ſuch things as are truly works in our ſence, ſuch as are againſt the nature and ordinary practice of worldly men to do; ſome things by which they may ſee that thou doeſt prefer God before honour, and wife, and children; and hadſt rather build and endow ſome place for Gods ſervice, then powr out money to multiplie titles of honour upon thy ſelf, or inlarge jointures and portions to an unneceſſary and unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable proportion, when there is enough done before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly theſe works muſt be good works. They are not good works how mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ſoever, if they are not directed to good ends. Aſeditious end vitiates the beſt work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus it muſt be a work, ſomething of ſome importance, and a good work not depraved with an ill end; and then in the laſt place, it muſt be your work, <hi>that they may ſee your good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are not your works if that which you give be not your own, nor is it your own if it were ill gotten at the firſt: how long ſoever it hath been poſſeſſed, and how often ſoever it hath been transformed, from money to ware, from ware to land, from land to office, from office to honour; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the ware, the land, the office, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is none of thine if in thy knowledge it were ill got at the firſt. <hi>Zacheus.

                  <p>Firſt, he that is bountifull, muſt be a giver and beſtower of good things, and all he beſtowes, it muſt be by way of gift, not by way of requitall unto, or by deſert from the party he beſtowes all on. Thus Chriſt ſaies <hi>Luk.</hi> 6, 33. that to do good to thoſe who have done or do good to us, is not thank-worthy, nor is it bounty; but God is therefore truly good, becauſe he ſimply meerly, and abſolutely, gives away all which he beſtows: for he was not, nor can any way become beholding to any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor had formerly received any thing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119668:59"/>
from them which might move him hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. So <hi>Rom. 11. 35. who hath &amp;c.</hi> Nay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he gave us a beeing we were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſo much, as receiving any good thing from him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he who is truly termed good, or bountifull, all that he gives away muſt be his own; and ſo all which God beſtowes it is his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So <hi>Pſal: 24. 1. The earth is the Lords,</hi> the ground we tread on, the place we dwell in, he is our Landlord. But is that all? for the houſe may be the Land-lords, when the furniture is the Tenants, therefore hee further adds, <hi>and the fulneſſe of it is his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, i e,</hi> all the things that fill the world, all the furniture and proviſion of it: both all the moveables, So <hi>Pſal: 50. 11. 12. the cattel and the fowles upon a thouſand hills are mine,</hi> ſaith he, and alſo all the ſtanding goods, the corne and the oyle, which you ſet and plant are mine, <hi>Hoſ:</hi> 2. 9. yea and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the ſame 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> adds further, that they who dwell therein are his alſo; not the houſe and furniture only, but the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants themſelves. And this by the moſt ſure and moſt Soveraigne title that can be, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that of purchaſe or inheritance, of and from another: for he hath made them;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119668:59"/>
all is thine becauſe all comes of thee, ſaith the ſame <hi>David 1 Chron:</hi> 29. 11, 12. And all things are not only of him, but through him <hi>Rom. 11. 36. i e.</hi> they cannot ſtand nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitſt without him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he muſt give largely; it is not bounty elſe: now God is therefore ſaid to be rich in goodneſſe, becauſe he is abundant in it; ſo we find it comparing <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 24. in which it is ſaid that the earth is full of his goodneſſe, and his riches; which we may judge of, by what he ſaies <hi>verſ 27. of Pſal</hi> 104. of what an houſe he keepes, and what multitudes he feedes, all theſe ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> wait on thee &amp;c. <hi>King Ahaſuerus</hi> to ſhew his bounty, made a feaſt to his cheife Subjects, but it was but for halfe a yeare, and not to all: ſome few halfe yeares more would well nigh have beggard him: but God doth this continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The greateſt and moſt bountifull of men, when they would expreſſe the largeſt of their bounty, ſpeake but of giving halfe of their Kingdomes; ſo <hi>Herod,</hi> and he did but talke ſo neither. but God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſtowes whole worlds and Kingdomes, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi> ſpeakes <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 35. and gives them to whom hee pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:119668:60"/>Fourthly, he that is bountiful muſt give all he gives freely and willingly, which though I put together, yet may imply two diſtinct things; as firſt, that he that gives muſt be a free agent in it, who is at his choice whether he would give any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or no. The Sun doth much good to the world, it affords a large light, and even half the world at once is full of its glorie, yea and all this light is its own, not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed as that of the Moon and Stars is; yet this Sun cannot be called good or boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, becauſe it ſends forth this light neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, and naturally, and cannot chuſe but do ſo, neither can it draw in its beames: but God is a free giver; hee was at his choice whether he would have made the world or no, and can yet when he pleaſeth withdraw his Spirit, and then all things periſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 29. Secondly it muſt be willingly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> no way conſtreined or wrung from him who is to be called bountiful. Now of God it is ſaid, that he gives all away with delight; for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31. having ſpoken of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eeding every living thing, and of other the like works of his goodneſs, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with this, God rejoiceth in all his works; <hi>i. e.</hi> doth all the good he doth with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119668:60"/>
delight: It doth him good, as it were, to ſee the poor creatures feed. The laſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in bountie, is to look for no recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the time to come: So <hi>ſaith Chriſt, Luke 6 34. If you give, &amp;c.</hi> but ver. 35. <hi>So doth not your heavenly father.</hi> For ſaith hee, <hi>Do good, and hope for nothing againe, ſo ſhall you bee like your Father;</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe he is ſo great and ſo high a God, as nothing we do can reach him, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal. 16. 2. My goodneſſe extends not unto thee,</hi> hee is too high to receive any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by what we do. And this ſhall ſuffice for the four General Rules of giving Alms, and alſo of the firſt <hi>general part</hi> which we obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the diviſion of theſe words, the <hi>quid,</hi> the <hi>matter,</hi> what we are to do, and that is to provide for our ſelves by making us friends.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>General</hi> that we held out to<note place="margin">2. General.</note> you in the diviſion, was the <hi>Manner,</hi> to uſe the beſt means to get theſe friends, unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous <hi>Mammon.</hi> Where in the firſt place I ſhall reſolve a doubt, and withall the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this expreſſion, <hi>The Mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe.</hi> How comes it to paſſe that this <hi>Mammon,</hi> which is the ſubject of ſo much good, ſhould deſerve a name ſo bad?
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119668:61"/>
why is it ſtyled the <hi>Mammon of unrighteuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</hi> you are to know therefore that wealth is call'd the <hi>Mammon of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> for two reaſons; the firſt taken from the cauſe, the other from the effect.</p>
                  <p>1. Firſt from the cauſe, for that wealth is an inſtrument and cauſe of much iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Court, the Counſellours ſhall be fee'd, that the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not go on, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. and if <hi>Saint Paul</hi> would but have ſaid <hi>tantum dabo</hi> to <hi>Felix</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> there had been more Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick in the Apoſtles fee, then in all <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> his ſtarched Oratory. For this reaſon <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> when he ſued in the 8 of the <hi>Acts</hi> for the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> truſted more to his <hi>Mammon,</hi> then his <hi>Familiars;</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, there was greater power in money then in all the Devills in hell, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, if it might have been, even the Apoſtles themſelves. And therefore it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills laſt aſſault and battery againſt our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the 4 of St. Matt:</hi> For it any promiſe could have ſeduced Chriſt, it had been that of the worlds Kingdome and glory: he is the Sonne of God indeed, that for ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaine will not caſt himſelfe from the pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Temple. It would be no hard
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119668:61"/>
work to manifeſt this truth through every age of the Church, were it not too viſible in our own.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, I ſhall from hence, in the<note place="margin">1. Uſe.</note> firſt place, draw an uſe of reproofe for the Miniſters of theſe times. I would to God I could not ſay (but I muſt) even of our own divine Profeſſion, that which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of his Twelve, <hi>Yee are clean, but not all;</hi> for how many have theſe few year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are they that long for the <hi>Wedge of gold</hi> more then the <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo themſelves may put up the means of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> care not who puts on the robes. Theſe are they which make uſe of the Prieſt's office like him in <hi>Samuel, onely for a piece of bread,</hi> and will with that <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> of <hi>Micah's, Judg.</hi> 17, ſet you up Idols if you give them but ſilver.

                  <p>Secondly from hence let mee give them a<note place="margin">2. Uſe.</note> word of Dehortation, from all ſuch corrupt ſordid courſes, whereby they make Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie a Trade, and the Pulpit a Shop, where they vent their doctrines according to the faſhions of the Time, not the truth; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that ſolemne pompe and Ceremonie uſed in their Orders; where when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Bible from the holy man, with autoritie to divide the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it was not given to abuſe their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters truſt, in betraying that ſacred pledge either to Pulpit-applauſe, or Pulpit-gain, to the flatterie of the giddie multitude, or the reward.</p>
                  <p>Secondly this <hi>Mammon</hi> is call'd <hi>unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous Mammon,</hi> or the riches of iniquitie, <hi>ab effectu,</hi> from the effect, becauſe it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes men unrighteous, endangering the ſoul of the poſſeſſor; and therefore the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119668:62"/>
                     <hi>Church Liturgie</hi> doth teach us to pray, <hi>In all time of our wealth good Lord deliver us;</hi> there being as great danger in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of temporal bleſſings, as there was in the multitude of fiſh, <hi>John</hi> 21. where if Chriſt had not ſeconded their great draught with divine help, they had loſt both the ſhip and themſelves.</p>
                  <p>From this expreſſion thus interpreted<note place="margin">1. Doctr.</note> our firſt conſideration ſhal be that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 24. that 'tis a very hard thing for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of heaven. Gold is the heavieſt of all mettals, no wonder then if it ſomtimes carries the rich man downwards. 'Tis hard for the ſoul clogged with many weights to aſcend to heaven. <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Nabal</hi> think onely of their Sheep-ſhearing, and making merrie when they have done, their buſineſſe is thought on, not their ſalvation: ſo great an enemy is our temporal happineſſe to our eternal; the love of this world being that great gulfe betwixt <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me and us. Secondly if it be ſo hard for the rich,<note place="margin">2. Doctr.</note> then ſurely 'tis as eaſie for the poor to enter into the Kingdom of heaven, which is our ſecond conſideration upon the point.</p>
                  <p>Whether a ſtorme or calme are moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119668:63"/>
                     <hi>Jonah's</hi> Whale or his Gourd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſperitie have loſt, or adverſitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered more I know not; certain I am, none praies ſo heartily for his daily bread as he that wants it: miſerie like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s plagues ſends them to their praiers that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of God when they were well. Outward loſſes are inwardly gainful, and it is good for us that wee have been afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nay it would be worſe with us were it not ſometimes thus bad; many, had they more wealth would be more wicked, and if they were not kept ſhort of this world would come ſhort of the next, and then it had been better for them had it not been ſo well. I know 'tis pitie that fair weather ſhould do any harme, and yet 'tis often ſeen, we even adore thoſe Phyſitians in our ſickneſſe, which being recovered, we onely ſalute with a complement: abundance makes many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that God, which want would make crouch to; like <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Butler, ſhaking off his friend with his ſhackles; or like beggars, that are no ſooner ſerv'd, but they are gone. Thus I hear <hi>Iſrael</hi> praying in <hi>Egypt,</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling in the wilderneſſe: When they were at their Brick-kills they would be at their devotion, and no ſooner are they at eaſe,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119668:63"/>
but they are wrangling for their fleſh-pots. I think many a man had not been ſo bad had he been but poor. It is the ſaying of a wiſe Father, That <hi>Solomon</hi>'s riches did him more hurt then his wiſdom did him good. Wealth like knowledge puffs up, when po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie (as their infirmities did many in the Goſpel) makes men flock to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But then in the Third place, I would not have any one here thinke I ſpeak this to barr rich men heaven, God forbid. For though 'tis hard for a rich man to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of Heaven, yet he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notwithſtanding, the gate of heaven ſtands open for him as well as for the poor: and as 'tis Scripture. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> ſo 'tis alſo as true. <hi>Bleſſed are the rich, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which ſhall be our third conſideration<note place="margin">3. Doctrin.</note> upon the point, that heaven gate ſtands open for the rich, as well as the poor. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> flew up to heaven, with the double monarchy of the world upon their backs: for they were ſole Emperors both of the Eaſt and Weſt, and the whole univerſe. The <hi>Patriarchs</hi> alſo did climb to heaven
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119668:64"/>
with much wealth; many holy Kings with maſſy Crowns and ſcepters. It is not wealth therefore as wealth, but ſin that is the clogg that keeps men from aſcending; the burden of covetous deſires being more heavy to an empty ſoul, then much treaſure to the full; for not the meer poſſeſſion and uſe of riches offends, but the affectation. And to this purpoſe <hi>Lombard</hi> puts in his obſervation with a <hi>non dicit propheta,</hi> the prophet ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> gave a ſtrong caveat to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that when their flocks and heards increaſed, and their ſilver and their gold was multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, they ſhould beware leaſt their hearts were lifted up, and ſo they ſhould forget the Lord their God, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 8. 13.

                  <p>The uſe then of this particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<note place="margin">1.

But if the ſoul be not ſo active and nimble as to carry up it's ſelfe and ſuch a load, we muſt with <hi>Eliah</hi> drop our mantle upon the <hi>Prophets,</hi> diſperſe our goods to the poor, it being better going to heaven naked, then to hell in purple.

That's given to the poore is given to me, <hi>ſaith Chriſt,</hi> ſhall we then make our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> a receiver of ſtollen good's? God forbid. Yet one caſe there is, where ill gotten goods muſt be beſtowed on pious uſes, of neceſſity; and that is, when we know not the right owners, nor where to find them to make reſtitution: in this caſe Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> muſt be followed; <hi>Acquiſiſti male, impende jambene,</hi> thou haſt gotten them ill, beſtow them well. However what is ſo beſtowed is not almes neither: and therefore it is that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally cheaters and robbers cannot be truly and properly ſaid to give almes of what they have cheated and robbed, unleſſe they cannot tell the perſons whom they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, or the proportions; &amp; in ſuch caſes they are to give thoſe unknown portions to the poore by way of reſtitution, for it is no almes: Onely God is the ſupreme Lord to whom thoſe eſcheats devolue, and the poor are his receivers; And therefore are ſaid in my Text, <hi>to receive you into everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> which is my laſt <hi>generall part</hi> of the

                  <p>In the handling of which part I ſhall Firſt propoſe to your conſideration <hi>three brief poſitions,</hi> and then proceed to a more full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this generall head.</p>
                  <p>For the Poſitions, the Firſt is this; that if<note place="margin">1. Poſition.</note> men were their own friends, they would make others ſo with their <hi>Mammon,</hi> and while they are on earth, provide for heaven. Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy, was our Saviours in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. God's promiſes though they be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, yet they are confined, and he onely ſhall receive mercy, that ſhewes it: The Almighty being therefore bountifull to us, that we might be ſo to others; promiſing, that if we feaſt thoſe that cannot bid us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and build for thoſe that cannot lodge us againe; We ſhal be made partakers of that Mariage-feaſt, and thoſe habitations, whoſe maker and builder is God. If men then were their owne friends, they would make others ſo with this <hi>Mammon;</hi> Why ſhould the ruſt of that gold riſe up in judgment againſt thee, the right uſe of which will place thee with thoſe, that ſhall ſit in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119668:68"/>
Turning thy Talents into Cities, and ſaying the foundation of that building, whoſe walls reach up to heaven. And that is our Firſt Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ition. But can good workes, purchaſe theſe eternall habitations? By no meanes. And therefore</p>
                  <p>Our Second Poſition is this: That not<note place="margin">2. Poſition.</note> our good workes, But Chriſt's merits, are the formall cauſe of our Salvation. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vertue of the works, they bee but the fruits of charity; nor the vertue of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is but the fruit of faith; nor the vertue of faith, that's but an inſtrument to apprehend <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but he alone our <hi>Saviour</hi> alone by his merits hath made this purchaſe, and prepared thoſe manſions for us. And yet miſtake me not, there is no leſſe neceſſity of good workes, then if you ſhould be ſaved by them; &amp; that though you cannot be ſaved by them, as the meritorious cauſes of your glory, yet that you cannot be ſaved without them, as the neceſſary effects and arguments of that grace which brings glory. Which is our Second Poſition upon the point.</p>
                  <p>Our third runns thus: The poor by<note place="margin">3. Poſition.</note> their praiers receive us into thoſe eternall habitations which <hi>Chriſt</hi> beſtowes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers upon us. Now the poor here meant in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119668:69"/>
the <hi>Text,</hi> are either <hi>Pauperes ſpiritu,</hi> the poor in ſpirit: for theirs is the kingdom of God. <hi>Mat</hi> 5. or <hi>Pauperes ſacculo,</hi> the poor in purſe, and theſe by their prayers ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee into heaven. For as Chriſt is ſaid to receive thoſe almes on earth which the poor put up, and not he: ſo the poor in heaven are ſaid to receive us into everlaſting habitations, which Chriſt ſhall beſtow, and not they. Can you conceive how the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> and men of <hi>Nineve</hi> ſhall riſe up at the laſt day? In the ſame manner, but for a better end, ſhal the men women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> riſe up and teſtify on your behalf, ſaying, Sweet <hi>Jeſus!</hi> had it not been for theſe, and theſe Benefactors, we had periſhed for want. As therefore <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Ye are our hope,</hi> cauſe theſe at the laſt day would witneſſe how he had laboured for their ſalvation; ſo may every one of you ſay of all thoſe to whom you have done good, You are our hope; for that they ſhall teſtifie your good works before men and Angels, &amp; juſtifie that ſentence which ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv you into <hi>everlaſting habitations.</hi> Theſe are the three brief Poſitions I mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may come to a more full
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119668:69"/>
explication of the point, theſe <hi>everlaſting habitations</hi> according to ſeveral <hi>Expoſitors</hi> are ſeverally interpreted; for <hi>firſt,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into theſe <hi>everlaſting habitations,</hi> is to be taken into the protection of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 1. which is interpreted by the next <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1, <hi>ad</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> from which <hi>firſt</hi> interpretation our <hi>poſition</hi> ſhall be, That it is better to give away all that wee have to the poor, and have God with nothing, then all the world without God. To have God with nothing, did I ſay? Nay in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him wee have all things, ſaith Saint <hi>Cyprian de Coen. Dom. cum Dei ſint omnia.</hi> Since all things are God's, to him that hath God nothing can be wanting, except he be wanting unto God: nothing ſaith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no good thing ſaith the Prophet; the young Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall want nothing that is good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. Though all earthly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions entrench thee, and miſerie ſeems to come upon thee like an armed man, and thou art fallen into the jawes of thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whoſe teeth are ſpears and arrows, and their tongue a ſharp ſword, yet Angels ſhall encampe about thee, and the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be thy buckler and thy ſhield;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119668:70"/>
the neighing of the horſe, the noiſe of the trumpet ſhall not invade thee; or if they do, and at ſuch a ſtrait that the arme of fleſh growes weak, yet his mercie is great unto the heavens, and his truth reacheth unto the clouds: the glorious hoſte above ſhall muſter all their forces to aſſiſt thee; the ſtarrs ſhall fight for thee, and thunder ſpeak loud unto thy enemies. Thus in the height of miſeries God ſhall be thy caſtle and ſtrong tower, and <hi>under the ſhadow of his wings ſhall bee thy refuge, till theſe calamities bee overpaſt.</hi> God never leaveth his in their extremities, whether in the Cave, or in the Mountain; in the Den, or in the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon; hee is alwaies there both in his power and aſſiſtance, and ſomtimes in his perſon too: when all natural ſupplies grow hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, God purveies for his children by his miracles: rocks ſhall burſt with water, and Ravens provide bread, and clouds drop fatneſſe, and heavens ſhower mannah, and Angels adminiſter comforts, which when we are naked ſhall cloath us, and receive us, or rather uſher us into theſe <hi>everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now beſides this expoſition of the words, theſe <hi>everlaſting habitations</hi> may receive a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119668:70"/>
double interpretation; one in reſpect of the everlaſting fame and glorie of your name in this world, the other in regard of your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reward in the next: and that firſt branch hath a double relation; one to your ſelf, the other to your poſteritie: &amp; truly even this part of the reward and retribution, namely in this life, is worth a great deal of your coſt and alms, that God ſhall eſtabliſh your poſteritie in the world, and in the good opinion of good men. <hi>The righteous ſhall have hope in his death, Prov.</hi> 14. 32. <hi>i. e.</hi> hope for himſelf in another world, and hope of his poſteritie in this world; for, ſaith hee, <hi>hee leaveth an inheritance to his children's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Prov.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>i. e.</hi> an inheritance out of which he hath taken and reſtored all that was unjuſtly got from men, and taken a bountiful part which he hath offered to God in pious uſes, that the reſt may deſcend free from all claims and incumbrances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his children's children. <hi>The righteous is merciful and lendeth, Pſal.</hi> 37. 26. merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as his Father is merciful in perpetual, not in tranſitorie endowments (for God did not ſet up his lights, his Sun and Moon for a day, but for ever; and ſuch ſhould our light, our good works be) <hi>He is mercifull
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119668:71"/>
and lendeth.</hi> To whom? for to the poor he giveth, he looks for no return from them; yet he lendeth, <hi>he that hath pitie on the poor, lendeth to the Lord, Prov. 19. 17. The righteous is merciful and lendeth,</hi> and then as <hi>David</hi> adds, <hi>his ſeed is bleſſed;</hi> bleſſed in this which follows there, that he ſhall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever; which he rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies again, <hi>Surely he ſhall not bee removed for ever,</hi> i. e. he ſhall never be moved in his poſteritie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly as he is bleſſed that way, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the eſtabliſhment of his poſſeſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his childrens children; ſo he is bleſſed in this, that his honor and good name ſhall be powred out as a fragrant oyl upon his poſteritie, <hi>The righteous ſhall bee had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance, Pſal.</hi> 112. 6. Their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie ſhall bee alwaies alive, and alwaies freſh in their poſteritie, when the name of the wicked ſhall rot. So then <hi>the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, Prov. 11. 30. i. e.</hi> the righteous ſhall produce plants that ſhal grow up and flouriſh, ſo his poſteritie ſhall bee a tree of life to many generations.</p>
                  <p>The other interpretation of <hi>everlaſting habitations,</hi> is in regard of your everlaſting reward in the next world: but before I
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119668:71"/>
ſpeak of your reward in the next world, I will ſpeak a word or two of your reward in this world, and ſhew you how God will reward you with grace in this world, before he rewards you with glorie in the next; by giving you the grace to uſe thoſe temporal bleſſings which he hath given you to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie here, and to your glorie both here and hereafter: which ſhall bee cleared to you from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine, &amp;c. Your Father</hi> is not meant here as if men ſhould glorifie God as the common Father of all by Creation, nor as he is the Father of ſome in a more particular conſideration, in giving them large portions, great patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in this world: for thus he may be my Father, and yet diſ-inherit me; he may give me plentie of temporal bleſſings, and withold from me ſpiritual and eternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Theſe are not the Paternities of the Text, that men ſhould glorifie God as the Father of all men by Creation, nor as the Father of all rich men, by their large patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but as he is your Father, as hee is made yours, as he is becom yours by that particular grace of uſing the temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which he hath given you to his glory, In letting your light ſhine before men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:119668:72"/>Upon which our firſt doctrinal Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall bee, That it were better God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited<note place="margin">1. Doctrin.</note> us, ſo as to give us nothing, then that he gave us not the grace to uſe that, that hee gave us, well. Without this all his bread were ſtones, all his fiſhes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, all his temporall liberality and bleſſings, a meer malediction and curſe. How much happier had that man been, that hath waſted thouſands in play, in riot, in wantonneſſe, in ſinfull exceſſes, if his parents had left him no more at firſt, then he hath left himſelfe at laſt, how much neerer to the Kingdome of heaven had he been, if he had been born a beggar here. Nay though he have done no ill of ſuch exceſſive kindes, how much happier had he been, if he had had nothing left him, if he have don no good.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Obſervation in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar<note place="margin">2. Doctr.</note> ſhall bee, That 'tis a fearful thing for rich men, not to uſe their riches for God's glorie. There cannot be a more fearefull commination upon man, nor a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous dereliction from God, then when God ſaies <hi>Pſal:</hi> 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8, 12. <hi>I will not reprove thee for thy ſacrifices;</hi> Though thou offer none, I care not; i'le never tell thee of it, nor
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119668:72"/>
reprove thee for it; <hi>I will not reprove thee for thy ſacrifices.</hi> And when he ſaith, as he does there, If I be hungry I will not tell thee, I will not awake thy charity; I will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite thee, nor provoke thee with any occaſion of feeding me, in feeding the poor. When God ſhall ſay to thee, I care not whether you come to Church or no, whether you pray or noe, repent or no, confeſſe, receive or no; this is a fearefull dereliction: ſo it is when he ſaith to a rich man, I care not whether your light ſhine out, or no; whether men ſee your good workes, or no; I can provide for my Glory otherwiſe. For certainly God hath not determined his glory, and his purpoſe, ſo much in that, to make ſome men rich, that the poore might be releeved, for that ends in a bodily releife; as in this, that he hath made ſome men poor, whereby the rich might have occaſion to exerciſe their charity; for that riches to ſpirituall happineſs. For which uſe the poor do not ſo much need the rich, as the rich need the poore; the poor may better be ſaved without the rich, then the rich without the poore. But when men ſhall ſee that that God who is the Father of us all by creating us, and the Father of all the rich, by enriching them, is alſo become
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119668:73"/>
your Father, yours by adoption, yours by infuſion of that particular grace to do good with your goods; then are you made bleſſed inſtruments to that which God ſeekes here, his glory, <hi>they ſhall glorifie your father which is in heaven;</hi> and then your Father which is in heaven will glorify you. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, ſaith Chriſt,</hi> John. 15. 8. <hi>that ye beare much fruit.</hi> The ſeed ſowed in good ground bore ſome a Hundred fold, the leaſt Thirty, <hi>Marke.</hi> 4. 20. The ſeed in this caſe is the example that is before you of thoſe good men whoſe life hath ſhined out ſo, that you have ſeen their good workes. Let this ſeede, theſe good examples bring forth Hundreds, and Sixties, and Thirties in you, much fruit: for herein is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorified that you beare much fruit. Of which plentifull encreaſe I am afraid there is one great hindrance that paſſes through many of you, <hi>i. e.</hi> that when your Will lies by you, in which ſome little lamp of this light is ſet up, ſomething given to God in pious uſes; if a Ship miſcarry, if a Debter breake, if your Eſtate be any way empaired, the Firſt that ſuffers, the firſt that is blotted out of the Will, is God and his legacy:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119668:73"/>
And if their eſtates encreaſe, portions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and perchance other legacies; but Gods portion and legacy ſtands at a ſtay.</p>
                  <p>Now let me from hence give you a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> did of his paſſion: Chriſt left two uſes, of his paſſion, applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Imitation: he ſuffered for us; 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. For us, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we might make his death ours, apply his death; And then as if followers there, he left us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. So Chriſt gives us two uſes of the reformation of religion; Firſt the Doctrine how to do good workes, without relying on them, as meritorous; and then example. Many, very many men in this Citie, Whoſe lights have ſhined out before you, and you have ſeen their good workes; That as this noble City hath juſtly acquired the reputation; and the teſtimony of all who have had occaſion to conſider their dealings in that kinde, that they deale moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, moſt juſtly, moſt providently in all things which are committed to their truſt, for pious uſes from others, not onely in a full employment of that which was given, but in an improvement thereof, and then an imployment of that improvement to the ſame pious uſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo every man in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119668:74"/>
may propoſe to himſelfe ſome of thoſe bleſſed examples, which have riſen among your ſelves, and follow that, and exceede that: that as your Lights are Torches, and not petty Candles, and your Torches bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then others Torches, ſo he alſo may be a larger example to others, then others have been to him: <hi>For herein is your Father glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if you bear much fruit;</hi> and that is the end of all that we all do, that men ſeeing it may glorifie our Father which is in heaven, that our Father which is in heaven may glorifie us, by receiving us into theſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting habitations, which is the laſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the words, our eternal reward in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Of which everlaſting habitations of this eternal reward I know not well what to ſay. And indeed it is not for a finite intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to conceive, much leſſe to expreſſe thoſe infinite joies <hi>which God hath prepared</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for them that love him, 1 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 2. 9. And thoſe that think to attein to the knowledg of theſe <hi>eternal habitations</hi> by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, will be reckoned as curious ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers into God's ſecrets, and may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the reproof of the <hi>Galileans, Acts 1. Why ſtana yee gazing up into Heaven.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119668:74"/>
to ſatisfie you as far as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Antient <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> warrant me, I will obſerve this method in explaining theſe <hi>eternal habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which is all one with eternal life. I will firſt ſhew you what this eternal life is by the privation of it, what the life of heaven is by the life of hell; and then I will give you a glimpſe (for a full ſight it is impoſſible) what it is in its ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt the privation of this life<note place="margin">1. Doctr.</note> which is hell our firſt poſition or Doctrine ſhall be this; There are ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning hell, in which a man may goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his reaſon, and yet thoſe things have no relation to his faith. For that there is an hell, a damnation, an eternall life there; and why it is; and when it is; it is clear enough from Scripture: but what this dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is, neither the tongue of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that know damnation by the contrary, by the fruition of ſalvation; Nor the tongue of bad Angels, who know damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a lamentable experience, is able to expreſſe it. There are things in which a man may go beyond his reaſon, and yet not meet with faith neither: of ſuch a kind are thoſe things that concern the locality of hell,

and the materiality of the torments thereof. For that hell is a certain and limited place, beginning here, and ending there: and extending no farther; or that the torments of hell, be materiall, or elementary torments, which in naturall conſideration can have no conſideration, no affection, or appliableneſſe to the tormenting of a ſpirit; theſe things neither ſets my reaſon, nor the bind my faith; neither opinion, that it is, or is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo, doth command our reaſon ſo, but that probable reaſons may be brought on the other ſide; neither opinion doth ſo command our faith, but that a man may be ſaved, though he think the contrary. Our inſtruction therefore is, that in ſuch a point it is alwayes lawfull to think ſo: as we find does moſt advance, and exalt our own devotion, and Gods glory, in our eſtimation. But now in the Second place when we ſhall have given to theſe words, by which hell is expreſſed in the ſcripture the heavieſt ſignification, that either the nature of thoſe words can admit in themſelves, or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This then is our ſecond Poſition of our<note place="margin">2. Doctr.</note> diſcourſe in this particular, that hell is the privation of the beatificall viſion of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity. And this I ſhal amplifie by give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you the ſeveral degrees of this privation. Firſt in generall, for the foundation of all the reſt, you are to know that the torments and miſeries of hell are thus deſcribed, by our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Matt: 25. 4. depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Devill and his angels.</hi> In this word <hi>from me</hi> is the height of paint, the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of torment: and thus I will prove it. Frſt it is fearfull to undergo pain, though that pain be but momentary: as for inſtance, to thruſt a finger into the fire, though but for the turning of a hand, or to have but one
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119668:76"/>
ſingle drop of brimſtone fall into the eye, the miſery but of this ſingle drop of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were unſufferable. But then Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the whole man to lie under everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cataracts, and ſhowers of Brimſtone: to have the body eternally fed upon by a fire that never goes out, and the ſoule by a worme that never dies, the miſery of this as far ſurmounts that other, as eternity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds time; and yet this is not all. For thirdly, the damned ſinner muſt go from Chriſt into this eternity of torment. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me yee curſed, into everlaſting fire.</hi> Where the firſt part of the ſentence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably the heavieſt; the departing from Chriſt worſe then the everlaſting fire: the intenſiveneſs of that fire, the aire of that brimſtone, the anguiſh of that worme, the diſcord of that howling, the gnaſhing of thoſe teeh is no comparable, no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of the torment, in reſpect of this departing from Chriſt. Which is the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſight of God, the baniſhment from the preſence of God, an abſolute hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, an utter impoſſibility of ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which ſuſtaines the miſerable in this world; who though they ſee no ſun here, yet they ſhall ſee the ſonne of God
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119668:76"/>
there. This <hi>depart from me</hi> then is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of horror, the very eſſentiall forme and quiddity of damnation it ſelf. The righteous they depart, they go to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, but they go with Chriſt into heaven, the other muſt go from Chriſt into hell. Into hell did I ſay, why that is not ſo much neither. It were an hapineſſe to go to hell with Chriſt, no joy, no bliſſeat all to the righteous to go without Chriſt into heaven. For heaven is hell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, and hell with Chriſt is heaven; and the reaſon of this is, becauſe the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Saints doth not conſiſt in the place where they are, but in the company which they injoy: their beatitude is not bounded and terminated by any etheriall dimenſions of ſpace, any ſupernaturall lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calities, but it is comprehended in the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall Viſion of the <hi>Fathers</hi> power, the <hi>Sons</hi> wiſedome, the <hi>Holy-Ghoſts</hi> goodneſſe; it is ſwallowed up in that extati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>all raviſhing contemplation of the incomparable beauty, the unutterable and unconceivable glory of the bleſſed Trinity; the privation of which Beatificall Viſion exceeds the miſeries and torments, thoſe matchleſs, thoſe endleſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and torments even of hell it ſelfe. And thus have I given you a generall deſcription,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119668:77"/>
of this privation of the Beatifical Viſion, what it is in the general notion of it.</p>
                  <p>But then in the ſecond place, to come (as I promiſed) to the ſeveral particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this privation; there is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this privation of the Beatifical Viſion in the firſt place, a privation of the care of God, that a damned ſinner is out of his care, out of his thought. It is a fearful thing, ſaith the Apoſtle, to fall into the hands of the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 13. Yet there was a caſe in which <hi>David</hi> found it an eaſe to fal into the hands of the living God, but to fall out of the hands of the living God is an horrour beyond our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, beyond our imagination: that God ſhould let my ſoul fal out of his hands into a bottomleſſe pit, and roul an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable ſtone upon it, and leave it to that which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> findes there (and it ſhal finde that there which it never imagined till it came there) &amp; never think any more of that ſoul, never have any more to do withit. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a ſecond degree of this privation of the Beatifical Viſion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, that herein doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a privation of the general providence of God, that ſuch an one is out of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral providence as wel as his particular care:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119668:77"/>
that of that Providence of God that ſtudies the life of every Weed, and Worm, and Ant, of every Spider and Toad, and Viper, there ſhould never any beam flow out upon me, never any ray dart upon mee, never any line center in mee: That the moſt contemptible creatures under heaven, and the moſt loathſom crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures under heaven, and the moſt venemous creatures under heaven, ſhould be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and protected under the ſhadow of his wing; and I, onely I, excluded as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prey for the Raven and Dragon of the bottomleſſe pit. Thirdly here is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the power of God; that that God who look'd upon me when I was nothing, and cal'd me by his omnipotent power when I was not, as though I had been, out of the wombe &amp; depth of darkneſſe, will not look upon me now: when, though amiſerable &amp; a baniſh'd and a damned creature, yet I am his creature ſtil &amp; contribute ſomething to his glorie, even in my damnation. Laſtly which is the higheſt degree of this Privation, here is an eternal privation of the mercie of God: That that God who hath often look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me even in my fouleſt uncleanneſſe, and vileſt ſins: who when I had ſhut out the eye
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119668:78"/>
of the day, the Sun; and the eye of the night, the taper, and the eies of all the world with curtains, and windows, and doors, did yet ſee me, and ſee me in mercie too, by making me ſee that he ſaw me, and ſometimes brought me to a preſent remorſe, and for that time to a forbearing of that ſin, I was then acting, ſhould now ſo turn himſelf from me to his glorious Saints and Angels, as that no Saint nor Angel, nor Chriſt Jeſus himſelf ſhould ever pray him to look towards me more, never remember him that ſuch a ſoul there is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That that God who hath ſo often ſaid to my ſoul, Why wilt thou die? and ſo often ſworn to my ſoul, As the Lord liveth I would not have thee die but live, wil nether let me die nor live, but die an everlaſting life, and live an everlaſting death: That that God, who when he could not get into me by ſtanding and knocking at my heart, by his ordinarie means of entring by his Word, &amp; Miniſtershis mercies, hath applied his judgments, and hath ſhak'd the houſe this bodie with Agues and Palſies, and hath ſet this houſe on fire with Fevers and calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and frighted the maſter of the houſe, my ſoul, with horrors and heavie apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119668:78"/>
and ſo made and forc'd an entrance into me; That that God ſhould fruſtrate all his own purpoſes, and practiſes upon me, and leave me and caſt me away, as though I had coſt him nothing, that this God at laſt at the houre of death, ſhould let this Soul go away, as a ſmoake, as a vapour, as a bubble, and that then this Soul cannot be ſo happy, as to be a ſmoake, a vapour, nor a bubble, but muſt lie in darkneſſe, as long as the Lord of light is light it's ſelfe, and never ſpark of that lighe reach to my Soul; what Tophet is not Paradiſe? what brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is not amber? what gnaſhing of teeth is not muſick? what gnawing of the worm is not a tickling? what torment is not a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age bed to this damnation? to be ſecluded eternally, eternally, eternally from the ſight of God. And thus have I ſhewn you what this eternal life is by the privation of it, what the life of heaven is by the life of hell, I will now endeavour to give you a glimpſe, for a full ſight it is impoſſible, of theſe everlaſting habitations, this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And here in my expreſſions of theſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting habitations, I will take a new courſe, and onely tell you this of them, that they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119668:79"/>
cannot be expreſſed. For if that <hi>beloved aiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> whoſe head lay neer his <hi>Maſters heart,</hi> who from the boſom of his Lord drank deep of the heavenly wiſdome, if Saint <hi>John</hi> I ſay brake of his Revelation with a <hi>nemo ſcit no man knowes, Apoca:</hi> 2. 17. needs muſt I leave you at this time with a <hi>Theologia negativa,</hi> a negative divinity, or divine ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and onely tell you what is not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The plumage of the ſwan appeares more faire, when it is oppoſed to the ravens black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and wee may beſt conjecture at the joyes above, if wee conſider the miſeries here below. This life of ours if it were not ſhort, yet it is miſerable, and if it were not miſerable, yet it is ſhort. In this world are a world of troubles, we have no reſting place here ſaith the Prophet; glory and reſt are two things that meet not here: the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious life is not the moſt quiet, and the quiet life is for the moſt part inglorious; riches and honour like <hi>Abſolons</hi> mule do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leave their Maſter in extremity. A conſideration if well digeſted, which would gather our divided thoughts and rouſe up our Soules to ſeeke firſt the Kingdome of heaven; and then we know <hi>coetera adjicientur</hi> other things ſhall be added unto us. And
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119668:79"/>
indeed when heaven is once named all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are but <hi>&amp; cetera's,</hi> not worth the naming. But now for heaven it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by thoſe that are ſkill'd in the holy tongue, that in the ſacred name <hi>Jehova</hi> are none but <hi>literae quieſcentes,</hi> myſtically impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus much unto us, that <hi>Deus eſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum quietatiuum,</hi> that God is the God of reſt; in whoſe preſence there is joy, &amp; fulneſs of joy, &amp; joy for evermore, as David ſings. When once we ſhall be planted in that celeſtiall paradiſe, there ſhall no apple of contention grow between God and us. It is <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens note,</hi> upon that divine antheme, of three parts, <hi>Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, good will towards men, Luk. 2. pugnas &amp; diſſidia neſcire deum &amp; angelos,</hi> that there are no broils nor brabbles in heaven. There ſhall the Soul be ſatiſfied in all her deſires: there ſhall be no actuall or potentiall evill; no actuall, becauſe grace being conſummate in the Saints, excludes all ſin; no poetential, for they being confirmed in goodneſſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin. There ſhall be no ſorrow, nor tears the effect of ſorrow, thoſe rivers of our eyes ſhall be dried up; there ſhall be no more death, for <hi>reſurrectio erit mors mortis.</hi> At that <hi>jubilee</hi> of glory, the conqueror ſhall be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119668:80"/>
diſarmed, and we whom death hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, ſhall overcome death. Our bodies riſing firſt immortall, not ſubject to any more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe or death, we ſhall not any more ſtand in need of thoſe ordinary helpes of meat and drinke, by which our nature is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for it ſhall then be our meat and drink to do our Fathers will. Secondly, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall riſe glorious, the juſt ſhall ſhine <hi>like the ſun in the firm ament; ſaies the Prophet, &amp; qualis erit ſplendor animarum, quando ſolis claritatem habebit lux corporum,</hi> and how great then ſhall the ſplendour of our Soules be, when that of our bodies ſhall exceed the Suns. And to confirme the verity and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of this glory, it ſhall not onely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us, but (ſaith <hi>the Apoſtle</hi>) in us, <hi>Jeruſalem (as the Kings daughter) is all glorious within.</hi> Thirdly, they ſhall be perfect, every defective member ſhall be reſtored to it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrity. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall not halt, nor <hi>Iſaac</hi> be blind, nor <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> be lame. Fourthly, our bodies ſhall be raiſed impaſſionate, free from ſuch paſſions, as may hurt and offend, but not from the paſſions of joy, the joy of the ſoul, ſhall be the ſoul of joy. Laſtly, they ſhall be ſpirituall, that is in quality, not in ſubſtance; they ſhall ſtill remaine the ſame
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119668:80"/>
quantitative bodies, bounded and limited with their natural dimenſions. For otherwiſe how could <hi>Job</hi> ſee God with the ſame eyes, he had while he lived. Our bodies therefore ſhall be endued with moſt unſpeakable perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and moſt perfectly clarified from all imperfections, but they ſhall not be diſrob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their natural properties: briefly they ſhal be ſpirituall in a three-fold ſence. Fiſt in that they ſhall be wholly freed from all earthly droſſy corruptions, all the ſences ſhall be more ſubtle, the body it's ſelfe ſhall become more light, and apt to motion; and as neer the nature and qualitie of a ſpirit as a body may be. Secondly, cauſe they ſhall be no more upheld, and maintain'd by earthly meanes and helpes, but be preſerved by ſpirituall meanes, <hi>i e.</hi> by the power of Gods holy Spirit. What uſe ſhall there be of the creature, when the Creator himſelfe the Lord of heaven and earth is in place. And in theſe two reſpects eſpecially, they ſhall be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, equal to angels. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſhall be Spiritual becauſe they ſhall never rebell, but be alwaies ſubject and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the regenerate ſoul, without contradiction they ſhall obey the motions of the ſpirit. Other particulars I ceaſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119668:81"/>
cauſe the Scripture doth forbeare to deliver them; and in the ſilence of the holy-Ghoſt I will not be curious: leaſt by this meanes I looſe my ſelfe, in the labyrinth of theſe everlaſting habitations, whereto the Arts never taught an entrance in; nor Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ever diſcovered a paſſage out. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt light we have (which is but dimm nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) is held out vnto us by Scripture, and the primitive Doctors of the Church, in theſe particulars of eternall life, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal habitations: firſt in the comfort that the Saints ſhall pertake of there, Secondly in their joy, Thirdly in the ſight, and Laſtly in the knowledge which the Saints ſhall have of the bleſſed Trinity in heaven. And firſt as to the comfort, this is in ſome ſort expreſſed, <hi>John 14 2. In my fathers houſe are many manſions.</hi> Where our Saviour admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſeverall Recipees of comfort to his afflcted diſciples, by reaſon of his going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and of this comfort the firſt beam is, that that ſtate which he promiſes them, and in them all faithful believers, is a houſe; it hath a foundation, no earth-quake ſhall ſhake it; it hath a wall, no artillery ſhall batter it; it hath a roof, no tempeſt ſhall pierce it. It is a houſe that affords ſecurity,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119668:81"/>
and that is one degree of comfort. And then Secondly it is his <hi>Fathers houſe,</hi> a houſe in which he hath intereſt; and that is another degree of this conſolation. It was his fathers, and ſo his; and his, and ſo ours; for we are not joynt purchaſers of heaven with the <hi>Saints;</hi> but we are co-heirs with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> by death we are gathered to our fathers in nature, and by death through his mercy gathered to his father alſo, where we ſhall have a full ſatiſfaction, in that wherein <hi>Saint Philip</hi> placed all ſatiſfaction, <hi>Lord ſhew us thy Father and 'tis enough, John the</hi> 4. 8. We ſhall ſee his father, and ſee him made ours in Chriſt. And then a third degree of this comfort is, that in this houſe of his fathers, thus by him made ours, there are manſions, which word in the originall, and latine, and our language, ſignifies a remaining, an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and fixing, and denotes the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the everlaſtingneſſe of that ſtate, an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting State; and yet a ſtate but of one day, becauſe no night ſhall overtake or determine it, but ſuch a day as is not of a thouſand yeares, which is the longeſt meaſure of any day in ſcripture, but a thouſand Millions of Millions of generations; a day that hath no <hi>pridie</hi> nor <hi>poſtridie,</hi> yeſterday doth not uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119668:82"/>
it in, nor to morrow ſhall not drive it out. <hi>Methuſalem</hi> with all his hundreds of yeares, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. Was but a muſhrom of a nights growth to this day. And all the foure Monarchies, with all their thouſands of years, and all the powerful Kings, and all the buea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Queenes of the world, were but a bed of flowers, ſome gathered at ſix, ſome at ſeven, ſome at eight, all in one morning in reſpect of this day. In all the two thouſand years of nature, before the law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the two thouſand years of law before the Goſpel given by Chriſt, and the too thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years of grace, which are runnig now, (of which laſt hour, we have heard three quarters ſtrike already, more then ſixteen hundred of this laſt two thouſand ſpent) in all this ſix thouſand, and in all thoſe which God may be pleaſed to add, in this houſe of his Fathers in heaven there was never heard quarter-clock to ſtrike, never ſeen mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute glaſs to run. No time leſſe then it's ſelf would ſerve to expreſs this time, which is intended in this word manſions: which is alſo exalted with another beam a fourth beam of comfort, that they are alſo <hi>many; in my Fathers houſe are many manſions.</hi> In which circumſtance we do conſider the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119668:82"/>
of our ſociety and converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſince ſociety and converſation is noe great element and ingredient into the comfort which we have in this world. Firſt we ſhall have an aſſociation with <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, for where he is it is his promiſe that we alſo ſhall be, <hi>John</hi> 14. Secondly we ſhall have an aſſociation with the Angels, and ſuch an one as we ſhall be ſuch as they. Thirdly we ſhall have an aſſociation with the <hi>Saints,</hi> and not onely to be ſuch as they, but to be they; and to be with all thoſe who come from the Eaſt &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 11. Where we ſhall be ſo far from being enemies to one another, as that we ſhall not be ſtrangers to one another; &amp; ſo far from envying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that all that every one hath ſhall be every others poſſeſſion: where all Souls ſhal be ſo entirely knit together, as if there were but one Soul, and God ſo entirely knit to every Soul, as if there were as many Gods as Souls.</p>
                  <p>And this is that glimpſe of the eternal life I promiſed you; a meer curſorie ſight and view of thoſe everlaſting habitations and manſions in the Text: and here as I have given you a glimpſe of the comforts, ſo let me beg leave of your patience to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119668:83"/>
preſent you with a taſte of the joyes of heaven likewiſe: and it ſhall be a taſte, moſt properly ſo called; For it ſhall be but of one drop of the Fountain of life; I meane that drop which <hi>Dives</hi> in Hel deſired to coole his tongue with: which muſt not be ſo underſtood, as if the paines of hell were ſo ſmall that they might be quenched by one drop of water; but rather thus, that one drop of water, where <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> are, is of that infinite vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as could it be but drop'd into the pains of hell, it would quench them all. Now the greatneſs of theſe joies may be comprehended both by the fulneſſe of the objects in heaven; and alſo the fulneſs of our enjoiying the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there. The objects in heaven are many, but the ſumme of all is God, whom we ſhall ſee face to face; and in him all that is good and joifull; for as looking in a glaſſe wee ſee the glaſſe, our ſelves, and moſt things that are in the room about it: ſo in the glaſſe of the bleſſed <hi>Trinitie,</hi> we ſhall by the <hi>Beatifical Viſion,</hi> ſee the glorie of that <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> our ſelves, an our own glorie, and all the Angels, Saints and pleaſures that are about that Trinitie. And as our joy ſhall be full, in regard of the fulneſſe of the object,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119668:83"/>
ſo it ſhall be full too in regard of our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of enjoying that object. Wee ſhall feel this joy with all the powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our ſouls, ever beholding, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſatisfied, and ever drinking, yet ſtill thirſting, not with any thirſt of drineſſe, but with a thirſt of deſire after that water of life, thoſe rivers of joy, which are ſaid <hi>Pſal. 46. 4. to make glad the citie of the Lord.</hi> And thus as I have given you a taſte of theſe joies from the Scriptures drop of water, ſo now ſhould I give you all thoſe rivers of Rhetorical expreſſions, ſhould I open all the flood-gates of Oratorie, with which the Primitive Doctors of the Church have endeavored to expreſſe thoſe joies, all would prove but as one drop of water in reſpect of the infinite ocean of thoſe joies. And this may appear from that ſtorie of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concerning Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> of whom Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>quae Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus neſcivit nullus hominum unquam ſcivit,</hi> that that S. <hi>Jerome</hi> knew not, no man ever knew: and S. <hi>Cyril</hi> (to whom S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid that) ſaid alſo to Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in magnifying Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> that when a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Prieſt diſputed with an Heretick, and cited a paſſage of Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> and the

Now as no man can know what it is to ſee God in heaven but by experimental and actual ſeeing of him there, nor what it is to love God there, but by ſuch an actual and experimental love of him; nor what it is to enjoy and poſſeſſe God, but by an actual enjoying, and experimental poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of him; ſo can no man tell what the eternity and everlaſtingneſſe of all theſe is, till he hath paſſed through that eternity, and that everlaſtingneſſe; and that he can never do. For if it could be paſſed through, then it were not eternity.

                  <p>The third and fourth particulars (that I mentioned before) to illuſtrate theſe <hi>ever la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting habitations in the text,</hi> are the ſight and the knowledg which the Saints ſhall have of the bleſſed Trinitie there. And both theſe are held out unto us in that ſingle text of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119668:85"/>
Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 12. For now we ſee through a glaſſe darkly, but then face to face: now I know in part, but then ſhall I know even as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo am known.</hi> Now as for the ſight of God here, our theater is the world, our Medium and Glaſſe is the creature, &amp; our light is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and as for our knowledg of God here, our Academy is the Church, our Medium the Ordinances of the Church, and our light, the light of Faith: ſo we may conſider the ſame termes, Firſt for the ſight of God, and then for the knowledg of God in the next life.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the ſpheare, the place where we ſhal ſee him, is Heaven. He that asks me what heaven is, means not to heare me, but ſilence me: he knows I cannot tell him: When I meet him there, I ſhall be able to tell him, &amp; then he will be as able to tell me: yet then we ſhall be but able to tell one another this that we enjoy is heaven; but the tongue of Angels, the tongue of gloried Saints, ſhall not be able to expreſſe what that heaven is: for even in heaven our faculties ſhall be finite. Heaven is not a place that was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for al places that were created ſhall be diſſolved. God did not Plant a Paradice for himſelfe, &amp; remove to that; as he planted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119668:86"/>
a Paradice for <hi>Adam,</hi> and removed him to that. But God is ſtill where he was before the World was made. And in that place where there are more Sunns, then there are Stars in the firmament: for all the Saints are ſunnes; and more light inanother ſun, the Son of righteouſneſſe, the Son of glory, the Son of God, then in all them; in that illuſtration, in that emanation, that effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of beames of Glory, which began not to ſhine ſix Thouſand yeares agoe, but ſix Thouſand millions of millions agoe; and had been ſix thouſand millions of millions before that, in thoſe eternall, in thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created heavensſhall we ſee God. This is our ſphear, and that which we are fain to call our place. And then our <hi>Medium,</hi> our way to ſee them, is <hi>Patefactio ſui,</hi> Gods laying himſelfe open, his manifeſtation, his revelation, his eviſceration, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowelling of himſelfe to us there. Doth God never afford this manifeſtation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his eſſence to any in this life? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer yea nor no, without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great part in the <hi>School.</hi> There are that ſay, that it is <hi>fere de Fide,</hi> little leſſe then an Article of Faith that it hath been ſo; And <hi>Aquinas</hi> denies it ſo abſolutely, as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119668:86"/>
that his followers interpret him <hi>De abſoluta potentia,</hi> that God by his abſolute power cannot make a man, remaining a mortall man, and under the definition of a mortall man, capable of ſeeing his eſſence; As we may truly ſay, that God cannot make a beaſt remaining in that nature capable of grace or Glory. Now as 'tis fairly argued that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffred not the very torments of very hel, becauſ tis eſſential to the torments of hel to be eternal, they were not torments of hel, if they received an end; So it's fairly argued too that neither <hi>Adam</hi> in his extaſy in Paradiſe, nor <hi>Moſes</hi> in his converſation in the mount, nor the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the tranſfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, nor <hi>Saint Paul</hi> in his rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the third heavens, ſaw the eſſence of God; becauſe he that is admitted to the ſight of God, can never look off, nor loſe that ſight again. Onely in heaven ſhall God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to this patefaction, this manifeſtation, this revelation of himſelfe, and that by the light of Glory. The light of Glory is ſuch a light, as that our <hi>Schoolemen</hi> dare not ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, that every beam of it is not all of it. For as the eſſence of God is indiviſible, &amp; he that ſees any of it, ſees al of it; ſo is the light of glory communicated entirely to every
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119668:87"/>
bleſſed ſoul. To this light of glory, the light of honour, is but a glow-worm, and majeſty it ſelf but a twilight; nay that Goſpel its ſelf, which the Apoſtle calls the glorious Goſpel, is but a ſtar of the leaſt magnitude. And if I cannot tell what to call this light by which I ſhal ſee it, what ſhal I cal that which I ſhal ſee by it, the eſſence of God himſelf? and yet there is ſomething elſe then this fight of God intended in that which remaines; I ſhal not onely ſee God face, to face, but I ſhall know him, and know him even as I alſo am known.</p>
                  <p>In this conſideration God alone is all; in all the former there was a place, and a meanes, and a light; here for this perfect knowledge of God, God is all thoſe. Then ſaith the Apoſtle God ſhall be all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. Here God doth all in all, but here he doth all by inſtruments, even in the infuſing of Faith, he works by the miniſtery of the Goſpel: but there he ſhall be all in all, do all in all immediately by himſelfe; for Chriſt ſhall deliver up the Kingdome to God even the Father; his Kingdome is the adminiſtration of his Church by his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in the Church: at the reſurrection there ſhall be an end of that Kingdome; no
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119668:87"/>
more Church, no more working upon men by Preaching, but God himſelfe ſhall be all in all: therefore it is ſaid, in heaven there is no Temple; but God himſelfe is the Temple, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 22. God is the ſervice and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and <hi>Sermon,</hi> and <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and all. We ſhall live upon the word, and heare never a word. Here God is not all in all, where he is at all in any man, that man is well. Wiſedom in <hi>Solomon,</hi> it was well with <hi>Solomon</hi> becauſe God was wiſedom with him; and patience in <hi>Job,</hi> and faith in <hi>Peter,</hi> and zeal in <hi>Paul,</hi> but there was ſomething in all theſe that God was not. But in heaven he ſhall be ſo all in all, that every ſoul ſhall have every perfection in it's ſelfe, and the perfection of theſe perfections ſhall be, that their ſight ſhall be face to face, and their knowledge as they are known.</p>
                  <p>But now for the firſt of theſe privileges, how ſhall we ſee God face to face; is it all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a declaration of Gods favour, when God ſhewes his face? No; I will ſet my face againſt that ſoul, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 10. but when there is light joyned with it, it is a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of favour; this was the bleſſing that God taught <hi>Moſes</hi> for <hi>Aaron, Num. 6 25 The Lord make his face ſhine upon thee.</hi> And there
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119668:88"/>
we ſhall ſee him face to face by the light of his countenance, which is the light of glory. But what ſhall we ſee by ſeeing God ſo face to face? we ſhall ſee whatever we can be the better for ſeeing. Firſt, all things that men believed here, they ſhall ſee there; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us me ditate upon no other thing on earth, then we would be glad to think on in heaven; and this conſideration would put many frivolous, and many fond thoughts out of our mind. This then we ſhal get concerning our ſelvs by ſeeing God face to face; but what concerning God? Wee ſhall ſee God as he is in his eſſence. Why? did all that are ſaid to have ſeen God face to face ſee his eſſence? No. In earth God aſſumed ſome material things to appear in, and is ſaid to have been ſeen face to face when he was ſeen in thoſe aſſumed forms. But in heaven there is no material thing to bee aſſumed, and if God be ſeen face to face there, hee is ſeen in his eſſence. <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> ſumms it up, fully upon thoſe words, In thy light we ſhall ſee light, <hi>te</hi> ſcil. <hi>in te,</hi> Wee ſhall ſee thee in thee, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith he, face to face.</p>
                  <p>And then ſecondly what is it, <hi>To know him as wee are known:</hi> it is not expreſſed in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119668:88"/>
the Text ſo: that is onely that we ſhall know ſo, not that we ſhall know God ſo; but the frame and context of the place hath drawn that unanime Expoſition from all, that it is meant of our knowledg of God then. A comprehenſive knowledg of God it cannot bee; to comprehend, is to know a thing as well as that thing can be known; and wee can never know God ſo, but that he will know himſelf better. Our knowe ledge cannot be ſo dilated, nor God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd or contracted ſo, as that we can know him that way comprehenſively. It cannot bee ſuch a knowledge of God as God hath of himſelf, nor as God hath of us; for God comprehends us and all this world, and all the worlds that hee could have made, and himſelf. But it is <hi>not a ſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis non aequalitatis,</hi> as God knows mee, ſo ſhall I know God, but I ſhall not know God ſo as God knows me. It is not <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> but <hi>ſicut,</hi> not as much, but as truly. As the fire does as truly ſhine as the Sun ſhines, though it ſhine not out ſo far, nor to ſo many purpoſes. So then I ſhall know God ſo, as that there ſhall be nothing in me to hinder me from knowing God: which cannot be ſaid of the nature of man, though
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119668:89"/>
regenerate, upon earth, no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Angel in heaven left to it ſelf, till both have received a <hi>ſuper</hi>-illuſtration from the light of glorie. And ſo it ſhall be a knowledge ſo like his knowledge, as it ſhall produce a love like his love, &amp; we ſhall love him as he loves us. For ſay the Fathers, whom <hi>Oecumenius</hi> hath compacted, I ſhall know him, <hi>i. e.</hi> embrace him, adhere to him. What an holiday ſhall this be, which no working day ſhall ever follow. By knowing and loving the unchangeable, the immutable God, <hi>mutabimur in immutabilitatem,</hi> we ſhall be changed into an unchangeableneſſe ſaith that Father, that never ſaid any thing but extraordinarie (Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>). Hee ſaith more; If God ſhould be ſeen and known in hell, hell in an inſtant would be heaven. How many heavens are there in heaven? how is heaven multiplied to every ſoul in heaven? where infinite other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes are crown'd with this ſight, and this knowledge of God there. And how ſhall all thoſe heavens be renewed to us every day, that ſhall bee as glad to ſee and to know God millions of ages after every daies ſeeing and knowing as the firſt hour of looking upon his face? And as this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:119668:89"/>
this knowing of God crowns all other joies and glories even in heaven, ſo this very crown is crown'd; there grows from this an higher glorie, which is that we ſhall be made partakers of the divine nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Immortal as the Father, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as the Son, and full of all comfort as the Holy Ghoſt. To which bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bee ever (as is moſt due) aſcribed all Honour, and Glorie, Dominion, and Power, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:119668:93"/>

                  <p>Secondly by Suffering you are to denie your ſelves herein, by being willing to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the greateſt ſcandals and indignitics that can be thrown upon you for the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Though all your friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, your father, mother, husband, wife ſhould caſt you off and abandon you for ever, you muſt be content to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <p>And the reaſon wherefore Chriſt teacheth you to denie your ſelves herein is, 'cauſe you are to take up your Croſſe and follow Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> muſt expect reproaches, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tribulations for the name and ſake of Chriſt, <hi>Joh</hi> 16. 33. A man that hath not learn'd this leſſon of Chriſt, can never ſuffer with comfort and joy.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119668:94"/>
let me ſubmit to Chriſt, ſaith he, to every Truth, to every Ordinance, although I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer loſſe in the world, reproach and ſhame from my friends and acquaintance, though I loſe the love of my beſt friends, whether father, mother, husband, wife, yet ſaith the <hi>ſelf-denying Chriſtian,</hi> Chriſt hath ſaid, that whoſoever loveth father or mother better then me, is not worthie of me: And this love of Chriſt conſtraineth mee to deny my ſelf, &amp; follow Chriſt in all conditions. Thus you ſee the ſelf-denying ſoul, and none elſe, is meet to be a diſciple, a follower of Chriſt; becauſe hee is moſt ready to take up the <hi>Croſſe</hi> and follow him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly we muſt deny our ſelves as in our great places, and honours, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo likewiſe in our profits, pleaſures, in all our carnal worldly enjoiments. Oh how hard is it for a poor crcature to deny himſelf in this! <hi>How hard is it for a rich man,</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>to enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Luk. 18. 24. The world is a common bait wherewith the Divel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeth men to fin, as <hi>Judas Anan<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:119668:95"/>
to look upon the world as Chriſt did, as a very emptie thing; he gives power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>For whatſoever is born of God overcometh the world.</hi> All our worldly deſires therefore, and pleaſures, and enjoiments muſt be denied by us; we muſt uſe the things of the world as though wee us'd them not. We muſt be ſo dead to the world, as to ſee all things that are now in our poſſeſſion to be none of ours, ſo that the very worſt things in the world that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us will be good to us: all that before were croſſes and afflictions now will be joy and comfort, 'cauſe wee ſhall ſee it to be the will of the Father; and we ſhall have peace in every condition. We ſhall have as much comfort in a dungeon, as in the poſſeſſion of the greateſt ſtate in the world. We ſhall caſt our care upon God, and truſt him as well with our bodies as with our ſouls. We ſhall not ſo much care for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, we ſhall ſee enough in God to ſatisfie us both for to morrow and for ever: <hi>For the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 1. All the labour of men under the Sun is but for two things, <hi>food</hi> and <hi>raiment;</hi> now when we are aſcended to God by denying our ſelves, we ſhall know
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119668:95"/>
that God is able to feed us, and cloath us as miraculouſly as he did the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſſe. And thus much ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for our firſt ſtep or ſtair of ſelf-denial, the denial of our honors, preferments, riches plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, luſts, &amp; all our carnal ſinful enjoiments:</p>
                  <p>The ſecond now followes, which is the denyall of our will and affections. Firſt then for our will, we muſt deny our ſelves in that, as well as our Saviour did. If we will come after Chriſt, be followers of Chriſt; we muſt tread in this ſtep, and follow him in this track and path, as wel as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And indeed our bleſſed Saviour began betimes in the denyall of his own will. For when he was but twelve yeares old, we find him at this work, doing the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Luke 2. 49. And he ſaid unto them, how is it that ye ſought me? wiſt yee not that I muſt be about my Fathers buſineſſe?</hi> not fulfilling his own will, or doing his own buſineſſe, but both were his Fathers. And as he began this courſe betimes, when he was but twelve yeares old, ſo he continued it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe through the whole courſe of his life. In his preaching, as you heard before, he did not his own worke, nor fulfilled his own will, but his Fathers; and as in his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119668:96"/>
preaching, ſo in his praying like-wiſe, one of his firſt petitions was <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven;</hi> and this petition was made good even through his whole life, and death. Through his life, <hi>John 4. 34. Jeſus ſaith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus you ſee that our Saviour both pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preaching, living, and dying, denied himſelfe, and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ather to deny our ſelves, and our own wils, then Gods Chriſt, who is the <hi>Saints</hi> patterne, did alwaies ſo walke as to pleaſe God. <hi>John 8. 29. And hee that ſent mee, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone: for I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him:</hi> And as he was our pattern, ſo he teacheth us by his <hi>Apoſtle</hi> the ſame leſſon, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 4. 1. Furthermore, then wee beſeech you, brethren: and exhort you by the Lord Jeſus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk, and to pleaſe God, ſo ye Would abound more and more.</hi> As if the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:119668:96"/>
had ſaid, that which you receive of us, is that you ought to walk according to the example of Chriſt; to pleaſe God though you thereby ſhould diſpleaſe your ſelves. And this is a ſoul taught by Gods Spirit, when he prefers the pleaſing of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelfe, the fulfilling of his will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own. This being once learned, is that which would carry you along, through all oppſition in a way of truth. Perhaps the poor creature reſolving with fleſh &amp; blood, may be reedy to conclude ſomtimes, if I ſubmit to this way, to this truth, I muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect reproach, perſecution. Now it would wonderfully pleaſe carnall will and reaſon to conceal ſuch a truth in unrighteouſoeſſe; but when a Soul comes to this, it is my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to fulfil Gods will, and not my own; O then I dare not but do it; come what will come I cannot but do it. Truely you who indeed love the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> that love will conſtrain you to pleaſe him, though you diſpleaſe your ſelves, to fulfill his will by denying your own. This Chriſt himſelfe teacheth and by his own example, hath given us an example ſo to do, <hi>John 4. 34. Jeſus ſaith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:119668:97"/>
Oh bleſſed example, to be imitated by all the Saints; what ſhal <hi>Jeſus Chriſt when he was but twelve yeares old dony himſelfe,</hi> his own will; and ſhall not the Saints do it, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, his followers, at fiftie, and ſixtie, and eighty do as much?</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt hath not onely given us his example and paterne, but hath enjoyned us thereunto alſo, under penalty of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Matt: 7 21. Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle, Ephe.</hi> 6. 6. exhorting ſervants to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their Maſters, ſaies, <hi>Not with eye-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as men pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart:</hi> This ſelfe-will is the cauſe of much ſtir and diviſion in the world. What is the cauſe of this war among us, but ſelfe-will? One will eſtabliſh one religion, another, another religion, or elſe the <hi>Nation</hi> muſt rue it. This ſelfe-will is it that cauſes diſcontents and troubles in <hi>Families.</hi> The husband will have his will, and the wife her will. This cauſes contention in Churches among the <hi>Saints;</hi> when every one will have his own mind, his own way, his own will, will pleaſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119668:97"/>
himſelfe whoever be diſpleaſed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent theſe and the like inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, let us deny our own wils after the example of Chriſt, and ſubmit to the will of God in every thing. Let Gods will, his unknown will, his undeſired will (by any but himſelf) be done by us &amp;, upon us. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his will bee concerning any, let it take place in them &amp; upon them to the utmoſt. Let not me nor any elſe be what we would, but what Gods will pleaſeth to have us; and let us pray with our Saviour, Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven: that ſo Gods whole will and counſel may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd upon us, without ſo much as deſiring him to give us the leaſt account of it, untill he pleaſeth himſelfe. If God pleaſe to ſuffer us to be lead into folly, ſin, death, hell, any thing, let him do what he will, carry us whether he will. Let our own will wholly die in us, that it may never avoid any thing more, nor chuſe any thing more in any kind, but as Gods will ſhall chuſe for us, and avoid for us. For my own particular, let it be ſo that I periſh for ever, I had rather have it ſo, then have mine own will fulfilled. I know my own will ſo well that I deſire to have it croſſed, even in the things that neereſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119668:98"/>
concerne me. I would not be ſaved as I have a mind to be ſaved, I would not go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in my own way, and after my own will. And on the contrary, I have ſuch a taſte though that be but a ſmal one, of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the hidden wil of God, that I would not have it croſs'd, no not in thoſe things that tend to my greateſt prejudice. If it be Gods wil that I muſt be damned, I muſt deny my ſelfe in yeelding to this wil of God, &amp; be content for Gods glory to ſubſcribe my own damnation. Nowthis may deſerve the name of ſelf-reſignation, &amp; the denying of our own wils; which is the ſecond ſtepof <hi>Selfe-denyall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We now come to hold out unto you the third ſtep, or degree of our great Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duty of <hi>Self-deniall;</hi> namely, the deniall of our gifts and our graces, the fruits and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provments of our endowments, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or ſpiritual. And firſt for our natural gifts and endowments: there is naturally in every man, ſelfe-boaſting in the creatures own wiſdom, &amp; apprehended ſelf-excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. There is a diſpoſition of nature, even in the Saints to be exalted above meaſure, not onely in thoſe graces received from Chriſt, but in their own perſonal excellencies. <hi>Saint Paul 2 Cor:</hi> 12. 7. Was ſenſible of both, <hi>And
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:119668:98"/>
leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure through the abundance of the revelation, there was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me, leſt I ſhould be exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure.</hi> And there is in every childe of God a natural diſpoſition to ſpiritual pride: he that knows any thing knows it. This is the filthineſſe of the ſpirit that the Saints are liable unto. Truly we have very little cauſe to glorie in any thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Let not the wiſe man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in his wiſdome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he underſtandeth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord.</hi> It is the exhortation of Chriſt to his diſciples, <hi>Luk. 10. 22. All things are delivered to mee of my Father, and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son, and to whom the Son will reveal him;</hi> and this leſſon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> learned, and every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in ſome good meaſure muſt learn, <hi>Gal. 6. 14. But God forbid that I ſhould glorie, ſave in the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi> Let us therefore in the firſt place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our <hi>Selfe-ſufficiency</hi> and <hi>Selfe-ſtrength.</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:119668:99"/>
There is a natural diſpoſition in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to think that it hath power in it ſelf to act towards God; hut where Chriſt comes in power, hee teacheth men to deny this principle, <hi>Jeh. 15. 5. I am the Vine, yee are the branches: hee that abideth in me, and I in him the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without me yee can do nothing.</hi> And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle that had experience of the workings of God confeſſeth it, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was beſtowed upon me, was not in vain: but I labored more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was in me.</hi> And the reaſon wherefore wee are to deny our ſelf-ſufficiencie and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrength, is, that ſo we may be able to hold out in the evill day, when a man is put to it either by his ſpiritual, or temporal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

And I will make an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> It is in the ſtrength of Chriſt the believer ſtands, <hi>Job.</hi> 15. 5.

Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivhimſelf: If any man among you ſeemeth to be wiſe in this world, let him become afool, that he may be wiſe.</hi> The readieſt way to attain wiſdome, is to lay all our wiſedome downe at the feet of Chriſt: I beſeech you conſider this, hath Chriſt taught your ſoules this leſſon? Is your wiſedome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly born wiſedom, or is it earthly? Is it your own or God's? <hi>This is your own wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Jam. 3. 13. but ſee <hi>ver. 17.

                  <p>Then ſecondly as we are to deny all our natural gifts and parts, ſo likewiſe all our ſpiritual, all our graces, all our fruits and improvements in ſpiritual matters, and this muſt be done in a double reſpect: Firſt in reſpect of the end of thoſe graces; wee muſt deny our ſelvs herein by doing all for God, and not fo our ſelves; for his glorie,

and not our own. Secondly in reſpect of the means, by referring all to God, and not to our ſelves, to his ſtrength and his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not our own. Firſt then wee muſt deny our ſelves in the end of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving theſe gifts and graces. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea, Chap.</hi> 10. 1. calls <hi>Iſrael</hi> an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie Vine, that brought forth fruit: Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie, and yet bringing forth fruit, how can theſe ſtand together? Yes, very well. For <hi>Iſrael</hi> was an emptie Vine, though they brought forth fruit, becauſe the fruit was not ſuch as ought to grow upon them, ſuch as was proper to the root they ſeem'd to grow in; as Wells are ſaid to be emptie when they are not full of water, though they are full of air: ſo here an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie Vine, 'cauſe it brought forth all its fruit, whether good or bad, to its ſelf: which was not proper for the people and ſervants of God to do; that is, thoſe ends that did draw up the ſap and did put it forth into fruit, were drawn but from themſelvs, they bring them not forth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to God, and for him. All their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, all their affections in holy duties, if they examine the reaſon of them all, the ends that run in them all, they will finde
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119668:101"/>
they are taken from themſelves: and though the aſſiſtance wherewith they are enabled to do what they do is more then their own, yet their ends are no higher then themſelves, and ſo employ the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance God gives them, for themſelves.

But may not a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſeek himſelf in any caſe? may hee not ſeek his own good, his own credit?

                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:119668:102"/>Secondly as we are to deny all our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gifts and graces in reſpect of the end of thoſe graces, by doing all for God and and not for our ſelves, for his glorie, and not our own; ſo in the ſecond place wee are to deny thoſe graces in reſpect of the means, by referring all to God, and not to our ſelves; to his ſtrength and his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not our own. For as we muſt do all things for God as the end, ſo alſo wee muſt refer all things to God as the means, acknowledging our ſelves to do all things in his ſtrength, and by his aſſiſtance. For as it is eſſential to thee, if thou bee'ſt a true branch of the Vine, a true Chriſtian, to do all for another, as your end, namely to God; ſo to do all in the ſtrength of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as your ſole aſſiſtant, namely Chriſt, who works all in you, and <hi>through whoſe ſtrength, ſaith Paul, I am able to do all things, and nothing without it,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. Therefore we finde both theſe join'd, <hi>Phil. 1. 11. Being filled with the fruits of righthouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt unto the glorie and praiſe of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the latter is meant as the final cauſe, the other as the efficient. Now temporary believers, as they do all principally for themſelves, ſo alſo all as from themſelves;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119668:102"/>
and as they do not make God their end, ſo nor Chriſt their root, becauſe they fetch not their ſtrength, their ſap to do all they do from Chriſt by Faith, and from their Union with him; And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are never emptied of themſelves, which is the root they grow upon, both in regard of their own ends, and alſo of their own efficiencie of working: whereas wee muſt all be brought to nothing in our ſelvs both in regard of <hi>Self-aims,</hi> and alſo <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities.</hi> But indeed it is as hard a thing for us, both in reſpect of natural, and alſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual endowments, to live out of our ſelvs, and fetch all from another, as not to live to our ſelves but to another. Wee are full of our own ſtrength as well as of our own ends: and although wee do receive all our ſtrength from Chriſt, and ſo all we do in what is good, is from him, yet we do not honour Chriſt in receiving it, by doing all as in his ſtrength, and ſo do not do it as in him; but though wee receive all from Chriſt, yet we work with it as it were our own ſtock, and ſo glorie as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, as if we had not received it. And thus though the ſap and livelineſſe which ſtirrs us to any ſpiritual dutie is really and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119668:103"/>
indeed efficiently from Chriſt, yet wee work with it as if all proceeded from our ſelves, becauſe wee neither receive our ſtrength by faith, nor act by faith that ſtrength received as men acted by Chriſt, and working in Chriſt; being ſupported with the pride and ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſufficiencie of our own gifts and parts: whereas all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are emptied firſt of their own ſtrength and abilitie, and ſo walk as thoſe who can do nothing without Chriſt, as thoſe who are not able to love or believe one moment more without him. And therefore a true believer being thus ſenſible of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie and unabilitie, doth (when hee is at any time aſſiſted in ſpiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) attribute all to Chriſt when he hath done: he glories not in himſelf as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but as he is a man in Chriſt, and that as he is a man in Chriſt he did it, and no otherwiſe. So the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. 5. <hi>I knew a man in Chriſt above fourteen years ago, &amp;c.—Of ſuch an one will I glorie, yet of my ſelf I will not glorie, but in mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</hi> And yet it was himſelf he ſpeaks of, but yet not in himſelf as of himſelf, but as he was a man in Chriſt, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Wee have done with our third ſtep or
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119668:103"/>
degree of <hi>Selfe-denyal,</hi> the denial of our gifts and graces both natural and ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p>And as we have denied theſe natural and ſpiritual endowments, ſo in the fourth place we muſt deny our very religion, our chriſtianity for Chriſt. This ſeemes at the firſt ſight a contradiction, but it is onely a high expreſſion, or if you Pleaſe to call it ſo, a new light of <hi>Self-denyal.</hi> For I do not mean ſo to deny our Chriſtianity, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Jewes, Turkes,</hi> or <hi>Infidels;</hi> but ſo to deny it, as to reſigne it up unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to lay it at <hi>Chriſts</hi> feet; ſo to deny it as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it, as the onely diſpenſation and appearance whereby God is able to reveal himſelfe unto his people: for can'ſt thou meaſure the waies, thoughts and various ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of God, whom thou thy ſelfe calleſt infinite, and unmeaſurable? Art thou ſure he can appeare no otherwiſa then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what thou exſpecteſt he will? Call but to mind the religion of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> what religion that ever was ſince the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, I will not except our own <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion, was more confirmed by miracles then this? what religion for it's time had the preſence of God more in it; ſet up by the peculiar appointment of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119668:104"/>
Almighty; the Doctrine written in Tables of ſtone with his own finger; the diſcipline in every circumſtance, and ceremony, and <hi>Punctilio,</hi> dictated not by his Spirit onely, but by the expreſſe word of his own mouth. Had the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion, for doctrine and diſcipline, been as punctually ſet down and enjoyned, the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> had not erected ſo many ſtakes and gibbets; nor the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Church</hi> raiſed ſo many armies in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as we find by woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they have done. And now what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all the divine right and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; of all the pompe and glory of the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> and religion? Is it not called <hi>off all</hi> and the droſſe and dung even in the very righteouſneſſe of it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>And the doctrine and diſcipline baſe and beggarly elements, by the ſame Apoſtle, Gal:</hi> 4. 9. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I here profeſſe before you all, that ever ſince I knew any thing of religion; nothing hath more amazed and ſtagger'd my reaſon; then that God ſhould firſt eſtabliſh, and afterwards diſanull the ſame relgion; and ſecondly, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſhould ſet ſo low a rate upon, ſhould have ſo mean, baſe, and contemptible an eſteem of any thing, that was at any time ſet up
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119668:104"/>
and avowed by God. Neither know I how to anſwer the <hi>Jew,</hi> ſhould he urge this very argument home to me, then by crying out with the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> upon the ſame account and ground we now mention; <hi>O the depth of the riches of the wiſdome and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgments, and his wayes paſt finding out! Rom.</hi> 11. 33. Thou ſeeſt therefore that the <hi>Jews</hi> were cozen'd (who were as confident as thou can'ſt be, that it ſhould not be ſo with them as it was;) is it then ſo impoſſible that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ever be deceived in what thou further expecteſt, becauſe thou haſt gone a ſtep or two beyond theſe <hi>Jewes?</hi> Is that which thou haſt attained and hoped for, of ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during nature, that it can never paſſe away? The <hi>Jewes</hi> knew <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the law, and it was a very glorious knowledge, compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any knowledg the heathen had; but what became of that knowledge? It vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and became of no account, as you have heard. And ſo likewiſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have known <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and this kind of knowledg doth far excell that which was imparted to the <hi>Jewes;</hi> Goſpel-faith, Goſpel-love, Goſpel-obedience, do infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119668:105"/>
ſurpaſſe any legal qualifications and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances whatſoever: but with all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, may not theſe Goſpel diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons paſſe away? may not theſe duties be ſwallowed up in higher and more ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd duties, and the? glory of theſe fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a greater glory In all theſe then thou muſt deny thy ſelfe, thou muſt reſigne them up, &amp; lay them all at <hi>Chriſts</hi> feet. And how this religion of ours which we now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, muſt be denyed by us, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up of us, I ſhal endeavour to ſhew you in theſe following particulars. Firſt we mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t deny all ordinances &amp; adminiſtrations, ſo as to reſt &amp; relie upon them: and here firſt for the ordinance of miniſterial preaching, we muſt not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt, not put our confidence and faith upon that, becauſe as it is <hi>Iſa. 54. 13. We ſhall be all taught of God.</hi> Now the teaching of men, and the teaching of God, differ as the light of the Moon, and the light of the Sun; that ſhines by the helpe of this, this from it's own light. The teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men is this Moon-light, which in Gods time muſt vaniſh. For this Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, this conveying knowledge to others by helps and meanes, is to be ſwallowed up into the light of the Sun, that God may
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119668:105"/>
become all in all, <hi>Jer. 31. 34 And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their ſin no more.</hi> By the mentioning of Sun and Moon in this place, God ſpeakes to the capacity of men, and points out the whole creation of night and day, and that all creature-helps and meanes ſhould fail, though they were and are as glorious helps as the Sun, that gives light to the day, or as the Moon that gives light to the night; and that the time will come, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe will be the light of men without crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-helps or meanes; and theſe teachings of God ſhall never ceaſe. Then ſecondly, as we are to deny the Ordinance of Preaching, ſo likewiſe of Praying, and Faſting, and all ordinances whatſoever; ſo as I ſaid before to reſt upon them, to lay our faith upon them. And the reaſon is, cauſe that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are nothing without the Lord. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one will confeſſe that the letter is a dead letter without the Spirit; and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are meer formes without God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in them: and therefore our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119668:106"/>
is to couple the Lord and Ordinances together, and we cannot endure to heare of the parting of them; though many now adayes do, who crie, ſo we have Ordinances we are well. Now this is that we muſt deny, or elſe it will appear that we promiſe to our ſelves ſomething from the bare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of an Ordinance, and ſo like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> we are hankering after the <hi>fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots of Egypt,</hi> though they had better meat in the wilderneſſe, yet their fleſh-pots run in their minds. So though God offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and though the <hi>Saints</hi> tell you they cannot find God in ſuch and ſuch formes, but find him abundantly good in the ſpirit, and they find that he recompences the want of all formes in the ſpirit, and preſſes you to wait till God appeares to you in the ſpirit: O! ſay you, I can never believe that God ſhould do it without an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or that God ſhould ſtrengthen you without an Ordinance. God, thinke you, with an Ordinance can ſtrengthen me, and deliver me, and ſave me out of temptation, not otherwiſe. This is to ſay, that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or fleſhly form, doth add ſomething to God. If you confeſſe God to be all in an Ordinance, you muſt confeſſe him to be all
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119668:106"/>
without an Ordinance, to be ſufficient of himſelfe. I deſire not to be miſtaken, I judge not thoſe that find God in Ordinances and outward formes. Let them wait upon God, and let them receive and partake of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Ordinance, and let them bleſſe God for it, and be faithfull to their own principles; and let them be ſweet to others. But when we do find God in a Forme, and in an Ordinance, to ſay he is not to bee found and enjoyed any other way; this is not a right ſpirit, and this is to be reſigned up and denied by us.</p>
                  <p>A maine and principall reaſon of the point is, that God alone may be exalted. For as civil formes are accompanied with many corrupt, yet cleaving intereſts; ſo ſpirituall adminiſtrations, are attended in their <hi>Proſelites</hi> with fleſh, forme, &amp; ſelfe, which doe many times deprave and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Adminiſtration, and render it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall to the end for which it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And as it is the deſigne of God to purge the civil adminiſtration from its dregs and filth, ſo the Lord carries on the ſame deſignes in paring away all humane intereſts from the ſpiritual, that ſo he alone may bee exalted; beſides as civill formes
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119668:107"/>
are not the ſubſtance but the out-ſide onely, and appearanee of that equity and reaſon which they ought to repreſent; So is it with the ſpiritual, as being onely ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to our wants, abſence, weaknes, until ſuch time as we come to live in the very life or ſubſtance its ſelfe. So that ſpiritual admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations being of an inferior and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening notion, cannot poſſibly hold forth the moſt compleat and glorious way of enjoyment, which in the <hi>Scripture</hi> is ſaid to bee by ſight, and not by faith; and ſuch a ſight as is not in forme, or glaſſe, but face to face. The ſight which <hi>Moſes</hi> had of God, as it did tranſcend the ordinary diſcovery to common Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo it was farr inferiour to this viſion; for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw but the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of God. And yet as their ſacrifices did t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e out the true ſacrifices which we enjoy; ſo this viſion, in regard of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediateneſs of it, beares ſome proportion with that glorious diſcovery in the Saints, where God ſhall be ſeen as he is: but this diſcovery is darkned and vail'd in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forme, even in the deſigne of God himſelfe; for the weake underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to behold the brightneſſe of this preſence (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fled from
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:119668:107"/>
the ſight of God) it is the pleaſure of the Father to caſt a vaile over his glory, which vail is the forme, that ſo the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries thereof may bee born by us. Our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ments will be then moſt ſublime, when this vail is rent a ſunder, and way made to the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> or the naked glory by the power and purity of the ſpirit. In the mean time the forme is proportioned to the darkneſſe of the fleſhly underſtanding, and therefore it is that the glory is limited and confined therein; and given out according to the meaſure of our ſtature by degrees; this juſtifies the deſign and wiſedom of God in chooſing theſe waies and methods in the manifeſtation of himſelf. For the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpiritual adminiſtrations is the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and weakneſſe of the creature, all which make up a bundle of neceſſities, which are thus ſumm'd up. Man beeing clouded with a dark and miſtie underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſtands at a great diſtance from the clear light of God, by reaſon wheroſ hee apprehends nothing but what is ſuitable to himſelf, and his enjoiment is anſwerable to his light; that is, weak and glimmering. But God ſtoops down to humane frailtie, and gives out himſelf in weak appearances,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119668:108"/>
                     <hi>Moſaical forms,</hi> which are as <hi>mediums</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us. But when this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſtance is removed by the power of God, man becomes near, and his enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments immediate, which muſt needs be the beſt, becauſe neareſt the fountain. For the appearances of God, like the beams of the Sun, the farther they paſſe, the more weak and imperfect are they, as to us. Hence it is that God in ſpirit beeing the moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate appearance, is therefore ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; God in fleſh the next to that, but of an inferiour cogniſance and operation. And the deeper God deſcends into fleſh, as into the ſacrifices of old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more is his glory cloath'd upon, and by conſequence the more dark and obſcure is his preſence, and our enjoiment. So that ſtill while we are within the compaſſe of appearances, they may afford us a good but not the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent life. For the higheſt life is above all appearances, even in the ſubſtance it ſelf. For which is better, to live in the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a thing, or in the thing it ſelf? in the branch, or in the tree? in the root or in the rinde? To live in the ſubſtance is a life fuller of heavenly contemplation and reſt. For as the daies of God's labour were
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119668:108"/>
common and ordinarie, but the day of his reſt ſanctified and holy; ſo it is with the Saints: The life of a Chriſtian under ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations and forms is the day of his labour, and he meets with many uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſappointments, and troubles in the outward form, as the experience of Saints can witneſſe. But the life above is the day of his reſt, wherein hee ſtudies all things, and ſees them to be very good, yea and ceaſeth from his works as God did from his.</p>
                  <p>But did not God himſelf ordain Form, and where did he abrogate it, you will ſay? I anſwer: As there was a time to plant, ſo there is a time to pluck up what was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For Form was never created as a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rule, but as a temporarie help to ſerve a turn; which when it is once accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the means ceaſe, as having uſher'd in the end. Neither is the abrogation of Form onely in the letter, but in the diſcovery of an higher glory, which darkens the firſt, as the Sun darkens the ſtarrs. So that the diſcovery of Goſpel-forms is the abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Legal, and the Goſpel adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in external rites gives way to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er glory. And yet there are ſome hints in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119668:109"/>
the letter of this glorious ſtate, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. and <hi>Rev. 21. 2 Pet. 3. 13. Nevertheleſs we, according to his promiſe, look for new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs.</hi> Though the glorie of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries contained in it are to be experimented in us. You'l ſay Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſubmitted to the outward Form. 'Tis true, Chriſt in the fleſh was made under the Law, and ſubmitted to Circumciſion as well as Baptiſme; he under-went the ſtate of death or ſorrow, and the ſtate of fleſh or form, <hi>Heb. 5. 7. Who in the daies of his fleſh, when he had offered up praiers and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with ſtrong crying and tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in that he feared:</hi> Wherein he praied, and at the laſt was raiſed up to the ſtate of mirth, or immediate diſcovery, wherein he did rejoice. So that Chriſt in the fleſh is the figure of ſeveral adminiſtrations, and every Chriſtian is an embleme in one ſtage or another of his life. Some live in a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſome in a glorified Jeſus; ſome live in his life, ſome in his death; ſome live in Chriſt after the fleſh, others in Chriſt after the ſpirit. And amongſt theſe the higheſt pitch of a Chriſtian is, <hi>Chriſt riſen,</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:119668:109"/>
or rather <hi>ſitting at God's right hand:</hi> for here is immediateneſſe of favour and enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But in the mean time Ordinances and Adminiſtrations take place after one ſort or other, till this ſtate come. For as the appearances of God are ſtronger or weaker, ſo adminiſtrations are of ſeveral ſorts; the moſt eminent are, Paradifical, Legal, and Evangelical.</p>
                  <p>Paradifical adminiſtrations then took place, when the angelical nature being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed upon with a humane appearance, did contemplate its Maker in things below himſelf the clear ſtream of the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the heavenly ſpirit being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe clothed upon, was a proportionated ſubject to entertain that diſcovery. This adminiſtration did not contein the moſt compleat enjoiment. For here the vail was firſt ſet up, and man of neceſſitie muſt have ceaſed to his being or form, though he had never ſinn'd, that ſo he might bee raiſed up to an higher enjoiment. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration was but for a ſeaſon; for when fleſh and ſelf had defiled the ſtream, the glory crept inward, and was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from our view, and in came a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of helps to uſher in but a review of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:119668:110"/>
the ſame glory, this was the original of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſacrifices and adminiſtrations. But as the fountain was clear'd by degrees, and the imagerendred more perſpicuous, ſo Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel adminiſtrations ſucceeded in the place of the Legal, as differing onely from them in degrees of light.</p>
                  <p>Theſe adminiſtrations are not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by fleſhly Epoches or Periods of time, but are interchangeably managed within the Saints, according to their degrees of light, as being partly bond, and partly free; partly in the fleſh, form, and letter, partly in the ſpirit and power Which ſtate is a ſtate of confuſion and mixture, not of puritie. The death of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did not ſtraitwaies determine the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal adminiſtration: for the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Believers</hi> did continue to obſerve them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſuch time as an higher diſcovery was made known within them, and even then when an higher diſcovery was made known unto them, when they were perfectly under a Goſpel ſtate, yet had they but the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, and were in the dark in many things. Yea Saint <hi>Paul</hi> holds forth a ſtate atteinable by the Saints which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf came ſhort of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. which <hi>John</hi> ſaw
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119668:110"/>
by the ſpirit of propheſie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>And if any ſhall deny this new ſtate, let us reaſon a little from conceſſions and grants, and ſee what the enjoiment of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may amount to. It is granted by all, and cannot be denied, that the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the word holds forth more glory then is yet attain'd, and that many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies are to be fulfilled relating to that glory of the Saints, among which that in the <hi>Revelations</hi> is one, as likewiſe that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is to be preſs'd after, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. which certainly is more then uprightneſſe; for the Apoſtle ſpeaks to upright Saints. Now what this glory, theſe new heavens, this ſtate of perfection, is the diſpute and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of theſe daies, which to me is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus. That there is a glorious ſtate of the Saints to be diſcovered in the laſt daies, conſiſting not in a fleſhly paradiſe, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial enjoiment, but in the true viſion of God in the ſpirit and high light of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory. This ſtate was the hope and joy of the <hi>Prophets, Apoſtles</hi> and other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> who foreſaw the day thereof. And well might it bee ſo, conſidering the many myſteries contein'd therein, which no other ſtate can attein unto. For here the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:119668:111"/>
ſees all things in the light of God. Here is opened unchangeable glory, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential will, perfect freedom, reſtitution of all things, heavenly reſt. There man cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, queſtions are reſolved, union clear'd, and all expectations ſatisfied. And thus have you ſeen the firſt particular, wherein wee muſt deny our Religion, it is in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> and <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly in the ſecond place, we muſt deny our religion in reſpect of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſo as to reſt upon the letter, and to prefer it above the teaching of the ſpirit in it. Heare this all you that idolize <hi>Scripture</hi> ſo much, as to prefer thoſe writings before the God of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets:</hi> it is very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a man may attain to the litteral knowledge of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and may ſpeak largely of the hiſtory thereof, and draw concluſions, and raiſe many uſes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſupport of a troubled ſoul, or for the reſtraining of lewd practiſes, and direction of a civil converſation; and yet they that ſpeake, and they that heare, may be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unacquainted with, but enemies to that ſpirit of truth; by which thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> write. For it is not the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:119668:111"/>
writings, but the ſpirit that dwelleth in them, that did inſpire their hearts, that gives life and peace to us all. And therefore when the <hi>Prophets Iſa. Jerem.</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſpake what they ſaw from God, they ſpake <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> out of experience of what they ſaw and felt; and they were call'd true <hi>Prophets.</hi> But when others roſe up that ſpake their words &amp; writings, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them to another age and generation of men, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did; they were called falſe <hi>Prophets;</hi> becauſe they had ſeen nothing themſelves of God, but walked by the legs and ſaw by the eyes of the true <hi>Prophets.</hi> For God doth not threaten death to every city of every age of the world, as to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomrorha;</hi> nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119668:112"/>
him that gives life, or deſtroyes, and ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen nothing from him, they are to be reckoned among the falſe <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>phets,</hi> they run before they are ſent. A man may know the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and yet be an arch enemie to the God of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were. They knew the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who writ of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and yet they perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and killed <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they knew him not. For if they had known him to have been of the power of God, they would not have kill'd him. And ſo many now<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>adayes do know Scripture, &amp; yet may, &amp; do perſecute the ſpirit of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> through ignorance and unbeliefe. Truely friends, it is not the knowledge of the <hi>Scripture</hi> onely, but the knowledge of the God of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as God is pleaſed to make known himſelfe by his mighty working in you, that gives life and peace to you. If you know and ſpeake <hi>Scripture,</hi> and can ſee nothing of God; you are like Parrats, that ſpeake the words of another, as you have been taught by humane education. But if the ſame annointing or power of God dwel in you, as did appeare in the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that writ; then you can ſee into that miſtery of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and ſo can
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119668:112"/>
ſpeake the mind of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> though you ſhould never ſee, heare, nor read the <hi>Scripture</hi> from men. If your peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in God ſhould onely remain with you, while you are either hearing, or reading <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or while you have any ſociety of ſuch as can ſpeake and diſcourſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and then find again that your peace and comfort is gone, when you are depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any occaſion of that ſociety of <hi>Saints,</hi> truely let me tell you, that though you prize and know the <hi>Scripture,</hi> yet there is a great ſtrangeneſs betweene, you and the God of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> Many enjoy outward reading, and hearing, and Saints Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and they are in peace, and they live in heaven as they conceive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is a ſweet life, but it is not the life. For if the wiſedom of God hedge up all theſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with thornes, and leave theſe poor ſouls alone, (as it was <hi>Chriſts</hi> caſe, all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke him and fled,) why then here is your triall. For when God hath denyed you the opportunities of hearing, reading, praying, and Saints fellowſhip; doth not your heart now looke for thoſe helps, and mourn in their abſence. If it be ſo with you, (as I know it is with you) then where is your
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119668:113"/>
knowledge, experience, and peace, in and with God? It ſhewes plainly that at ſuch a time we ſuck'd refreſhment: from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures breſts, but not from God.</p>
                  <p>We are now come to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſt particular, in reſpect of which we muſt deny our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that is in reſpect of the Author of it, our bleſſed Saviour. And herein we muſt firſt deny all falſe Chriſts; ſecondly all falſe opinions of the true Chriſt; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt deny but in a Chriſtian qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſence, even the true Chriſt himſelfe. Firſt then we muſt deny all falſe Chriſts, you will find falſe Chriſts coming with ſignes and wonders <hi>Matt: 24. 24. For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders, inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very elect.</hi> You ſhall have Chriſts to do what you deſire; Chriſts to ſhew you ſignes and wonders, as you gape after, but they ſhall be falſe Chriſts; and this ſhall be your judgement. God in judgement hath falſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> for falſe <hi>Seekers,</hi> falſe <hi>Inquirers.</hi> This is the plague of the fleſh, it ſhall have what it doth deſire, one that will open <hi>Scriptures,</hi> do mighty miracles, ſhew great gifts, and yet all this is but a falſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the very

Therefore let it be our ſpeciall care to deny theſe falſe Chriſts, moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe antichriſtian times wherein we live; in which you ſhall have Chriſts come upon you more then you would have. If you go into the deſert there is Chriſt; if into the city there's Chriſt; ſome ſhall ſay lo here, others lo there, you ſhall have falſe Chriſts every where, a falſe ſpirit, a falſe reſurrection, a falſe glory, a falſe god, continually offering themſelves unto you; <hi>lo here, lo there.</hi> Such excellent glorious high raviſhing, wonderfull diſcoveries of ſpirituall things, that they ſhall ſay plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you I am Chriſt.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119668:114"/>
of God in the world;—<hi>Becauſe thine heart is liſted up, and thou haiſt ſaid, I am a God, I ſit in the ſeat of God, in the midd'ſt of the ſeas: yet thou art a man and not God, though thou ſet thine heart as the heart of God.</hi> You ſhall be ſo enlarged in underſtanding, that you ſhall thinke your ſelves wiſer then <hi>Daniel,</hi> that you ſhall ſee through all the myſterie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> through all the darke propheſies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as a clear thing; yet there will be a falſe Chriſt, an antichriſt under all this: <hi>go not after,</hi> ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Luke. 17. 23. And they ſhall ſay to you, ſee here, or ſee there: go not after them, nor follow them.</hi> Such appearances will preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto you, and invite you to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and clear underſtanding of the darke places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> but ſaith God, follow them not; <hi>They are ſuch as if it were poſſible, they ſhould deceive the very elect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the ſecond place, as we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all falſe Chriſts, ſo we muſt likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all falſe opinions of the true Chriſt. To this purpoſe is that, <hi>Matt: 24. 23. Then if any man ſhall ſay unto you, Lo here is Chriſt, or there: beleeve it not.</hi> The ſum is this, Chriſt will be ſpoken by no man, no man will be able to ſpeake Chriſt, to ſay here is Chriſt; Chriſt will be underſtood and known by
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119668:114"/>
no man; while we are men we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and know Chriſt, till we are raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Chriſt, we underſtand not Chriſt. None but Chriſt can ſpeake Chriſt, non but Chriſt, can declare Chriſt. It is not the Kingdome of God if man be able to declare it, and utter it. Let no man ſay lo here, or lo there. This is the wretchedneſſe of man to be ſomething in himſelfe, to take part him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to give part to Chriſt; or to ſay here I am when he is not, or this is Chriſt when it is not Chriſt. It is the ſpeech of ſome, I am in Chriſt, and Chriſt in me. He is in ſpiritual things, he is in preaching, and in praying, but he is not in outward things. Lo here he is, when I am wrapt up in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyments, but when I am in my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in my calling, I cannot ſay he is here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This voice is the ſame with that in <hi>Luke: 17. 21. Neither ſhall they ſay, Lo here, or lo there: for behold the kingdome of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you.</hi> Lo here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt, and here he is not, and there he is not. To ſhut Chriſt out of any place, out of any thing, theſe are falſe opinions of Chriſt. This is the wickedneſſe of man to exclude or include Chriſt, to make him be one where and not another where. For Chriſt is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:119668:115"/>
weakneſſe as well as ſtrength, darkneſſe as well as light, Chriſt in me, Chriſt in all. The Lord in triumph, the Lord crucified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord exalting, the Lord humbling, the Lord in life, the Lord in death, the Lord here bleſſing, the Lord there curſing, this is Chriſt. If you cannot ſee him in one thing as well as in another, in wicked men as well as in good men, you cannot ſee him at all. Here's the narrowneſſe of the heart of every man (a ſenſible creature, full of obſervation and his own reaſon) ſaying, Lo here is Chriſt, lo there is Chriſt; here he is not, there he is not, narrowing of him in their own obſervation: hee is in me when I am ſo qualified, and he is not in me when I am not ſo qualified; not knowing that hee is in ſome trampled on under the feet of his enemies, and yet there in glorie. In ſome he is at the top, in ſome he is at the bottom, in ſome withering, in ſome bringing forth fruit; in ſome ſweetening and moderateing their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in ſom letting forth wrath and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, as we muſt denie all falſe Chriſts, and all falſe opinions of the true Chriſt, ſo thirdly muſt we deny, but
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:119668:115"/>
in a Chriſtian qualified ſence, even the true Chriſt himſelf. As thus for inſtance: The Saints and children of God ſhall not enjoy Chriſt, till they have denied Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him. You muſt forſake him, and leave him, and be <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and perſecute him before you can be crown'd with him; that which is in a high degree malignity in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> is in a leſs degree in the <hi>Diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> killing, and the <hi>Diſciples</hi> departing, it's all fleſh, man-weakneſſe and ignorance. Before any man ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God he muſt firſt reject it. Yee ſhall be offended at Chriſt, you ſhall ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall, and reject him before you find him. You ſhall never be acquainted with Chriſt till you have denied him, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him. I know you are ready to ſay, What muſt we be guilty of this wickedneſs? is there ſuch wretchedneſſe in the heart of man to do thus? Thus ſpeaks the fleſh; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s ſaith the Lord, <hi>the Son of man muſt ſuffer many things from this generation.</hi> Chriſt muſt ſuffer by ſome, and be rejected by others: Some are ſo wicked as to kill him, others ſo unbelieving as to forſake him; ſome revile him, others ſhake their heads, and cannot tell what to think of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119668:116"/>
him: ſome crie out violently againſt him, others are not able to ſpeak a word ſon him; you ſhall never ſee the Lord, till you can ſay, This is he whom I have denied, this is he whom I have pierced, this is hee whom I have reviled and hated. Thus ſpeaks Chriſt, if you ſtand upon terms and ſay, What wee crucifie Chriſt? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid: what we that are his own people, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Diſciples;</hi> we that are his own dear children, and ſhall be ſaved by him? To whom Chriſt will ſay, if I ſuffer not by you, I will not be a deliverer to you; I will ſave none but thoſe that kill me. If you will not own that you have ſlain me, you ſhall not enjoy me: you ſhall never eat my fleſh and drink my blood, unleſſe you ſlay my fleſh and ſpill my blood. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſuffers by all men, which is clear in this, that in all yee have, in all that yee do, in all that yee are, in all that yee ſpeak, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is free from the blood of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that you do, ſpeak, or act, in the higheſt, devouteſt and moſt glorious way, is any thing elſe but murther and blood, killing the Lord of life. Yea it is neceſſary he muſt ſuffer by you, he will not finde a throne in you till he hath found a grave in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119668:116"/>
you, hee will not be rais'd in you till hee hath been dead and buried in you. You ſhall never ſee him in the Reſurrection, till you ſee him kill'd, and then hee will riſe again in your hearts, with healing in his wings, to your everlaſting joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly we muſt deny Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the miniſtration of the fleſh, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hiſtorie, and the reaſon is, becauſe that the whole hiſtorie of Chriſt will profit you nothing, nor all that you know, except you finde experimentally the ſame things done in you by the Spirit. I beſeech you therefore be not offended when as we ſay, that Chriſt according to the hiſtory of him onely, and according to his miniſtration in the fleſh, is but a form in which God doth appear to us, and in which God doth give us a map of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thou knoweſt it not to be thy real ſalvation, except it be revealed within thee by the Spirit. Jeſus Chriſt is called the image of the inviſible God. God comes forth to be ſeen in the fleſh of Chriſt as in an image, it is not the naked appearance of God, but it is an image or repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God. Now wee know the image
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:119668:117"/>
ſerves in the abſence of the lively face of the living perſon, and ſo do all theſe ſame tranſactions of Jeſus Chriſt, they ſerve till the kingdom of God become to us in the ſpirit. And therefore as Chriſt ſaid, wee may be bold to ſay after him, <hi>The fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing.</hi> If you onely know Chriſt as dying and riſing without you, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit you nothing, unleſſe you know him as dying and riſing within you. Any man is capable of remembring the ſtorie of Chriſt, and rehearſing it if hee have but common reaſon, and can ſay as well as another that Chriſt died for him, and can throw himſelf upon Chriſt, and can hang upon Chriſt, this is not faith, this is not ſalvation; for ſaith <hi>James, Faith without works is dead:</hi> and <hi>Rom. 8. 2. For the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath `made me free from the law of ſin and death:</hi> he doth not ſay that ſuch a propoſition or text of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel did ſet him free; he doth not ſay, that the hearing that Chriſt died for the ſins of men doth ſet him free. No: there was the Spirit of life in Chriſt, as well as the law or letter, it is that entails life upon Chriſt and his ſeed. There is an outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and there is an inward Spirit: The
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119668:117"/>
outward Covenant is this, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed:</hi> and may not any man pretend to be in this Covenant, of this ſeed? do not thouſands profeſſe themſelvs to be ſo? Do not thouſands in the world ſay, Lord, Lord, Lord, and preſſe to enter into heaven? We cannot put a difference betwixt one or other except we know this truth: for they ſay they are within the Covenant, and of Chriſts ſeed: and what hold they forth for this, they hold forth the confeſſion of Chriſt, and ſay that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their ſin, and roſe for their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and this they believe, and upon this they lay their ſouls for ſalvation. May not the verieſt hypocrite do ſo as well as the trueſt Saint? but here's that which puts the difference, when the ſpirit of Chriſt brings this Covenant to the heart of a poor creature, when the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Spirit of ſon-ſhip, revealing God as our Father, revealing God in Union with us, our righteouſneſſe, &amp; our ſtrength, hee doth indeed ſeal us to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; he ſets apart Chriſts ſheep, and this diſtinguiſheth them from the other. So that if you lay ſalvation upon an hiſtorical Chriſt, you'l be deceived. If you would
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:119668:118"/>
have that in which you may confide, you muſt have Chriſt revealed in you in the Spirit; you muſt have the ſame Spirit of Faith that was in Chriſt, and the ſame ſpirit of power that wrought in him: you muſt have the ſame eternal ſpirit, by which you muſt offer up your bodies, offer up your fleſh to God as a ſacrifice; yea your ſelves, and your own righteouſneſſe; this is true ſalvation, this is ſalvation manifeſted unto life.</p>
                  <p>To make this yet more clear I ſhal ſhew you the difference between Chriſt in the fleſh, and Chriſt in the Saints; between that work of God within us, and that work of God in Chriſt; the latter is the truth of the former: <hi>Sanctifiethem through thy truth, Joh.</hi> 17. 17. that is, do thou act thoſe things really in them, which are done in a figure for them upon mee: there is the truth. I deſire to clear this to you by ſome familiar experience. You know that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to die for our ſins, and riſe for our juſtification.</hi> Here is now Chriſt in the fleſh, here is his miniſtration. Why now hereupon ſalvation is preach'd to men, and they are told that God is reconciled, for he hath ſent his Son; there is nothing to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:119668:118"/>
be done, God is reconciled, his juſtice ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titfied, onely believ. Here is the outward dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. But now a poor ſoul, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, lies under the guilt and weight of ſin, whereby he cannot believe, or take comfort in theſe glad tidings. Do you not ſee that there is need of another miniſtration? Is there not need of the Law of the Spirit of life in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as well as the propoſition of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> You come and ſhew a poor ſoul the propoſition of the Goſpel, that whoſoever believeth in Chriſt ſhall have eternal life. Yet all this while the poor ſoul lies dead; till not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the letter, but the ſpirit of the Goſpel comes and appears to him; till Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not onely in his firſt Court, that is his own fleſh, or the letter of the Goſpel, but the inmoſt place of all, that is, in this man's conſcience. For wee may allude to <hi>Heb. 9. 24. That Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Theſe words are ſpoke figuratively. It is true he went viſibly into heaven, that is a place remote from their ſight, a cloud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him out of their ſight. The true hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:119668:119"/>
and that heaven where Chriſt doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the comfort and releife of a poor ſoul; is the conſcience of a poor ſinner, and that is called heaven, becauſe as heaven is the place of God; ſo is the heart of man. He is ſayd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o be the ſearcher of the heart, God ſits there and wounds, and heales there, that is God's true place. It is not in the underſtanding of a man in the Notions there; but it is in the heart of man, there it is gone. Chriſt in the ſpirit is in the heart of his people, that is Chriſts place, and there it is that Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpeakes a word for a poor ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there it is, that Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſits as King in our conſcience. Chriſt may offer himſelf long enough in the letter, in the hiſtory of the Goſpel; but if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not in the ſpirit, and ſit in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to quiet them; we ſhall never have any true underſtanding of the word. Now for this reaſon I ſhall deſire you to looke within your ſelves, and I make no queſtion but if you do wait upon God without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate ſpirits; he will clear this truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
                  <p>And now while I come to ſome appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this truth, I ſhall deſire you in the feare of God not to miſtake me. Let us
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:119668:119"/>
take heed of idolizing even the humanity of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt himſelfe, of idolizing his doings and his ſufferings. We ſee God through theſe doings and ſufferings of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as through a glaſſe: but it is not blaſphemie to ſay, that a believer may come to ſee a love born unto him above and before the manifeſtation of it in the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt; he may ſee it in God himſelf, though by Chriſt. Do not think you know ſo much as you need to know in knowing the fleſh of Chriſt, in knowing the man Chriſt Jeſus; for unleſſe you know God in his appearance, under that form you miſtake Chriſt, and make him an Idol. I am nothing ſaith Chriſt; and hee that ſends is greater then he that is ſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If God be greater then Chriſt, then Chriſt himſelfe is but a <hi>medium</hi> through which you come to be acquainted with God, and in which you muſt not reſt. Take heed of being offended when you ſhall hear ſuch like doctrine as this, that the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt for us were as it were but a parable in which God ſpake to us; and that God's heart was not ſet upon the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a little blood for the ſins of the people, but that herein he premeditately
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:119668:120"/>
(if wee look upon it in the original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance) would commend his love to us, and herein (if we relate to the lapſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of man) he conſiders us poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as we are, and ſpeakes to our childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and weakneſſe, who being made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a Law, and having incurr'd the curſe, could not ſee how there could be a reconciliation without blood-ſhedding. Be not offended when you hear that there is a greater work done by the Spirit in the Saints, then was the offering up the fleſh of Chriſt. That there is a greater ſacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up to God, when as the old <hi>Adam,</hi> man's own righteouſneſſe and ſtrength is crucified and offered up to God; I ſay a greater ſacrifice then the ſacrificing of the fleſh of Chriſt himſelf, if you take the fleſh of Chriſt without the myſterie. For that ſacrifice was indeed the root as well as the figure of this ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>And in the ſecond place, if ſo be you need to bee warn'd of idolizing the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Chriſt, much more of idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing other forms. There are two ſort of forms wherein God appears to the world. There is the humanitie of Chriſt, which is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:119668:120"/>
the higheſt and moſt immediate form and appearance of God; and there are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in which God appears as it were at the ſecond hand, and by reflection; as when the Sun appears by the Rainbow, or when it makes another Sun like its ſelf in a watery cloud, which is but the Sun by reflection: ſo Ordinances are but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow as it were of the image; and thus Chriſt is the image of the <hi>Father,</hi> but Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are but ſhadows of that image; therefore take heed of idolizing Formes. Your intereſt lies in knowing the <hi>Father,</hi> not in knowing any Form whatever. And take heed of cenſuring and judging ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſcoveries; take heed of beeing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, if we ſay there is an higher thing then Ordinances, then Faſting and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea then Believing too; and that is, ſeeing the Father, and knowing the Father without a Form, manifeſting and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in his own immediate light.</p>
                  <p>Now by the by, let me give you this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary caution; let no man think that there is no uſe of Chriſt, and no uſe of prayer, and preaching, and other Ordinances. No, this cannot be infer'd from the Doctrine, this
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119668:121"/>
onely may be infer'd that this is not that glorious reſt, where a Chriſtian is to ſit down. Formes are but helps, and God doth by Formes, bring us to know himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Forme: and no man knowes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he that knowes him by Chriſt whom he did ſend, therefore you cannot caſt away thoſe Formes; the <hi>Scriptures</hi> will laſt ſo long as there is ought of them to be fulfill'd. But that which we are contending towards in all theſe meanes is the knowing of the <hi>Father;</hi> and then we ſhall ſee that ſimplicity and unity that is in the truth, then we ſhall ſee all thoſe knots looſed, and darke waies opened; then we ſhall ſee that all thoſe things of Chriſt coming, and dying and ſuffering for us, were but as it were parables. Now this is the ſum of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that God loves believers, and is their righteouſneſſe, and their ſtrength, and love, and faith; and all not thus reſolved into the Father, is but a parable that doth cloud the <hi>Father.</hi> They were not ordained to cloud the <hi>Father,</hi> but they do through our weakneſſe cloud the <hi>Father</hi> from us. They were ordain'd that they might inſinuate and convey according to our capacities
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119668:121"/>
the knowledg of the <hi>Father</hi> into us. But as I ſaid before, in all Formes there is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Formes ſhall be done away, as time haſtens to be no more, and then God ſhall be all in all.</p>
                  <p>I have already brought you up four of thoſe five ſtaires or degrees of Chriſtian <hi>Selfe-denyall:</hi> there remaines onely the laſt, the <hi>Deniall</hi> of our ſalvation and heaven it's ſelfe for Chriſt, of which but in a word. Oh what a ſtirre there is with Chriſtians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne up a few luſts to God! which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they know, and ſenſibly feel, that it is their greateſt happineſſe to part with, and yet how far are they from attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even this alſo; but who in this Nation dares reſigne up his righteouſneſſe in Chriſt, and go and lie in the grave with the wicked? It is no very eaſie taske with <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to give up themſelves to God at preſent for him to do what he will with them; ſo he will bring them to heaven at the laſt. Thou can'ſt truſt God, O <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> in this preſent appearance of God to thee, as a Saviour of thee: thou can'ſt love this ſweetneſſe, kindneſſe, grace and goodneſſe of his to thee; thou can'ſt give up thy ſelfe to him to do
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:119668:122"/>
what he will with thee, ſo hee he will bring thee to this ſalvation; this thou haſt attain'd to in ſome good meaſure, with much difficulty and ſtriving: but who dares ſay unto God, take me and throw me into hell, and let me lit there till I fall in love with it for thy ſake, till I come to know and feel thee there, till I can embrace thee and hugg thee there, and fall in love with thee there, and be able to enjoy thee in the mid'ſt of thoſe everlaſting torments? Ah miſerable is that man that is afraid of hell, and is fain to court God to free him from hell, and to croſſe and deny himſelfe for feare of being in danger of hell. That life deſerveth not the name of life, that can looſe any of it's ſtrength, vigour, pleaſure, ſweetneſſe, enjoyments, in the mid'ſt of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings. For if ſin could defile God, where were his holineſſe? and if death or hell could entrench upon his life or joyes, (which life of his, is alſo made our life by his Son) any where to dampe or interrupt that life, or thoſe joyes, that life would moſt certainly prove but a weake a periſhing life, and thoſe joyes fraile momentary joyes, obnoxious to the intermixtures of death
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119668:122"/>
and ſorrow. And juſt the very ſame may be ſaid of our life, and our joyes; of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our heaven it's ſelfe. If thou beeſt wiſe then, deny thy ſelfe in all theſe things; in thy will and affections; in thy gifts and thy graces; in thy religion; and even in thy very ſalvation and heaven its ſelfe: reſigne them up all unto Chriſt, lay them all at Chriſts feet. Leaſt whileſt thou lookeſt for moſt happineſſe from God, for greateſt neerneſſe to and intimacy with God; thou ſhould'ſt be caſt behind his backe for too much prizing and over-valuing theſe things. 'Tis true, perchance that thou haſt ſweetly enjoyed God, not onely at a diſtance in longing deſires, but neerer at hand in cloſe embraces: gifts, graces, ordinances, dueties, ſpiritual-exerciſes of all kinds, you have been well acquainted with; and haſt known how to ſucke life from them; but now you muſt deny all theſe, you muſt follow Chriſt, and learn to ſucke life even from life it's ſelfe: being dead in your ſelves to all theſe, you muſt have no party, no intereſt, no principle, no will, no deſire, no gift, no grace, no ſalvation, no heaven of your own; but you muſt lie like the clay before the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119668:123"/>
Potter, freely delivering up your ſelves into his hands, to be new moulded any way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any forme he himſelfe hath a mind to. All the creatures muſt paſſe away and be denyed, and whatſoever appeares in you, and to you, muſt be God: the creature muſt be ſwallowed up; there muſt be nothing left but the Lord in being, the Lord in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and operation: even ſo Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> for thy mercy ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
