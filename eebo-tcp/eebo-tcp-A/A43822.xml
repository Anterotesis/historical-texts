         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving certain knowledge of the many <hi>Scandals</hi> and <hi>Abuſes</hi> caſt upon thoſe who are the Faithful <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the ways of truth, I ſhould be moſt heartily <hi>Sorry</hi> to give any juſt occaſion of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the ſame; yet do believe it my <hi>Duty</hi> to do my part for the Defence and Vindication of the <hi>Innocent.</hi> And conceivng my ſelf (as will appear by the following <hi>Diſcourſe</hi>) to have received no ſmall injuſtice, from a pretended Apoſtle of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour, (by Name, <hi>Matthew Caffin,</hi>) though his Acts of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> have in part already made manifeſt to the world, that he is far <hi>otherwiſe</hi>; and for that his (and his deluded confederates) Tyrannical dealing with me by way of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> was for my doing a thing which is ſo far from being <hi>any tranſgreſſion of any known Law,</hi> That both the Law of God, and the Law and Royal <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of this Nation, and (as I am informed) all Neighbour King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, do allow of and juſtifie the ſame. I therefore think it my duty to publiſh to the world his Uſurped <hi>Authority,</hi> his new <hi>Laws,</hi> ſtrange <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi> and acts of <hi>Injuſtice</hi>; all which are to my certain knowledge ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſowned by all the Officers of the <hi>Baptized</hi> Congregations, both in Country and City, that I have as yet had the opportunity to treat with, thoſe only that are under this pretended Apoſtles; awful wings, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>All which I am not only induced, but <hi>conſtrained</hi> to publiſh for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe Reaſons following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:32603:3"/>Firſt, becauſe it doth appear to me and others, that the Authority by which he and his Conſederates have executed ſuch his new laws and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, is an <hi>Uſurped Authority</hi>; and therefore the timely Publication of the matter is to prevent the like errors from creeping into the Church of Chriſt, as heretofore have done, being brought in by ſuch Lordly Spirits, whereby the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> once the Spouſe of Chriſt, is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatized, and become an Harlot, (as he the ſaid <hi>Matthew Caffin</hi> hath ſaid) on which account I conceive it my duty by this means to do my part in order to the ſuppreſſing this growing and dangerous Diſtemper, which otherwiſe, like a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> may deſtroy the whole body.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the Truth and honeſt <hi>Profeſſors</hi> thereof may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from thoſe reproachful abuſes and Cenſures, which by this means are apt to be caſt upon them, That ſo the burthen may be laid on the right ſhoulder, and a whole <hi>Profeſſion</hi> not be condemned for the proud <hi>Extravagancies</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or ſome few more particular men; for ſo it is that ſome (otherwiſe judicious and ſober) perſons hearing of ſuch ſtrange <hi>Carriage,</hi> daily ſay, that theſe Profeſſors are a crooked and perverſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, running into a thouſand errors, that their pretence of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is but deceit to cover a deſign of miſchief. And ſome perſons of good quality and repute (no enemies to the Truth or its Profeſſors) have by this means been provoked to entertain hard thoughts, and open their mouths againſt them, to ſay both in words and writing, that we are of <hi>dangerous</hi> opinions, accompanied with rancour and malice againſt all that will not go along with us, be it right or wrong. For (ſay they) we can expect no better fruit from them, then what you have had from your <hi>Saint,</hi> (meaning the Lordly Apoſtle aforeſaid) all which and much more of that nature doth abound to the great diſhonour of the Goſpel, and the Profeſſors thereof, wholly upon the account of this <hi>Buſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third reaſon for Publication hereof is, becauſe all other Admonition and Advice which was publickly given him in full Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſeveral Church Officers of known integrity, (to wit) Mr. <hi>G.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and divers others the moſt, or however the moſt Eminent in <hi>London,</hi> was and ſtill is wholly ſlighted, and could no way incline his mind to Humility, but he ſtill goes on to juſtifie his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Tyranny, notwithſtanding this meeting was ſingly for the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and determining of his caſe only.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe I would thereby have the World to know, that I know not one Profeſſor in the way of the <hi>Baptized</hi> Congregations to be of the like quarrelſome and dangerous principle, unleſs it be thoſe who are at his own diſpoſe, or in ſerviſe ſubjection to his own Laws as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:32603:3"/>And now Impartial Reader! this one thing I humbly beg of thee, and I pray deny me not, <hi>viz.</hi> That thou wouldſt not by means of any thing contained in the enſuing diſcourſe <hi>accuſe</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> the Innocent with the Guilty, nor the peaceable, Loyal and Obedient, with the Peace-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Contentious, and Diſobedient. For although it may appear in thy Judgment that we are <hi>both</hi> unworthy, yea, although I my ſelf through the Inſtigation of the Devil ſhould become an <hi>Adverſary</hi> to all good (for I dare not hoaſt of my future <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> though I can through mercy ſay, I have more than a little <hi>Confidence</hi>) notwithſtanding, I ſay, thy worſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable ſhould happen, yet be intreated I pray, ever to love and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the Royal Road and Kings high-way to Life and Glory, which Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (I hope I may ſay) I never in all my Life did yet deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>And (if I know my heart) I had rather a thouſand times ſuffer the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And this I pray further take notice of, that I do declare, that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the enſuing matter to the world in this manner, was wholly contrary to my own will and deſire, neither had I ſo much as the laiſe thoughts of ſo doing, had not they, to wit, Mr. Caffin or his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, firſt publiſhed my <hi>Excommunication</hi> to the World, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch as they had reaſon to believe did hate me moſt, and this they did within leſs than three days. The conſideration of all which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Effects</hi> that did every day attend it, to the great diſhonour of the truth, did after ſome time upon juſt grounds engage me to <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> the matter and manner of their proceeding againſt me, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly I did make preparation for it, and that long before the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof; But if it demanded why I did not publiſh it ſooner, I faithfully and ſincerely can anſwer, my reaſon was this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe I greatly feared that by this means, not only the Offenders would be ill thought of, as juſtly they may, but that the way of truth it ſelf, and honeſt Profeſſors might happen to be <hi>Cenſured</hi> by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate people, and evil <hi>reported</hi> of, to the diſhonour of God, and prejudice or diſcouragement of the innocent.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I did rather reſolve to uſe all fair and ſafe means to prevent theſe ill effects, and bring the matter to be heard, determined and compoſed without ſuch Publication. To which purpoſe, I read part of what I had written to a perſon pretending much kindneſs to me, who I well knew did intend alſo to ſerve my cauſeleſs Adverſary to his power,

               <hi>The occaſion or thing</hi> for which I was <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>I having by my Induſtry found out and invented a way to cleanſe a certain ſort of Graſs Seeds, by ſome called <hi>Trefo le,</hi> by other, <hi>Nouſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

it beareth a three leaf'd graſs and yellow flower) from its husk and courſe Graſs Seeds, which courſe Graſs, was very deſtructive to the other, ſo that the ſame by means of ſuch invention is become better then it was before, as some of my Adverſries themſelves confeſs.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as it did evidently appear, that ſuch a way of cleanſing the aforeſaid Seeds, was a thing that would be for a <hi>General benefit</hi> to all ſhould make uſe of the ſaid Seeds, I then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that it was reaſonable I ſhould have the benefit of cleanſing the ſame according to the <hi>Statute</hi> in ſuch caſes made and provided; which priviledge of invention I did underſtand (by Councel Learned in the Law) The King, by his <hi>Royal Prerogative,</hi> might lawfully grant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm by his Letters Patents, under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to the firſt and true Inventer.</p>
            <p>And I being the ſame (as one of my chiefeſt Adverſaries declared at their Meeting publickly, that he verily did believe I was) did and ſtill do conceive that I might lawfully endeavour to obtain it as my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt priviledge. Foraſmuch as by this means, I ſhould prevent no perſon enjoying any of their former Rights and Priviledges which they enjoyed before this my doſcovery for as they bought, ſold, ſowed, and improved it before, ſo they may ſtill, without the leaſt interruption; nor have they cauſe to complain, that by the Kings Letters Patents they are prohibited from cleanſing the ſaid Seeds, ſeeing every perſon may have the priviledge of ſowing the Seeds which I thus cleanſs, ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eap the profits of my labour, and the greateſt profits too, for if the cleanſing of it were free to all, the advantage would be very little, wherefore I did on good grounds hope that no honeſt man would be offended with the Kings Letters Patents, nor with me for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them, except it were a generation of ſelf ended men, who, envy my proſperity; nor could I believe, that I for this thing ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by thoſe who are my pretended tender loving Brethren, ſince I have not hereby tranſgreſſed any known Law, for where there is no Law tranſgreſſed, I do belive there is no Law to puniſh, unleſs it be under that Government where Uſurping Tyrants beare rule.</p>
            <p>All which conſidered, I did proceed in my endeavours to obtain his Majeſties Gracious favour for the grant of his Letters Patent for my aforeſaid Priviledge, But being willing to let ſome of my friends know of my deſign therein, before I had finiſhed my buſineſs, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Matthew Caffin</hi> moſt Faithful, I therefore thought him moſt worthy to be truſted with ſecret things. Some other alſo I declared my mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to, who did promiſe ſecrefie, nor did they report it to any that I know of; but he the ſaid <hi>Matthew Caffin,</hi> whome I thought moſt faithful, was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32603:7"/>
pleaſed to be <hi>offended</hi> with the thing, and would not by any means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of Letters Patents, and becauſe I would not without juſt cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert my priviledge, and loſe all the charge I had been at (which by this time was not leſs than Thirty pound) only to pleaſe himſelf (for as yet you may note that he knew not that any others were offended, or did know of it) therefore he ſoon after (the better to bring about his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of revenge for this my diſobedience) declares it to others, and our of doors they thruſt it with as bad a name as might be gives to it.</p>
            <p>Thus by his, and his Conſederates means, they provoked others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt me, by reporting that other perſons had made the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very before me, and not only ſo but that I did intend alſo to prohobit all perſons from cleanſing <hi>Clover,</hi> and thereby provoked ſeveral wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons to oppoſe me through theſe their falſe information; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not ſacrifie my juſt right and priviledges to ſatisfie his own ambition.</p>
            <p>By ſuch means his deſign was carryed on; for from his ill reporting of the thing, they now report what he would have them, little thinking that whilſt he pretends a deſire of good, they themſelves are in this their ſo doing, become his Servants meerly to ſerve and pleaſe his quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and boundleſs humour. For now by this means he can change me with a thing that (ſaith he) is of an <hi>Evil Report</hi> in the World, and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous amongſt the <hi>Common ſort,</hi> he himſelf having under hand uſed all art to render it <hi>ſo.</hi> And now by this time he himſelf only requires me to come to a quarterly Meeting (as they call it) in order to debate the matter at the Meeting, but becauſe I was ingaged to be at <hi>London</hi> at that very time I was not there. Nevertheleſs a Meeting there was, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he, as before, acted his part according to his art and Cunning, whereby to make my caſe as odious to the Congregation as poſſible, of which was as followeth.</p>
            <p>When firſt he came to mention the thing to the Congregation, he ſaid, that there was a certain caſe which he ſhould acquaint them with, but ſaid he, we need not name the perſon, nor <hi>judge</hi> the matter, for that is referred to another Meeting; but no ſooner had he ſo ſaid, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the thing, but he immediately, to conjure up the diſpleaſure of the people againſt me, uſeth all his art and cunning to make out Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enta as odious as was poſſible; and after he had ſpent much time that way, and bad ſeemingly anſwered that might be ſaid for the juſtification of Patents, he then ſaid that I did pretend that I had a Statutre for the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a Patent, but ſaid he, I do not believe it; <hi>But ſaid he, if he hath a Statute for it,</hi> what is that to us: what have we to do with the Laws and Statutes of men, calling them unjuſt? (notwithſtanding they are for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32603:8"/>
the praiſe and incouragement of thoſe that do well, and for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the lawleſs and diſobedient) And again ſaid he, what <hi>a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor get a Patent? the very name of a Patent is</hi> odious <hi>amongſt the</hi> common <hi>ſort of men, ſo that I can as freely have</hi> Communion <hi>or Fellowſhip wiſh any</hi> Idolatrous <hi>or</hi> unclean <hi>perſon as with a man that ſhould obtain a</hi> Pattent; <hi>and if be ſhall perſiſt in it, he ſhall be</hi> dealt <hi>with or</hi> Excommunicated; <hi>And then</hi> ſaid he to the Congregation, <hi>whoever ſhall ſtand by him in it may expect to come under the</hi> ſame Condemnation.</p>
            <p>Thus by flattery and threats were they conjured to do according to his own will as though he were an Apoſtle, perfect and infallible, and Letters Patents as black as the Devil, as he endeavoured to repreſent them; <hi>So that at the ſame Meeting it was agreed by them that they ſhould not: trade with me ſo as to buy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſell for me</hi>; And although my <hi>Servant</hi> was one of them, yet it ſhould be unlawful for him ſo to do. Thus was I and my caſe condemn'd when I was thirty or forty miles from them, and before the weak Brethren had ſpoken of it to me.</p>
            <p>Here let us ſuppoſe ſome one in Eccleſiaſtical Authority, whom he doth ſeparate from, ſhould act and expreſs himſelf as he hath done, I pray would he not judge and condemn ſuch an one as a proud imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon? But to proceed,</p>
            <p>When the Church-meeting came that was appointed for the tryal of my Caſe, I being then to treat with the Congregation about it; after an Oration made by this New Lord againſt me, and Letters Patents whereby to render them odious, he then firſt charged, it as an evil thing; for ſaid he, it is of a bad report amongſt people in the world, for I heard them ſpeak againſt it, and ſaid he, I could not ſpeak one word in defence of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he charged it as an offence to the weak Brethren, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not allow of it, but ſaid he to me, you may plead for your ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now by what he had ſaid at this and other times, I did well perceive, that he had a deſign to carry it againſt me with a high hand, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no <hi>accuſer beſides himſelf,</hi> therefore I directed my ſpeech to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and to the weak Brethren, to whom I was to give ſatisfaction, and ſaid, That whereas it is alleadged, Patents are ill reported of by ſome people of the world, the ſame is no ſufficient argument to prove them unlawful, no more them it is if one ſhould alleadge the wayes of Truth to be unlawful, becauſe perſons of the world report evil of them or reproach thoſe that imbrace the ſame. And foraſmuch as they had received an accuſation againſt me from the world, and none of them there preſent to accuſe me, I therefore had a deſire to pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad my cauſe to the Congregation (who according to their own principles are to judge
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32603:8"/>
and determine all Controverſies according to Scripture) and alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired liberty firſt to diſcourſe and reaſon the caſe with thoſe weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, of whom it is ſaid, that Pattents are an offance unto them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interruption of Matthew Caffin, for ſaid I, I am none of the Sons of Art, who by their cunning can make a Mountain of a Mole-hill, and therefore I would that I might firſt treat with my equals, <hi>and then I would diſcourſe it with him if deſired</hi>; For you muſt obſerve that the power lies in the Congregation, and not in his Lordſhip, as he himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in words confeſſeth, and therefore declares that the Lord Biſhops are Uſurpers.</p>
            <p>But this poor courteſie was utterly denyed me, for thoſe to whom I ſhould give ſatisfaction, might not diſcourſe the matter with me, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his perpetual interruption; for as ſoon as I had thus ſaid, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently replyed, that he never was denyed his priviledge before, and then crys out, it is my Priviledge, and hath been my priviledge this twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, <hi>and what do you think that I will</hi> loſe it now? And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he hath confeſſed that the Authority lay in the people, and not in the Officer; yet ſo it was that by his commanding power, and Lordly Prerogative, which he claims by vertue of his <hi>Twenty years Tradition,</hi> I was not ſuffered to treat with any of the Congregation, nor they with me, by reaſon of his <hi>Perpetual interruption</hi> (as they, if they be honeſt, will teſtifie) which occaſioned ſuch a ſtrange confuſion, that I was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered neither time nor opportunity to diſcourſe with the weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that were offended, as he ſaid; But to this day I know not who they be. But when he had ſpent much time, after an inſulting and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding manner, like his Brother Diotrephes, but never proving any thing by which I had tranſgreſſed any known Law of God or the King; nor letting me know who he or they was that I had offended. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtood up and demanded ſeveral times, ſaying, who it is that doth accuſe me? (for you muſt note that I refuſed to diſcourſe it with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) Then did this Lordly perſon ſtand up, ſaying, I do accuſe you; Now foraſmuch as he had uſurped an over-rulling power, and that my malitiouss accuſer ſhould not be my judge, and ſeeing that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared the people to do according to his own will and pleaſure, upon pain of <hi>Excommunication</hi> (as they very well known) the like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if any ſuch were, I am ſure he would call it not only Uſurpation, but Tyranny and Intollerable Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>I therefore declared for an appeal (for you muſt know that in ſuch caſes, Appeals to ſome other Congregation are allowed of) But ſo far was he from mercy, that he would not permit ſo much as this <hi>Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh kindneſs,</hi> but with the conſent of his <hi>over-awed</hi> adherents, after he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32603:9"/>
had prated againſt me with malicious words, like his Brother <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> to rites he proceeded and declares me to be an Excommunicate perſon; and alſo ſaid to him who did ſpeak in favour of my caſe, and that but ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly neither at that time, yet if he did not deſiſt to abet the cauſe of the Patent, he muſt expect to be ſeverele dealt with, (<hi>Oh how neceſſary would a torturing Inquiſition now be</hi>!) for now there is to be no <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> without works of <hi>Supererrogation,</hi> and that, becauſe I did ſtand to juſtifie (not Covetouſneſs or any one ſin,) but only the lawfulneſs of Letters Patents that are upon lawfull means obtained, and not otherwiſe. The which Sentence of Excommunication he was troubled to expreſs; nor could he find a name for the offence, but declared that Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and that the <hi>Devil</hi> put me upon it. And all this did he do before it was <hi>proved</hi> that I had tranſgreſſed any known Law, or that I had wronged any Man, Woman or Child, or that Patents were of the <hi>Devil</hi> as he ſaid they were. He having thus acted his part, whereby to practiſe his revenge and malice againſt me for this contempt of his U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urped Tyrannical Authority, he ſaid to me that I might make my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to whom I would, <hi>Provided</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>they be ſuch as me own</hi>; Now who they be that he owns, or who they are that own his dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and corrupt Government I know not; Therefore with advice I did make my appeal to the General Aſſembly of Meſſengers and Elders, but I ſuppoſe that this great Apoſtle, who thinks himſelf equal with St. <hi>Paul</hi> was unwilling that the caſe ſhould be heard and determined by them; for ſince I perceive he did not own ſome of them, as doth appear thuse; One of the Aſſembly there preſent (to wit) Mr. <hi>M.</hi> who had written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an errour that Caffin hath Preached up, and owned, and had Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it too, had not ſome of the Brethren prevented it; The errour is his Principle cencerning our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour, of whom Caffin faith, <hi>That he did not take his fleſh of the Virgin Mary,</hi> and that he was not <hi>made of the Seed of David.</hi> Now becauſe Mr. <hi>M.</hi> had written a Book to confute this errour, wherein it doth plainly appear, that the ſaid prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is Heretical and dangerous, as you may find at your leaſure in his ſaid book, E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tituled, <hi>A Cure for the Cankering Errour,</hi> to be ſold at the <hi>Elephant</hi> and <hi>Caſtle</hi> neer the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> the price a ſhilling, well worth the mony and reading; For which Book, Caffin at this Aſſembly, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to engage, the whole Aſſembly againſt <hi>M. M.</hi> and alſo had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſomething in writing in the nature of a charge againſt him, in order to bring him under the Cenſure of the Church.</p>
            <p>And for this reaſon I conclude that he did not own theſe Brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all of them were on Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſide, a ſmall party that were of Mr, <hi>C.</hi> Faction excepted.</p>
            <p>But whether he would not have me therefore to appeal to this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32603:9"/>
I know not; but this I know, That whereas the Queſtion was put to one of Matthew Caffins right hand men, by a Worthy perſon, why my caſe was not heard and determined by the Aſſembly, the reaſon and anſwer was this (to wit) becauſe their buſineſs was ſo much that they had not time for it: This I ſay I know to be an untruth, but this he might honeſtly and truly have ſaid, that had it not been for his errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principle, and quarrelſome humour, there might have been more time ſpared and better, ſpent. Again, I ſuppoſe that the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his unwillingneſs that it ſhould come to a hearing at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was, becauſe I have declared my Reſolution (that is to ſay) that I would have it ſo publick, that whom I pleaſed ſhould be there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>But however, if the reaſon why my caſe could not be heard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined at the Aſſembly, was want of time (as it was not) or, that it could not be done, becauſe Mr. <hi>C.</hi> adherents would not be there; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the like excuſes, <hi>Theſe are to Certifie all perſon whom it may concern, that I do reſolve to make my</hi> Appeal <hi>to the next General Aſſembly at</hi> London, which will be about Whitſuntide next, according to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement; and in the mean time (I calling all in the world there to prove if they can) that I have willfully or knowingly done wrong ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to man, woman, or child, or that in any caſe I have been unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to any that have relyed on me; and alſo to prove if they can that I ever deſpiſed Admonition or the Admoniſher for any, ſin committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt High God, or that I ever did deſign or practiſe any thing of revenge againſt any perſon; or that I have refuſed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in any thing by which I have tranſgreſſed any known Law, and therefore to the Aſſembly I freely refer the caſe, where I hope they by doing juſtice will clear themſelves from being guilty of any ſuch acts of Uſurpation and Tyrannical practiſes, as now they are cenſured to be guilty of by many ſober perſons (of the better ſort, notwithſtanding they are juſtified by the baſer or common ſort as he called them) And alſo will do me juſtice according to the unerring rule. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that I have ſaid, if according to what was propoſed by the Aſſembly (<hi>viz.</hi>) ſix Officers to meet together to hear and judge, of the, matter, whom I ſhall chuſe as they ſaid I ſhould; I then in, the mean time ſhall conſent thereunto, Always provided it may be at <hi>London,</hi> and that I may bring with, me to the meeting whom I pleaſe. And in the mean time I humbly beg all perſons to whom theſe lines ſhall come, to have charitable thoughts of thoſe who in the Profeſſion of the Truth in this cauſe are wholly Innocent; for it is undoubtedly as great an evil for them to deſpiſe and condemn the Innocent, as it is for me to conceal the danger and erroneous Principles of a Seducer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:32603:10"/>Some other Acts of Uſurpation I cannot but mention, whereof this is but one (to wit) his forbidding me to be a Peace maker between Neighbour and Neighbour, when in the way to ruine one another; In which work I have been often concerned. This alſo was an offence unto him, notwithſtanding he nor any other can honeſtly ſay that I ever did knowingly do any unjuſt thing, or knowingly committed any ſin thereby. Who this New Lords Aſſiſtant or Council is, I need not determine, but doubtleſs he is no friend to Peace nor Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers.</p>
            <p>Again, when at that Meeting in which he accompliſht his deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, he alſo in the face of the whole Congregation, ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked me; becauſe ſometimes, although but upon occaſion, I kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>Great Perſons</hi> (as he called them) this alſo is contrary to his <hi>New Law,</hi> notwithſtanding he nor any other can honeſtly accuſe me or them for any diſorder thereby committed, but this did he do as though they had been a company of Strange kind of perſons dangerous to have any converſe withal; Notwithſtanding he knew that thoſe perſons, of Quality are both <hi>ſober, honest</hi> and of <hi>good report,</hi> and Well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their places of Authority, and the love of all honeſt men, for that they are <hi>favourites</hi> to that which is <hi>good,</hi> and puniſhers of thoſe that do <hi>evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now why he ſhould have ſuch an Antipathy againſt great perſons, that it ſhould be contrary to his New Law, for thoſe that are under himſelf to be in company with them I know not, but ſurely if their great Eſtates and Authority were <hi>removed,</hi> and they in all pomts <hi>equall</hi> with the <hi>Common</hi> ſort, and his <hi>own</hi> new Arbitrary Government <hi>Establiſhed,</hi> then I do believe he would permit them to be <hi>Companions</hi> fit for him and his Confederates, <hi>Provided,</hi> they with ſubmiſſion, came under his new Government, however in the mean time the baſer or common ſort are more neceſſary and uſeful for Uſurpers, than thoſe who are in place of Authority, and faithful therein. Now if he ſhall pretend, that what he doth in this caſe is upon a Conſcientious account, and that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it to be his duty to God, did conſtrain him thereto, and that the Throat of his Conſcience could not ſwallow theſe ſmall things, yea ſo ſmall as not to be ſeen or heard of in all the Book of God. I that am falſe in my judgment, but if true in his own, How then comes it to paſs that he can ſwallow far greater things, yea as great as Cammels in compariſon of the other; for he can ſwallow Covetouſneſs Fraud and Deceit, all in one Morſel, as doth appear by his owning and allowing one of his ſupporters, who with himſelf thought fit to puniſh me with Eternal Miſery, for coveting a Patent (as he calls it) which no known Law forbids, by which I covet nor take any thing that is anothers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32603:10"/>
Right. But this Confederate <hi>having a good eſtate in Lands of his own and a good Trade beſides,</hi> is not content therewith, but unlawfully covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>another Trade,</hi> which is his <hi>Neighbours lively-boad,</hi> and ſo makes uſe of <hi>both</hi>; And when they perceived that their lively-hood was diminiſhed thereby, they to ſecure their proper right and priviledge, cauſed the ſaid Covetous perſon to be <hi>Indicted</hi> at the Aſſizes; but he to ſecure himſelf, deceitfully puts himſelf an <hi>Apprentice</hi> for a Term of years to one who was of the ſame Trade, who lived near twenty miles diſtant from him. And now notwithſtanding his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> which is ſufficient to keep him, yet will he become a pretended Servant and Bondman, in order to defend and maintain his Covetous practice, on purpoſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich himſelf, and as it were to rob his Neighbour. Now whether this be not <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and deceit, and contrary to a known Law, I leave it to all for to judge; yet nevertheleſs, this narrow throated tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his Lordſhips Grace, can ſwallow this without asking any queſtion, whether it be to the diſhonour of God, or his Truth; all which conſidered, judge ye whether what he did and deſigned to do in the other caſe, were not for his own Glory and Renown, and not for the Glory of the moſt high and holy one, as he would pretend.</p>
            <p>But further to demonſtrate his being guilty of partiality in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, as may appear thus (that is to ſay) by his practiſing all the ways and means he can to accompliſh his malice and revenge againſt a perſon that diſowns his and their unmerciful proceedings againſt me; and in order to deal the like with him, he laboureth to find an occaſion againſt him; and having found one ſailing unawares committed, which might have more honeſtly beed born with, then many which he and they do connive at, and allow, ſeeing he did acknowledge his failing with Humility, yet notwithſtanding he muſt be, and was publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, and further threatned to be <hi>ſeverely</hi> dealt with; Nor could his Lordſhip accept of his Humility, becauſe it was not <hi>really</hi> from the heart, as he faith, (But how he ſhould know the ſecrets of hearts I know not, although he pretends to it, but this Ple ſay, if he have ſuch an Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to know what is in the heart, why then did he, <hi>unknown</hi> to the people within doors, creep into a houſe and ſtand behind a Wall to hear the ſecret diſcourſe of two Women) But this failing of, my friend not being ſufficient, his Lordſhip hath ſought out other Inventions whereby to make him odious, and to caſt him out of their Synagogue, and will not now leave one ſtone unturned; for why, he hath how <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> againſt one that cannot be reconciled, (to wit) his won <hi>ſelf.</hi> For as in his conceit it was committed againſt the moſt high, it might have been born with from year to year, as you may obſerve. But now the caſe, is altered, and his Popeſhip is now offended, and <hi>ſeverely</hi> this offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

And the better to accompliſh his deſign of revenge, he <hi>knowingly, purpoſely,</hi> and <hi>deſignedly</hi> did <hi>tell a lye</hi> of his own making, as may be made appear, and all this to make a diſcovery of ſome ſecret ſin, which his Lordſhip had reaſon ten years ago to believe was committed if at all, and yet all the time ſince as it was a ſin againſt God, it was born with eaſe, although in his own apprehenſion it was true. But now doubtleſs to his greater trouble he finds it falſe, and the party Innocent; Yet nevertheleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he takes my part, he muſt be <hi>ſeverely</hi> dealt with. But further, to make his conniving and his partiality more plain, and that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that this his great care to diſcover ſin was but to defend himſelf and his acts of Wickedneſs from being brought to the light. Another of his Confederates, who is highly oblieg'd by his Lord to ſtand by and defend his Maſter at a pinch: at a certain time this perſon, who in a diſſembling manner did pretend great Love to me, but plaid <hi>Jack on both ſides,</hi> ſo far as it might do ſervice to his Maſter, (This is that perſon to whom I firſt read my Book, of whom I make mention in my Epiſtle) and ſo it was, as I by, good hands am Informed, that this perſon upon the Road had tired his Horſe, and having ſo done, he beat him with ſuch cruelty, which cauſed a perſon to ſend a Meſſenger out of his houſe to tell him, <hi>That a merciful man would be merciful to his Beaſt</hi>; but inſtead of moderation, he abuſed him the more, and fell a Curſing, and ſaid, a Plague of God take him, he can go, but will not with a <hi>Pox</hi> to him; uſing other ungodly expreſſions to the Spectators, who are credible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and will teſtifie the Truth of it; and although his Lordſhip had knowledge of this diſorder from ſome of the Spectators own mouths, yet notwithanding all is by him connived at, and he only juſtified, and they in his account are all Lyars; Judge now if this Information had been brought againſt this Member that is diſobedient to <hi>himſelf,</hi> would it be welcome News, and eaſie to be believed?</p>
            <p>But Sirs, why may not he who was ſo wicked as to beat and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as touching his Lordſhips dealing with him, for abuſing his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſomewhat of another <hi>Nature</hi> (which out of a deſire to regain them, I ſhall forbare now to mention) it was very gently and ſparingly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32603:11"/>
as I am informed; therefore it is not ſtrange that he ſhould hear with him in the other caſe. Furthermore, touching this perſon that abuſed his horſe, he ſeems to be a very Religious man as ſome may ſuppoſe, for I think he ſerveth no leſs than two ſeveral Gods beſides the moſt high and holy one, (that is to ſay) The Lord <hi>Caffin</hi> and his own Belly; as thus, firſt you muſt note, that upon a Religious account, as he pretends, he cannot eat nor drink with me, nor would not from time to time, not becauſe any thing of ſin was proved againſt me, or that it was becauſe he was more zealous in the obſervation hereof, becauſe it is commanded of the moſt high God, but rather becauſe it did pleaſe his Idol God (to wit) the Lord <hi>Caffin,</hi> as may appear thus, at a certain time he and I coming to my Quarters in <hi>London,</hi> I being hungry, asked the Maid for ſuch Victuals as the houſe did afford, his Belly-god pinching him, he ſaid, <hi>give me ſome too,</hi> and ſo went up Stairs into my Chamber, and there at one Table, and a very little one too, we then could eat and drink <hi>together,</hi> at which time a Friend cometh up into the Chambers, and was very joyful to ſee us eat and drink together at ſo little a Table, but ſaid this Religious perſon, I'le warrant you he will laugh at me for this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but ſince that time he hath recovered his Zeal to his Idol again, and now he will neither eat nor drink with me, yet notwithſtanding he hath not repented of this his ſin, as it is a ſin committed againſt the moſt high God; for ſince that time I have told him of his behaviour in this caſe, and that in the hearing of another perſon, he then ſaid, <hi>he could do ſo again,</hi> thererefore I conclude, that which he doth in this Caſe, is not in obedience to the true God: But now may ſome ſay, you ſeem to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that he is an Idol, and that he is idolized by them; to this I ſhall ſay more hereafter, when I have done with his conniving and partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which may further appear. For ſome that do not adore him, as others that are more fit for his turn, if they through Infirmities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or fall into any evil (as I think none may boaſt that they are free) let the matter be as private as it can, and for their ſin as penitent, as through grace they may, yet notwithſtanding he will make them as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to publick view as poſſible, if they refuſe to do according to his <hi>own</hi> will, yet if one who is his beloved favourite ſhould commit — with one whom he loveth not, or at beſt but very little, Let the caſe be as notorious as it will, yet it ſhall be concealed, and the worſt ſhall be favoured for the ſake of ſhe that he loveth beſt. Although the Fact be as it were poſted up for the publick view of all, and that there be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Marrying her to ſome body, So that the Beloved, and he that is not Beloved, muſt now by the care of the Brethren, go from one place to another to get them Married. And although he the ſaid <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was informed of this diſorder, yet notwithſtanding, he never in publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32603:12"/>
them, until the early great Belly diſcovered the Fact, and then very gently too, but that in the mean time he did not deal with her in a Corner, I cannot ſay, now if he had not been partial, I wonder why he had not dealt with or publickly rebuked this new married man, who was at that very meeting when he practiſed his revenge againſt my ſelf, I am confident it was not becauſe he had nothing againſt him; for he and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did diſcourſe of other things they had againſt him at that very time for which Mr. Caffins diſpleaſure was ſufficiently ſignified againſt this man; But if he had been blamed or dealt with for that which was notorious, then the diſcredit would have reflected upon his great beloved Favorite; but why ſhe ſhould be the object of his love more then others I know not, but if he had known her to be better than others whom he hath inſulted over, I am perſwaded it muſt be otherwiſe then in the way of Regeneration.</p>
            <p>There is an old Proverb, <hi>Kiſſing goes by favour.</hi> But ſuppoſe an honeſt Widdow or Maid ſhould marry with one that is not in fellowſhip, be he of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Presbitery or Independent, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he be of a more honeſt life and converſation than he that was fain to marry his own Favorite; yet for this thing, according to his Law ſhe ſhall be accuſed as an offender, and no humility to be accepted of, but excommunicated ſhe muſt be, and ſhe not to be forgiven to the hour of death except they part, or he be converted to them; but in the mean time, ſhe is to be adjudged to live in <hi>Forincation,</hi> and ſo their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are Baſtards but this Doctrine is oppoſed by the Congregations in <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere, and by what Authority he doth maintain it, I know not; but this I, with others, do believe, that perſons fearing God, ought to match with thoſe that do agree with themſelves therein, if they can to their contentment. One thing more is obſervable which is this, that before this meeting he had certain knowledge of this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and yet at the meeting ſignified that he was ignorant of it.</p>
            <p>But to ſmooth up the matter, poſſibly he may pretend, that the cauſe of his bearing with this Female Favorite was, becauſe ſhe was his neareſt or deareſt Kinſwoman, and therefore this thing was ſuffered without <hi>pulick</hi> rebuke <hi>contrary</hi> to order for <hi>publick</hi> Sin. To which I anſwer, that if the Caſe be ſo, and this ſufficient, then it may be concluded, that if a man will but purchaſe a Kinſwomans favour of him, he then may keep a Concubine without any publick rebuke. But to all this I know, that ſome, whoſe eyes are blinded with Idolatrous zeal, will yet ſay, that I do not well to cenſure him, for ſay they, I am CONFIDENT that he hath <hi>holy</hi> good ends in what he doeth, and that he <hi>deſigns the good of all.</hi> To which I anſwer, ſo did others as honeſt as himſelf pretend, and that without doubt Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the firſt, did as <hi>ſoberly</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> pretend
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32603:12"/>
the ſame thing, and thoſe that idolized him, did <hi>believe</hi> that he deſigned the good of the Church, when he made <hi>pardons</hi> and <hi>Indulgences</hi> ſaleable, for ſeeing, ſaid he, that one drop of our Saviours blood had been enough to have ſaved all mankind, and yet that all his blood ſhould be ſpilt, he perſwaded himſelf that the overplus was given as a Treaſure, to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed of by the <hi>chief</hi> Officer of the Church.</p>
            <p>But ſay you, theſe things are not according to the Law of God and the holy Scriptures, which we own for the unerring Rule, and I ſay, ſo is not Uſurpation, Tyranny, Rebellion conniving at ſin and partiality, the Caſe is as broad as long, ſin is the ſame think among the Baptiſts where it is allowed of, as it is amongſt the Papiſts, whom you condemn and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from. What think you of it when a man ſhall be thus publickly charged with cruelty and curſing by <hi>many creditable</hi> perſons, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at, whilſt another man hath ſpent all his days, ſo as to commit ſcarce any publick evil to the diſhonour of the Goſpel or the Church of Chriſt as ever yet was <hi>proved,</hi> and yet that an Accuſation ſhould be received and Credited againſt him and that from the mouth of <hi>one</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and he one of the world too, and doth ſpeak in his <hi>own</hi> Caſe and for his <hi>own</hi> Ends, <hi>all</hi> that he ſaith, is not this partiality, I leave it to all the world for to judge.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as I am blamed by ſome of my pretended brethren for calling them Idolators, I muſt confeſs it is very ill done of me, if it be not true. But if I can make it appear that they do give more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to their new Lordly Officer, than they give to the moſt high I ſuppoſe they, not I, deſerve the blame. Now that it is ſo, doth it not appear by this (<hi>viz.</hi>) one of his chiefeſt adherents ſoon after they had practiſed their Tyranny without any the leaſt ſhew of mercy. I at a meeting at this mans houſe did take an occaſion to interrupt him in his diſcourſe, and ſaid that they preached one thing and practiſed another, he having not wherewith to defend their practiſe declares publickly that I had lived in tranſgreſſion theſe ſeveral years, but would name nothing, and (ſaid he) I have convinced you thereof, and yet you have continued in it; and further ſaid, that I deſerved to be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that very thing; now Sirs, I pray obſerve, that if this dangerous thing, without name, which he accuſeth me with, to render me odious to the people, were true, and that he knew it to be ſo, which if not, is he not a lyar and a falſe Accuſer of his Brother; but if true, pray Sirs, how hath he done his duty, have we not often been both at the Lords Table ſince that time? have we not ear and drunk ſeveral times to our greater condemnation (if it be as he ſaid) I pray ſirs obſerve, all that could be ſwallowed up very well notwithſtanding it was to the great diſhonour of God and tending to the damnation of us both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:32603:13"/>Now all this he can ſuffer without the leaſt diſquiet of Conſeience, doth it not therefore appear that he is more <hi>zealons</hi> to do the <hi>will</hi> of his new Lord, than the <hi>will</hi> of him that is in <hi>Heaven</hi>; if not, why did he not rebuke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e before this time, and diſowned to have fellowſhip with me if I was obſtinate, but that the thing for which he condemned me, was as a <hi>ſin</hi> (as doubtleſs he would have the people to believe, it was a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable one) I utterly do deny, and alſo do affirm, that he never did convince me that it was ſo, and therefore I leave the Reader to judge whether he be not a Iyar and an <hi>abuſive falſe accuſer,</hi> for ſaying that he did. Again, if I did confeſs it to be a ſin, and yet to his knowledge I did live ſeveral years in it, why then did he not admoniſh me according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? but inaſmuch as he did not, I pray what condition is he in by neglecting his duty, and having fellowſhip and Communion with it; if, as he ſaid, I deſerved excommunication for; the caſe was only this, A certain perſon from year to year was often a Treſpaſſer upon me by his Cattle lying in my Corn and Paſture, which ſaid perſon, at a certain time, dealt diſhoneſtly with his own Brother in a Caſe that was injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my ſelf alſo, by which means I was provoked the more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſatisfaction for the wrong which he did unto me, his Cattle at that very time lying on my Corn, and becauſe I did take money of him in ſatiſfaction of all the injuries that he had done me for the time paſt. And notwithſtanding I never troubled him, nor in any wiſe hurt or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed his Cattel, nor did take half ſo much as the damage did amount unto, yet for this I am accuſed, this is the whole caſe, and for this very thing, I in this pretended charitable mans judgement deſerved to be excommunicated: certainly this pretended loving brother muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that excommunication extends no further than to Purgatory; or if he believes it reacheth further, I then do believe that his brotherly charity is turned into that love which is of a helliſh nature.</p>
            <p>But this of the Story I cannot forget (<hi>viz.</hi>) That as the thing in his conceit was a ſin by which I diſhonoured God and wronged my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet he never tells me I deſerved this puniſhment until I had diſpleaſed his new Lord and Maſter; ſo that ſin commited againſt God may be born with ſeveral years without rebuke; but a pretended ſin againſt this new Lord cannot be ſuffered nor born with one whole day; doth it not therefore appear, in his conceit, that this Lordly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is equal, if not more than equal with the moſt high, which is moſt horrible blaſphemy to conceive. Now judge ye which, in this loving brothers conceit, was the greateſt ſin, my ſin againſt God, or my ſin committed in refuſing to <hi>bow</hi> to the Image which they had ſet up, <hi>whoſe Law forbids to buy and ſell, ſo that of the two be ſerveth his Idol God rather than the true.</hi>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:32603:13"/>Bear with me, I pray you, oh! my pretended loving Friends; you have your Infirmities as well as I, know you not that I was not <hi>ſuffered</hi> to clear with you in place convenient, ſurely if I had, there ſhould not have been occaſion for this thing, eſpecially if your <hi>New</hi> Lord had been honeſt, but he proving to be an Uſurping Tyrant, and you to be his Confederates and adherents to him, and all other lawful means for Reconciliation, by me offered, being by you ſcornfully Rejected; I therefore, according to my duty, to convince you of your deluſions, ſhall take the boldneſs to ſpeak a little farther.</p>
            <p>And therefore further, to ſhew wherein your Idolatry doth appear, as thus, when this your <hi>New</hi> Lord had declared that Patents were of the Devil, and to be of that damnable Nature, ſo that according to his <hi>New</hi> Laws, none might juſtifie them upon pain of ſuffering his <hi>High</hi> diſpleaſure, which in his and your judgments, is puniſhable with no leſs then eternal Damnation, unleſs they ſubmit.</p>
            <p>He having thus ſeduced the Brethren, one who is very often a Preacher amongſt them, being asked the queſtion, what he thought of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt me, and whether he thought Patents were ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous things, to which he anſwered and ſaid, <hi>He could as freely Steal a Horſe as to have a Patent.</hi> I pray Sirs, obſerve how great Zeal appears in this <hi>Deluded</hi> Perſon, for the obſervation of the <hi>New</hi> Laws and Precepts of this his <hi>New</hi> Lord; for rather than to ſin againſt, and tranſgreſs his Commands, he had rather ſin a againſt, and tranſgreſs the Commands of the moſt high God, in ſuch degree, as to incur his Wrath and Indignation; for do you not know that by ſtealing, you tranſgreſs both the Law of God and good Men, and by the tranſgreſſing of theſe, do you not know, that you endanger your Souls to damnation together, with the loſs of your Life and Eſtate, and will you do this rather than ſin againſt or <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> your <hi>New</hi> Lord, and yet is he not your Idol, Judge, oh ye that are not ſeduced!</p>
            <p>Again, another perſon who was not at this Meeting, to whom I ſaid, that this <hi>New</hi> Lord was an Uſurper and Tyrant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>I do not, nor cannot believe it</hi>; to whom I replyed, and ſaid, That if it be not true, then I am the <hi>Lyar,</hi> and have done him greater wrong, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to give him ſatisfaction, nevertheleſs ſaid I, it is my duty to acknowledge my ſin, and to deſire mercy, is it not? yea ſaid he, it is ſo, but ſaid I, ſuppoſe that all that I have ſaid be true, and that I prove it to be ſo how then? ought not he to do the like? Now to this take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, I could not by all the means I could uſe, get any anſwer, though often provoked him thereunto, do not all theſe things prove that you Idolize him in a high degree, <hi>or otherwiſe that you believe he is Infallible, and cannot Erre.</hi>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:32603:14"/>Again, another, perſon, who at the laſt Meeting that I was at, before they thus dealt with me, called me to go with him, and being at a little diſtance from the people, he then ſtanding ſtill ſaid nothing to me, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to him, what haſt to ſay to me, he anſwered with a ſoure coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and ſaid, <hi>I am ſorry that your Condition is ſo bad, and ſaid he, it doth exceedingly trouble me that you cannot ſee it</hi>; I pray ſaid I, what do you mean, he anſwered, the <hi>Patent,</hi> To which I replyed, why? how doth it offend? ſaid he, it doth offend every body, wherefore ſhall I name any, To which I ſaid, That to my knowledge that was not true, for it did not offend every body, no ſaid he, that's true, well ſaid I, who then doth it offend? he anſwered, The <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> then ſaid I, <hi>which</hi> of them? he would not at preſent tell me, but through much importunity, he told me who they were, and that was <hi>Matthew Caffin,</hi> and that perſon that ſaid I deſerved to be Excommunicated for taking mony of a man for wrongs he had done, and theſe two who are the moſt <hi>knowing</hi> men, and able to <hi>Preach</hi> too, and deceive the honeſt weak Brethren; but as for thoſe who were really weak upon honeſt account, and conſcientiouſly were oppreſſed or grieved by it, I never yet could find or hear any to be amongſt them to this day.</p>
            <p>I then put the Queſtion, ſaying, what haſt thee to ſay againſt it? to which he ſaid, I do not know what a Patent is, nor what it means, To which I replyed, I am ſorry that thou ſhouldſt be ſo weak as to be under ſo much ſorrow and trouble for that which thou knoweſt not, nor doſt underſtand, yet could he not, but muſt believe that it was but a very bad thing, and why? becauſe he muſt believe as his Popeſhip believes, and do as he commands, and who more, zealous and earneſt againſt me at the time appointed for the Condemnation of Patents. Now, if this man had not been more zealous, for the Adoration of his <hi>New</hi> Lord, than he was to do the Will of the moſt high God: Why ſhould he be ſo urgent for to puniſh me in Hell for that which is no Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, <hi>what think you of it Sirs</hi>? Hath not this Idol eat up all love, and ſwallowed up all mercy and compaſſion; for doth it not appear that Tranſgreſſion committed againſt this <hi>New</hi> Lord is unpardonable; and doth it not plainly appear that he in their judgment is Infallible; if not, why do you do theſe things without any other Rule or Scripture autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that before it was proved that I had tranſgreſſed any known Law of God or the King, or that I had wronged any man; I therefore demand of you (oh ye my pretended tender loving Brethren) whoſe Majeſty I have offended, that my Soul muſt be offered up in ſacrifice to pacifie his Wrath and Indignation; If he be not the true God, was it not your Idol? <hi>Thus they feared the Lord, and ſerved their Idol, and yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, I not the Lord amongſt us, and no evil can come upon us.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:32603:14"/>But one thing more which is not altogether impertinent to the caſe, take as followeth, One perſon more, with whom I was very converſant, who was at both meetings, In which their infallible Apoſtle practiſed his deſign againſt me, and notwithſtanding he (as I hope) is a man as honeſt as any amongſt them, were he not ſeduced and deluded, ſo as in all points to pleaſe his Idol, for notwithſtanding he never did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nor could charge the thing to be unlawful, or that it was againſt the mind and will of the moſt high God, yet when he was at the ſolemn adoration of their Idol, he not conſidering that he ſhould do, as he would be done unto, did give his conſent to this horrible cruelty, and from that time is become a great defender of his Idols Tyranny; and ſuch is the force of his deluſion, that he is conſtrain'd to believe that what his Idol ſaith, is as Oracles, and therefore cannot but expreſs the ſtrange alteration of his whole mind and affection. And now in his judgment I ought not only to be damned for oppoſing his Idol, but alſo to be hanged, drawn and quartered; for ſaid he to me, you never had had your Patent, if you had not <hi>ſtole</hi> the Seal, To which perſon, I ſay, I do not remember that I at any time was reputed or ſuſpected to be a Thief before, nor yet known to be an obſtinate offender of the moſt high God, nor of thoſe who are his faithful and honeſt people, and yet will you think it pleaſant for ſuch an one, if you were the party your ſelf, to be hanged, drawn, quarter'd, and afterwards damn'd for ever: But ſhall I be angry with him, no, I will not, but ſorry I am, and pitty him I muſt, becauſe he cannot ſee his ſtrong deluſion.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly he will ſay, no I would not have a man ſuffer death for ſuch a thing; To which I anſwer, that if he were not ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded and ſeduced, he then would ſay, that it is much honeſter to hang a man for tranſgreſſing the Law of a King, than it is to puniſh both Soul and Body for ever in Hell, for tranſgreſſing the Laws of him, who is no leſs than a Uſurper, Tyrant, and an Idol, and that before you know that you have any command from God for it, or that you know that the party accuſed, is an obſtinate offender of God, which indeed, no perſon in the world can prove. Now my beloved, obſerve whether this his, and your practiſe and principles, be not the ſame with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren beyond the Seas, who command the ignorant to believe as they believe, and do as they bid, and whether he hath not ſo far deluded you, as to put you upon ſuch practiſes as do juſtifie the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> uſurped Authority rather than the Church of Chriſt, whoſe government is according to Scripture authority, let him that readeth judg, and though Hypocrite like in words he doth diſown them, yet how can he honeſtly diſown them when both he and you act by the ſame authority And though at a diſtance he may call her Whore and Harlot; yet if ſhe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32603:15"/>
be ſo, is it not clear, that in matter of fact, he hath committed Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Her, by approving of her corrupt and wicked wayes?</p>
            <p>And therefore now my beloved, you may no longer wonder that he ſhould have <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>Idolators</hi> and <hi>unclean perſons,</hi> rather than with thoſe that keep themſelves <hi>from</hi> Idols, and approve of Letters Patents; for if Idolatrous zeal hath not blinded your Eyes, you may ſee that he himſelf is an Idol and a Fornicator, and hath fellowſhip with Idolators every day.</p>
            <p>But whereas ſome of you cry out againſt me, for ſaying, <hi>That he is a falſe Apoſtle</hi> and doth <hi>contemn the Authority of all that are above him,</hi> I am therefore apt to conceive ſome <hi>objections</hi> will be raiſed, or <hi>ſhifting excuſes</hi> endeavoured to be made by this Lordly Uſurper, to <hi>wave</hi> or <hi>deny</hi> what he hath ſaid or done, notwithſtanding all may be proved by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if they were injoyned to ſpeak but the Truth of what they know; (<hi>viz.</hi>) his ſaying, <hi>If there be a Statute for it, what is that to us, what have we to do with the Laws and Statutes of Men?</hi> That <hi>Patents are of the Devil</hi>; And that he could as <hi>freely</hi> have <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>unclean</hi> Perſons, as with that <hi>man that ſhould have a Patent</hi>; Nothing of which was oppoſed by you, although, all thoſe expreſſions ſavour ſtrongly of contempt of All Authority whatever, and ſeem directly to oppoſe that Precept of Peace, Loyalty and Obedience enjoyned by the Apoſtle to a11 true Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Pet. ca.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 13. and 14. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly he will alledge, That ſeveral perſons of good quality ſubſcribed their hands againſt me in procuring the Patent, To which I anſwer, that thoſe worthy perſons oppoſed my proceedings only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a miſtake, and the falſe Informations of one or two Conſpirators, and that ſome of them ſince they came to underſtand the truth of the matter, have freely declared to me, in the preſence of ſeveral perſons, that they were ſorry they did appear againſt me, and did now believe it was both juſt and right for me to enjoy my Priviledge.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe he ſhould deny the truth, and ſay he did not affirm that Patents were of the Devil, then obſerve I pray, whether it doth not appear very plainly by his actions in the very Caſe of the before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Covetous Perſon, who is ſuffered by Deceit and fraud, unlawfully to exerciſe or enjoy his Neighbors priviledge or Calling; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they know it is contrary to all Law, yet in Contempt thereof, he and his covetous practiſes are allowed of.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe this covetous perſon ſhould have obteined a Patent from the King, whereby he might enjoy the Trade or Livelyhood of other men, then according to his Law, it muſt come under the ſame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; ſo that it appears evident, That 'tis <hi>Patents,</hi> not <hi>Covetouſneſs;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32603:15"/>
Patents</hi> not <hi>Fraud</hi>; ſimply <hi>Patents,</hi> not <hi>Deceit,</hi> that is the forbidden fruit of him whom you adore. Again, if he did not condemn Patents ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly and meerly as ſuch to be of the Devil, why are Patents worſe in his conceit than Idolatry and Uncleanneſs? but if you ſhould ſay, That you condemn me for juſtifying of Patents, that by falſe informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo to unlawful Ends were obtained; I anſwer this cannot be, for I ever ſaid, That if any other Perſons did make the Diſcovery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my ſelf, then it was their Priviledge and not my own, and that in ſuch caſe my endeavours had been evil; ſince (as I always declared) Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are grantable only to the firſt Inventors and not otherwise, and that if it could be proved that any perſon before my ſelf did find out the thing I ſhould immediately deſiſt. Again, if Patents, were not of the Devil, in his conceit, why ſhould he condemn me for juſtifying of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? and not becauſe I endeavoured to ſecure the thing it ſelf, but judged it lawful for me to prevent other Perſons of cleanſing of the Seeds, and alſo did juſtifie me for ingaging my Servants by promiſe not to cleanſe the ſame, or to inſtruct any other therein; Therefore, moſt plain it is, That my withholding perſons from doing the thing, is not the Sin or Evil, <hi>but</hi> Patents, and Patents ſimply that is ſinful, and of the Devil; if not, why is not one means lawful as well as the other, ſeeing they both tend to one thing and one end.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if he did not judge Patents in themſelves to be of the Devil, why ſhould he and you upon deliberate conſultations agree, That it ſhould be unlawful for any Brother to Buy or Sell for him that ſhould have a Patent? Whence it muſt be concluded, that either Patents or this your Apoſtles practiſe muſt be of the Devil; And what he hath done, is either to pleaſe the moſt High God, or himſelf; If you ſay it doth pleaſe the moſt High, I demand of you to prove it.</p>
            <p>But if you will ſay, <hi>That it was his and the Churches Duty to practiſe theſe things only to ſatisfie the Weak Brethren and Common ſort of People</hi>; Shew me your <hi>Commiſſion</hi> for it; if not, then give me leave I pray to ſhew the danger of this ſeducing Error, which you conceit is a <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable principle</hi> to preſerve peace, love and unity in the Church; to which purpoſe be pleaſed to conſider, If a perſon that ſhall obtain a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a <hi>Prince,</hi> or do any other thing, which the weak Brethren may interpret or call an Offence to them, may not be ſuffered upon pain of Excommunication or Damnation, which is all one in your ſenſe; whether the thing for which they are offended, be lawful or unlawful, (as your new Law-maker hath aſſerted, and endevoured to prove to be, as you well know to be true) <hi>obſerve</hi> then, I ſay, whether this be not a Stirrup to mount himſelf into a Saddle of Supremacy, or a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation Step to exalt him into the Seat of the higheſt Dignity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32603:16"/>
ſo as that all from the King on his Imperial Throne, to the meaneſt Subject, muſt Truckle to him, and be in ſubjection under him, and his pretended weak Brethren, and Common ſort of Men, ſince no perſon may offend them in any Caſe, upon pain of Excommunication, nor oppoſe his Lordſhips Deſign, <hi>he</hi> having the <hi>commanding</hi> power, and the <hi>weak Brethren</hi> on his ſide; for they like ſo many Children are eaſily perſwaded and deluded by their Strong Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>This muſt needs open a wide Gap for all kind of Uſurpation and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and makes <hi>Excommunication</hi> meerly an Inſtrument to gratifie the malitious revenge of a private perſon on his Brother, under colour of offence: For if any one diſpleaſe his Lordſhip, who hath the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, he then may make it his work (and who ſhall hinder him) to render ſuch perſon and his Caſe as odious as he pleaſeth. And at this work he is not a little Arch and Dexterous, but can <hi>forecaſt</hi> his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeſ</hi> ſo as to accompliſh his Deſign, and when he hath thus, by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, inſtigated the weak Brethren againſt the perſon whom he reſolves to Cruſh, then they muſt declare that they are offended, although they have nothing to ſay therein, nor do underſtand the matter, However having declared againſt the party or thing according to his pleaſure, and the words by him put into their mouths, <hi>he</hi> then aſſembling again with theſe his weak Brethren, and in the Congregation makes it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to engage them alſo againſt the perſon, for that he lies under the moſt abominable Crime of accepting a lawful favour from a King, which is an offence to the weak Brethren; And for this offence without proving the matter to be any Breech of the Law of God, the party muſt ſuffer Excommunication, and had He but the Priviledge of a Torturing. Inquiſition, all that dare oppoſe his Deſigns doubtleſs ſhould be ſure to be (according to his own word) <hi>Severely dealt with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed in his diſorderly Order; you muſt obſerve in the next place, That he himſelf is to manage the Tryal between the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Offender, and the pretended Offended, though the quarrel be ſtill his own, and the thing deſigned only to bring about his Revenge, or what pleaſeth him beſt, which he is able to manage without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul as you well know, for by his <hi>twenty years Prerogative,</hi> he will not ſuffer the Caſe to be debated between the Offender and his Accuſers, and thoſe of the Court, nor is it neceſſary in his Government (though preſcribed in Scripture) that the weak offended Brother ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour firſt by himſelf, and afterwards with one or two more to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Offender: But ſuch is his Arbitrary Order, That the Party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed ſhall never know who his accuſing weak Brethren are, nor do I know to this day, though I did ſeveral times demand the ſame.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſetled his abſolute Government, wherein <hi>himſelf</hi> in effect
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32603:16"/>
has <hi>Authority</hi> to all, <hi>viz. Accuſe, Judge,</hi> and <hi>Condemn,</hi> whilſt all the reſt are <hi>ſilent,</hi> or ſpeak according to his <hi>pleaſure,</hi> not <hi>daring</hi> to oppoſe, ſo as to take the Priſoners part, upon <hi>pain of damnation: What</hi> then, I pray, ſhall hinder him from exerciſing his Uſurped Authority, and making his Tyranny and Cruelty, his unlimitted Power and <hi>greatneſs</hi> known, ſo that he may as he lifts proſecute his Revenge againſt thoſe that will not <hi>ADORE</hi> him, (the refuſal whereof, I verily believe was my great Crime.) He therefore calls a Court, Commands one of his Subjects (as he thought) to appear before his Lordſhip, and there accuſeth him as aforeſaid for accepting of a lawful Favour from a King(but ſubtilly pretends it an Offence to the weak Brethren and common fort of Men, as he calls them) <q>This thing, faith he, Is odious and abominable; and according to our Law unſufferable, <hi>Whoredome, Fornication,</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> We allow of, rather than <hi>This.</hi> What ſayeſt thou? Thou mayſt plead for thy ſelf, but 'tis to no purpoſe; For if thou haſt offended me, and my deluded weak Ones, thou ſhalt know, that I am thy Accuſer, Lord and Judge my Self; and thou muſt not expect any benefit in this Court, by pleading thy Cauſe, with any others beſides my ſelf; For it is my Priviledge, and hath been ſo theſe Twenty Years, and, What, Do you think I will <hi>looſe</hi> it now?</q> And then, after an <hi>inſulting</hi> manner, render ſuch an one as odious, as malice and a lying Tongue ſubtilly can expreſs: As you may likewiſe well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; All which perhaps Strangers may ſuppoſe to be only a Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick fit, and that he ſpeaks in paſſion, but I muſt therein undeceive them, for I would not abuſe him, I think all the world cannot put him into the leaſt ſhew of Paſſion, and that <hi>Matchiaevel</hi> might have been his Pupil in the Arts of Diſſimulation; He ſalutes you as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Abner</hi>; with a Kiſs, and all hail my Brother, but at the ſame time fails not to ſmite you under the fifth rib: In brief, he kills you with pure kindneſs, and under pretence of the higheſt Love, makes you an example of <hi>Sober Revenge</hi>; By which means he ſo far deludes, the poor weak Brethren, that they cannot but believe, whatever he doth is for holy ends.</p>
            <p>But further, obſerve, I pray, <hi>Whether this great pretended Charitable Principle will lead</hi>: If the Caſe be ſo, That whoever offends the weak Brethren, muſt be condemned, and that they may be offended with perſons for doing that which is <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> and meerly of a <hi>civil</hi> nature, (as he ſaith they may) then ſuppoſe that the Church did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of the greateſt number and ſtrongeſt party in the Nation, and that the Baſer or Common ſort; as he calls them, whoſe part he hath taken, were agreed, and this New Lord their chief Conducter, Command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r and Law-given; And the weak Brethren, through <hi>his Inſtigation,</hi> or <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi> declare, That it is a very great Offence to them, That the <hi>King</hi>

ſhould have his <hi>Crown, Dignity and Prerogative,</hi> and all Perſons within his Dominions to be <hi>his Subjects,</hi> and therefore they cannot but be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded till he hath otherwiſe diſpoſed of the ſame (for the wearing of Gold, Silver and Ribonds, he hath already voted inſufferable; And as we ſay, in the vulgar Proverb, <hi>If his Cap be made of Wool,</hi> he ſhall pay the Debt; ſo if his Majeſties Crown be made of Gold, It ſeems he muſt ſubmit, or be dealt with)conſidering I ſay, you are not to have reſpect of perſons in judgment, nor any amongſt you, <hi>dare</hi> make oppoſition upon pain and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of <hi>Excommunication</hi>: What I pray, what may the King do in this Caſe? for as he is a member, he may not by your Law, offend a weak Brother upon pain of ſuffering Eternal Damnation (if he believe as the Church believes;) and alſo to reſiſt the Commands of this upſtart Lord Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick, he may not, becauſe they are the greateſt number, and at his requeſt muſt proſecute with the greateſt force and vigor.</p>
            <p>Again, what if the weak Brethren ſhould take a fancy, or be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make a King of him, who is <hi>ſo</hi> humble, <hi>ſo</hi> holy, and always <hi>ready</hi> to pleaſe them, by making the rich and ſtrong ſubmit to his and their own <hi>wills</hi> and pleaſures, would he not ſay, within himſelf, <hi>Ob! this is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</hi> But ſuppoſe (as the Popes at their Election) he ſhould pretend himſelf unwilling, and with hypocritical prayers (and perhaps Tears, but of joy) ſeem to beg heartily to be excuſed, yet at laſt rather than offend the weak Brethren, he muſt yield and give them ſatisfaction; For may he not ſay, It is better for me to be a <hi>Rebel,</hi> than be damn'd for offending the weak Brethren; I cannot in Conſcience deny, it is my <hi>duty</hi> to accept it, when they will not be contented without it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But poſſibly it may be objected, and ſaid, That I am upon the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams</hi> in this ſuppoſition, and ſpeak of things ſo far from being heard of heretofore, or apprehended hereafter, that they are wholly unimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, To which, I anſwer, that in ſome meaſure, the like hath been practiſed by <hi>John</hi> the Taylor, King of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and that to the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and abuſe of many innocent, honeſt and peaceable Profeſſors to this very day; Be not therefore <hi>over Confident,</hi> but know that wiſer men, and I do believe; no leſs ſtrict, holy, and zealous then your ſelves, have been deluded and ſeduced ; For, <hi>Zeal without true knowledge is moſt dangerous</hi>; I will only give you one inſtance, in that godly man <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now my beloved, if you find, that he yet will juſtifie, or endeavor by deceit and ſubtilty to excuſe what he hath wickedly done, let not his former righteouſneſs be regarded, until by plain demonſtrations, he ſhew that ſuch his Evil is repented of; Keep cloſe to your unerring Rule, the Divine Word, for otherwiſe who knows into what <hi>Extreams</hi> you may run, which brings me back further, to anſwer your aforeſaid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,<hi>That I am upon the Extreams,</hi> As to what I have ſuppoſed was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ:ible to be accompliſhed by this pretended holy Politician, and thoſe

            <p>To which I anſwer, That his Brethren, <hi>Innocent</hi> the third and others, as honeſt as himſelf, did pretend to as great holineſs and humility as himſelf can do, declaring themſelves in words to be ſo far from affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Supream Dignity, that they alwaies ſtiled themſelves <hi>Servants of the Servants of Chriſt,</hi> nothing ſeemingly more humble, nothing more Innocent; But obſerve if either Emperor, King or Prince offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, down they muſt to receive Correction, and on their Knees, they muſt Kiſs the Great (and perhaps the Gouty) Toe of this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed Creature: Remember that no man grows horrible wicked all at once, Uſupations ſteal upon us by Degrees, and ſeveral ſteps; What is once done by <hi>permiſſion,</hi> ſhall next time be <hi>exacted</hi> as by <hi>Right,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Preſident of Encouragements pact, ſerve as a <hi>Lam</hi> to juſtifie thoſe to come; Till at laſt having <hi>forſaken</hi> the Poleſtar of Gods word, which ought to limit all Spiritual Authority, they come to Launch into a <hi>boundleſs</hi> Ocean of Tyranny, where they have no Card to ſteer their Courſe by, but the <hi>meer</hi> will and pleaſre of an Uſurper.</p>
            <p>Now, my Brethren, although this new deluding principle, which faith, A man ſhall either ſubmit to the wills and pleaſures of the weak Brethren in all caſes, whether lawful or unlawful, or otherwiſe be damned; and that all others who oppoſe this Doctrine, muſt be dealt ſeberely with; be ſuch an one as I never heard of before, either here or beyond the Seas: yet is it a moſt proper Engine to mount an ambitious and domineering Spirit, <hi>unſuſpectedly,</hi> to a ſtate of <hi>Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. called his Brethren before him, as your pretended innocent Lord may do; and being aſſembled, it was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by them, That this Innocent Lamb, the Pope, and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, ſhould have the <hi>correction</hi> of all Chriſtian Kings and Princes.

King <hi>Solomon; I have ſeen a ſore evil under the Sun, Servants on horſe-back, and Princes as Servants walking on the earth.</hi> For he being thus mounted and ſet up above all, makes open proteſtation, That his Pontificial Dignity: was rather to <hi>give</hi> Laws to Emperors, Kings and Princes, than to <hi>receive</hi> any from them: As your innocent Leader would do; who ſaith, <hi>What have we to do with the Laws and Statutes of men</hi>? And what, I pray, ſhall hinder your, new Lord, or Chief Officer, from <hi>doing,</hi> as well as ſaying the ſame thing, if his Horn were but as ſtrong as his Brother <hi>Innocent</hi>'s was? What do all his pretences to holineſs ſignifie to the contrary, ſince with your conſents he can do as it pleaſeth himſelf, without Scripture Authority? No doubt Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> could alleadg as plauſible holy ends for what he acted, as your pretended innocent Lamb can do for correcting the King's Royal Prerogative, as it hath relation to the lawfulneſs of <hi>Letters Patents</hi>: And why may not he correct the ſame in <hi>other</hi> caſes, as well, as this, if by his inſtigation the weak Brethren ſhould be offended, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with?

But may not the <hi>Quakers</hi> and thoſe that he doth thus Condem, Reply to him in the words of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Thou Hypocrite, firſt caſt out the Beam out of thine own Eye, and then mayſt thou ſee more clearly to caſt out the Mote out of thy Brothers Eye</hi>; For is it not hiypocriſie for your new Lord to condemn his Brother at <hi>Rome,</hi> for that which he himſelf doth practiſe and allow of at home? For if at <hi>Rome</hi> a man offends the Pope, who orders the matter ſo, That ſuch perſon ſhall be condemned, although no known Law of God be tranſgreſſed; Doth not your Lord Act the ſame things? Nay, may it not be ſaid, without injuring Truth, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not altogether ſo cruel; For they only ſeparate the Soul from the Bodies of ſome perſons, becauſe they will not go their way, which they believe is the only way to Heaven; But you my pretended loving Brethren! will ſhut a man out of Heaven, and ſend him to Hell Torments for ever (in your own apprehenſions) meerly becauſe he will not ſubmit to a groundleſs, boundleſs, quarrel ſome humour</p>
            <p>Again, hath not this pretended Innocent man (as he ſaith of the <hi>Quakers</hi>) <hi>deſpiſed Dominions and ſpake evil of Dignities,</hi> and is not his <hi>look</hi> more <hi>ſtout</hi> than his Fellows? ſince if one that is under his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſhall obtain and accept of a favour and priviledge from a King, whereby it appears he owns his Authority above himſelf, what is it leſs then <hi>high Treaſon</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>Caffin,</hi> ſeeing he will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately declare that it is of the Devil, and (in effect) that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be <hi>damn'd</hi> for the ſame, and therefore chargeth it as a Crime againſt me, becauſe I ſaid, they had not any thing to do with things of that nature.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But ſay you,</hi> Is it not a ſin to offend <hi>a weak Brother</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To which I anſwer, That it is ſo as the Caſe may be, and that it is my Duty, if I be the ſuppoſed offender, to clear my ſelf, and convince my Brother of his miſtake, and ſhew him his failing, if in Truth ſuch his offence be taken without cauſe, and upon no juſt grounds, and that ſuch pretended offended Brother is to blame rather than the pretended offender, when he hath given no juſt cauſe of offence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:32603:19"/>I do further believe, That it is wickedneſs in him, whoever he.be, that ſhall after a <hi>Lordly</hi> and inſulting manner with high hand and proud look diſturb and <hi>interrupt</hi> thoſe perſons, who are willing to reaſon together, in order to be reconciled one to another; As I for my own part was ready to do; And what, I pray. Sirs! was lie that hindred our Reconciliation and Chriſtian Friendſhip, being the firſt time I ever had opportunity to treat with you, Is he not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber and quareller? who perpetually interrupted theſe our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, and laboured to make the Breach <hi>wider</hi> than it was before, hypocritically acting under pretence of Love, Innocence, and Peace, and yet an enemy to Peace and Peace-makers?</p>
            <p>Further, conſider, Is it not <hi>their ſin</hi> alſo, that ſhall take ſuch quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers part, ſeeing thoſe that <hi>will be conſcientious for that which iſ ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Right, the Church of God hath no ſuch Cuſtomes</hi>? Leſt you alſo be found Tranſgreſſors again God for not only allowing of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Contenders, but for condemning him, who hath given no juſt cauſe for them to be offended, as ever yet was proved, as you well know; and your own <hi>Conſciences</hi> muſt teſtifie, if not ſeared.</p>
            <p>But this I moſt freely confeſs, That ſuppoſe I have knowledge and do believe, That I may <hi>eat</hi> Fleſh that is offered in Sacrifice to <hi>Idolls,</hi> without offence to God, yet if by my ſo doing I cauſe my brother to offend, and becauſe that by my eating unknown to him that I eat without reſpect to the Idol, he not haying ſuch a degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Is by me imboldened to eat thereof, as ſacrificed to Idolls, and ſo this my weak brother, becomes an offender and Idolater; For me thus, I ſay to make or occaſion my Brother to trangreſs the Laws of God, is <hi>ſin</hi> and that I deſerve in <hi>ſuch</hi> a caſe to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly blamed, if I do obſtinately perſiſt therein.</p>
            <p>Again, If my brother being a <hi>Jew,</hi> newly converted to the Faith, and, whilſt he is yet young and weak, dares not eat <hi>Swines</hi> Fleſh, and therefore will have no Communion with thoſe whom he knows to eat thereof; Becauſe the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law forbids it, ſhall I therefore eat Swines Fleſh or the like, that hath been forbidden whereby to offend this weak Brother? God forbid, I with the holy Apoſtle will ſay, <hi>That I will eat no meat whilſt the world ſtands, rather than he for whom Chriſt dyed, ſhould periſh</hi> through my means, and doubtleſs in all ſuch caſes, as it hath relation to matters of Religion and worſhip, the ſtrong ought to bear the Infirmities of the weak, according <hi>to the Apoſtles</hi> Doctrine; For whoeverdoth otherwiſe, becomes an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but in matters and things meerly Civil, and <hi>never</hi> by any Law forbidden, as there can be no Real Ground for any ſuch offence; ſo doth there not lye any ſuch obligation; As ſuppoſe (pardoning the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32603:20"/>
lightneſs of the compariſon, which yet is ſuitable enough to ſome perſons <hi>childiſh</hi> dealings) one of you ſhould meet me at a Fair, and cry for a Fairing, and nothing would give ſatisfaction, but a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance or a Ballad, and if my <hi>weak</hi> brother will not be ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, will you ſay I am bound in duty to gratifie his fanſie? But if I do not, he may complain that he is offended, and I may accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your rule, incur an Excommunication for denying him. But if you ſhall ſeriouſly reply, That theſe things do not deſtroy the Faith of a weak Brother, nor may he periſh becauſe of ſuch my croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his deſire; I anſwer, the very ſame may be ſaid for Legal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, they are quite of another nature, and in no wiſe to be conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a means to cauſe any honeſt impartial man, that is in the truth, to deny our Lord Chriſt, and adore Idols, or the like.</p>
            <p>But the Truth is, as touching Letters Patents to be an offence to weak Brethren, and that his deſign was to do them a kindneſs in defending their Priviledge, I know very well the ſame was but a meer pretence and ſuggeſtion, neither had any of you been offended, if it had not <hi>FIRST offended</hi> him; Bur the main thing hereby intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was to bring about his own vain Glory, and make himſelf famous above all his Brethren, and to be admired by thoſe that do adore him; For as he hath often to <hi>boaſted of great</hi> things he hath done, how he hath <hi>corrected</hi> and rebuked <hi>great perſons,</hi> and caſt them out of the Church; ſo might he by this means have had an occaſion to <hi>boaſt of far greater</hi> things than ever; For now he hath <hi>corrected</hi> the Kings Royal Prerogative and Authority, and that with ſuch an high hand, that thoſe who are under him, <hi>dare</hi> not, upon pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, juſtifie what is thereby granted, when his Lordſhip <hi>pleaſes</hi> to call it in <hi>queſtion, This I believe verily</hi> was one great thing he aimed at.</p>
            <p>Oh! what wickedneſs will not be practiſed to gratifie an <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Heart under pretence of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>innoceney? what? ſend a man to Hell</hi> for not <hi>ſatisſying</hi> a proud Majeſtical quarrelſome <hi>boundleſs</hi> humour! for ſo I muſt call it, becauſe there is no Scripture Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for his practice, and doth he now complain that I deſign to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him or endanger his Life? As he hath ſaid I do, becauſe I would have a publick hearing of the Controverſie, and ſome of <hi>thoſe</hi> preſent at it, whom he calls <hi>the world,</hi> to prevent which he hath endeavoured to provoke all the Officers againſt me, ſaying, <hi>I had a deſign to bring with me ſome great Perſons to the Meeting,</hi> and ſo ſignified that I might betray them into danger, and therefore adviſed them to <hi>beware,</hi> as though they alſo had been of as <hi>dangerous principles</hi> as himſelf; But I could not perceive by their words or actions, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32603:20"/>
they apprehended any reaſon they had to fear any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>But I pray Sirs! doth he not think that thoſe in Authority are as tyrannical as himſelf, for other wiſe, if he <hi>know</hi> himſelf <hi>innocent</hi> of whom ſhall he be <hi>afraid</hi>? But if by what he hath done or declared, he be a Tranſgreſſor, and ought to be corrected for it, why, ſhould he expect more mercy from them, whereby to preſerve himſelf, and his actions, from the <hi>chaſtiſement</hi> due for that which is <hi>ſin,</hi> ſince he himſelf without <hi>mercy,</hi> would ſend another man to Hell, for that which is <hi>no ſin,</hi> as ever yet was proved?</p>
            <p>However, ſuppoſe the worſt imaginable, <hi>viz.</hi> That the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate for contempt of Authority (or only to <hi>pleaſe themſelves,</hi> as he hath done) ſhould cauſe him to be puniſhed, <hi>can</hi> he complain of them or be offended with me, conſ:idering what himſelf hath done <hi>infinitely</hi> beyond it? <hi>What</hi>? ſhall I puniſh a man with <hi>eternal</hi> Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for doing <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>no</hi> Tranſgreſſion of any known Law, and yet <hi>cry out</hi> by reaſon of ſo little pain, as may be over in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour? would you not for this compare me to thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful and tyrannical Hypocrites, that would not touch the <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> and <hi>intollerable</hi> burthen with one of their Fingers, much leſs ſet their Necks and Shoulders to it?</p>
            <p>To make the Caſe more plain, ſuppoſe (my unmerciful Brethren) A Perſon whom the <hi>King</hi> hath appointed to repreſent his Royal Perſon on the Seat of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> to put his Majeſties Laws in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt ſuch as are Rebellious and Diſturbers of the Peace, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſay, this Judge <hi>contrary</hi> to ſuch his Office and Truſt, ſhould cauſe ſome one of you to be brought before him, &amp; <hi>falſly</hi> accuſe you with <hi>Treaſon,</hi> or contempt of his Majeſties good Laws, when you are <hi>altogether</hi> innocent in that caſe, and better Subjects than your Accuſer; But yet the ſaid Judge <hi>ſubtilly,</hi> by <hi>flattery</hi> and <hi>threats, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts</hi> all the <hi>Iuſtices</hi> that ſit with him on the Bench, <hi>ſo</hi> as that they are conſtrained to be his Aſſiſtants, or at <hi>beſt,</hi> dare not take your parts <hi>upon pain of Death,</hi> which being done, he commands you into the Court, and there he himſelf chargeth you with Rebellion againſt the King, and as a Diſturber of the Peace of his Subjects, when in <hi>truth</hi> it is becauſe you have according to <hi>duty</hi> oppoſed his <hi>usurped and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Authority,</hi> and for not humoring thoſe that are deluded Subjects, and ſo do not like nor regard the Kings Prerogative, nor his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Priviledg; But he having thus over-awed the Jury, and ſtopt the mouths of them that with him <hi>ſhould</hi> do Juſtice, and ſo orders the matter according to his pretended <hi>priviledge</hi> (which poſſibly may be a <hi>uſurpation</hi> of <hi>twenty years</hi> ſtanding,) That the party accuſed ſhall not Plead for himſelf, with thoſe of the Bench or Jury, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

through Grace was repented of, ſo as that with a good conſcience, I through mercy do, and then did to my great comfort believe, that I, whom you have <hi>unmercifully</hi> condemned, my Lord and Saviour, <hi>doth and will juſtifie; and therefore I believe, and that upon good grounds to, that ſuch his ſentence of Excommunication is no more, then as though his Triple-Crown'd Brother beyond the Seas, with his Bell, Book, and Candle, had done it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo, my unkind Friends! As you are erred from Truth and Righteouſneſs, to conceal and defend wickedneſs, I muſt tell you, that according to what is my farther duty, I am reſolved to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, what I have undertaken againſt him; as though I never knew him, but as an uſurping Tyrant; for I do believe, if a godly man tranſgreſs a righeteous Law, he ought to ſuffer as an other man, much rather ſuch an one, who is ſo far from godlineſs, as to juſtifie, and by Lies and deceit, defend his Acts of Impiety.</p>
            <p>Therefore let none think, that I am become a <hi>perſecutor</hi> of thoſe whom I own to be my <hi>Brethren,</hi> or that I oppoſe any, but as the <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed</hi> may lawfully endeavour for the <hi>execution</hi> of Juſtice upon the <hi>unmerciful</hi> and <hi>tyrannical oppreſſor</hi>; For if I ſhould perſecute the People of God in their Innocency, <hi>doubtleſs</hi> (as the holy Apoſtle in another Caſe ſaid) I <hi>then of all men ſhould be moſt miſerable; For I verily believe</hi> (&amp; <hi>heartily wiſh,</hi> that all good people were of the ſame Faith, from the King on his Throne to the meaneſt Subject, <hi>That to perſecute and afflict the People of God in their Innocence,</hi> for doing that which upon Scripture Authority they ought to do, <hi>is a great and moſt dangerous ſin, and of the higheſt provoking nature that can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</hi> it appearing in my judgment <hi>ſo grievous</hi> to the <hi>moſt High,</hi> That he <hi>can in no wiſe bear therewith</hi>; For, ſaith he, the Lord to his perſecuted Children, <hi>He that toucheth you toucheth the Apple of my Eye</hi>; whence I obſerve that the Lord hath not by any Metaphor expreſſed any ſuch <hi>intollerable</hi> provocation to him, as that of <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi>; And oh! that none would give entertainment to that <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous perſecuting ſpirit,</hi> until they can bring their Commiſſion from Christ himſelf, and until they ſee and have an <hi>infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> that it is the will of their <hi>Maker,</hi> and that themſelves be <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin</hi> and errors, <hi>for the Almighty ordaineth</hi> his <hi>Arrows againſt Perſecutors,</hi> and be ſure he will not <hi>miſs the Mark.</hi> He will not do as men, ſhoot at a rebellious or ſtubborn Sinner, and kill an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble penitent Saint.

            <p>Nevertheleſs, Wickedneſs ought not to be tolerated anywhere, much leſs in the Church of Chriſt, <hi>eſpecially when practised and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; for doubtleſs in ſuch Caſe, great will be the Sin of him</hi> that ſhall <hi>know it, a not endeavour to the utmoſt of his Power to Oppoſe and Reform it:</hi> Wherefore ſince you have again and again Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned my other Lawful Means and Endeavours, that ſo <hi>Iuſtice might be wreſted,</hi> and Wickedneſs juſtified, ſaying, All Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Perſons will Complain, and that 'tis nothing if I do ſo, let me tell you; It had bin good for all ſuch Confederates, that they had at firſt hearkened to the voice of the <hi>Oppreſſed,</hi> and done their Duty.

            </p>
            <p>Beware likewiſe of Falſe Accuſations: As for my own part, I have not, nor will Accuſe <hi>you</hi> or <hi>him</hi> with any thing but what I know is true, or can make appear by thoſe who were never known to be falſe Accuſers. But for my own part this I ſay, That as I would not part with my Juſt, Civil, Temporal Priviledg, to gratifie the quarrel ſome boundleſs Humour of that unjuſt Judge, whoſe part you have taken; ſo will I not (God aſſiſting) part with my Spiritual Priviledg, or ſell my Birthright in Heaven, purchaſed for me by the precious Blood of my dear Lord and Saviour only, for a Meſs of Pottage; or that by which I may only pleaſe my <hi>ſelf</hi> or any other.</p>
            <p>Beware my Friends how you ſin againſt light and your own knowledge, to deſend that which is no leſs than a <hi>Damnable Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Principle,</hi> For if it be true, as you have in words ſaid, <hi>That the Church</hi> of Rome <hi>he become a Harlot, which once was the Spouſe

of Christ, Then Vſurpation is a Damnable Error</hi>; For if ſhe had not Uſurped Authority to <hi>Compel Perſons</hi> to do and practiſe more or leſs then what is by their Supream Lord and Maſter required, and appointed for Diſcipline and. Government of the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Holy Scriptures, then no doubt but ſhe had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a true Church unto this day.</p>
            <p>Again, If the Church Officers had not through Uſurpation been corrupted, but had governed the Church according to the Will of our Lord and Saviour revealed in Scripture, and not mixt <hi>their own Inventions with Chriſts Inſtitutions,</hi> Then doubtleſs, the Officers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſtill deſerved the Honour to be ſtiled <hi>The Holy Succeſſors of the Holy Apoſtles,</hi> But if as you ſay, by uſurpation ſhe be now come a <hi>VVhore,</hi> and her Officers none of Chriſts Miniſters; Then I infer, that <hi>Uſurpation is a Damnable Sin</hi>: For ever ſince ſuch <hi>Uſurpation</hi> her Officers are <hi>ceaſed to be the holy Succeſſors of the Apoſtles,</hi> and are become the <hi>Antichriſtian Succeſſors of Uſurpers, Tyran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, and Murtherers, and notorious Enemies to all true Chriſtian Emperours, Kings and Princes</hi>; Whence 'tis evident that Uſurpation is a Damnable deſtroying Sin, and moſt dangerous to Church and State.</p>
            <p>But you may poſſibly ſay, That Uſurpation cannot be the greateſt and moſt damnable Sin, ſince it is the Sin of the Holy Ghoſt that is the greateſt Sin, and never to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That the Sin committed againſt the Holy Ghoſt (in my opinion) is that Sin only which is committed under the higheſt degree of ſaving means, (to wit) God by his holy Spirit and Word oppoſing, and the perſon perſevering in his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wickedneſs, ſo that whether it be the Sin of <hi>Uſurpation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Tyranny, Hypocriſte, Idolatry, &amp;c.</hi> any of theſe may thus be committed againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo become impardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And therefore, my Brethren, look to your Conſciences; if <hi>Baal</hi> be God, ſerve him; but if the Lord be God, how dare you go beyond his Word and unerring Rule?</p>
            <p>Believe not, truſt not the beſt of men in matters of Religion, in any thing that is not according to the Word of the Lord: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that a man of God was torn in pieces by a Lyon, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved one who was not as then a Prophet; an Example worthy the obſervation of thoſe that incline to truſt any private man, rather than the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Be no longer deluded, Oh ye my Beloved, although unkind Friends; and bear with me for endeavoring at <hi>once</hi> to defend my own <hi>Innocent Juſt Cauſe,</hi> and ſhew you <hi>your Deluſions,</hi> and how

               <hi>you are Betray'd</hi>; For hath he not corrupted your Authority and Government, ſo as to render it to be Lordly, Arbitrary, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, contrary to the Will and Mind of Chriſt, whom you ſuppoſe is the Head of your Church. Yea, and I do alſo believe, That you think that you Act under Chriſt, by vertue of Authority and Commiſſion received from Him only, and not otherwiſe; which if really true, then are you the true Church, or part of the true Church, and ſo ought to go no further than the Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which ſo long as you obſerve, you are undoubtedly his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Children; and true Subjects to him here, and ſuch as ſhall Reign with him in his Kingdom forever; which I alſo believe is your hope and expectation: And to this you are often encouraged by your pretended true Apoſtle; and to believe, that the Order of his preſent Government will bring you to this happy eſtate.</p>
            <p>But if like a pretended Angel or Light, he with ſmooth Words, and hypocritical Speeches, and Pretences of Tender Love to you, and Honour to the Church, have led you out of this good way and order, in which you might ſtand and remain in ſafety; and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled you into a Government under which you are become Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to another Maſter, and Rebels to Him whom you conceit you ſerve and honour, like thoſe grievous Tranſgreſſors of whom the Lord complains, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58. 2. <hi>Yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a Nation that did Righteouſneſſ, and forſook not the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of their God, They ask of me the Ordinance of Juſtice; they take delight in approaching to God.</hi> What, I pray, have you done more than they?

               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:32603:27"/>Sixthly, By what rule did he walk; who did Receive an acou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt me by one that was not of the Church, and Condemn the thereupon when the accuſer was both witneſs and party; and yet refuſe an accuſation brought in againſt another who was guilty of Cruelty prophane Curſing, and that proved by ſeveral honeſt and uninterſted Perſons, I ſay, what rule had he for this but his own will like <hi>Nebuchadrezzor</hi> that whom he had a mind to ſave, he ſaved and whom he had a mind to diſtroy, he deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Seventhly <hi>VVho gave him Commmiſſion,</hi> To rebuke a man, and that in the face of the Congregation, For keeping Company with <hi>great Perſons</hi> (As he calleth them) who are known to be <hi>Sober</hi> men and <hi>much honeſter</hi> then himſelf. And this before it <hi>was</hi> or <hi>ever could</hi> be proved, That any Sin was by this means Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
            <p>Eightly, <hi>VVho gave him Commiſſion,</hi> To appear like an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to peace and good Neighbourhood, ſo as to forbid me to make peace between Neighbour and Neighbour, and to blame me for being often Concerned therein, though he could never prove, That there was any Acts of Injuſtice or diſorder thereby know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Committed.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>VVho gave him Commiſſion,</hi> To move for the denying Communion to ſeveral Congregations, Becauſe ſome that were rich, were ſuffered to were a Gold Ring, or Silver Buttons, or Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>VVho gave him Commiſſion,</hi> To make it unlawful for thoſe that are in ſubjection to his Corrective power, to trade or have any Trade or Commerce with me, ſo as they might not buy or ſell for me, though Servants?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>VVho gave him Commiſſion,</hi> to <hi>Condemn the Counſel and Admonition of our London</hi> Brethren, ſo as to ſay, We do not own them, nor are to regard what they ſay?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Sirs,</hi> If for all theſe things he have not <hi>Scripture Authority</hi> for their <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> Then remember henceforth that wholſome Advice,<hi>When he ſpeaketh fair</hi> BELEIVE <hi>him not</hi> BELEIVE <hi>him not, for their are more than</hi> Seven Abominations <hi>in his Heart</hi>; For are not ſuch principles and Practiſes <hi>Dangerous both to Church and ſtate, and beſides other wickedneſs, do they not render the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church Lordly and Tyrannical, and the Authority of the State Contemptible, ſo as to make the one Dangerous to the well being of the other, For as the Church doth increaſe, the ſafety and Authority of the Civil Magistrate muſt proportionably decreaſe VVitneſs</hi> the like Uſurpation of the Church of Rome, makeing

Kings and Emperours Submit; And can you alleadg any better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Scripture for theſe things, than <hi>Papiſts</hi> can for their Ceremonies and Traditions?</p>
            <p>If not, <hi>VVhere are you</hi>: my Beloved, <hi>VVhere are you Got</hi>? Are you not within leſs than a Sabboth days Journey of <hi>Rome,</hi> And whilſt he with a high hand oppoſes the <hi>Quakers pretended</hi> perfection, and Condemns many others (<hi>more honeſt</hi> than himſelf) for Idolatry, Superſtition, and Uſurpation, As though he himſelf were of a Holy lamb like Spirit, hath he not in the mean time by <hi>fair flattering words</hi> and <hi>ſmooth pretences Subtlely</hi> and Slily under pretence of Holy Ends <hi>Crept</hi> into your <hi>affections</hi> before, you are aware, That now you are Conjured ſo to <hi>Rely</hi> on his <hi>Infallibility,</hi> As to make it a <hi>Bridge</hi> whereby to <hi>Step over</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> that Sacred Boundary which as a River of Life <hi>divides</hi> the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from that of Anti-chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus my beloved Brethren, But his weak <hi>Little Children,</hi> whilſt he is as it were <hi>Singing</hi> to you <hi>a pleſant Song of Romes ruin being at hand</hi> and <hi>Rocking</hi> you into the <hi>peaceable ſleep of vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in his <hi>Cradle of pretended ſafety,</hi> Hath he not all on a <hi>ſudden</hi> Lead you over this <hi>Bridge</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> quite <hi>A CROSS Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Authority,</hi> and Squat, you down in the <hi>very Lap</hi> of the <hi>Great VVhose of Babylon</hi>; Whence if you would but <hi>awake</hi> you need not <hi>VVonder</hi> why he doth not own thoſe honest Chriſtian Brethren, that are in the City of <hi>London,</hi> For now you may ſee, That it is the order of his <hi>Infallible</hi> Brethren Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> that he do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Obj. But poſſibly you may ſay, Why did you not before this time diſown him for theſe things, if you did not allow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>Sol. To which I Anſwer, That I was wholly ignorant of his great Office and Authority, and also of his deceits, and even when I had Cauſe in ſome meaſure to ſuſpect him, my Charity was ſuch that I could not Conclude him to be thus dangerous and deceitful; But if the Caſe on your ſide be otherwiſe, and that you were acquainted with ſuch his Authority and Order of Government, ſo as to know he hath power to be at once both an Accuſer and Judge, and that an abſolute Submiſſion and obedience ought to be performed to this High-Brave Lordly-Perſon, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Then let me tell you, That you your ſelves who pretend to be my <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> are moſt <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and my ſelf moſt weak and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, And therefore foraſmuch as you have offended me who am ſo weak; <hi>according to your own Law,</hi> you your ſelves ought to be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32603:28"/>
Excommunicated except you ſubmit, whether the matter for which I am offended be lawful or unlawful, Civil or Religious. The Caſe is as broad as long; and as you are honeſt, I hope you will not think it too much, if you without mercy ſhould be paid with your own Coyn, eſpecially when your Actions whereby you have ſo offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me, were tyrannical and unmerciful. <hi>Forget not, forget not,</hi> my <hi>pretended tender loving</hi> Brethren, <hi>what meaſure you have made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, to demonſtrate that his Lordſhip, in his own conceit, is in as great Power and Authority as any the Pope pretends to, give me leave to ſay, That at a certain time, before his Acts of Cruelty practiſed againſt me, I taking an occaſion to ſpeak of the ſudden death of a Woman of his Congregation, he ſaid,<hi>He could not ſee how ſhe could enter into the Kingdom</hi> (meaning Heaven,) <hi>for that ſhe died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Admonition without Confeſſion</hi>; or to that effect. Whereupon I alleadging, that for ought any one knew, ſhe might Repent of her Sin before ſhe died. He replied, <hi>That it was all one if ſhe did, unleſs ſhe had made</hi> Conſeſſion, <hi>that ſo ſhe might be forgiven by himſelf.</hi> For you muſt know, the Controverſie lay not between the poor Woman and the <hi>Church,</hi> but between <hi>her ſelf</hi> and his Lordſhip, who would have been her <hi>Confeſſor;</hi> nor did he at this time know, but that ſhe might confeſſ her Sin to ſome other Perſon: But did ſhe, or did ſhe not, for want of <hi>articular Cofeſſion,</hi> and his <hi>Pardon,</hi> he could not ſee any Hope. Judge now, I pray you, Oh all ye whoſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and Judgments are not <hi>clouded</hi> with Idolatrous Zeal, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not an <hi>infallible mark of Popiſh infallibility, That he hath</hi> (in his his <hi>own conceit</hi>) <hi>the Keys of Heaven and Hell</hi>; ſo that whom <hi>be himſelf</hi> binds on Earth, are bound in Heaven; and whom <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> looſeth on Earth, is looſed in Heaven. As if there were none in Heaven that hath power above him, that may make any Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration without his Licenſe or Conſent.</p>
            <p>But for as much as many be apt to ſuppoſe that this offence in the good Woman, (and I think a very good Woman too, for I never heard that any could accuſe her beſides the unjuſt Judge) was very great, I therefore will give an account of her Crime, which was thus, This Womans Daughter in Law being always croſs &amp; unkind, as was obſerv'd by many, went out (becauſe of their diſagreements) to ſervice, and home ſhe came again with a great Belly; at which the honeſt old Woman was greatly diſpleaſed, and would not give her entertainment. This was the whole matter and fact he charged againſt her, which ſhe muſt acknowledg to be ſin, and make <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> to him, that ſhe is ſorry for ſo doing; or elſe, according to his Popeſhips principle, ſhe muſt be <hi>damn'd eternally.</hi> I pray Sirs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32603:28"/>
obſerve the <hi>charity</hi> of this <hi>tender tyrannical lobing</hi> Brother and Judg, which of the two he had moſt kindneſs for, the Mother or the Daughter?</p>
            <p>Some of you perhaps may blame me, ſaying, Theſe are private things; and that if I did ſee an evil tendency in them, I ought not after this publick manner to detect it; but firſt admoniſh the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the ſpirit of love and meekneſs in private; and if that will not do, to take two or three more; and if he refuſe to reform, then to bring it to the Church, and not render him odious to all.</p>
            <p>Whereunto I anſwer, firſt, That to the knowledg of ſome of you, and of my ſelf, his Popeſhip hath taught me another Leſſon; nor did I ever find ſuch Chriſtian carriage from him or his Legate, that would have a man damn'd for offending his Idol, rather than for diſpleaſing the moſt High. Let it not then be grievous to receive the ſame meaſure you have already meeted; and withal remember, That the <hi>difference</hi> between ſin committed through deluſion or weakneſs, being repented of, and never juſtified, and wickedneſs practiſed upon deliberation, juſtified by Authority, or defended by Lyes and Deceit, <hi>is very great.</hi> Nor had I been ſo large on this particular, had I not certain knowledg of his great delight in <hi>auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſſion,</hi> which thing he improves to bring perſons into <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That I had not learnt this Leſſon from your own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; and taken this way, had it not been that you are conſtrained (as it were) not to believe me: For, ſay you, <hi>All excommunicated perſons will complain</hi>; and therefore I may not be believed, nor the truth of what I ſay regarded. But whether I be believed or not, this I know, and with a good Conſcience I can ſay, That I have ſaid no more of him than what I know to be true, or what will be juſtified by others.</p>
            <p>But here perhaps ſome of the weak Brethren may ſay, That they have heard him <hi>preach</hi> againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and call her Whore and Harlot, but never heard him <hi>preach</hi> againſt their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Infallibility; and therefore methinks I hear ſome of them puting the Queſtion to me, ſaying,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> You ſpeak much againſt Infallibility, but pray tell us what it is; and ſhew us why it is dangerous to believe that our dear Apoſtle is Infallible</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which, for the benefit of ſuch as are really weak, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of my underſtanding, I readily anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That for a perſon, or perſons, to be Infallible, is as much as to ſay, That they cannot Err; or that 'tis Impoſſible for them to be Miſtaken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:32603:29"/>Secondly, If you believe any perſon Infallible, you muſt alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That whatſoever he or they Injoyn or Compel in Matters Religious or Civil, whether in point of Faith or Obedience, you who are under their Government muſt of neceſſity Embrace or Submit unto, or otherwiſe be Damn'd hereafter; or preſently ſent to Hell, by ſeparating of your Soul from your Body with Fire and Faggot, or what other Torments they ſhall pleaſe to Invent, ſince they cannot Err, but whatever they do here on Earth is pleaſing to God, who may not make any Alteration without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Thus if he whom you own for Infallible, ſhall declare, That Scriptures are corrupt and dangerous, becauſe they, ſay, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man,</hi> you muſt believe they are ſo, or elſe be <hi>damn'd</hi>; and all the Congregation muſt ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he ſhall declare the good Laws and Statutes of the Supreme Magiſtrate are unjuſt, and not to be regarded; you muſt believe it, and act accordingly on the ſame penalties.</p>
            <p>If he who is Infallible, to cover his Deceit, and carry on a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, require you to tell a Lye, and ſay, That ſuch a thing is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to you, when in truth the offence is his own, and not yours, for you underſtand not what it means; yet you muſt do it, or be damn'd.</p>
            <p>If he or they who are thus Infallible, ſhall Condemn a perſon for that which in its ſelf is lawful, and by him lawfully uſed, and not abuſed; you muſt joyn with them, though againſt Gods Word, Reaſon, and your own Conſcience; and may not Trade with ſuch perſon, ſo as to buy or ſell for him, though you are his Servant, or be damn'd.</p>
            <p>If he who is Infallible, ſhall Declare againſt thoſe who are honeſt godly Officers, and Members of ſeveral Congregations in <hi>London,</hi> that he doth not own them; you muſt thenceforth never regard what they do or ſay, or be damn'd.</p>
            <p>If he who is Infallible, judge it lawful to be an Eveſdropper, to creep into a Houſe, and ſtand behind a Wall to hear the ſecret Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Women; you muſt by no means ſay, It is a thing of <hi>ill report</hi>; if you do, into the Inquiſition you muſt go, or be ſeverely dealt with.</p>
            <p>If he who is Infallible, command you to approve of a Uſurped Authority, and diſown all other Government; to make himſelf only your Confeſſor; to murther and deſtroy Kings, Emperors, or Princes, or any other Perſons; to believe that the Bread and Wine after Conſecration; is really and ſubſtantially the Body and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32603:29"/>
Blood of our bleſſed Saviour; Believe and perform it you muſt, or elſe be Damn'd, And all the Congregation muſt ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> But if ſome of the Services are too hard, if you can but purchaſe as much kindneſs of him as your <hi>New Lord</hi> hath for his <hi>Kinswoman,</hi> you then may have <hi>Pardon</hi> or <hi>Indulgence</hi> without <hi>Penance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But now I ſuppoſe you will ſay, although He nor we had no Scripture Authority for what he and we have done; yet we do not pretend that he is Iafallible; for if you remember, you were accuſed becauſe by the Patent you did offend the weak Brethren, and you may call to mind, That our dear Brother did prove, that whatever did offend the weak Brethren, If the Offender perſiſt in juſtifying the thing, although in it ſelf lawful and honeſt, and no way relating to Religion or Religious Worſhip, ought to be puniſht, and becauſe you did perſiſt, we therefore at his Requeſt gave our Conſents that you ſhould be Damn'd, except you ſubmit, although you might not know who thoſe weak Brethren were.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That by what hath been pretended and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, you would have me believe that it is the weak Brethren that are <hi>Infallible,</hi> for otherwiſe you would not ſend a man to Hell for offending them that are <hi>ſubject to a quarrelſome boundleſs humour</hi>: What your Apoſtle ſaid, I remember pretty well, but that he proved his groundleſs Affertions, I cannot ſo eaſily grant, for let me tell you this is one of his <hi>Popeſhips New cheats, by which his Police is Improved, the better to ſeduce you, ſo as to give him occaſion to boaſt and rejoyce in his unlimited Power and admirable Greatneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For now it is <hi>So,</hi> that his and his weak Brethrens Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is equal with the Uſurped Power and Authority of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Infallible Brethren at Rome</hi>; For now he and they may Damn <hi>whom</hi> they <hi>pleaſe,</hi> and for <hi>what</hi> they <hi>pleaſe,</hi> except they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, for what they <hi>pleaſe</hi> ſhall offend them.</p>
            <p>But I knowing that many of you, notwithſtanding all his new Devices, Tricks, and Deceits, do really believe that ſtill his deſign is good, and his heart towards God perfect and upright.</p>
            <p>I therefore, in <hi>Love to regain you,</hi> am as it were <hi>conſtrained</hi> to ſhew you what great dangers this <hi>groundleſs Belief</hi> is attended with.</p>
            <p>The beſt of thoſe who was Seduced by <hi>Pope Innocent, John the Taylor King of</hi> Leyden; <hi>that pretended holy man</hi> Hacket, <hi>or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greateſt Deceivers that ever were in the Church,</hi> were <hi>drawn</hi> in by this <hi>Bait, viz.</hi> A <hi>Belief</hi> that although they might Act ſtrangely, and practiſe things without <hi>Scripture Authority,</hi> yet their deſign was to promote <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> and that his <hi>heart was upright.</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:32603:30"/>
Be wiſe now therefore, and remember that the moſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nerring</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> Rule is <hi>without him,</hi> not <hi>within him</hi>; by that try his heart, bring the counterfeit Gold to the Touchſtone, and whatever out of fondneſs or exceſs of Charity you may have Believed; compare the ſame with that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and who knows but you may find it appear ſo after all his pious pretences and ſolemn Proteſtations, <hi>viz. That his Heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you will ſhut your eyes, and be ſtill ſeduced to Believe that whatever he does is for Gods glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What may he not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure and draw you unto, having already brought you meerly on his requeſt to commit ſpiritual Murther, and moſt uncharitably and unjuſtly Damn a man, without the leaſt Authority from Scripture? Dare any of you my <hi>Beloved</hi> (though moſt unmerciful Brethren) ſay that his Precepts and your Practiſes are Authorized by the moſt High? Do they not rather look like the hair-brain'd Proclamations of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> or the Extravagancies of a Popiſh Bull?</p>
            <p>Do you own the holy Scriptures for the only and Infallible rule for Church Government, Worſhip and Religious Exerciſes? ſearch then I pray, peruſe them diligently, <hi>and if you find not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for what he hath done therein Recorded, you have too much cauſe to believe that you are Betrayed, and if ſo, look to your ſelves, delays are dangerous; Haſt to the work, keep cloſe to your unerring Rule, and eber remember that Councel of Chriſt, Beware of falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which come in Sheeps Cloathing, but inwardly are ravenous Wolves, Te ſhall know them by their Fruits</hi> Therefore ſee his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe he ſhould <hi>ſolemnly Proteſt</hi>; That he is <hi>led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> yet (as I wiſh the worſt of you well) let me beg of you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>That the Spirit of the Lord doth not contradict his own will and mind revealed in Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And may not all good people, whoſe eyes are not blinded with partiality, eaſily ſee his <hi>Commiſſions and Authoritie,</hi> by which he acted as aforeſaid, proceeds from the Devil, the Father of Uſurpers, Rebels, and Tyrants, the Authorizer of all wickedneſs, whereby he may deſtroy Chriſtian Peace both of Church and State; and will you <hi>condemn</hi> the Pope as his only darling Child for putting in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution his deviſes, and yet <hi>juſtifie</hi> him that doth the ſame thing at

            </p>
            <p>But to prevent the worſt, I would yet in Love, with all plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, further admoniſh you, in hopes that you will hear, as your Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>VVhat have we to do with the Laws and Statutes of Men</hi>; So let me intreat you ſeriouſly to ſay, <hi>Oh! what have we to do any more with Idolls</hi>: Conſider, and lay to heart, what an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite peice of <hi>Cruelty</hi> you have committed, even offered up a Soul as a Sacrifice to your <hi>Idol</hi>; for ſince you cannot prove your doings therein were <hi>required</hi> by, or <hi>pleaſing</hi> unto the moſt high <hi>God,</hi> Is not the thing evident, that it was wholly performed to the <hi>Solemne Adoration</hi> of your <hi>Idol,</hi> who alone commanded, and is well <hi>pleaſed</hi> with your Actions.</p>
            <p>And further, to convince you that he is no true Apoſtle, do but <hi>obſerve,</hi> I pray, what manner of Perſons they were he makes choiſe of above all others to <hi>attend his Perſon,</hi> and help to defend his Acts of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> when called to <hi>London</hi> to give an account thereof; for by the <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of the Servants, may be diſcerned what manner of <hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>Maſter</hi> is of; they being the only <hi>Three</hi> (three more ſuch I would hope he may not find) amongſt you ſo fit to ſerve him.

prove only Deluſive motions of the ever-buſie Fancy, retained by the waking Memory, whilſt the Judgment and diſtinguiſhing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, together with the external Senſes, lie faſt lock'd up in the Charms of Sleep; yet ſince we have both Examples, and poſitive Texts, ſhewing, That in Dreams was one way whereby the Lord was pleaſed heretofore to communicate himſelf to his Servants, I dare not cenſure all Repreſentations of that kind as vain, caſual, or ſignifying nothing. Nay ſome Reaſons I have, conſidering the Time and ſeveral Circumſtances, to apprehend, that a certain Dream of mine (the Relation whereof might occaſion ſuch his Lordſhips Scoffs) may prove no leſs certain in the Event, than the Dreams of him, who for his Dreams was <hi>envied</hi> by his <hi>Brethren.</hi> And for the ſatisfying your curioſity who have not heard it, I ſhall here faithfully relate it, as it happened, thus.</p>
            <p>On the Day on which you were pleaſed to deal with me as an Offender of the weak Brethren, I aroſe early in the morning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, as at other times, not to omit the performance of any thing that might be my duty towards God; in order whereunto I prepared by Faſting and Prayer, to rely on him only for his guidance and aſſiſtance, without the leaſt premeditation what to Anſwer. And with ſincerity I can ſay it, as I went out, ſo did I come home, with a gracious <hi>confidence</hi> of his Mercy and Favour; But it being then ſomewhat late in the Evening, ſo ſoon as I had refreſhed my ſelf, and performed my Duty as at other times, I went to Bed; and in my Sleep I had a Dream, That I was ſtanding a little diſtant from that Houſe wherein this unhappy and ill-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged Meeting was; and as I ſtood ſtill, obſerving the Houſe to be full of People, and my ſelf at a diſtance, as a Perſon not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; Behold, a great Fire did on a ſudden appear in the Houſe; at which I ſtood amazed, crying out, Your Houſe is on Fire; but immediately it ſeemed to me to Blaze through all the Windows on the South-ſide of it; whereupon with a loud voice I cried to them within to depart the Houſe; telling them what danger they were in, and often ſaying, <hi>The Houſe is on Fire</hi>: But all the care and pains I could take to perſwade them was in vain, and wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. But whilſt I was buſie thus warning them to eſcape, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, all the Houſe ſeemed to be in a Flame, the Fire breaking vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently forth, even through the Roof of it. Then did I obſerve every Perſon ſuddenly to be in motion, and every hand ſet work, whereby the Fire began to ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te, and in ſhort time after was quenched. This being done, I then came into the Houſe, where I found all the People in a little diſorder, ſome walking about, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32603:31"/>
others ſitting ſtill (in that Room where they had compaſſed their unhappy Act of unmerciful Tyranny) but at the upper End of the Table where the unjuſt <hi>Judg</hi> or falſe <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſed to ſtand and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Devotion, <hi>I</hi> beheld the perfect form of a Pulpit with the door open, and on the outſide of the Pulpit door there was a little woodden-pin, on which there hung a very <hi>bright key</hi> (of which <hi>I</hi> did often take notice) but the Pulpit being empty <hi>I</hi> inquired for the perſon that ſhould be in it, but none made me <hi>Anſwer,</hi> till at laſt it was obſerved by all, that the Party belonging to the ſaid place was loſt, and could no where be found, and alſo that my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was Acceptable.</p>
            <p>This was my Dream, as one (to wit) my Servant that then was, and was one of their Company, and knew more of my mind than any other can (if he will) witneſs that I related the ſame to him the next day; but this is <hi>obſervable</hi> that in all my dream, <hi>I was not ſenſible of any thing that had paſſed between the Church and my Self,</hi> nor did I awake till the morning Light, and then my dream came to my remembrance;</p>
            <p>Another dream ſome what remarkable I had ſome few days before, there was a ſlop put to my obtaining the great Seal of England, for the Confirmation of his Majeſties grant before the late Lord Keeper, by reaſon of the untrue Information of two Conſpirators, who ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, That I was not the firſt Inventer, and that I deſigned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite all perſons from Cleanſing of Clover, All which was utterly falſe; Some few days I ſay before this ſtop was made I being at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in my ſleep had this dream. That as I was going about my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in Order to have his Majeſties grant Confirmed under the great Seal, behold there ſtood in my way a Church, as it were quite Croſs the ſtreet, ſo that I could not paſs by it, whereupon I ſtood ſtill to Conſider, whether there was no other way by which I might go whither my buſineſs lay, but whilſt I was thus Conſidering me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts a ſtrange thing came into my mind, <hi>viz.</hi> That I <hi>muſt</hi> go over the Church which ſeemed to be of a conſiderable Height, and on the middle of it ſtood a very High and Stately Steeple, which ſeemed to overtop all the Churches in <hi>London,</hi> At the ſight whereof I was ſomewhat afraid of Climbing ſo High as to get over the Church, but ſo it was, over it I muſt, and up I got to the Top of the Church, and being there, the loſty Steeple ſtanding in my way, over that I muſt go alſo, which I did, and went down again to the ground on the other ſide, where looking up to the top of the Steeple. I returned thanks that I came over ſo dangerous a place without hurt, but paſſing towards my buſineſs, methoughts I was diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32603:32"/>
and given to doubt, that at that time I ſhould be fruſtrared of my intent, and was moved to go home with Content, there to ſettle my ſelf to the work I ſhould find my ſelf moſt concerned in, and afterwards I ſhould have my Expectation, as in relation, I mean to the Confirmation of the Patent;</p>
            <p>This dream I confeſs I did little heed, though it <hi>of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> came into my thoughts, till ſuch time as the day of hearing before the Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per came, who upon their falſe Allegations was pleaſed to put a ſtop to my buſineſs, and then home I came, where I not only found how theſe Conſpirators had <hi>Alarm'd</hi> the Country with news of the great things they had done, one of them boaſting (as I was told) that they were promiſed, That if I did go any more to private meetings It ſhould coſt me every time 100, pound. But alſo that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Brethren were lifted up above meaſure, beginning to boaſt that they were Juſtifyed on all hands, and that they were glad they had done it, <hi>viz.</hi> Excommunicated me, before that time; All which Considered, together with the premifes herein before declared, I was then and not till then fully Convinced, That it was my duty to Publiſh their Acts of Injuſtice, and defend my own Innocency thus beyond meaſure abuſed !</p>
            <p>Whereupon I did apply my ſelf to the Lord by Faſting and Prayer ſeveral days, Deſiring that he would aſſiſt me in the work, or otherwiſe withhold me from it, by what means beſt pleaſed him; yea I did deſire the Lord to bring upon me thoſe Evills which that falſe Apoſtle did predict Should befall me, rather than that, I by this means ſhould diſhonour his glorious name.</p>
            <p>But the work lay before me, and as well as I could I then drew up the greateſt part of what is here preſented to publique view, And then to <hi>London</hi> I went with a full Intent to Printthe ſame, and and alſo to move for a Rehearing of my Caſe concerning the Patent.</p>
            <p>About which makeing ſome Inquiry, I found all things ſeemed to ſmile upon, and in order to obtain a Rehearing, I went to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> then Lord High Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>England,</hi> and without Petition, Bribe, or Fee, was admitted to treat with his Honour, who after ſeveral times diſcourſing the matter, was pleaſed to Confirm what His Majeſty had gratiouſly granted unto me under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>; But the cauſe of my not publiſhing this Narrative at that time, I have truely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in my Epiſtle to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Thus part of my laſt dream being accompliſhed in ſuch good ſucceſs in my Buſineſs of the Patent, after I had applyed my ſelf
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32603:32"/>
with diligence to make a diſcovery of the Uſurpers Wickedneſs, why may I not rationally Imagine, that no part of the reſt will paſs unfulfilled in its kinds, Yet cannot I boaſt any Certainty, nor dare pretend to Divine Revelations, acknowledging that what I have related were really dreams, but whereas this falſe Apoſtle (as I hinted before) hath propheſied, ſaying to me at a time when I was not well in Health, That if I would not be <hi>ruled</hi> by him, and decline the ſaid buſineſs of the Patent, <hi>I ſhould not proſper in Body nor Eſtate,</hi> and to another, <hi>That I ſhould not be able to ſubſiſt,</hi> or to that effect, my <hi>Condition would be ſo ſtrange: Bleſſed and for ever Bleſſed be</hi> the moſt High God, Even the <hi>God of my Salvation,</hi> I have found him a <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and though at his Inſtigation I was Caſt out by my pretended Loveing, but deluded Brethren, ſaying, <hi>Let the Lord be Glorified,</hi> I comfortably hope, <hi>That be will appear to my Joy, when they ſhall be Aſhamed,</hi> If. 66. 5.</p>
            <p>Oh! What ſhall I ſay unto you, my moſt unkind, yet pretended tender Loveing Friends! May I flatter you as your ſeducer hath done, whereby to Engage you on my part? No, I dare not, the matter is weighty; A Soul Concern, and moſt dangerous it is to play with Thunder-Boults, and Jeſt with things that are ſharp and burning?</p>
            <p>Did you not believe, that what your pretended Apoſtle with your conſents hath done on Earth, was alſo done in Heaven? I <hi>know</hi> that you did <hi>believe</hi> it, And yet how eaſily were you drawn to Conſent, to this horrible Cruelty, though youhad no Command for it; Why would you to that degree puniſh where no Law was Tranſgreſſed? Why would you Condemn where no ſin was proved? As for my offending weak Brethern, I have I ſuppoſe ſufficiently proved that to be a meer pretence, and Juggling Stratagem to Engage you to Joyn and become ignorantly his inſtruments to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his deſigne before reſolved upon, And yet even in this I was ready and earneſt to have given you Satisfaction, if he like an Enemy to Peace and good Order had not perpetually diſturbed our Reaſoning together as aforeſaid; Let not, I beſeech you a fond veneration for him, or prejudice againſt me, any longer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your <hi>laying</hi> to <hi>heart,</hi> this Act of raſh Cruelty, and your dealings equally unjuſt and unkind towards a perſon, who can with a good Conſcience ſay, That he hath been, and is ſtill ready to be kind to you all, according to his Duty; Conſider I ſay, my Beloved! what was become not only of mercy and Compaſſion, Chriſtian Love and mutual pitty, but even of Juſtice and Common, right in that day when you Condemn'd me, ſo that I could not find ſo much
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32603:33"/>
as a little Heatheniſh Equity; I ſpeak not this to inſilt over, but to regain you and Convince you of your Condition, for whatever you may think, I cannot but Believe, That without Repentance for ſuch unjuſt and uncharitable deeds, you muſt be in danger.</p>
            <p>And think not my friends, That I am ſuch a ſon of <hi>Belial</hi> that in a way of Love, you may not without Interruption ſpeak unto me, for <hi>I</hi> can truely ſay <hi>I</hi> have longed for an opportunity to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with you, <hi>ſo</hi> as the Uſurper be not <hi>preſent</hi> to disburb our friendly Reaſonings continually with his Clamorous interpoſeings, Nor ſhould <hi>I</hi> after this manner have ſpent one hour in this work, had <hi>I</hi> not believed that it was indiſpenſably my Duty to endeavour by this means to make you ſenfible of your Deluſions; And <hi>I</hi> pray God that it may prove effectual to that purpoſe, ſo that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth you may ſay of him, who like a ſeducer hath Cauſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Diſorder, <hi>What have we to do with thee, Ob; full of all Subtlety, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For untill you Repent and acknowledg your Acts of Injuſtice, practiſed under pretence of Authority, how ſhall you and I be reconciled, For my ſelf I am always ready to do my part ſo far forth as it Concerns me, declaring hereby, That upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of your Duties, I am as ready and willing to forgive the worſt of you that hath hated me moſt, as you can be willing that <hi>I</hi> ſhould;</p>
            <p>But if you ſhall will fully neglect the means, and we be not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,</hi> what will <hi>ANSWER</hi> when <hi>God ariſeth up,</hi> and in <hi>Iudgment</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>who hath REQUIRED</hi> this offering or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> at your <hi>hands: Oh! forget not, VVhat manner of meaſure you have made,</hi> Therefore if you expect mercy and pardon for your Sins and Treſpaſſes, If you deſire your iniquities to be Covered with the imputation of the Righteouſneſs of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> If you would find Deliverance in Diſtreſs, or Grace to help in time of Tryal, are you not in the Exerciſe of your faith, To offer up your prayers and performances of your Duties unto the Lord as a means in order to <hi>obtain these mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, my Beloved! When thus you do, <hi>Then remember</hi> that Obedience is better and more acceptable than <hi>such your Sacrifice,</hi> and forget not to <hi>remember</hi> your own Evil ways, and to conſider <hi>VVhether your abuſed Brother hath not ought againſt you,</hi> Knowing that your Prayers are <hi>unacceptable</hi> to the Lord, <hi>until</hi> you have done your Duty, that is to ſay, <hi>To be reconciled to your abused Brother</hi>; If you will not perform this your firſt work, or do not Believe it your Duty ſo to do; <hi>Tell me, I pray, how can you believe that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32603:33"/>
you ſhall obtain mercy; Is not the Caſe Plain, He ſhall have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Mercy that hath Shewed no Mercy; If therefore you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the VVord of God, and that he will be as good as his VVord,</hi> have a care you add not Sin to Sin, but haſt for <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> that ſo the obſtruction, which hinders the <hi>acceptation</hi> of your Duties, may be removed out of the way.</p>
            <p>But there is yet one Objection behind, for poſſibly you may ſay That he Preacheth up Holineſs and Godlineſs of life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and Rebuketh, and Admoniſhed Perſons many times that are worthy of Blame, and therefore we cannot but in Charity Judg the beſt of Him, and accordingly muſt Love Him.</p>
            <p>To which <hi>I</hi> Anſwer, That <hi>I</hi> know all this may be true, for the moſt Counterfeit Coyn is guilded all over, with ſome good met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and the greateſt Hypocriſy walks in a Maſque of ſanctity, ſo is his Lordly Tyrannical Authority, vailed with the faireſt pretences of the greateſt degree of Love and Humility; <hi>I accuſe him not,</hi> for thoſe things which <hi>are good,</hi> But be not deceived, what if he had Faith ſo as to remove Mountains, Suppoſe he gave all his Goods to relieve the poor, or (which is more than all that) ſhould he give his body to be Burned, If he hath not Charity, what will all this avail him? and do you not know that true Charity and ſolid Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty are both wanting? Are not all his <hi>plauſible</hi> pretences like rotten wood in the dark, of more ſhew than <hi>Subſtance</hi>? A Phariſaical Holineſs, like painted Tombs, finely varniſhed over, but within, nothing but ſtench and Putrefaction; Let not then ſhews and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Words, Titles and Geſtures, deceive you, <hi>bring all</hi> his Practiſes to the <hi>Touchſtone,</hi> Compare all his motions with the Sacred Dyal, and <hi>weigh</hi> his pretended Gold in the <hi>Ballance</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> but let neither Superſtition nor <hi>prejudice</hi> touch the <hi>Scales.</hi> And let Sound <hi>Iudgment</hi> not your <hi>Affections</hi> hold the Ballance; And then as you find him <hi>regard</hi> him, ſtill remembring that the before menſioned wicked Seducer <hi>Hacket</hi> did expreſs as <hi>great Zeal for Gods glory,</hi> as much <hi>Care to reforms</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> it againſt its Adverſaries, nor was there any one thing whereby he might ſhew himſelf <hi>Famous</hi> omitted by him, nor doth your Leader go beyond him in any reſpect; But well do <hi>I</hi> know that he cannot be idle but will uſe all means Juſt and Unjuſt, to maintain his intereſt in your affections, But though he ſould raiſe a thouſand Reaſons, or if it were poſſible for him, to make fire come, down from Heaven, in your ſight, to make you believe that his practiſes are approved of by the <hi>Lord</hi> on high, yet if they are not <hi>warranted,</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> Let it Signify no more to you than if he had a Thouſand Leggs
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:32603:34"/>
without Ground to ſtand upon, For if he ſhould venture to walk over the Sea, notwithſtanding all his Leggs, he muſt <hi>ſink to the Bottome,</hi> So if his mighty reaſons have not the word of God for their <hi>ſure Foundation,</hi> they cannot ſtand, but in a little time muſt Sink into the bottomleſs Pit, from whence he had them.</p>
            <p>Nor think it, my Friends, notwithstanding your <hi>great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> a thing impoſſible or incredible, That ſo many of you ſould be miſtaken, <hi>'tis no new thing for a Congregation to be deluded</hi> And why may not you, as well as others, conceit, That you are <hi>rich, and have need of nothing</hi>; and yet whilſt you inſult over others, and juſtifie your ſelves, take heed leſt you appear in his preſence, who ſeeth not as man ſeeth, <hi>wretched and miſerable, poor, blind and naked.</hi> Conſider the ſtate of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church; and <hi>remember,</hi> that if your Zeal for God be more then Lukewarm, yet conſidering what you have done, you may perceive your Zeal hath been much more <hi>ſervent</hi> for the <hi>Adoration</hi> of your <hi>Idol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be not overwiſe in your own conceits; why ſhould you who call your ſelves <hi>weak,</hi> think your ſelves <hi>wiſer than thoſe knowing and eminent Brethren,</hi> who at <hi>London</hi> had the hearing of the matter, and though they knew not of <hi>half</hi> his <hi>Devices,</hi> declared their <hi>diſlike</hi> of his <hi>illegal practiſes</hi>; Asking him, <hi>How he dared to do ſuch a thing, having not one VVord of God for it</hi>? How can you now call me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, becauſe I will not conform, when your ſelves <hi>ſlight all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition anb Advice</hi>; and rather then acknowledg your Errors, will create a Schiſm and Diviſion, ſo far as to contemn our City Friends, and diſown them.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould your Envy, my Brethren, be thus ſtirred up againſt me? Have I been ſuch an one as have to your diſcredit, and the diſhonour of the Truth, which I have profeſſed, lived in any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Sins? or have I through infirmities tranſgreſſed againſt my God, and refuſed to be reformed? Have I ever deſpiſed any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly rebuke, (if any ſuch hath been given) ſlighted any Chriſtian Counſel, or caſt Admonition behind me? Have I not been careful to make good my Place at the Meeting to which I uſually went, inſomuch that ſome in time of Perſecution ſaid, If they could but perſwade me not to come, or were it not tor me, they would not ſpare you? but by means of <hi>my conſtant being there,</hi> your <hi>Meeting</hi> was never yet diſturbed, whilſt all thoſe round about were viſited, Have I failed to ſupply your wants? or came ſhort of any one therein? Have I carried my ſelf loftily to the meaneſt? or would I not willingly be in <hi>peace</hi> with thoſe, who without <hi>cauſe</hi> are my <hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>envy my proſperity</hi>? Or can you think that I now
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32603:34"/>
neglect my Buſineſs, and ſpend my Time and Labour, hereby to make a Party, or for any ſelf-ends to engage you to my ſelf? Be not miſtaken, my Friends, it is the <hi>knowledg</hi> of your <hi>dangerous</hi> Condition, into which you are <hi>betrayed,</hi> that moveth me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Duty of <hi>Love</hi> unto you.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, my Beloved, according to what I believe I am bound to do, have I endeavored to lay before you, and all others whom it may concern, That it may, if poſſible, <hi>awaken</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> you, and that the <hi>Iniquities</hi> before mentioned may not be laid to my <hi>charge</hi> for concealing thereof; nor to the charge of the Innocent, who do not allow of, but abhor the ſame.</p>
            <p>And now, whether you my deluded Friends will <hi>hear,</hi> or whether you will <hi>forbear,</hi> I know not. But if the Caſe ſhould be with you, as it was with the Church of God in the days of the Prophet, who rebuked them for that they embraced Idols: And you, through <hi>hardneſſ</hi> of Heart, and <hi>blindneſſ</hi> Eyes, ſhould Anſwer as they did, and ſay, <hi>There is no hope; no, we have loved ſtrangers, and after them we will go.</hi> Yet I have diſcharged my Conſcience, and I hope done my Duty to my Ability; which, I truſt, may be-profitable to you and my ſelf, and all read it, fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
