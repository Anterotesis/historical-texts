            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aster Campions Booke being at large answered shortly after our conference with him, which was concerning certaine points in the beginning of the fayd booke one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and our sayd conference also, being partly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in the saide answere of his booke, (though we had immediatly vpon the sayd conference, set downe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting certaine notes of the same, out of our fresh memorie to all euents:) Yet we thought there was no cause, the whole booke being confuted, why we should publish our dealing with him, concerning a fewe pointes in the beginning thereof onely, specially Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Campion being now dead, and not to replie thereunto himselfe: so that we layd aside our notes, and without all thought of any publishing of them at all. But there hauing bene sithen by others the fauourers of him and his cause partly in print, but in written Pamphlets much more dispersed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Master Campions surmised glorious conquest against vs, is exceedingly set forth, and some of them so confidently, that in the conclusion thereof the Authour saithe: <hi>The Catholikes by the iudgement of those that were not wedded wholy to will, did get the Goale.</hi> And againe: <hi>In my soule I protest, that in any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent iudgement, the aduerse protestaunts were quite confounded: and if I were not a Catholique already, the onely hearing of that conference, would haue made me one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon such vntruthes and impudencie of such writers, we were partly of our selues enclined, and by the often and earnest exhortations of others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned, and by some of great authoritie almost inforced to set downe the true report of the saide conference: whereby we trust that all those Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, as they woulde be called, that haue any sparke of shamefastnesse left, may blush for Master Campions sake, being so manifestly deprehended in so many lyes so braggingly aduouched, and in print in the Lattin tongue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to the worlde.</p>
            <p>Surely we doe thinke our selues, and may say in trueth, that if we had bene so openly conuicted, so many wayes and in such sorte, as Master Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion then was: we should while we liued, be ashamed to shewe our faces. And we haue indeede heretofore, out of our fresh memories then, made reporte of diuers partes of this our conference vnto diuers persons as occasion hath serued, and not dissembled, that we found not Campion such a man, as by his challenge and booke, and other mens reportes of him we looked for: and that vpon this our conference with him, we verely thought the booke publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in his name, to haue bene none of his. But by such Pamphlets as these be, and like reports by word, his surmised victories against vs were so speedily suread abroade, that diuers Gentlemen and others, neither vnlearned, nor of them selues euill affected, gaue not much credite to our sayings: of that value is the first report in some eares and heades, which hath among other things moued vs not a litle, to set downe at the last this our true report of our saide
<pb facs="tcp:13733:3"/>
conference, vpon hope, that trueth in time may take place. We doe knowe they will cauill at this, as our biting of a dead man, whome being aliue, they will say, we could not all matche But the trueth is, we doe defende our selues against the backebitings of many slaunderous reporters, who doe yet liue and lurke in euery corner, by false reportes and writings continually indeuouring to suppresse, or at the least to blemish the trueth, vpon euery least occasion offered or sought. As first they began, so they continue. For whereas diuers of vs at diuers times had conference with Campion and his fellowes, the time being such, that so many of vs as could get leaue, when we had once conferred with him &amp; his fellowes, departed into the countrey from whence we were called: and others remaining in the citie, assaying whether it might please God, that they coulde doe any good with them to their reformation: this was foorthwith by reportes and pamphlets euery where so framed and dispersed, as though Campion like some great beare or Lyon rather (as they woulde haue him seeme) had shaken vs all off like cowardly curres one after another. But that religion can not long stand, that is vnderpropt and stayed by such impudent lyes, as amongest many other things may well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to all, that with indifferencie, without foreiudgement, will reade and consider our true reporte of the sayd conference. Which why we haue not published it before, and why we doe publish it nowe, we haue shewed the true causes, howsoeuer they shall cauill, that vpon misliking of our parts, we haue not published it hitherto, and find fault also that we haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed it nowe. Surely we with good conscience may affirme this our report, in the substance of matter to be most true, though our memorie could not alwayes retaine the order, or the very wordes wherein euery sentence was vttered.</p>

wayes of most horrible torments: whereas none of them was euer executed for Religion, but either for treason, or some other notorious crime punishable with death by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lawes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realme.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto he answered, that he was punished for Religion himselfe, and had bene twise on the Racke, and that racking was more grieuous then hanging, and that he had rather chuse to be hanged then racked.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto one of vs sayd, that belike Master <hi>Campion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes tender Pernell, accounteth a litle racking of him selfe, to be more crueltie, then the roasting quicke of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of vs.</p>
                  <p>You must (quoth Master <hi>Campion)</hi> consider the cause: the cause why, and not the punishment onely.</p>
                  <p>It hath bene euer your maner sayd we, not onely to vse <hi>peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione principij,</hi> but <hi>totius</hi> also: not only to require a principal point in controuersie, but euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole it self to be graunted vnto you: as that your cause is good, and that you be the true Church of Christ, as you continually presume and take vnto you. But thanks be to God, the contrarie hath bene so prooued, that a great part of Christendome doeth euidently see it. And many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, who were before of your Church, haue fled to vs from it, as from the synagogue of Antichrist. And concerning his racking, Master Lieutenant being present, sayde, that he had no cause to complaine of racking, who had rather seene then felt the racke: and admonished him to vse good speache, that hee gaue not cause to be vsed with more seuerity. For although (said he) you were put to the racke, yet notwithstanding you were so fauourablie vsed therein, as being taken off, you could, and did presently go thence to your lodging without helpe, and vse your handes in writing, and all other partes of your body: which you could not haue done, if you had bene put to that punishment, with any such extremitie as you speake of. Besides this, Master <hi>Beale</hi> one of the Clarks of her Maiesties priuie Counsell, being by chaunce present, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of him before all the companie there assembled, whether that being on the racke, he were examined vpon any point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or no:</p>
                  <p>Whereunto he answered, that he was not in deede directly examined of Religion, but moued to confesse in what places he
<pb facs="tcp:13733:4"/>
had bene conuersant, since his repaire into the Realme.</p>
                  <p>Master <hi>Beale</hi> sayde, that this was required of him, because many of his fellowes, and by likelihood he him selfe also, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled diuers of her Highnes subiectes to the Romish Church, and had attempted to withdrawe them from their obedience due to their naturall Prince and Soueraigne.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto he answered, that forasmuch as the Christians in olde time being commanded to deliuer vp the bookes of their Religion to such as persecuted them, refused so to doe, and misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with them that did so, calling them <hi>Traditores:</hi> he might not betray his Catholike brethren, which were (as he sayd) the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>But it was replied by Master <hi>Beale,</hi> that it was conuenient in policie for the Prince to vnderstande, what such as were sent from the Bishop of Rome (her Maiesties and the Realmes mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemie) did within her dominions: and to knowe her foes from her faithful subiects, specially in such a time as this, wherein we liue: &amp; that this inquirie did not touch the cause of Religion. After this we came to the matter of his booke.</p>
                  <p>And first, where he chargeth vs that we haue nowe of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, cut off many goodly and principall partes of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the whole body thereof, of meere desperation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust in our cause (as hee writeth:) and for example and proofe thereof, he nameth first the Epistle of Saint Iames, which <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that flagitious Apostata</hi> saith he) <hi>in the Preface of the same</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Flagitiosus Apostata. Contentiosam, tumidam, aridam, stramineam.</note> 
                     <hi>Epistle, and in his booke, <hi>De captiuitate Babilonica,</hi> nameth contentious, puffed vp, drie or barren, &amp; as a thing stuffed with strawe, and iudgeth it vnworthie the Apostolique spirit:</hi> wee answered, that if <hi>Luther</hi> had so written, yet Master <hi>Campion</hi> did vs wrong, to charge vs with violating of the Maiestie of the holy Bible, for reiecting of the sayde Epistle of S. Iames, who doe, and alwayes haue receiued the same Epistle. Yet we prayed him that he would shewe these wordes, in the places by <note place="margin">Lutherus in praefat. in epist, Iacobi. Hanc epistolam S. Iacobi laudo &amp; pro vtili ae commodo habeo.</note> him noted: which he sayd he would, if he had the bookes. The booke, wherein was <hi>Luthers</hi> Preface to that Epistle being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him, when he had read some part of the sayd Preface, and found that <hi>Luther</hi> did allowe and commend that Epistle, as in deede he doeth, testifying, that though it were reiected of some
<pb facs="tcp:13733:5"/>
olde writers, yet he commended it and tooke it to be good and profitable: which wordes of <hi>Luther</hi> when Master <hi>Campion</hi> had read, he shut the booke and sayde, that it was not of the true edition.</p>
                  <p>We answered that the print was not lately published, being almost fourtie yeeres sithence, and that we had searched all other printes that we could come by, and found them to agree with this: and that we thought there was no other, and therefore we prayed him, that he would shewe some edition wherein it was so set downe, as he alleaged it in his booke.</p>
                  <p>He sayd, he thought it was so as he had alleaged in the same booke of <hi>Luther</hi> in the Dutch tongue.</p>
                  <p>Then we offered to bring him the Dutch booke for the triall of the trueth of the Latin translation: but he refused to see the same. But it was aduouched vnto him (as the trueth is in deede) that it was likewise in the Dutch booke, as he had read it in the Latin, for that we had made conference thereof.</p>
                  <p>Then he desired to see <hi>Luthers</hi> booke, <hi>De captiuitate Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica.</hi> This booke also we deliuered to him, and desired that he would shewe those wordes there. He read the wordes in Latin, which are these in effect: <hi>I passe ouer</hi> (saith <hi>Luther) that many doe very probablie affirme, that this Epistle is not Saint Iames the Apostles, nor worthie the Apostolike spirit.</hi> Here Master <hi>Campion</hi> thought that he had founde at the least, that <hi>Luther</hi> had sayd, that the sayd Epistle, was not worthie the Apostolike spirit.</p>
                  <p>But wee prayed him to consider, that <hi>Luther</hi> spake of other mens iudgement, and not of his owne, as in the same place is most euident to see: and also before in his Preface to that Epistle he expresly deuideth his iudgement from theirs.</p>
                  <p>But Master <hi>Campion</hi> much vrged the wordes <hi>(very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly)</hi> whereby saith he, <hi>Luther</hi> shewed his allowance of their iudgement.</p>
                  <p>We answered, that he so sayde, for that they brought very probable reasons for that their iudgement. But he still char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Luther</hi> with blasphemie for saying that some doe very probably affirme, that the Epistle of Iames, was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:13733:5"/>
by the Apostle Saint Iames, nor worthie the spirite of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, and vrged vs to answere what opinion we had of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, meaning to intangle vs with that <hi>Dilemma</hi> either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Luther, or else to doubt of the Epistle, as Luther saith that some probablie doe.</p>
                  <p>We answered that our Church doubteth not of that Epistle, but receiueth it as Canonical, readeth it in our Churches, expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it in our scholes, and alleageth it for confirmation of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Notwithstanding for Luther or any other to say, that some haue very probably affirmed that Epistle not to be written by Saint Iames nor to be worthie the spirite of an Apostle, is no blasphemie.</p>
                  <p>It is blasphemie, blasphemie (quoth he) pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing those words with disdainefull countenance and voyce.</p>
                  <p>It is soone said (quoth we) but not so easely proued.</p>
                  <p>I will proue it (quoth he) to be blasphemie by two reasons, and thus he framed a syllogisme.</p>
                  <p>The Gospell of Saint Iohn, and the Epistle of Saint Iames, were written by the same spirite:</p>
                  <p>But to say that some doe probably affirme the Gospell of Saint Iohn not to be written by Saint Iohn, nor to be worthie the spirite of an Apostle is blasphemie:</p>
                  <p>Therefore to say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like of Saint Iames Epistle is blasphemy.</p>
                  <p>Answere was made that the <hi>Maior</hi> was <hi>Petitio Principij</hi> the challenging of the graunt of that which chiefly is in controuersie. For those that so say of Saint Iames Epistle, doubt whether it was written by the same Spirite, that the Gospell of Saint Iohn was or no: and that still resteth for you to proue said we.</p>
                  <p>And here Master Campion when he coulde not denie, that he required that to be graunted to him which he should haue proued, was put to silence, and had no more to replie.</p>
                  <p>Then was his second reason called for, but none could be found.</p>
                  <p>Then saide one of them, Why, is not Saint Iames Epistle called the Catholicke Epistle of Saint Iames? Howe doe you then denie it to be Canonicall?</p>
                  <p>It was said, that that was a simple reason. For whereas other Epistles of the Apostles, were written vnto speciall Cities, people or persons: this of Saint Iames, for that it was written com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb facs="tcp:13733:6"/>
to all the tribes of the Iewes dispersed, was called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or generall.</p>
                  <p>Then sayd we to the auditorie: You haue heard that <hi>Luther</hi> doeth much commend this Epistle of Saint Iames, as good and profitable: and Master <hi>Campion</hi> alleadgeth, that he calleth it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, puffed vp, drie or barren, stuffed with strawe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie the Apostolike spirit.</hi> Whereby (sayd we) ye may see the diuersitie or rather contrarietie of <hi>Luthers</hi> wordes, and Master <hi>Campions</hi> reporte, and so may ye iudge of his synceritie &amp; trueth, which he vseth likewise continually.</p>
                  <p>Then saide Master <hi>Campion,</hi> that <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe and others had purged these workes, and taken away all such places as that was, and the like that ministred such occasions of offence as that did: and he said he woulde procure from the <hi>Emperours</hi> Maiestie, and the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> and from another Prince (whose name we remember not) the true copyes of those bookes to be sent to the Queenes Maiestie. Which wordes he (rising vp from the forme whereon he sate) pronounced with so great contention of voice, and with such gesture, casting vp his armes, &amp; beating vpon his booke, that one of vs challenged him therefore, demaunding why he vsed such outragious speach and behauiour?</p>
                  <p>He answered, for that so many yong Catholiques were present there, he woulde not by any faint defending of the cause, giue them occasion of offence.</p>
                  <p>Whereby we vnderstande, howe he would haue behaued him selfe, might he haue obteined a disputation among the youth of the Uniuersities, trusting they woulde be caryed away many of them by such his bolde and confident dealings and actions.</p>
                  <p>And we saide further to Master <hi>Campion,</hi> that if <hi>Luther</hi> had purged his books, &amp; where he first reiected Saint Iames Epistle (as Master <hi>Campion</hi> saith) he hath sithen receiued and much commended it: with whatreason hath Master <hi>Campion</hi> charged vs vpon his surmise of <hi>Luthers</hi> first writing, which doth no where appeare as reiecting Saint Iames Epistle? He should rather haue commended vs, who doe and alwayes haue allowed of that Epistle, and should haue praised <hi>Luther,</hi> who after the example of <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> (and other ancient and godly writers) had amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">S. Aug. in his booke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractations.</note> in his writing that which vpon better aduise he misliked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13733:6"/>
Then we turning to the auditorie, sayd, that seeing all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bookes of <hi>Luther</hi> extant, that we could finde, doe conteine such commendations of Saint Iames Epistle as they had heard, and that Master <hi>Campion</hi> hath charged <hi>Luther</hi> so contrarily to all his printed bookes, wherein he commendeth that Epistle, and therby also chargeth vs as reiecting it, who euer haue receiued it: they might, we said, take Master <hi>Campions</hi> trueth and synceritie to be as it is, vntill he haue brought out his copies from the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> which he nor any liuing we beleeue can euer doe.</p>
                  <p>But Master <hi>Campion</hi> said, that might he haue his own bookes from Oxeforde, he woulde shewe that in <hi>Luther,</hi> which he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto it was answered, that if he woulde let vs knowe where they were, we would become humble suters to their honors, that he might both enioye his bookes, and that the partie who had them in keeping might be without daunger. But this woulde he not consent vnto.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Hart</hi> one of his fellowes saide, that he being at Rome, heard <hi>Bellarminus</hi> the reader of controuersies there affirme, that the wordes reported by <hi>Campion</hi> in his booke were in that preface of <hi>Luther,</hi> and that therefore vpon his worde it was so.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto we answered, that neither his wordes, nor the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Bellarminus</hi> were of sufficient credite to carry away such a matter as that was without better proofe, specially so many and most manifest proofes in <hi>Luthers</hi> printed bookes being to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, who agreeth with vs in allowing the said Epistle, and that therefore Master <hi>Campion</hi> hath most impudently alleadged this place of <hi>Luther,</hi> as a profe that we should reiect S. <hi>Iames</hi> Epistle.</p>
                  <p>Then Master <hi>Beale</hi> said, It is not materiall to vs, if <hi>Luther</hi> had once so written: but he asked Master <hi>Campion</hi> whether euer he did read him selfe any such wordes in <hi>Luther,</hi> as he in his booke doeth charge him with, or not?</p>
                  <p>Whereto he answered, that in a treatise made by <hi>Doctor Lee,</hi> sometime <hi>Archbishoppe</hi> of Yorke, against that booke of <hi>Luther</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>De captiuitate Babilonica,</hi> he had read these wordes allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as he had set them downe in his booke.</p>
                  <p>Being againe asked, whether either vpon his othe, or vpon his
<pb facs="tcp:13733:7"/>
credit, he would say to the presence there assembled, that he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seene the places alleaged by him in his booke: and whether he knewe them to be true?</p>
                  <p>He answered, that he wrote his booke as he traueiled, and that he coulde not, we knewe, cary a librarie about with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was forced to giue credite to his notes.</p>
                  <p>We said it was more credible, that he brought the saide booke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with him, readie framed by the common and long conference of him selfe, and his fellowe Iesuites at conuenient opportunitie suddenly to be published, rather then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did write it in his trauels, hauing so much besides to do, &amp; being destitute of his librarie as he said, which is the vsual maner (as we said) of you all, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting thereby for popular praise of speedie writing. But when &amp; howsoeuer you did write your booke said we, you haue vsed ouermuch boldnes, so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently to publish in print these slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous reportes of such men as you haue named, being not able to make any proofe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you accuse them. And vpon these such good grounds of yours, you doe most vnreasonably and vntruly charge vs all, as those that haue rased, mangled and spoyled the body of the holy Bible.</p>
                  <p>The third testimonie or proofe alleaged against vs by Master <hi>Campion</hi> in his booke, is taken out of the <hi>Centuries,</hi> written by <hi>Illiricus,</hi> and others: which booke being giuen into his handes, and the like demaunde made as before, he would neither reade, nor once open the booke, neither yet made he any answere thereto, knowing that he could make no exception to the print, as he did before to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> bookes, seeing that booke was neuer printed but once.</p>
                  <p>And besides, where they as Historiographers, had only set down the iudgements of S. <hi>Hierome, Eusebius, Epiphanius,</hi> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient fathers concerning this Epistle of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> of <hi>Tobias,</hi> the bookes of <hi>Macchabees,</hi> &amp;c: he knewe that he could not thereby proue his assertion, that they suddenly cut away so many goodly partes of the holy Bible, much lesse that we had so done, as he doeth in his booke charge vs. For which causes chiefly, he would not as much as once open those bookes, and for the same cause, he woulde not looke vpon <hi>Kemnisius,</hi> whome, and vs by him, he had likewise falsely charged.</p>
                  <p>When Master <hi>Campion</hi> could not shew these words, out of any of those books by him alleaged, nor any good matter to proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:13733:7"/>
nor vs suddenly to haue rased, mangled and spoyled the holy Scriptures, as he chargeth vs of desperation in our cause, to haue done: then did we shewe him, that we had not nowe sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as he vntruely reported) cut off any part or line of the body of the holy Scriptures, but made onely a difference betweene those bookes of the Scriptures, that be commonly called <hi>Canonicall,</hi> and of all men be taken for vndoubtedly true, from those that haue bene long ago suspected of many, and are called <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> according as was before set downe by the ancient Doctors of the Church, aboue a thousand yeres since &amp; more. And for the proofe hereof, we alleaged the testimonie of <hi>Saint Hierome, In Catalogo Scriptorum ecclesiasticorum,</hi> where he thus writes of the Epistle <note place="margin">S. Hieromes wordes.</note> of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> named by Master <hi>Campion: The Epistle of Saint Iames, is sayd to be published, by some other man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his name.</hi> And of the second Epistle of Saint Peter he saith in the same booke, <hi>that it is denied of many to be his, by reason of the difference of the stile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Master <hi>Campion</hi> answered, that <hi>Hierome</hi> spake not of his owne iudgement, but reported what others sayde of them.</p>
                  <p>We answered, if <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> so reported of other mens sayings of those Epistles, and did not him selfe gainesay it, that it was a manifest token, that he did not greatly mislike their say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And seeing in <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> time and before, those Epistles were doubted of, you doe vs great wrong sayd we, to charge vs that we haue suddenly cut them off from the body of the Bible, who in deede notwithstanding the former doubtes of them, gladly receaue and allowe them. We alleaged againe <hi>S. Hierome, In Prologo Galeato, et Epistola ad Paulinum,</hi> where hee sheweth his owne iudgement, what bookes of the Scriptures of the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament are to be taken for <hi>Canonicall,</hi> and which haue bene doubted of: which Epistles (quoth we) haue bene written and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all Bibles, by the space of these thousand yeres and more, to warne al readers of that difference of the said <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> from the true <hi>Canonicall:</hi> and to arme them as it were against the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of confounding the <hi>Canonical</hi> Scriptures with these <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha:</hi> for the which cause as it seemeth, hee also nameth that Prologue <hi>Galeatum,</hi> as an helmet for defence against that error.
<pb facs="tcp:13733:8"/>
But nowe sitchence the Tridentine Councill, some Popish prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue left out the sayd Prologue and Epistle of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> who yet declareth this his iudgement likewise, in his Preface to the first booke of <hi>Esdras</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sherwin</hi> one of Master <hi>Campions</hi> fellowes, answered to these allegations, that <hi>Hierome</hi> did <hi>Iudaizare,</hi> and more was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ayd to these places.</p>
                  <p>We also alleadged <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who hauing made rehearsall of those bookes of the newe Testament, which be vndoubtedly true, nameth also such as were gainesayd, and writes thus: <hi>Quibus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 3. cap. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>contradicitur, &amp;c.</hi> those bookes that are gainesayde, though they be knowen to many, be these: <hi>The Epistle which is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to S. Iames, the Epistle of Iude, the latter of Peter, &amp; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 2. cap. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>and third of Iohn.</hi> And the same <hi>Eusebius</hi> in another place <hi>affirmeth plainely, the sayd Epistle of S. Iames, to be a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite or bastard Epistle.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Adulterinam.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this authoritie they said that it was true that he so said, and as we alleadged them, and that when he wrote, it was lawfull for any man to doubt of those bookes, that he called <hi>Apocrypha:</hi> but seeing by the Church (that was by the Councill of Carthage, &amp; now also by the Councill of Trident) they were receiued for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, it was blasphemie, they said, to doubt of the authoritie of those bookes.</p>
                  <p>To that was replied, that the <hi>Synode of Laodicea,</hi> helde them for <hi>Apocrypha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea said they, but that Synode was not generall.</p>
                  <p>No more was that of <hi>Carthage</hi> said we.</p>
                  <p>No said they, but that of <hi>Carthage</hi> was after confirmed by a generall Councill in <hi>Trullo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So was (quoth we) the Synode of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which helde them for <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> confirmed also by the same generall Councill in <hi>Trullo,</hi> as there is to be seene. But howe doth this agree, that not long before you did saye absolutely, that <hi>S. Iames</hi> epistle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the same spirit that <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Gospell was written with, and now you ground the credit of <hi>S. Iames</hi> Epistle and the other vpon these Councils:</p>
                  <p>But said we, these Councils had no authoritie to make any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner writings Canonical, that was not before Canonicall. For, by
<pb facs="tcp:13733:8"/>
the iudgement of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in many places of his bookes, there <note place="margin">August. contra Faustum. li. 28. cap. 2. &amp; lib. 33 cap. 6.</note> are two things requisite to proue any writing Canonicall: one is the testimonie of the Church, in which the authour liued when he wrote: The other is the continuall contestation of the Churches succeeding. To this effect writeth <hi>S. Augustine:</hi> and so be all lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Churches barred from authoritie to make any writings cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall scripture, specially those that haue of olde bene doubted of. They may testifie what the olde Churches before them haue done, as we nowe doe.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto they saide againe, that it was blasphemie after those Councils to call those bookes <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> or to doubt of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of them.</p>
                  <p>It is rather most horrible blasphemie said we, to make humane writings equall with the Canonicall scriptures, (as of late your <hi>Tridentine Councill</hi> hath done, and as your Pope being but one <note place="margin">Distinct. 19. cap. In Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicis.</note> man hath made his Decretal epistles) then with <hi>S. Hierome, Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> and other ancient godly fathers, to call those bookes <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> which they do so call.</p>
                  <p>And we said, that notwithstanding those Councils, <hi>Caietanus</hi> their Popes Cardinall thought it no blasphemie, who in the ende of his expositions vpon the olde testament, in very plaine wordes, maketh the same difference of the bookes of the scriptures, &amp; doeth not onely alowe the iudgement of <hi>Hierome,</hi> but addeth further, that all writitings, yea of bishops of Rome them selues, of whome he nameth some, must be brought to <hi>S. Hieroms</hi> rule. <note place="margin">Ad norm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>They vtterly reiected <hi>Cardinall Caietanus,</hi> because (as they said) he was but one man against all the Church.</p>
                  <p>We said, you of your side will not be charged with the wordes of others, though they be the Popes Cardinals, and yet you doe thinke it reason, that we should be charged with euery worde, that hath slipped from <hi>Luther.</hi> Nay you charge him, and vs by him, with that which you can neuer proue, that he did write or speake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hart</hi> said further, that <hi>Caietanus</hi> was a good scholema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled in that course with commendation: but when hee began to become an expositor of the scriptures, said he, then he lost his grace and credit.</p>
                  <p>We answered, if they thought it reason to charge vs with all the sayings of <hi>Luther,</hi> or of any other: we might by good and great
<pb facs="tcp:13733:9"/>
reason, charge them with the sayings of so great &amp; learned a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of Rome, as <hi>Caietanus</hi> was. Last of all wee came to the place of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in his second booke <hi>De doctrina Christiana.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">August. De Doctrina Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. lib. 2. ca. 8.</note> Which <hi>Campion</hi> and his fellowes gladly receiued, because they said, it made for them and not for vs. For, saide they, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> rehearseth those bookes for <hi>Canonicall</hi> scriptures, which you call <hi>Apocrypha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this wee answered, that they shoulde rather charge <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and other auncient fathers, who doe call them <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> And <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in that place rehearsing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the bookes of scriptures, though, said we, he differ somwhat from <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in shewe of wordes: yet hee doeth in deede agree with them. For where they deuide the bookes of the scriptures into three sorts, that is, <hi>Canonicall, Apocrypha</hi> and <hi>feigned or vntrue: Augustine</hi> deuideth them, into <hi>Canonicall</hi> and <hi>Apocrypha</hi> onely: and then he deuideth the <hi>Canonicall</hi> bookes into two sortes, that is, those that be certainely true (which we with <hi>S. Hierome</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> do call properly <hi>Canonicall)</hi> and those that haue bene doubted of, which <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome</hi> do call <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> And <hi>S. Augustine</hi> nameth those that be vtterly vntrue, <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> which <hi>Eusebius</hi> calleth doubtfull, feigned and forged. <note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 3. cap. 25. dubia, ficta, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterina.

Testes Domini.</note> And this may be gathered out of <hi>Augustine</hi> him selfe in diuers places, whereof we haue noted some. And albeit <hi>Augustine</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth those bookes <hi>Canonicall,</hi> yet he giueth not the like authoritie to them, as namely to the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and to the other of that sort, as he doeth to those that be Christes the Lords witnesses, as he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them, which be these that are named properly <hi>Canonicall.</hi> Here would they not admit in any wise, that the worde <hi>Canonicall</hi> was <hi>aequiuocum,</hi> or of diuers significations in diuers places: but that wheresoeuer that worde was founde, it brought all bookes so called vnder one kinde. Much time was spent here about, and the matter was much argued on Master <hi>Campion</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes part. At the last Master <hi>Campion</hi> was desired by vs, to reade the chapter in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Canon law, beginning <hi>In Canonicis,</hi> which <hi>Gratian</hi> takes out of this place of <hi>Augustine:</hi> and first that hee <note place="margin">Distinct. 19. cap. In Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicis.</note> would reade the rubrick, which he seemed both to do. And <hi>Pound</hi> one of his companions sitting by (who with his importunitie &amp; impertinent speaches, had often interrupted the course of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference)
<pb facs="tcp:13733:9"/>
saide, <hi>Father Campion, let them reade their places them selues.</hi> Yet at the length <hi>Master Campion</hi> read it, and it is thus. <hi>Inter Canonicas scripturas, Decretales Epistolae connu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merantur:</hi> which after much desiring he englished also. <hi>The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretall Epistles are numbred together among the Canonicall Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon one of vs saide, you charge vs with blasphemie, for naming those bookes <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> which <hi>Saint Hierome, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> and other ancient holy fathers doe so name: but here may you see most horrible blasphemie in deede, in the Canonical lawe of your <hi>Pope,</hi> which matcheth his Decretall Epistles (that is meere fables) with the Maiestie of the <hi>Canonicall Scriptures,</hi> as he doeth in this distinction, and sundry other places, whereby you may see to what point this boldnesse of making mens writings Canonicall Scriptures is come.</p>
                  <p>Then saide we to <hi>M. Campion,</hi> do you hold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Popes decrees for <hi>Canonical</hi> scriptures? as you do the bookes of Moyses and the Prophets?</p>
                  <p>He answered no: and graunted then that the worde <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> was <hi>aequinocum</hi> or of diuers significations, which before they all did so constantly denie.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon we sayde that we had some good hope of Master <hi>Campion,</hi> for that he blushed. And we sayde further that <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Caietanus</hi> in the place before alleadged, sayeth expressely that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> placed those books in the <hi>Canon</hi> of maners, but not in the <hi>Canon</hi> of doctrine, whereby he plainely declareth that the word <hi>Canonicall</hi> is <hi>aequiuocum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this he was desired to reade the text of that Chapter, and there he founde and could not denie, but that the place of <hi>Augustine</hi> was vntruely reported by <hi>Gratian,</hi> and by manifest corruption drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> altogether from the meaning of <hi>Augustine.</hi> For where S. <note place="margin">S. Augustines wordes.</note> 
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>that those Scriptures are to be taken for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, which the most or greatest part of Christian Churches so take, among the which those Churches be, which deserued to haue Apostolique Seas, and to receiue Epistles from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:</hi> these wordes of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> are chaunged, and in the <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:13733:10"/>
cleane contrary to S. <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes and meaning.</p>
                  <p>Both often before, and here specially, Master <hi>Campion</hi> and his fellowes seemed to be desirous to dispute vpon some pointes of religion, rather then to continue in this examination of his booke, which we said we woulde not at afternoone refuse, but the forenoone (qd we) is so farre spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that we must at this time make an ende. And then turning vs to the auditorie, we said: You haue heard howe Master <hi>Campion</hi> in his printed booke, hath charged vs as <hi>rasers, manglers and spoylers of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of meere desperation and distrust in our cause,</hi> as he saith. You haue heard how he would proue vs so to be, by certeine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by him in his said printed booke noted, as being the wordes of <hi>Luther</hi> and others in their bookes. You haue heard and seene proued by the bookes them selues, that there is no such thing to be founde in those places of their bookes as he hath set downe: but onely that S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> aboue a thousande yeere sithen, doubted of the authoritie of those Epistles &amp; bookes. And you haue heard, and it is vniuersally knowen, that S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi> Prologue and Epistle, wherein he noteth those bookes to <note place="margin">Hierom.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Councill, some Popish Printers haue left them out. And you haue heard, that not onely now of late, the Councill <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> hath made the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> of equal authoritie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Canonical</hi> scriptures: but also that it is set down in the B. of Romes <hi>Canon</hi> law, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his Decretal epistles are to be numbred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Canonical</hi> scriptures: &amp; so finally you see what iniurie these men do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to the holy scriptures, &amp; what blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, in matching their fables w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> scriptures, who do most vniustly charge vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those crimes.</p>
                  <p>Sherwin said, but you should haue told withall, what we haue answered to all those pointes.</p>
                  <p>We said, your answere is to be looked for, when you can bring foorth your copies which you speake of, and promised: for in any bookes by you named, &amp; extant and to be had, there is nothing of that which <hi>M.

                     <p>Whereunto we answered, that we were minded (if the time would suffer vs) to examine other partes of his booke, and lay it open to the audience there, howe that as he had most vntruly charged <hi>Luther</hi> and others, with the <hi>mangling and spoyling of the bodie of the holy Scriptures</hi> in the beginning of his booke: so had he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise most vntruly and impudently in other places slaundered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worthie men: and vpon the same his good groundes, he had charged vs all, as <hi>rasers and manglers of the holy Scriptures.</hi> And surely our opinion was, that if any thing at all, (that laying open before his face of his continuall vntrueths, which he hath so braggingly aduouched in his booke) might haue reclaimed him. For vndoubtedly he could neuer haue endured the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of those his lyes, as they were in the confutation of his booke shortly after set out, had they bene layde open before his eyes: which might manifestly appeare to all that did marke his gentle and milde behauiour and speach in the After noones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in comparison of his bragging and lewde wordes vsed in the forenoone.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding at our meeting at after noone, we sayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Master Campion,</hi> seeing your desire is so much to dispute in some matter of doctrine, we will not refuse.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Master Campion</hi> indeuoured very much to quallifie this worde <hi>indifferentèr, indifferently,</hi> and so to mollifie the <hi>Popes</hi> blasphemie if he coulde: and he confessed that there was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the <hi>Euangelistes</hi> and other writers, for that the <hi>Euangelistes</hi> and writers of the Scriptures coulde not erre in memorie or any other circumstance, but <hi>Councils</hi> might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in some such small matters of circumstance. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, sayeth he, I am bounde vnder paine of damnation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that <hi>Tobias dogge</hi> had a tayle, because it is written <hi>he wagged his tayle.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:13733:11"/>
in matters of such waight.</p>
                     <p>Why then, saith he, if this example like you not, take another. I must beleeue that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had a cloake, because hee willeth <hi>Timothie</hi> to bring his cloake.</p>
                     <p>We said these thinges were nothing to purpose, vnlesse hee could proue, that such a promise was made to the bishop of Rome and his Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cils, that whatsoeuer they should determine, was sure to be true and certaine.</p>
                     <p>They alleaged Christes saying: <hi>Hee that heareth not the</hi>

                     <p>We answered that text serued them for all purposes. But first they must proue them selues to be the true Church before that text would belong vnto them. And where they alleaged out of the 15. of the Actes, <hi>So it seemeth to the holy Ghost and vs.</hi> Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> wee knewe well enough that that Councill was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the holy Ghost, wherein the Apostles were president.

After this wee began our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation concerning iustification, both for that it is first of all other mentioned in your booke (quoth we to Master <hi>Campion:)</hi> and both <hi>Luther</hi> and we all, are most grieuously charged by you, with error therein: and also for that it is in deede a matter of the chiefest controuersie betweene vs. And first, for that you doe in your booke, vntruely charge <hi>Luther,</hi> and vs by him, with the cutting away of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> epistle, for <hi>that the wretche</hi> (as you saie of <hi>Luther)</hi>

                     <p>Then said they, we knowe right well that the scriptures doe conteine great commendations of faith, but in all these there is not this worde <hi>faith onely,</hi> which is your doctrine.</p>
                     <p>But the ancient holy fathers said wee, vpon these groundes of

the scriptures by vs alleaged, doe gather and plainly pronounce, that onely faith iustifieth, as you shall heare anone. And howe many thinges saide we, doe you your selfe teach vs as necessarie articles of religion, not hauing for you one plaine worde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but doe affirme, that in effect they are conteined in the holy scriptures. And you haue heard that iustification and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, yea, saluation and the kingdom of heauen, are attributed to faith, and that without any addition of any other thing. And you haue heard the wordes of our Sauiour: <hi>beleeue onely, only beleeue.</hi> And of <hi>Saint Paul, you are freely iustified by faith,</hi> which are in effect as much as <hi>faith onely,</hi> and to more effect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, then are your proofes of a great many of the principal pointes of your Popish religion. And where as we meane none other by faith onely, but faith without the workes of the Lawe, and without our good workes: if the former place can not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, heare what <hi>Saint Paul</hi> sayeth further. <hi>Know ye that a man is not iustified by the workes of the Lawe, but by the faith</hi>

                     <p>But the ancient doctors of the Church said we, do vpon these very places of the holy scriptures by vs alleaged, gather and in expresse wordes set downe, as we doe, that we are iustified by faith onely, as ye shall see. <hi>Saint Hillary</hi> (quoth we) sayeth thus, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his wordes out of the booke it selfe, <hi>Mouit scribas remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi>

                     <p>We shall see of the sense anon saide we: but we pray you heare the other doctors also, who doe agree with vs in the same wordes. <hi>Saint Ambrose</hi> also vpon the place by vs alleaged out of the third to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> among many other sentences hath this, <hi>Non iustificari hominem apud Deum nisi per fidem. <hi>That a man is not iustified before God but by faith.</hi>
                        </hi> And shortly after <hi>Saint Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Tam Gentiles quam Iudeos, non aliter quam credentes iustificauit.

                     <p>It is well said we, that you cannot denie but that they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with vs in wordes, and that they doe gather these wordes euen of the same scriptures, which we alleaged for onely faith to iustifie: and that therefore these wordes, <hi>we are iustified freely thorow grace by faith: faith without the law, without the works of the lawe doeth iustifie,</hi> (which are the wordes of <hi>Saint Paul)</hi> are all one with these words, <hi>faith only doeth iustifie,</hi> which was before by you denyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Master Campion</hi> said, but the trueth of the matter resteth in the sense and meaning of the Doctors.</p>
                     <p>What sense is it that you doe speake of, said we.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Master Campion</hi> answered, We do graunt that it is true that onely <hi>Faith</hi> doeth iustifie in this sense, that is, that when we be first brought into the state of grace, no good works do go before <hi>primam gratiam <hi>the first grace</hi>
                        </hi> or <hi>iustification,</hi> but that our first iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is by <hi>faith</hi> only, without any works going before: but the workes that followe the first grace and iustification (said <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Campion)</hi> doe both iustifie and merite also.</p>
                     <p>We alleaged <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> saying, <hi>Opera non praecedunt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">August. de fide &amp; operibus.</note> 
                        <hi>iustificandum, sed sequuntur iustificatum: <hi>Workes doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede a man to be iustified, but doe follow him being iustified.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That is true, said <hi>Master Campion,</hi> as I said before of the first grace and iustification: but good workes doe goe before the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb facs="tcp:13733:14"/>
iustification.</p>
                     <p>It is but a small matter (said we) to graunt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> no good works doe go before the first grace or iustification, when before the same grace there can be no good workes at all. And concerning the seconde iustification, we replyed to that, that <hi>Saint Paul</hi> speaking <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> of that iustification, and alleaging the example and saying of king Dauid therefore, sayeth expressely, <hi>that to a man that doeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him that doeth iustifie the wicked, his faith is reputed to righteousnes, according to the purpose of the grace of God. Euen as Dauid setteth downe the blessednesse of a man, vnto whome God reputeth righteousnesse without workes. Blessed are they whose wickednesse is pardoned, and whose sinnes are couered, &amp;c.</hi> Thus sayeth <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> thus sayeth the King and Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> teaching plainely that our iustification is by Gods pardoning of our euill workes, and not by the merites of <note place="margin">Psalm. 32.</note> our good workes: for he saith expressely that iustice is without our workes. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> and King <hi>Dauid</hi> were in the state of grace when they did thus write, and yet doe shew that their iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication then, as well as before, was without workes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Master Campion</hi> said, a man being in the state of grace, may write of the first grace and iustification, why not? and so did they in that place.</p>
                     <p>Yea (quoth we) but if he be set downe for an example himselfe, after that he hath obteined the first grace and continued therein, and yet sayth that God reputeth his iustification without any his workes, though he haue done many good, as Abraham first, and then Dauid are here set out for example, and as <hi>Saint Basill,</hi> as was before alleaged, setteth out <hi>Saint Paul</hi> himselfe for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <note place="margin">D. Basil. de Humilitate.</note> who doeth glorie in the contempt of his owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: it is cuident, that that iustification or righteousnesse which is before God, is without any workes of ours at all, and that all iustification of all persons, and in all times, is by the grace of God through faith onely, without any merite of our workes.</p>
                     <p>Then they alleaged <hi>Saint Iames</hi> wordes, <hi>Faith without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is dead,</hi> making thereby charitie the soule and life of faith.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto we made answere, that faith without charitie was in deede dead, and altogether vaine and vnprofitable. But <hi>Saint Iames</hi> meaning herein, was not to make charitie the principall
<pb facs="tcp:13733:14"/>
parte, or the forme of faith: but onely to shewe, that by charitie faith is approued and declared to be a true and a liuely faith, which we doe most willingly graunt. And therewith we alleaged the saying of <hi>Thomas <hi>de Aquin.</hi>
                        </hi> being a scholeman of their owne side, who saith, <hi>Deus iustificat effectiuè: fides iustificat apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuè: opera iustificant declaratiuè.</hi> That is, <hi>God doeth iustifie effectually, faith doeth iustifie apprehendingly, workes doe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie declaringly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Master Sherwin</hi> said it was <hi>Fides iustificat instrumentaliter, <hi>Faith iustifieth instrumentally.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That worde (quoth we) doeth make no alteration in sense at all. And here you may see howe <hi>Saint Paul</hi> teaching that we are iustified by faith without workes before God: and <hi>Saint Iames</hi> teaching that we are iustified by workes, that is, doe declare our selues by our workes vnto men to be iustified, do agree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Master Campion</hi> said that he could yeelde and subscribe vnto that saying of <hi>Saint Thomas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And we saide, that we woulde doe the like, for that it is the very true doctrine that we teache: howbeit he held his penne from subscribing.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Master Sherwin</hi> alleaged these wordes of <hi>Saint Paul, If</hi>

                     <p>Here saith one of the Pamphleters, silence was the answere: but howe truely, let him selfe see: for it was straight answered, <hi>Master Sherwin</hi> you may see, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaketh there of faith in working of miracles, euen by the wordes of the <hi>Apostle</hi> him selfe, who saith, <hi>If I should haue all faith, so that I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue mountaines, and haue not charitie, I am nothing.</hi> And when he cryed still <hi>omnem fidem, <hi>all faith,</hi>

                     <p>Further they obiected <hi>Saint Pauls</hi> wordes in his Epistle to the Galathians, <hi>Faith worketh by charitie.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Galat. 5.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>We answered, that vnlesse faith doe worke by charitie, it is no faith at all: but that made nothing against our iustification by faith onely. But here they reasoned against vs thus.</p>
                     <p>If faith onely iustifie, then it iustifieth without charitie: But that was contrary to the text of the Apostles: Therefore onely faith doeth not iustifie.</p>
                     <p>We answered, this <hi>Syllogisme</hi> consisteth of foure termes. For it is one thing to say that faith onely doeth iustifie, and another, that faith is not without charitie. For when we say that onely faith iustifieth, we meane not to denie that charitie is ioyned with that faith which iustifieth, being inseparably vnited vnto it: but that onely faith and not charitie is the meanes, by which we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Iesus Christ our iustification and righteousnesse. And this we indeuoured to make manifest by an example. The fire (quoth we) hath heate and light, which qualities can not bee seuered in that subiect, yet the fire burneth by heate onely, and not by light. Nowe if any will reason thus: If the heate of the fire onely burne, then it burneth without the light of the fire: but that it can not doe: Therefore it burneth not by heate only. They should shewe them selues to be absurd that so woulde reason, sayd we. And such is your reason against the iustification of faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because it can not be separated from charitie. Likewise though the parts of mans bodie be ioyned together, and one is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out another in a perfect bodie, yet doeth the eye onely see, and the eare heare onely, and euery part hath his distinct office.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Master Sherwin</hi> alleaged out of the Epistle to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians: <hi>Ipsius sumus factura, creati in Christo Iesu in bonis ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus.</hi>

                        <hi>ad opera bona: vnto good workes,</hi> and so answered, that <hi>Saint Paul</hi> saith not, we are the creatures of God in Christ thorowe good workes, but that we are created of God in Christ to do good workes: which <hi>Master Sherwin</hi> (looking vpon the greeke Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament) coulde not denie.

<pb facs="tcp:13733:15"/>
if he tooke that place in that sense, that we were created in good workes, he was contrary to <hi>Master Campion,</hi> who graunted that good workes doe come after the first grace, and not to be ioyned with our first creation in Christ Iesus, as <hi>Master Sherwin</hi> would haue it. And besides that we did admonish him, that the place by him alleaged, did of all others most effectually make against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and for vs. For immediatly before the wordes by him alleadged, Saint Paul sayth thus: <hi>Gratia enim estis saluati per fidem, &amp; hoc</hi>

                        <hi>He that is righteous, let him be more and more righteous.</hi> And thereupon he sayde, he would not refuse to subscribe, that we be iustified by faith onely, so that we would subscribe, that being so iustified, we ought afterward to walke forward more and more in the workes of righteousnesse.</p>
                     <p>We graunted that we would so subscribe.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>M. Sherwine</hi> said vnto <hi>M. Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion,</hi> Take heed what you do.</p>

                     <p>Doe you nowe come in with your merite, (sayde we?) we will none of it, neyther will acknowledge any merite (quoth we) in respect of our iustification, or of the kingdome of heauen, but only the merites of Christs passion.

And hee himselfe by his lowde speaches, and bolde and busie gestures, shewed no token of any either sicknesse or weaknesse: neither did him selfe then complaine vpon those difficulties, which the Pamphleters hath so diligently &amp; largely noted sithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p>They do charge some of vs and specially one with <hi>vncourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wordes, and vncomely for professors of the Gospell</hi> (as they saye) <hi>spoken to Master Campion and others.</hi> But they shewe not vpon what occasion by Master Campion and others of his companions offred, these wordes were spoken. For when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Campion did rise vp from the forme whereon he fate: did cast vp and fling with his handes and armes: did knocke and beate vpon his booke at euery other worde, with an exceeding lowde voyce and sharpe countenance, affirming that all our printed bookes were false, and that he would procure true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies to be sent from the Emperours Maiestie, &amp; from the Duke
<pb facs="tcp:13733:19"/>
of Bauaria, and from another prince (whom we remember not) vnto the Queenes Maiestie: was it I pray you so outragious in the Latine tongue, as seuerally to admonish Master Campion him selfe, without the vnderstanding of the common auditorie, for one of vs to say, <hi>Qui hic mos est mi homo? Quis hic gestus? Et loqueris &amp; pultas fores? Gloriosus miles. Proijcis ampullas, &amp; ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipedalia verba?</hi> We may bee bolde to saye, that considering Master Campions bragging in English, and the admonition of the other in Latine, there was no such outrage as they doe note. But this they much disdaine, that he sayde once, <hi>Os impudens.</hi> Truth it is, but vpon his often and fierce affirmation that all the printed bookes of Luther in Englande were false: and vpon <hi>Poundes</hi> odious interpellations <hi>(as, we knowe you to be a good Terence man)</hi> and his most scornefull lookes through his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, staring vpon him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually whiles he was reasoning with Master Campion, to put him out of his memorie: hee being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended both with Poundes mockings, wordes and lookes, and with Campions shameles sayings, brake out with <hi>Os impudens,</hi> as he thinketh, most deseruedly on their partes.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but he vsed the word <hi>obgannire,</hi> or <hi>oggannire.</hi> Hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth not, but comming by commandement to conferre with Campion onely, when two or three of them spake together, and many other of them muttered, and sometime brake out into scornefull laughter, he sayd, <hi>Siccine tam multos oggannire &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strepere?</hi> This is the rage and railing wherewith the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do charge him.</p>
                     <p>They say that he by a Commissioners checke, put the priests that would haue spoken, and Master Sherwin to silence. The trueth is, that though we were sent onely to Master Campion at that time, yet others did speake sometime, and Master Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win specially very much, &amp; almost as much as did Master Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion. Whereupon not we, but Master Lieutenant told him, that he should be dealt with another time, and willed him then to quiet himselfe.

And refusing there to reade (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Beale and the rest, were flatly then persuaded it was for lacke of skill) in the ende it fell out that Saint Basill was offered him in Greeke, and the booke holden him by a minister, wherein he read skilfully, and by the hearing of all the auditorie confessed

                        <hi>Another of them reporteth the matter thus.</hi> It happened in processe of their disputations, by occasion incident there was talke of a text of Scripture (which forsoth must bee viewed by Master Campion) &amp; to make the matter most plausible (as the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts imagined) they caused a Greeke testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be brought vnto him, which he refused to take, saying merily to his contrarie, it shalbe yours. At which doing many laughed, condemning him for ignorance of the tongue, and therefore gestingly by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants it was said, <hi>Graecum est non potest legi. <hi>It is Greeke, perhaps it cannot be read.</hi>
                        </hi> Whereunto Master Campion gaue no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere but rested at the matter, as a man vnable to reade Greeke, or to vnderstand the same. But it chaunced not long after, that the Protestantes as they had prepared before, were to alleage a place out of Saint Basil the Greeke doctor: and againe thinking to giue the Catholikes another bob, they commanded againe the booke of that ancient father to be giuen to Master Campion that he might reade, whome before they derided as not able to doe the same. But he tooke the booke, and hauing one of their ministers at his elbowe, both read and gaue the sense of the writer, and bad him beare witnes that hee was able to reade and vnderstande Greeke: whereat there was some admiration made among the Protestantes. and he was demanded why hee did not so before? who mildely answered, that the print was ouer small. Why saide they, had you not declared so much before? that had bene sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The like triall they made of an other Catholike, to wit Maister Sherwin, who by report of his fellowes and companions, is very well seene in the Greeke and Hebrewe tongues: yet hee tooke the booke and viewed it, but openly did not reade, which was imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that he did to be accounted ignorant in the tongue, or rather for that he was willed to holde his peace, for that there should bee other times to talke. <hi>Thus they write of this matter, farre more largely and earnestly, then of any other. But the truthe is, that</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13733:20"/>
when we had read the sentences out of the Greeke Testament and Doctors once or twise our selues, wee offered the Greeke Testament first, and afterwardes Nazianzene in Greeke to <note place="margin">Both Basill &amp; Nazianzen were offred, but it was Nazianzen &amp; not Basill as they report.</note> Campion to reade, that he might credit his owne eyes, and that we alleaged their wordes truely. But he refused to reade in the Greeke testament altogether, as them selues do here confesse. And when Saint Basill and Nazianzen in Greeke were offered to him to reade, he said once or twise, <hi>I knowe, I knowe, it is as ye haue alleaged:</hi> which we tooke to be a shift, to auoyde the reading of it him selfe. But when he was vrged, &amp; Master Stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard who stood by, tooke the booke and held it to him, he read, but so softly as it were to him selfe, that wee may with good conscience protest before God, that we heard not one word: so farre off was it that he read skilfully, &amp; in the hearing of all the auditorie, as they doe write. But surely, whosoeuer did knowe Campions vayne, may thinke that hee would haue read in the hearing of al the auditorie in deede, had he had any knowledge in that tongue: and not so haue whispered to him selfe, or in Master Stollardes eare. Truthe it is, that he saide, <hi>Let this man witnes whether I can reade Greeke or no.</hi> But why did hee not reade so, that not he alone, but that all we might haue bene wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses thereof?</p>
                     <p>But saye they, Master Stollard said, hee read very well. They onely heard him so saye belike: for of truth he said to vs, <hi>If he did reade at all, he read the worst that euer I heard,</hi> which some of vs thought that Master Stollard spake, for that wee hauing read those fewe wordes of Nazianzen, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> once or twise before the booke was giuen Campion, he might seeme out of his memorie to haue repeated them, rather then to haue read them out of the booke. Nowe, that we should be in any admiration hereat as they write, what cause was there? For that we should aske him why he did not so much before, who heard him then not reade one word: or that the Deane of Pauls confounded should say, <hi>We confesse you can reade Greeke:</hi> or that there was any cause giuen why we should blush or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, are most impudent lies, and most meete for such repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Nay, rather may all Papistes blush for Campions sake, who making such a chalenge, as though he had had all knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:13733:21"/>
in all learning and languages, when it came to the triall, vpon conscience of his ignorance, durst not reade openly one short sentence in Saint Basill or Nazianzen, the bookes being of a large and faire print. Surely wee before our comming thither, vpon Campions owne bragging challenge and booke, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens reportes of him, thought wee should haue bene sore incumbred by his learning, and ouermatched by his knowledge in the tongues: so farre off was it, that wee meant to make any ostentation therein towardes him (as they write:) but vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and triall with him, we found him not to be that man that we looked for, and went away with that opinion, that the booke which was so sodainely after his bragging chalenge, put in print, was none of his writing, much lesse penned by him as he was in his iourney, as he reported him selfe: but that it was elaborate before, by the common and long studie of all the best learned Iesuites, to serue at all oportunities. To the same effect is the report of Sherwin, who looking vpon the Greeke Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reading neuer a worde, goeth yet away thereby, not onely with the commendation of a man very well seene in the Greeke and Hebrew tongues: but also of singular modestie and contempt of all praises, as seeking to be accounted igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in that, wherein he had great skill. For that they would haue the cause of his not reading to be, for that he was willed to hold his peace, is very ridiculous: for he did oft speake, after he was so willed to holde him selfe contented: and then he was specially desired to reade, and not to holde his peace. But we thought the truthe to be, that when Sherwin had alleaged out of the second to the Ephesians after the olde translation, <hi>Creati in bonis operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> we were created in good workes: and the originall Greeke being shewed vnto him, when he found it to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>ad bona opera,</hi> created to do good workes: he looked in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and in the ende of the Greeke Testament, trusting as wee thought, that if he might haue found, that it had bene printed in any place, where the Gospel is preached, hee might after Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, haue made a challenge to the print as false, (which is now become a speciall shift of the Papistes, and the last refuge when all other do faile) but when he did see that it was Plantines print, hee held his peace. Notwithstanding we do not thinke,
<pb facs="tcp:13733:21"/>
but that Sherwin could reade Greeke, the ignorance wherof we neither obiected to any, nor did make any ostentation (as they write) of any our knowledge therein. Only we offered the bookes them selues vnto Campion, that his owne eyes might bee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that the auncient fathers both Greekes and Latines did teache iustification by faith alone, euen as we do. By which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, God as wee thinke by the opening of his ignorance, meant to controll his vaine glorious bragging of all knowledge and habilitie to deale with all men. Thus much, and to much of this matter, were it not that the reader may hereby vnderstand, what vantages these writers and reporters doe take vnto them selues: yea and by speedy and continuall spreading and beating of the same into the eares and heads of many, do much preuaile also, vntill time the mother of truthe, shall discouer their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes.</p>
                     <p>But we may by no meanes dissemble another matter, by these Pamphleters sore laide to our charge. Saint Augustine in the fourtenth chapter of his booke <hi>De fide &amp; operibus,</hi> was by some of them in our conference (as we thinke) alleaged, as against our doctrine of iustification by faith alone: but in that confusion of many speaking at once, it was not greatly by any of vs marked or said vnto, that we remember. But the authors of the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets do report this place of Saint Augustine, as by them of al other most effectually alleaged against vs. Their words be these. <hi>Unto this was added by the Catholikes the authoritie of Saint</hi> Augustine <hi>out of his booke De fide &amp; operibus and the fourtenth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">August. De fide &amp; operibus.</note> 
                        <hi>chapter, where he hath registred that this doctrine of</hi> Iustification by faith onely, <hi>was an heresie taught in the Apostles time: for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation whereof he declareth that Saint</hi> Iohn, <hi>Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>S.</hi> Iude, <hi>and Saint</hi> Iames, <hi>did write their Epistles, wherein they so much inculcate the doctrine of good workes.</hi> Thus they write, thus they whisper in euery eare open vnto them, to the slander of vs and our doctrine of iustification by faith onely, as not onely an errour, but an heresy also. But wee doe pray all indifferent readers, to consider of these maner of dealings. For Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine in that place writeth against the wicked opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those, who mistaking Saint Paules wordes of Iustification by sayth without workes, do by an euill securitie neglect to liue well, not
<pb facs="tcp:13733:22"/>
seeking by true faith the helpe of God, to the ouercomming of their owne euill concupiscences, but doe despise the workes of righteousnes, &amp; by a dead faith do promise to them selues euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life. These be Saint Augustines expresse wordes in that place truely translated, which they haue most vntruely and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiously alleaged against vs, &amp; against the heresie (as they terme it) of iustification by faith onely: which they woulde haue the simple people to mistake, as though wee woulde exclude all things vniuersally sauing faith onely: and did vtterly cast away all care of good workes, &amp; godly life, yea, and all desire of Gods grace to assiste vs, as did they against whom S. Augustine in that place did write. But we protest before God and all good men, that we neuer meant to make faith the chiefe and onely cause of our iustification, but that the grace and mercie of God by our sauiour Iesus Christ promised to the faithfull in his holy worde, is the principall and originall cause, and very fountaine of our iustification: and that faith, not a dead faith (as they thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whome S. Augustine doth write) but a liuely faith (being wrought in our hearts by the said word of God, and by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the holy ghost) beleeuing Gods promise of his mercy in Christ, is the instrumentall cause in vs, whereby onely wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our iustification, without the merite of our workes: and yet being iustified, we are most bounde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to walke in all good works, as much as it shall please God to giue vs grace thereunto, for the which we ought to sue by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall &amp; most heartie prayer. Which our doctrine, you may see to bee most contrarie to the wicked opinion of those, against whom S. Augustine writeth in that place, and that therefore it is most falsely and malitiously alleaged as against vs, who by faith onely iustifying vs, meane not to exclude the doing, but the merites of our good workes, which is no heresie, wherewith these men would charge vs, but the very truthe it selfe taught in the holy Scriptures, and by the auncient godly fathers and learned doctors set down in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same wordes which we do vse, as hath bene before at large declared.</p>
                     <p>Of the conclusion of our conference the Pamphleters write thus. <hi>At the last, the Protestantes did make a doe, as though some thing had bene wonne, when in my soule I protest there was not,
<pb facs="tcp:13733:22"/>
but in any indifferent audience the aduerse Protestants had bene quite confounded. For</hi> Master Campion <hi>and</hi> Sherwin <hi>too, would haue sayde much more in defence of their cause, but one of them by his Commissioners authoritie suddenly made an ende, cutting them off from all further speache.</hi> Thus they do write. In deede when we had continued very long, and the sunne shining vpon our faces in at the South windowes, and the throng being very greate, and by occasion of both, the heate so intollerable, that some of vs were fayne to go out of the chauncel to take breath, and to returne againe: and Master Campion and wee being nowe come to a very neare point of agreement in the question of iustification, (as is afore noted in the end of our conference) we turning to Master Lieutenaunt, sayde, If it shall so please you, let vs here make an ende. With a good will sayd he: and so we brake off. And here is all the Commissioners authoritie, which they speake of, that wee or any of vs did take vpon vs. And thus ended our conference with Campion: the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the trueth of their or our reportes whereof, wee doe leaue vnto God, and to those who were present thereat. Surely we by our notes set downe, whiles our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference was yet fresh in memorie, and by sundry conferences amongst our selues sithen, and with other also, who were there present, yea and by diligent perusing of the pamphlets written against vs, haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to set downe all poyntes that were dealt with, in our sayd conference, with as much trueth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the substance of the matter, as our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and memory, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of other also, could possibly attayne vnto.</p>

                     <p>I meane to be visible, is to knowe one another, to meete at Sacraments, when I can tell that I am of this church, and you of that, I a Catholike, and you a Protestant, as I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely know there is a Church in Fraunce, a church in Spaine, and in Flaunders, though I be farre from it, and we may knowe <note place="margin">Here was much a do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout writing, &amp; yet I neuer knewe any thing imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that might preiudice him</note> one another: a member can say, This is my pastor, these are my prelates and gouernours.

                     <p>If we haue this discoursing, we shal neuer haue done: I would you would be briefe. I will prooue from a place of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the church militant (vnderstanding visible as you say) is not alwayes visible in earth. <hi>Elias</hi> complaineth, that he was left <note place="margin">1.

                     <speaker>Campion.</speaker>
                     <p>I deny the Antecedent, &amp; further declare the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the place, which maketh altogether for me. For <hi>Elias</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out the schismatical church of the <hi>Samaritanes.</hi> In this schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall church, a member being driuen out, (as sometime it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out to be) the worlde turning and changing, he might not know the rest: but yet knew there were 7000. that neuer bowed their knees to Baal. Agayne, you must not bring a particular to ouerthrowe a generall. There were none there: therefore there were none in other places. But this place is an excellent place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you. For as the Prophet complained there, so we may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complaine now, <hi>O Lord they haue forsaken thy couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they haue destroyed thine altars, and slayne thy prophetes with the sword, and I am left alone &amp;c.</hi> Yet no doubt, there were many: as for example, I might haue complayned of <hi>Geneua,</hi> when I was there, that I had bene alone, not knowing of any other Catholike there. Were all the Protestants in England in Queene Maries time gone? were there none? and are all Catholikes nowe gone? Whatsoeuer they bee, I knowe certainely there is a Church in Fraunce &amp;c. And so then there was a florishing church in <hi>Iudea,</hi>

                     <p>His flight was into the wildernes, &amp; <hi>Beersheba</hi> was in his way, where he left his seruant, &amp; so went forward into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes.

                     <p>But his complaynt was of a particular place, for the Church florished in <hi>Iudea</hi> vnder two notable kinges, <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Iehosaphat.</hi> And when he sayeth, <hi>Ego solus,</hi> he meaneth that hee was the onely prophet that was left &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>This answere cannot stand with the oracle, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth that God had left 7000. true worshippers. Wherefore it is manifest, that <hi>Elias</hi> thought himselfe the onely true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that was left in Israel, except you will say there were 7000. prophets, whereof he was ignorant. But ye answere y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the church was then so visible, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knew whither to resort.

It is written 2. king. 16. that vnder y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> raigne of <hi>Achas,</hi> there was taken a paterne of the Altar of the idolaters of <hi>Damascus,</hi> &amp; that <hi>Vrias</hi> the high Priest remoued the Altar of the Lord.

                        </note> the altar was remoued, and the sacrifices vtterly ceased, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>That might well bee. For there might be such a time, and the case might so fall out, that there could be no exercise of the priestly function, &amp; yet it might remaine visible ynough, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>How could that be? when there was no outward forme of a Church, it fayled in the head, in the chiefe, &amp; in the members. There was no place for their publike sacrifices, seeing that only place, to which they were bounde to resort, was defiled with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish idolatrie. For it must be there and no where else. And I doubt not but there were particular members, that were knowen to God, or might knowe one another: yet was there not a visible Church, as you determine of the worde visible, to be, when men know their pastors &amp; prelates, and the place whither to resort, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I thinke any here might proue the Antecedent: the storie of that time sheweth it plaine. The face of the visible Church was then not in <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; his Apostles, but in the Iewes amongst the Scribes and Pharisees: they had the succession of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode and held the chaires. <hi>Christ</hi> was crucified, put to death and buried, the Apostles scattered and fled into holes and corners, so that if visibilitie be such a certaine marke of the true Church, then the high Priestes, Scribes and Pharises, were the true Church, and not our Sauiour Christ and his Apostles.</p>

                     <speaker>Goade.</speaker>
                     <p>The question is not whether they remained, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were seen. But you said of those Emperours times, that there remained many, and they were not vnknowen.

                     <p>Then I must proue both distinctly, and first touching the faithles. The faithles could not knowe the Church: therefore they did not knowe it.</p>

                     <p>I tolde you they did not knowe him as they ought to know him, to saluation. They knewe, but not fruitfully and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.

                     <p>But though the persons were knowen, yet they knewe them not to be of the Church. I will come to the other part of the antecedent.</p>
                     <p>As is the whole so are the partes:</p>
                     <p>But God onely knoweth the whole:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo</hi> he onely knoweth the partes. For the members of Christ are knowen to Christ alone. By reason of many hypocrites, men are not able to iudge who are truely faithfull. There are many wolues within, and many sheepe without: <hi>Deus nouit qui sunt sui, <hi>2. Tim. 2.

                     <p>Christ hath no dead members of his body: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reprobate can not bee of the Church. I will helpe you with a distinction. They may be in the Church, but not of the Church.</p>

                        </hi> in respect of faith, but not in respect of charitie.

Sicut enim verus Iudeus est Christianus dicente Apostolo, non qui in manifesto, sed qui in occulto: sic vera Iudea, Christianitas est, cuius nomen intelligitur confessio. Montes autem sunt scripturae Apostolorum aut Prophetarum, de quibus dictum est:
<pb facs="tcp:13733:31"/>
Illuminas tu mirabiliter a montibus aeternis. Et iterum de ecclesia dicit: fundamenta eius in montibus sanctis. Et quare iubet in hoc tempore omnes Christianos conferre se ad Scripturas? Quia in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore hoc, ex quo obtinuit haeresis illas Ecclesias, nulla probatio potest esse verae Christianitatis, neque effugium potest esse Christianorum aliud volentium cognoscere fidei veritatem, nisi Scripturae diuinae. Antea enim multis modis ostendebatur, quae esset Ecclesia Christi, &amp; quae gentilitas: nunc autem nullo modo cognoscitur volentibus cognoscere quae sit vera Ecclesia Christi, nisi tantummodò per scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turas, &amp;c.</hi> Then when you shall see the abomination of deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation standing in that holy place, that is, when you shall see an vngodly heresie, which is the army of Antichrist, standing in the holy places of the Church: in that time, they which are in Iury, let them flie to the mountaines, that is, they that are in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, let them get them to the Scriptures. For as the true Iewe is a Christian (as the Apostle sayeth) not which is in open sight, but which is in secrete: so true Iurie (whose name is vnderstood to be confession) is Christianitie. And the mountaines are the Scripture of the Apostles and Prophets: of whome it is sayde, Thou doest giue light marueilously from the euerlasting mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. And againe he sayeth of the Church, Her foundations are in the holy hilles. And wherefore doeth he commaunde all Christians in this time, to get them to the Scriptures? Because in this time, since heresie hath obtained those Churches, there can be no tryall of true Christianitie, neyther can there be any other escape of Christians, which woulde knowe the trueth of the faith, but the Diuine Scriptures. For before times, it was shewed by many wayes which was the Church of Christ, and which was gentilitie: but nowe to them that woulde knowe which is the true Church of Christ, it is knowen by none other meanes, but onely by the Scriptures. <hi>This is playne for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent.

                     <p>All other markes in time of heresie or schisme, by <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> iudgement are excluded, but onely the Scriptures:</p>

                     <p>This answere is a senseles cauil, which is easily auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

                     <p>If it please you, though it be commonly alleaged, yet it is allegoricall. There are many stronger places, and you were best take a more pregnant place, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Out of the circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the place and conclusion, it is manifest, that it is properly spoken of the Apostles doctrine and life, and not of the whole Church. Consider the wordes. <hi>Vos estis sal terrae, You are the salt of the earth. Vos estis lux mundi, &amp;c. You are the light of the worlde. Non potest ciuitas abscondi, &amp;c. A citie can not be hid.</hi> Then the conclusion: <hi>Sic luceat lux ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra, So let your light shine, &amp;c.

                     <p>You haue very well answered your selfe: For the text conteineth both. There is the salt and the earth: the light and the world: who must season, and who must be seasoned: who must shine, and to whom they must shine. Do you not see plainely, that he includeth both the teachers, and them that are taught? &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Nowe you fall to discoursing cleane besides the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. It is true that the one can not be without the other, but yet it is playne, that to season, to lighten, and to be set as vpon an hill, is proper alone to the Apostles and their ministerie. For the drift and scope of the place, is onely to set forth the Apostles doctrine &amp; conuersation, and you violently wrest it to the whole Church. The life of the ministerie, is as it were set vpon an high stage, the light of their conuersation is looked vnto of all: what is this to the <note place="margin">Absurditie: er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go preceptes giuen to the M. his calling are giuen to the familie.</note> visibilitie of the whole Church?</p>

                     <p>I pray you howe holdeth this argument? The life and doctrine of the ministerie is as it were set vpon a stage for all men to looke vnto, and therefore they are called the salte of the earth, the light of the worlde: <hi>Ergo</hi> the whole Church is visible.

You that are in prison, what Church can you tell, if you bee offended? will you say the remedy is vayne, because you can not vse it? Againe, there are meane remedies before a man come to this, that he should tell the Church: hee must first giue priuate admonition, and before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, which euery man can not do that is offended. As to whom shoulde <hi>Elias</hi> haue complayned, when hee knewe none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? Therefore it is no more necessary, that there should be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church alwayes to complayne vnto: then it is necessary that euery man should alwayes bee able to admonish priuately, or to haue two or three witnesses to call vnto him. Againe, you aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere your selfe, that there may be some cases wherein I can not tell where the Church is, to tell it. Therefore it was very yll concluded of you, that if a man can not alwayes haue a visible Church to make his complaynt vnto, the remedie prescribed by our Sauiour Christ is vayne or idle. And concerning the name <hi>Ecclesia</hi> in that text, when it is sayde we should tell the Church, ye abuse the audience: for it meaneth not the whole Church, but
<pb facs="tcp:13733:35"/>
the consistorie and eldershippe, that haue the gouernement of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular congregation.

You haue graunted many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities this daye, while you labour to defende that the Church on earth is alwayes visible.

                     <p>That which hee sawe of Christ, was experimentall knowledge: but that which he confessed, Christ to be the sonne of God, was of faith, and not of sense.

That which <hi>Peter</hi> sawe of Christ with his bodily eyes, was seene of many vnbeleeuing Iewes, and of <hi>Iudas</hi> the traytor: but his confession (which came of faith) he had not by bodily sight, but by diuine reuelation. It is not of faith, to see men which are the members of the Church, but to see them as they are members of the Church, that is of faith: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is seene of the Church is not of faith.</p>

                        <p>Marke here his absurdities. First he holdeth, that he can keepe the lawe in such perfection as God requireth: and he <note place="margin">Campions absurdities.</note> can loue God with all his heart, with all his soule, and with all his strength, and his neighbour as himselfe. Secondly, he affirmeth that though he haue a lust to steale, yet if he bridle that lust, hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his neighbour as himselfe. Thirdly, he holdeth that we are iustified by inherent righteousnes, which he thinketh to colour by the grace and gift of God. But neuerthelesse, ye are in the case of the Pharisee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. which trusteth in his owne righteousnes, &amp; yet ascribeth all to the grace of God, saying, <hi>I thanke thee, &amp;c.</hi> He boasted not before men, but humbly gaue thankes vnto God, acknowledging his righteousnes to be Gods gift, and yet Christ tolde this parable against him and such as he is, which trust in themselues that they are righteous, that is, by iustice inherent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they confesse they haue it by the grace and gift of God.</p>

                        <p>But this was of pride that he gloryed in his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, and therefore the parable is told against himselfe.</p>

                        <p>I graunt that he was proude, and so are all iusticiaries that trust in themselues that they are righteous, howsoeuer they would cloke their pride, by ascribing it to the gift of God: but he is condemned for trusting in himselfe that he was righteous, that is, for inherent righteousnes, which neuerthelesse he ascribed not to his owne strength, but to the grace of God, saying, I thanke thee God, &amp;c.

I say therefore, there are two wayes of iustification: one in vs, another without vs. Christ is a cause of iustification by his grace and merite without vs, and so we are iustified by baptisme: and we are iustified by the giftes of God in vs, faith, hope, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. how say you, were not these my words: And why then do you challenge me for saying we are iustified by Gods righteousnesse,
<pb facs="tcp:13733:41"/>

And albeit hope and charitie follow that same faith, (by which we are iustified) in the regenerate that are the children of God: yet we are not iustified by them, no nor by faith, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then instrumentally, as by apprehending the righteousnesse of Christ, which is without vs, and is no otherwise ours then by imputation.

                        <p>It is not left free, but an expresse commaundement, and therefore necessary. It is the Imperatiue mode, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a commaundement. I maruayle howe you can stande in this being so plaine?</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13733:43"/>
then he must eate, and not onely eate, but he must drinke also. For as the institution is of eating and drinking, so is the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apostle drawen from the institution. And if there be no commandement, then is no man bounde to receiue the Lordes supper.</p>

                        <p>Not so. But I will proue that <hi>Innocentius</hi> Bishop of Rome, and all the Church with him, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> confesseth, held this error, that it is necessary for infantes to receiue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which you your selfe holde to be an error, seeing you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it is not of necessitie by Christes commandement, that any lay men should receiue it. You shal heare the wordes of <hi>Augustine</hi> and of <hi>Innocentius</hi> both, as <hi>Augustine</hi> citeth them. Why are you afraide of the place before you come at it, let me reade it. Saint <note place="margin">Here Campio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> interrupted him, saying, there was no such place &amp; made much a doe.</note> Augustine citeth the wordes of <hi>Innocentius,</hi> out of his Epistle to the Bishops of <hi>Numidia, <hi>Lib. 2. ad Bonifacium contra duas epist. Pelag. cap. 4. Haec enim eius verba sunt. Illud vero quod eos vestra fraternitas asserit praedicare, paruulos aeternae vitae praemijs etiam sine baptismatis gratia posse donari, perfatuum est. Nisi enim manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerint carnem filij hominis, &amp; biberint sanguinem eius, non habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt vitam in semetipsis: qui autem hanc eis sine regeneratione de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendunt, videntur mihi ipsum baptismum velle cassare. For these are his wordes. But where as your brotherhoode affirmeth them to preach, that litle children may be rewarded with the gift of eternall life, euen without the grace of Baptisme, it is a very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish thing. For except they shall eat the flesh of the sonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and drinke his blood, they shall haue no life in them selues. But they which defende this vnto them without regeneration, seeme to me that they wil make frustrate baptisme it selfe.</hi>

                           </hi> In these wordes Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth the generall practise of the Church was, that infantes should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, because it was thought necessary vnto saluation.</p>

                        <p>This was the second. Of the forme of prayer after the Councill, which is this: <hi>Te in nostris principijs &amp;c. vt errori indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geas, &amp;c. <hi>We beseech thee in these our beginnings &amp;c. that thou wilt pardon our errour.</hi>

                        <p>Where you inferre, that the Councill asked forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their erronious decree: they meant not any errour of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but of wordes whatsoeuer had bene spoken against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, before the determination of the Councill: as, many wordes might be before vsed, which after the Councils determination it was not lawfull to vse.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Fulke.</speaker>
                        <p>They feare least ignorance might haue drawen them into error, or headlong Will driuen them to decline from Iustice: &amp; therefore they desired pardon, euen for their erronious &amp; vniust determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s if any were: which were needeles, if none could be.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

And so we haue knowen that many of the holy fathers haue thought, among whome is Basill, surnamed the great, and blessed Athanasius and Methodius, and them that stande with them. Onely God is without body and shape: but the intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures are not altogether bodiles, and they are such as may be portraicted in picture. Wherefore they are in place also, and haue a circumscription although they be not bodily as we are, as of the foure elementes, and that grosse matter. Yet no man may say that Angels, or deuils, or soules are without bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for they haue bene often seene in their proper bodies: but of them, to whome the Lord hath opened their eyes. Therefore we do paint and worship them, not as God, but as intelligible creatures and the ministers of God, but yet not as truely being without body. But that they are painted in the shape of man, the cause is, that they haue bene seen in that shape, if at any time they did execute the ministerie of God amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Tharasius the most holy Patriarch saide, Let vs marke the saying of the father: that there, the Samaritans did ouerthrowe the images of our Lord and sauiour, and also of his vndefiled mother: but here, the Gentiles. The father also sheweth, that wee ought to paint the Angels, seeing they may be circumscribed, and haue appeared as men. The holy Synode said, Yea my Lord.</p>

                           <hi>It appeareth it was generall, and solemnely gathered in the chiefe citie: heare the wordes in the title of the Councill.

Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any Image nor likenes of any thing. &amp;c. and Deut. 4.

                        <p>So it appeareth that these two Councils were contrary, and
<pb facs="tcp:13733:54"/>
therefore one of them did erre. But I will proceede to the next place. You doubted also, whether it were to be founde in Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> that there is no <hi>Miracle</hi> in the Sacrament. Now you may heare his owne wordes. <hi>To. 3. De Trinitate lib. 3. cap. 10. Sicut panis ad hoc factus in accipiendo Sacramento consumitur. Sed quia haec hominibus nota sunt quia per homines fiunt, honorem tanquam religiosa possunt habere, stuporem tanquam mira non possunt. <hi>As the bread ordained for this purpose, is consumed in receauing the Sacrament. But because these things are knowen vnto men, &amp; are done by men, they may haue honour or reuerence as holy things, but they can not be wondered at as things strange and miraculous.</hi>
                           </hi> Here you haue <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes against miracle in the Sacrament.</p>

                        <p>I will propounde an other argument. You say that Christ is present in the Sacrament substantially, very God and man in his naturall body, which I improue thus.</p>
                        <p>Looke howe Christ was present to the Fathers in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">2. Argument.</note> in <hi>Manna,</hi> and in the rocke, euen so he is present to vs in our Sacrament:</p>
                        <p>But he was not present to them in their Sacrament in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie:</p>
                        <p>Therefore he is not in his naturall body present in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

                        <p>I prooue it out of the plaine wordes of the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Et omnes eandem escam, &amp;c.</hi> speaking of our fathers the Israelites, he saith, <hi>And did al eate the same spiritual meate, and did all drinke the same spirituall drinke, for they dranke of the spirituall rocke that followed them, &amp; the rocke was Christ.</hi>

                        <p>They receiued the same that we do touching the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: you can not so anoyde the force of this place. Spiritual is added in respect of the corporal signes, which differ betwene them and vs, as shall after appeare, but the same spirituall substance in both, as the circumstance of that place enforceth.</p>

                        <p>Why, Christ had yet receyued no substance of fleshe, and therefore could not then bee present to them substantially in his naturall body.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Goade.</speaker>
                        <p>You reason well for mee. Therefore he was present vnto them spiritually, as the wordes are, <hi>eandem escam spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:13733:56"/>
And so he is to vs present, and not carnally, because Christ had not then taken flesh, and the Fathers did then eate Christ in substance as well as we, therefore the presence and eating in both must needes be spirituall.</p>

                        <p>This is no answere. I will easily take it away both by the wordes following in the text, and also by the manifest cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the place, both which proueth to be clerely the same in substance. They had the same Christ, who is the substance of our Sacraments: <hi>ergo</hi> the same substance that we haue.</p>

                        <p>The words folowing are plaine to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles meaning: <hi>Et omnes eundem potum biberunt, &amp;c. Petra autem erat Christus. <hi>They did all drinke the same spirituall drinke, for they drunke of the spirituall rocke that followed them, which rocke was Christ:</hi>
                           </hi> Therefore they eating and drinking the same Christ, did eate and drinke the same substance.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Campion.</speaker>
                        <p>There is a fallacion in the worde, <hi>eandem, <hi>the same.</hi>
                           </hi> In a mistery and in signification the same, but in substance, great difference.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Goade.</speaker>
                        <p>The difference was onely in the outward signes, the measure of reuelation, and in time, they beleeuing on Christ to come, and we in Christ that is come: but in matter and substance the very same. And that the Apostles meaning must needes be so, I will nowe manifestly proue out of the circumstance of this text, and out of the Apostles owne argument. His purpose is to proue that the Israelites were nothing inferior to the Corinthians, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the seales or Sacramentes of Gods fauour: and therefore the Corinthians had no more to boaste in, touching their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes then the Israelites had. Whereupon he sayeth they did eate the same meate &amp;c. <hi>ergo</hi> they were equall. Nowe if they eate not the same in substance, which the Corinthians did eate, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in shadow &amp; figure (as you say) then the Israelites were much inferior to the Corinthians in their sacramentes, and so ye would make the Apostles argument of no force.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Campion.</speaker>
                        <p>The Apostles meaning is, that the old Israelites
<pb facs="tcp:13733:56"/>
beleeued in the same Christ, and did eate him after a sort, as wee doe: they were not altogether equall, for he speaketh a litle before of Baptisme, saying, that they were baptized in the cloude, this was not the same with our baptisme.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Goade.</speaker>
                        <p>In deede the outward signe differed, as I said before, namely the watery cloude from our water in Baptisme, but in matter and substance it was a signe of the same inuisible grace. And so the Apostle proueth the Israelites equall to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and consequently to vs in both the Sacraments.</p>
                     </sp>

These are your olde excursions, when ye can not answere the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. But now, after I haue proued the same substance (which you denied) first by the playne wordes, &amp; then by the euident cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance and drift of the text, I will yet further vrge this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the iudgement of <hi>Saint Augustine. tom. 9. in Ioh. tract. 26. <hi>Sacramenta illa fuerunt in signis diuersa, sed in re quae signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur, pariasunt. Apostolum audi. Omnes eandem escam spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem manducauerunt, spiritualem vtique eandem: Nam corporalem alteram, quia illi Manna, nos aliud: spiritualem verò quam nos.</hi> Those Sacraments were in signes diuers, but in the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied are equall. Heare what the Apostle sayeth. All did eate the same spirituall meate: in deede the same meate spirituall. For touching the corporall meate they did eate one, &amp; we another, but they did eate the same spirituall meate that we doe.</hi>

                        <p>Your aunswere is taken away, and can stand neither with the text of the Apostle, nor yet with <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beside, it is manifest you would confound those thinges, which of their owne nature must nedes be distinguished, namely the thing it selfe, and the effect, ende, or fruite that commeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For the effect being saluation, is the fruite that followeth the spirituall eating of Christ being the thing it selfe or substance: whom whosoeuer first eateth not, can not be partaker of the fruite that followeth.</p>

The same I say stil, in effect &amp; ende, but not equal in the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. As, a man may be sicke to day, and to morowe whole: the same man, but not the same in substance of his body and blood.</p>

This he sheweth by example of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which is the image of Christ, in such sort as man is the image of God. For it is not equal with Christ, nor like vnto him, either concerning his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or deitie: but a mere insensible thing, as that which hath no power of life: whereas Christ is all sensible, all of power, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible, concerning his Godhead.</p>

                        <p>Reply against mine answere, if you can. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior forme or colour which we see, is that which he sayth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible.</p>

                        <p>He speaketh not of colour, hee speaketh of that which Christ calleth his body. Is the exterior forme called the bodie of Christ: Is the colour of bread the image of Christ: <hi>Epiphanius</hi> sayeth, that of which Christ sayde, <hi>This is my body,</hi> is voyde of sense: Therefore he sayth the whole Sacrament, or whatsoeuer is contained in it, is insensible.</p>

                        <p>The thing may bee abused after the true body of Christ be taken out, and yet there is a misterie there, because of the spirituall vse, the meaning is, you must not abuse the thing refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to holy vses, by the example of <hi>Balthasar,</hi> and therefore the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie is alwayes there, when the vessels are emptie.</p>

                        <p>When it pleaseth Christ to worke a miracle, he is not bound to the natural properties, he doth not alwayes practise all his properties.

                        <p>I answered before, that this is an article of our faith, grounded vpon the expresse worde of God. And because we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue by the word, that Christes body is ascended, and sitteth at the right hand of God, and from thence shal come to iudge: therefore we cannot beleeue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, that Christ is yet present on earth. So <hi>Augustine</hi> reasoneth in the same Epistle. <hi>Christus Iesus vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que est per id quod Deus, in coelo autem per id quod homo. Spacia lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum tolle corporibus, nusquam erunt: &amp; quia nusquam erunt, nec erunt. <hi>Christ iesus is euery where as he is God, but as he is man, he is in heauen.

                        <p>Christ the actor in the Institution, yet was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the same body in the Sacrament: if he will haue it so, who can let him? I say he is miraculously in many places at once.</p>

                        <p>That is an other question. And yet one may be guiltie of the Maiestie of the Prince, which refuseth to obey the same, or dispiseth the same: so are they guiltie of the bodie of Christ, which refuse to receiue it being offered.</p>

                        <p>They receiue Christ, but not worthily. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth Baptisme, receiueth the holy Ghost, or else the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should not be true: so <hi>Saint Paul</hi> saieth, <hi>He that eateth the body of Christ vnworthily, is guiltie of the body and blood of Christ.</hi>

                        <p>They must either receiue Christ vnworthily, or his grace:</p>
                        <p>They receiue not the grace of Christ vnworthily:</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>Christ can neuer be separated from his grace. A man may receiue the grace of Christ, though he receiue not his body. But he cannot receiue the body of Christ, but he must also receiue his grace.</p>

                        <p>I distinguish of your <hi>Maior. <hi>Res sacramenti,</hi>
                           </hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two wayes: for the body of Christ, or the inuisible grace of Christ. The wicked are partakers of the bodie of Christ, but not of his inuisible grace.</p>

                        <p>You cannot thus distinguish that which in it selfe is all one, though it differeth in wordes: as the body of Christ, and the thing or substance of the sacrament.

But the thing or substance it selfe, whereof the outward signe is a sacrament, is receiued of all men to life, and of none to death, whosoeuer is partaker therof.</hi> Whereby it is manifest, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> doeth make but two partes of the sacrament, which hee doth distinguish: <hi>viz.</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signe which he calleth the sacrament, and the inward thing or substance of the sacrament, which is Christ him selfe.

Your answere can not bee allowed for good, when you would shift off the plaine wordes of our sauiour Christ, calling it wine being the fruite of the vine, and would haue this referred to the wine vsed in eating the Pascall, before the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. You may not so leape backe from the Institution to the Pascal, there was some distance of time betwene the Pascall and
<pb facs="tcp:13733:72"/>
the Supper: so you can not referre this to the whole action.</p>

                        <p>The Apostles did eate the substance of breade and wine after <note place="margin">2. Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> consecration, as you terme it:</p>

Sed panis iste panis est ante verba Sacramentorum: vbi accesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit consecratio, de pane fit caro Christi. Vides ergo quàm operatorius sit sermo Christi: iussit &amp; facta sunt. Si ergo tanta vis est in sermone Domini, vt inciperent esse quae non erant, quanto magis operatorius
<pb facs="tcp:13733:72"/>
est, vt sint quae erant, &amp; in aliud commutentur.</hi> Peraduenture thou sayest that it is common bread. But this bread before the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall words is bread: but after consecration, of bread is made the flesh of Christ. Thou seest then of what efficacie the word of Christ is, he commaunded and the creatures were made. If then there is so great force in the worde of the Lord, that the things that were not, begun to be: how much more is it able to worke, that the things which were, should haue still their being, and be chaunged into other things.</p>

                        <p>I know the place, and thus I answere. First ye haue not any worde in <hi>Ambrose</hi> to exclude the substance of bread. We acknowledge a chaunge with <hi>Ambrose,</hi> not of one substance into an other, as you would haue to be, but touching the vse whereto the sacrament serueth, namely that which was common bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ordeined to a common vse to feede the body, is now conuerted and consecrated to an holy and spirituall vse, to nourish the soule, by feeding vpon Christ by true and liuely faith.</p>

                           <hi>Ambrose</hi> words in deede are plaine in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereby he doeth expound his meaning, the chaunge to be as I haue said touching the vse, and not the substance. <hi>Dicis commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem panem, &amp;c.</hi> By these wordes it appeareth, that <hi>Ambrose</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was to confute their opinion, who thought ouer basely of the Sacrament, making no difference betweene it &amp; common bread. Thou sayest it is common bread, but thou art deceiued, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated and chaunged to an holy and heauenly vse, and is become sacramentally the flesh of Christ.</p>

                        <p>That is, of common bread is now made Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, appointed to be a sacrament of his body. And although this be a wonderfull chaunge by the force of Christes word and Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that common bread should be chaunged to a spirituall vse, yet <hi>Ambrose</hi> doeth not say that the substance of breade is chaunged, but rather the contrary, that the substance doeth still remaine, as appeareth by diuers examples of miracles he alleadgeth in the same chapter, and also by his wordes, <hi>Vt sint quae erant, &amp; in aliud commutentur, That they should remaine and be as they were, &amp; also be chaunged touching the vse.</hi> Now you haue vrged what you can out of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> I will returne againe to followe mine argument drawen from the wordes of the Institution, as they are explaned by <hi>S. Paul. 1. Cor.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Panis quem frangimus, &amp;c. The bread which we breake, is it not the partaking of the body of Christ?</hi> Whereby appeareth, that after sanctification remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth bread: for he sayth, the bread which we breake, and breaking followeth after blessing or sanctifying.

You spake before of the analogie in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there must be a similitude and proportion betweene the signe and the thing signified. As in Baptisme, the element of water washing the bodie, and the holy Ghost through the blood of Christ washing and sanctifying the soule. So in the other Sacrament, as the substance of breade receyued, nourisheth the bodie: so Christ receyued by faith, nourisheth the soule. Euen as <hi>Augustine</hi> very well noteth this analogie, in his 23.

Therefore as the sacrament of the body of Christ, after a certaine maner, is the body of Christ, the sacrament of the blood of Christ, is the blood of Christ: so the sacrament of faith, is called faith.</hi>

                        <p>The similitude is not taken away, though there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine no substance of bread and wine, for there remaineth acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes which do nourish.

                        <p>This is strange. I might tell you that this is against Philosophie, that accidentes without substance should feede: but we are in diuinitie. The very true and principall vse of this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to confirme our faith, that as surely as the bread and wine feedeth our bodies, euen as certainely the body and blood of Christ receiued by faith, feedeth and nourisheth our soules.</p>
                        <p>Nowe by your taking away the substance of bread, wee are brought into doubt of the nourishment of our bodies by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward element, and so consequently of the feeding of our soules by Christ the heauenly bread: and so ye destroye the analogie &amp; chiefe vse of this sacrament.</p>

                        <p>When God doth worke a miracle, it is no marueile though there followe wonderfull sequeles.

<pb facs="tcp:13733:76"/>

                        <p>Let me make it plaine vnto this auditorie, how mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly you take away the comfortable vse and analogie in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. When I come to receaue, by this meanes I ought to strengthen my faith, that euen as I knowe most assuredly, that the substance of bread and wine serueth to nourish, and doeth feede my body: euen so Iesus Christ being receiued by faith, doeth also nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish my soule vnto eternall life. This is a most comfortable analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie or similitude in this sacrament. But if I should beleue that the substance of bread and wine is cleane gone, and though before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration the substance remained, yet before I can receaue the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the substance is taken away, and there remaine nothing but accidentes: howe can I be assured that my body is nourished by the outward elements, and so in like maner my soule by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Christ? Thus by your doctrine of Transubstantiation, you ouerthrowe both the nature and vse of the sacrament, &amp; would spoile vs of the comfort and streng thning of our faith, which wee should haue by this notable comparison: the grounde whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth vpon the certainty of nourishing our bodies with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the elementes.</p>

                        <p>But bread is substance:</p>

I made one answere before in respect of the people, nowe mine other answere is for the learned: that <hi>Tertullian</hi> vseth to alleage many harde and obscure places, and figures out of the olde testament, hee must be read with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and great diligence, the wordes, <hi>Idest figura,</hi> are not in way of exposition, but of obiection.</p>

                        <p>You shew your skill in the fathers. This is not <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> exposition onely, but also <hi>Augustines,</hi> vpon the thirde <hi>Psalme</hi> before alleaged, and <hi>Tom.</hi> 6. against <hi>Adamantus. <hi>Non du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitauit Dominus dicere hoc est corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quum signu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daret corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris sui.</hi> The Lord doubted not to say, this is my body, when hee gaue a figure of his body.</hi>

                        <p>The wordes are <hi>Augustines,</hi> that Christ gaue a signe of his bodie.

                        <p>Seeing ye will haue me draw it into an argument, thus I reason.</p>
                        <p>It is vsuall in the Sacraments, for the Scripture to speake figuratiuely, calling the signe by the name of the thing signified, as in Circumcision, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. the Pascall Lambe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. and the rocke in the wildernes. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10:</p>
                        <p>Therefore the like in this sacrament of the Lordes supper.</p>

                        <p>I proue it. The same reason of <hi>Augustine</hi> from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie to take the name of the thing, holdeth in all sacraments: <hi>Ergo</hi> in this. And for example he bringeth this: <hi>Sicut ergo secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quendam modum Sacramentum corporis Christi, corpus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti est, <hi>Therefore as the Sacrament of Christes body, after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine maner is sayd to be the body of Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </hi> Also the very maner of speach in the other Sacraments is like, viz. of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, <hi>This is my Couenant:</hi> of the Pascall, <hi>This is the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:</hi> of the rocke, <hi>The rocke was Christ.</hi>

                        <p>The like vsuall speache is vsed in all Sacraments both of the olde and newe Testament:</p>

                        <p>The heretique thought it was an absurditie, that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis</hi> being eaten, <hi>anima</hi> is eaten. <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth, because <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis</hi> is a principal part of life, it is called the vitall blood, &amp;c.

                        <p>Let it be noted: why is blood called <hi>Anima,</hi> but because <hi>Anima</hi> is neare it, &amp; because it exerciseth his functions therein: So he gaue bread, that was a signe of his body present. The question was neuer, whether the blood were the substance of the soule, but whether the blood being eaten, the soule were eaten? Therefore in that saying of <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> Christ doubted not to say he gaue his body, when he gaue a signe of his body, there, signe is a token of his presence.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13733:81"/>
blood a signe that <hi>anima</hi> is neere: <hi>Augustine</hi> is cleare, that the blood is not the soule, but a signe thereof: as that which Christ gaue, was not his body, but a signe thereof. Or els the heretique had his purpose, in saying that eating of blood, is eating of soules.</p>

                        <p>He speaketh popularly, hee must not be taken so strictly. The word substance is often times taken for being, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must not be here taken for a speciall substance, but <hi>genericè,</hi> for a generall being.</p>

                        <p>And your answere will helpe the heretike very well. As the signes remaine not in their proper substance, but in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall being or accidents: so the humanitie of Christ after it was assumpted by the Diuinitie, was absorpte of the same.

                        <p>If euer we must speake properly, we must do it when we dispute against heretiques, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> did.</p>

                        <p>That answere wil not stand with <hi>Theoderets</hi> words. For Christ hath not nowe those accidentes with the which hee was incarnate, but the same substance. You shall heare the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb facs="tcp:13733:82"/>
of <hi>Epanister</hi> the heretique. As the symbols of the bodie and blood of our Lord are one thing before inuocation, and after inuocation are changed and made other things: so the Lordes body after the assumption, is chaunged into the diuine substance. But <hi>Theodoret</hi> telleth him, that he is taken with his owne nette. For the mysticall signes depart not from their nature, but abide in their former substance, forme and shape. Here you see he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth both of substance and accidents.</p>

                        <p>Yes, it maketh against the heretique, that the bread being turned into the very bodie of Christ, prooueth that Christ had a true body.</p>

                        <p>You doe open violence to the place. His argument is not of the bodie of Christ, to prooue his humanitie: but by the remayning of the mysticall signes in their former substance and accidents, to proue the perfite remayning of Christes humanitie after his incarnation.</p>

                        <p>I will vrge you with an other argument out of the same author, whereby his iudgement shall appeare in moe places then one, that he is flat against transubstantiation: his wordes are
<pb facs="tcp:13733:82"/>
these, <hi>dialog. 1. qui dicitur immutabilis. <hi>Volebat enim eos qui sunt diuinorum mysteriorum participes, non attendere naturam eorum quae videntur, sed propter nominum permutationem, mutationem quae fit ex gratia, credere. Qui enim quod natura corpus est, triticum &amp; panem appellauit, &amp; vitem rursus seipsum nominauit, is symbola &amp; signa quae videntur, appellatione corporis &amp; sanguinis honorauit: non naturam quidem mutans, sed naturae gratiam adijciens.</hi> For he would haue those which are partakers of the diuine mysteries, not to regard the nature of those thinges that are seene, but for the chaunge of the names, to beleeue that chaunge which is made by grace. For he which called that which by nature is his body, corne &amp; bread, and againe called himselfe a vine, euen he did honor the symbols &amp; signes which are seene, with the name of his body and blood: not chaunging nature, but adding grace vnto nature.</hi> Out of which wordes I reason thus.</p>
                        <p>The symbols and signes remayne in their owne nature after they be consecrate:</p>

                     <p>Our helpe is in the name of the Lord, who hath made heauen and earth. O eternall God and most mercifull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we thy seruantes doe humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that we are by nature miserable sinners, ful of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and errour, without thee neither meete to receiue the loue, nor able to yeelde the obedience of thy trueth. Therefore wee beseech thee in Iesus Christ, to throw all our sinnes into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the sea, &amp; to chase away all our darkenes with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy wisedome, that we may growe vp in the knowledge, in the loue, and in the obedience of thy most holy will. And because we are here assembled to maintaine thy trueth against the errour and superstition of Antichrist, vouchsafe, O Lord our God, to be present in this action by thy holy spirit, and so sanctifie our hearts and gouerne our tongues, that our corrupt affections being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, all things may be done in a godly zeale for thy trueth, and

nothing against it. Moreouer, for those that are come to heare, graunt that as many as loue thy Gospell, may be more and more confirmed in the knowledge thereof, by that which shalbe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deliuered out of thy holy worde: such as be otherwise min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wee pray thee that they may yeelde either to the manifest trueth, if they appertayne to thy holy election: or being none of thine, that they may appeare guyltie and conuicted of a lying spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, such as is gone out into the worlde to deceyue those that will not receyue the loue of thy trueth, but delight in darkenesse. These things, O Lord, and whatsoeuer thou knowest to be good for vs, we aske in the name of Iesus Christ, and by that forme of prayer, which he hath taught vs. Our father &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>The interpreter asketh pardon of his speach for his style, and not for the doctrine. The holy Ghost asketh no more pardon, then Paul did when he saide, <hi>Rudis sum sermone, <hi>I am rude in speach,</hi>

For what a blot is it to the holy Ghost, to affirme he should aske pardon: and to the Apostle <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> to say his stile to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is a base and lowe stile: But to vse no further preface, I will thus proue that the 2. booke of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> was not indited by the holy Ghost.</p>

                        <p>I say the writer of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> asketh pardon of his speach, neyther doeth Paul blotte the holy Ghost when he saide that he was <hi>rudis sermone,</hi> that he spake not so eloquently, nor so finely, as sometimes he might.</p>

                        <p>You answere not directly: and beside, you affirme an error. For <hi>S.

                        <p>Then I answere thus. This circumstance, of asking pardon, is of the holy Ghost: for it is a speach of humilitie, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the holy Ghost, as is Saint <hi>Paules</hi> speach, <hi>Rudis sum sermone, <hi>I am rude in speach:</hi> Et non in persuasibilibus verbis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae sapientiae. <hi>Not in the perswasible wordes of mans wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>

                           <hi>Rudis sum sermone</hi> commeth oft and rudely in: and yet the alledging of it hath bene disproued long ago. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse seeing it pleaseth you so wel, it shalbe a weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your owne giuing, to vse against your selfe. For the Apostle, of purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding the wisdome of mans eloquence, doth iustifie that which his aduersaries called rudenesse of speach, as lawfull and good. Neither doth he (as you imagin) confesse any want, or craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Therefore your example is false, deceitfull, and vnlearned. It is a trim thing for you to abuse the multitude vnder opinion of great learning, and to match those that are no scriptures with scriptures, sometime affirming one thing, and another time ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: sometime that the Apostles speach is rude and the stile base, and needeth pardon in respect of daintie eares: and now last that it needeth no pardon, but is done for humilitie: whereas the holy Ghost neuer asketh pardon of man for any thing he doth: for that were to bring God vnder man, and make the spirit of God subiect to the allowance or disallowance of sinfull flesh.</p>

                        <p>Well, this is mine answere. It was not truely and formally fraude, but materially in the formall act fraude: as for example, when the people of the Iewes were commanded to steale from the Egyptians, it was in the act theft, but not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theft. So Abrahanis intent to kill his childe, was to do mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the act, but formally it was no murther.</p>

                           </gap>, from the place in hande to the examination of newe matters. Therefore to take you where you will needes be, I say the Hebrewe worde hath not that significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it shoulde import theft, but a spoyle, which was iust and commanded of God, as after a victorie, or for a rewarde of their labours &amp; seruice in Egypt: therefore no theft. But this fraude is another thing. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first example is vnlike &amp; proueth nothing, no more do the rest. For Abrahams act was no murther, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of murther, but a duetiful obedience and seruice to God who had expresly commanded it. Lastly, you can not thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate in taking the life of a transgressor, or taking away y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> head of a traytor, is a murtherer. No, this duetie of iustice is layd vpon him by his office from God, and can not but ignorantly be called murther. And such was the warrant for Abraham in his office.</p>

                        <p>Yes, I haue this against you, that you doe not thinke the scriptures onely and alone sufficient to all doctrine of fayth and maners. For whatsoeuer you say, we knowe you holde and teache the contrary: namely that all things are not set downe and written in the worde.

                        <p>If any thing be left obscure or not fully handled by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, it was either because the Apostles could not, or because they would not write manifestly and fully:</p>

                        <p>I reply to you, that Infidels, of age to vnderstand and beleeue, must beleeue before they be baptised and admitted to the Church: but the children of beleeuers being the seede of the faithfull, they may receiue the seale of the couenant of God made to the Fathers and to their seede, according to that of the Apostle, <hi>If the first fruites be holy, the lumpe also: If the roote be holy,</hi>

                        <p>It is an vniuersall proposition, that all traditions

that came not from the Apostles are full of wickednes: but those which they wrote came not from them. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also <hi>lib. 3. dc virginibus: <hi>Nos noua omnia quae Christus non docuit, iure damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quia sidelibus via Christus est.

                        <p>Uery well. So there are things taught by you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their names which are none of theirs: wherefore we may conclude you to be in the number of false prophetes.

                        <p>Note this obiection. This is myne answere to it. <hi>Hermogenes</hi> the Heretike did alleadge a bastard tradition, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth call him to proue his opinion by true scriptures. For <hi>Tertullians</hi> argument is not to say, It is not written, Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not true: but to call him to proue the Scripture true, which he alledged for him.</p>

What great boldnes is this? From what present reuelation doth it come? Beside your boldnes, your error is great, in affirming that <hi>Hermogenes</hi> brought a bastard tradition: For there is no such thing, as may appeare to any man that for triall hereof wil reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke. <hi>Hermogenes</hi> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed for saying as an <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Philosopher, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God made al things of <hi>materia prima.</hi> Againe, of your answere I conclude, that of necessitie the proofe of euery particular tradition must be by a true scripture.

Let vs before we enter into the matter, declare somewhat concerning the state of the question. We holde therefore that we are iustified by fayth onely, and that freely, no other woorkes concurring for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And yet we set not downe a bare and naked fayth, as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries charge vs. For we confesse that fayth, hope, and charitie are coupled and lincked together, and that loue is the greatest.
<pb facs="tcp:13733:102"/>
But we affirme, that fayth onely is that instrument whereby we lay holde vpon the loue of God, which is the onely foundation of our saluation. By that title therefore wee exclude all mens workes and vertues as meritorious, and onely looke to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ.</p>

Wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that God doeth iustifie, and for Christs sake onely, through his grace, and through his mercie alone, through his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and through baptisme. Thus farre we agree: but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we disagree. For we say, that when God doth iustifie, he doth giue vs of his grace three distinct giftes, fayth, hope, and charitie, and these are as three causes of iustification, and charitie a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cause, which frameth the first act in vs. We say therefore, that as grace is put in vs in iustification, so also our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is enlarged through good workes, and is inherent in vs. Therefore it is not true that God doeth iustifie by fayth onely.</p>

                        <p>The meaning of <hi>Saint Paul</hi> in such places, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Iewes Ceremonies. For the Iewes asseuering the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the lawe, the keeping of their sacrifices and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as Circumcision, &amp;c. to be necessarie to saluation: <hi>S. Paul</hi> informeth the Gentiles that these things were not so necessary, but faith was sufficient. This he vrgeth throughout the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <note place="margin">By Campions owne answere the Apostle speaketh of faith onely. Here againe it appeareth by his answere that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle teacheth faith onely.</note> So that faith is vrged, but not faith only. Againe, by faith is meant all Christianitie and the whole religion of Christians, which is sufficient, without any parcell of the Iewes religion. This is one generall consideration, why Paul so often vrgeth faith, throughout the Epistle to the Romanes, and else where. Another generall consideration is, for that the wise men of the Gentiles did alledge their moralities as a cause of their election, which <hi>Paul</hi> in the same Epistle stoode specially vpon, and meant to confute, as is afore sayde.</p>

                        <p>Whether of these two interpretations you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, it followeth by your owne exposition, that the Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding for faith against workes, concludeth that it is <hi>Faith only that iustifieth:</hi> shutting out all such workes as are opposed vnto it. Nowe whereas you say that the workes opposite to faith, are
<pb facs="tcp:13733:106"/>
onely either the morall workes of the Gentiles, or the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the Iewes: I will easily ouerthrowe the distinction.</p>

                        <p>First, there was neuer any such errour mainteined in the Church, that the morall workes of the Gentiles shoulde iustifie: therefore Paul neuer laboured so much and so often to confute that errour which did not trouble the Church. As for the Ceremonial workes, the Apostles writing to the Ephesians, not iustified with the obseruation of Iewish ceremonies, had no cause to barre ceremoniall workes from iustification. Therefore he teacheth that all the workes of the faithfull, euen of Abraham, are excluded from being causes of iustification, and not Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies onely, or the moralities of heathen men, as you imagine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Apostles argument, and scope in those places.</p>

                        <p>The generall scope of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> is to exclude all workes both of Iewes and Gentiles in that Epistle: but in the way of discourse I denie not, but incidently an other answere is to be giuen.</p>

                        <p>The ende why works are secluded from iustification doeth proue for me: for the Apostle in that place sheweth the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counsaile &amp; purpose of the Lord, to be farre otherwise then you suppose.

                        <p>The ende of our iustification was to exclude all workes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent or consequent from being causes of iustification:</p>

                        <p>Therefore they also and al other workes whatsoeuer, first and last, are secluded and can be no cause or piece of cause, in our iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

                        <p>The Apostle meaneth to shewe that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified by workes done in grace, and not by workes without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Christ, or voide of Christ.</p>

                        <p>An open contradiction to the holy Ghost: note it. The Apostle (faith <hi>Master Campion)</hi> proueth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified by workes. I reply against you with a double ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. First, <hi>Abraham</hi> had all his workes of Christ, for hee <note place="margin">1</note> was faithfull: therefore the works excluded, are works wrought in grace. Secondly, he speaketh not of him as of an infidel, but as <note place="margin">2</note> being the father of beleeuers: Therefore the Apostle excludeth not workes without expectation of Christ as you speake. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere it, <hi>Campion.</hi>

                        <p>And I haue proued that all are excluded: and you can neither answere the syllogisme, nor satisfie the place of <hi>Saint Paul.</hi> The text and argument is cleare.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Abraham</hi> were iustified by any workes, he had wherein to glorie:</p>
                        <p>But he could not glorie in any thing, (for that were absurde by the Apostles reason:)</p>
                        <p>Therefore there were no workes of merite or iustification in him.</p>

                        <p>This is the Apostles reason, All the good workes of <hi>Abraham</hi> were founded in Christ, and by these good workes he was iustified: therefore he was iustified by Christ. For if he had bene iustified by other workes excluding Christ, he might haue gloried, and not bene iustified by Christ.</p>

The Apostle proueth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified by workes, he leaueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for <hi>Abraham</hi> to glorie in: but you leaue wherein he may both glorie, and iustifie him selfe. You haue also said the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent workes of <hi>Abraham</hi> were excluded, and (which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie) that no works of <hi>Abraham</hi> were excluded. These things are very bad, which I the rather repeate, to lay open your contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions for some that I thinke are present, and looke for no such weakenesse in their Champion.</p>

His workes be not to his glorie, because his works were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ must be all to his glorie. <hi>Ahraham</hi> was alreadie iust and in the fauour of God before these things were sayde, and so being iust, he was made more iust: and so first iust, and afterward iustified, and was not iustified by workes that went before his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, but being alreadie iust was made more iust by works. And this was one of his good workes, <hi>Credidit deo, <hi>he beleeued in God:</hi>

                        <p>Whosoeuer is iustified, is iustified according to the tenour ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the first or of the seconde couenant (for there are but two <note place="margin">

                        <p>But no man is iustified according to the tenour of the first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, which is by the workes of the lawe:</p>

                        <p>The seconde couenant is all the religion of Christ, which includeth fayth, hope, and charitie. For otherwise the <hi>Eucharist</hi> were excluded. Hee meaneth therefore by fayth all obedience.</p>

                        <p>How can that be, seeing the Apostle <hi>Gal. 3. vers.</hi> 12. doth not onely set downe the two couenants in <hi>Sinai</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> with their seuerall forme of words, but addeth plainly, <hi>The lawe is not of fayth,</hi> and maketh workes and fayth opposite causes of <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 12.</note> iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: teaching that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is iustified by Christ is not iustified by works: and he that is iustified by workes looseth the benefite of Christ.

The couenant of the lawe, as it is of the lawe, is no way mixed with the couenant of the Gospell: but as it is the couenant of the lawe eternall, of the lawe morall, of the lawe of nature, it is mixed with the new testament, &amp; Christ hath renued it in the lawe of charitie. <hi>Moses</hi> gaue it one way: and Christ ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Moses</hi> the lawe maker: and Christ the law giuer. <hi>Praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nouum do vobis, vt diligatis inuicem.

Yet because you haue so often chalenged vs to answere you an argument, though I come not with any commission to suffer you to proue your erronious doctrine: I will notwithstanding, suffer you to oppose and make an argument in this matter. First giuing the companie to vnderstande, that you woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them with an opinion that our aduantage is great in replying: but it is not so. If your cause were good and your skill great, you might make it harder to reply, then to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. For the answerer may with a worde deny the proposition, and so, soone take from the replyer all his weapons. But make your argument.</p>

                        <p>Christ died onely through the imputation of our sinne:</p>
                        <p>Therefore if we liue, we liue onely by the imputation of his righteousnes.</p>
                        <p>And therfore to say that we liue by any imputation of our owne good workes, is asmuch as to say, that Christ died by imputation of some of his owne sinne. For this analogie and proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the causes of Christes death, and the causes of our life, doth necessarily hold, and must diligently be obserued.</p>

                        <p>If it be a similitude, it is by good analogie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of trueth out of the scripture. It is you that abuse the hearers with similitudes that are not <hi>similia:</hi> my argument is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue.</p>

                        <p>I answere then to your analogie. So farre as the scripture doth intend, it holdeth: like as Christ did beare our sinnes, so we haue in vs the iustice of Christ. The righteousnes that we haue, is giuen vs by Christ. Christ had our sinnes by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation onely, because hee was not capable of sinnes inherent. But we are capable of iustice inherent, which Christ doth giue vs, and therefore in vs we haue the iustice of Christ, both by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and also inherent, giuen by him. And therefore it is called the iustice, <hi>Non qua ipse iustus est, sed qua nos iustos fecit, <hi>Not whereby he is iust, but whereby he hath made vs iust.</hi>

                        <p>Our sinnes alone were of full sufficient force by imputation to condemne Christ vnto death:</p>
                        <p>Therefore his righteousnes alone is of full and sufficient force by imputation to iustifie vs vnto life. Againe, and shortly.</p>
                        <p>In Christ there was no inherent sinne to be any cause of his condemning:</p>
                        <p>Therefore in vs is no inherent righteousnes to be any cause of our iustifying.</p>
