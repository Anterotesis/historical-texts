            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday March</hi> the 5th the Assizes being then at <hi>VVorcester,</hi> the Tryals of <hi>Rebecca West, Margaret Landis, Susan Cock,</hi> and <hi>Rose Hallybread,</hi> Four Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Reputed Witches, came on for several Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical and abominable Practises, by Witchcraft and Fascination on the Bodies of Children and Cattle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Court being Sat, <hi>Rebecca West</hi> was brought to the Bar, when after her Indictment was Read. <hi>Iohn Edes</hi> was call'd as an Evidence against her, who De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that the said <hi>Rekecca West</hi> some Weeks a go Confess'd to him; that she had familiarity with the Devil, who came to her in the likeness of a young Man, promising her that she should be revenged of all her Enimies, and have what she desired, if she would deny God and wholy trust to him; and that the said Prisoner further told him, that upon request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Devil to revenge her on one <hi>Iohn Start</hi> who Livd in the same House, he quickly after Sickned and Dyed, so that she then thought he could do as God, and thereupon desired him to joyn in that Wicked and Develish Art, <hi>Mathew Hopkins,</hi> also Deposed that the said Prisoner Confessed to him since in Prison, that the Devil came to her one Night as she was going to Bed, and told her he would Mary her, and that he then kissed her, but was as cold as Clay, and that he took her by the Hand and leading her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Chamber a turn or two, he said they were Married, and promised to be her Loving Hu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>band, and to avenge her of her Enimies; and that she sent the Devil to Kill the said <hi>Iohn Hart,</hi> which was done accordingly. <hi>Thomas Hart</hi> Father of the Deceased De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that he verily believed that his Son dyed by Witchcraft, and that during his Torture he heard him cry out against <hi>Rebecca West;</hi> a Docter of Physick also spoke to the same Effect, as did several otheres; Upon which being asked by the Court what she could say for herself, she only alledged that her great Pove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had occasion'd all this, and pleaded guilty, desiring Mercy, but the Jury after having received their Charge, Imediatly brought her in guilty of Murther and Witch-craft.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Margaret Landish,</hi> was brought to the Bar, and Arrain'd for Witch-craft, and Diabolical Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The first Evidence deposed that about the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rst of <hi>December,</hi> as the said prisoner passed by his Door, a Child of his, then pointed at her, saying there goes <hi>pegg</hi> the Witch, upon which the said <hi>Margaret</hi> turn'd back and Clap'd her Hands in a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108325:3"/>
Threatning manner, telling her she should Sma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> it, and that very Night the said Child fell Sick in Raving manner, and dyed within three Weeks after. Another Witness deposed, that the said Child, when in its Violent Fitts, would often say that <hi>pegg</hi> the Witch was by her Bed side, making strange Mouths at her. Another Evidence deposed, that she once heard the said <hi>Margaret</hi> say, that she could not enjoy her Helth, if she did not send her Imps to do some Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or another, and that her Imps did usually suck two Teats near the privy parts; upon which the said Evidence being asked how she got this Confession from the prisoner, she reply'd that the said prisoner, did use her Endeavours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Intice her to be a Witch also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by telling her that she should want for nothing, and further added that she went with her to a Witches Meeting, where she saw the Devil in the likeness of a tall black Man, at which she was so much afrighted that she never went with her any more. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young Woman spoke, partly to the same effect, and that she was once with the said <hi>Margaret,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Mr. <hi>Bargrrans</hi> Orchard, consulting and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Childs Ruin; the Childs <hi>Docter</hi> also deposed that she dyed of a Distemper, which was more than meerly Natural, and that she was under the Torture of some Diabolical Agent: The prisoner in her own defence, said that they were all Malicious people and deny'd that she had Confessed any thing to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, insinuating as if they had formerly an old Grudge against her, and thereupon made a strange Howling in the Court, to the great disturbance of the whole Bench. Upon which the Court having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd

and Sum'd up the Evidence, told the Jury <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
