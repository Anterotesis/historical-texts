         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That in the Apostles

(whilest the Church lived under Pagan and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:22899:4"/>
persecuting Emperours) Christians had no
Oratories, or places set apart for Divine
Worshipp; but that they assembled here
and there promiscuously, and uncertainly,
as they pleased, or the occasion served, in
places of common use, and not otherwise.
But that this is an errour, I intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
by good evidence, taking my
rise from this passage of the Apostle, who

               </gap>,
<hi>Have ye not houses to eat and drink in?</hi>
These are places proper for ordinary and
common repast, and not the Church or
house of God: which is againe repeated in
the last verse of that Chapter<q>

            <p>I have produced thus largely the Glosses
of the Fathers upon this Text; that they
might be as a preparative to my ensuing
discourse, by removing or mitigating, at
the least, that prejudice which some have so
deeply swallowed, of an utter unlikeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of any such places to have been in the
Apostles times, or the times neere them.
For if these Glosses of the Fathers be true,
then were there places called <hi>Ecclesiae,</hi> and
consequently places appointed and set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
for Christian assemblies to performe
their solemne service to God in, even in the
Apostles times; Or suppose they be not
true, or but doubtfull, and not necessary;
yet thus much will follow howsoever,
That these Fathers, who were neerer to
those Primitive times by above 1100.
yeares then we are, &amp; so had better meanes
to know what they had or had not,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22899:6"/>
than we, supposed there were such places,
even in the Apostles times. If in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
times, then no doubt in the Ages next
after them. And thus we shall gaine some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by this Text, whether we accept this
notion of the word <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> or not.</p>
            <p>HAVING therefore gotten so good an
entrance, we will now further enquire
what maner of places they were, or may be
supposed to have been, which were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to such use; and that done, proceed
to shew by such testimonies or footsteps
of Antiquity, as time hath left unto us;
That there were such places through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Age respectively, from the dayes of the
Apostles unto the raigne of <hi>Constantine;</hi>
that is, in every of the first 3. hundred years;

            <p>If this tradition be true, it should seeme
by it, that this <hi>Coenaculum,</hi> from the time
our blessed Saviour first hallowed it by the
institution and celebration of his mysticall
Supper, was thenceforth devoted to be a
place of prayer &amp; holy asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no Ceremonies of dedication, no not of
<hi>Solomons</hi> Temple it self, are comparable to
those sacred guests whereby this place was
sanctified. This is the more easie to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
if the house were the possession of
some Disciple at least, if not of kinred al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to our Saviour according to the flesh;
which both reason perswades, and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
likewise confirmeth it to have been.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22899:9"/>
And when we reade of those first belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that such as had houses and lands sold
them and brought the prices &amp; laid them
down at the Apostles feet: it is nothing
unlikely, but some likewise might give
their house unto the Apostles for the use of
the Church to perform sacred duties in.
And thus perhaps should that tradition,
whereof Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> tels us, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
viz. <hi>That this Church of Sion was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Apostles:</hi> Not, that they erected that
structure, but that the place, from the time
it was a <hi>Coenaculum</hi> was by them dedicated
to be an house of prayer. His words are

If it be, then according to the Interpretation

that custome of the Church, to participate
the Eucharist fasting and before dinner,
had its beginning from the first constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Whence (if it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
it will follow; First, that the Churches
then, used to assemble, not in mutable and
promiscuous, but in definite and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
places. Secondly, that those who are
here saluted with that appendix, were such
as, in their severall Cities, had bestowed &amp;
dedicated some part, or some place within
their dwellings, to be an Oratory for the
Church to assemble in, for <hi>the performance

these words in such a sense. <hi>Oecumenius</hi>
in two or three of these places (if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
him) goes the same way, though he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22899:14"/>
mention the other exposition also: As to
that of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla, Rom.</hi> 16. his
note is; <q>

Ecclesiam.</hi>
                  </q> And unlesse this be the
meaning, why should this appendant be
so singularly mentioned in the salutations
of some, and not of others? and that not
once, but again, if the same names be again
remembred, as of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla.</hi> Had
none in those Catalogues of salutation,
Christian families, but some one only who
is thus remembred? It is very improbable,
nay if we peruse them well, we shall finde
they had, but otherwise expressed; as in
that prolix Catalogue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. wee
finde <q>
                     <hi>Aristobulus</hi> and <hi>Narcissus</hi> saluted

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> My third proofe is from a tradition the
Church hath had, of the houses of some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
and pious Christians, as afterwards; so
even in the Apostles time, converted into
Churches or Oratories; as the house of
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> a potent man in <hi>Antioch</hi> (the
same, as is supposed, to whom S. <hi>Luke</hi> (who
was also an Antiochean) inscribes both his
Gospell and Acts of the Apostles) who,
being converted unto the Faith by S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
converted his house into a Church, where
S. <hi>Peter</hi> had his first See, or Episcopall Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
This tradition is derived out of the
Recognitions of <hi>Clemens,</hi> where it is first
found. Which, though it be an Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall
writing, yet is of no small antiquity;
and this passage is of such a nature, as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be well imagined, to what end it
should be devised or fained.</p>
               <p>The like is reported of the house of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
a Romane Senatour and Martyr, in
the <hi>Acta Pudentis;</hi> That it was turned into
a Church after his Martyrdome. This is
that <hi>Pudens</hi> mentioned by the Apostle in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22899:15"/>
the 2. Epist. to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and coupled with
<hi>Linus: Pudens</hi> and <q>

                  </q> Here <hi>Clemens</hi> saith expresly,
That the Lord had ordained (even now in
the Gospell) aswell appropriate places
WHERE, as appropriate Times and
Persons (that is Priests) When and
WHEREBY he would be solemnly
served, that so all things might bee
done religiously and in order. Who then
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:22899:16"/>
can beleeve, that in the Apostles times
(when this <hi>Clemens</hi> lived) the places were
not distinct for holy services, as well as the
Times and Persons were; or that <hi>Clemens</hi>
would have spoken in this maner, unlesse
he had known it so to have been? The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
it seemes, in that their notorious
sedition and discord, had violated this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
at the correction whereof this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
aymeth.</p>
               <p>This one passage therefore makes all
my former proofes credible, and may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their defect, where they are not enough
convictive. And it is the more precious, in
regard of the penury of written Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by any Disciples of the Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
unto us of that Primitive Age.</p>
               <p>If any man shall ask, where this divine
ordinance, which <hi>Clemens</hi> here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is to be found? I answer, in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of the old Testament; whence this
principle is taught us: That, as the divine
Majestie it self is most sacred and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable,
(the reason why the worship
and service given unto him must be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:22899:16"/>
with no other) so is it likewise a
part of that honor we owe unto his most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
singular and incommunicable eminency,
that the things wherewith he is served, should
not be promiscuous and common, but appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
and set apart to that end and purpose. And
thus I conclude the first <hi>Seculum.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:22899:17"/>
&amp; Faith they have to Christ ward: Secondly,
to come thither <hi>as one,</hi> that is, in unity of affection
and brotherly love one towards another, as if
all were but <hi>one</hi> &amp; not many, even as the <hi>Altar,</hi>
before which they presented themselves, was
but <hi>one,</hi> and the high Priest and Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and the Father, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> but <hi>One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is to be observed that in those primitive
times they had but <hi>One Altar</hi> in a Church, as a
Symbole, both that they worshipped but <hi>One</hi>
God through <hi>One</hi> Mediatour Iesus Christ, &amp; also
of the unity the Church ought to have in it self:
whence <hi>Ignatius,</hi> not only here, but also in his
Epist to the Philadelphians urges the unity of the
Altar for a monitive to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation to agree
together in <hi>one.</hi> 
                  <q>For <hi>Vnum Altare</hi> (saith he) <hi>omni Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae,
&amp; unus Episcopus cum Presbyterio &amp; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conis
conservis meis.</hi>
                  </q> This custom of <hi>One Altar</hi> is
stil retained by the Greek Church. The contrary
use is a transgression of the Latins, not only sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically
implying, but really introducing, (as
they handle it) a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or multiplying of Gods
and Mediatours, instead of that <q>
                     <hi>One God,</hi> and <hi>One
Mediatour</hi> between God and men, the man
<hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay more than this: It should seem, that in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:22899:17"/>
those first times, before Diocesses were divided
into those lesser &amp; subordinate Churches, we
now call Parishes, &amp; Presbyters assigned to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
they had not only <hi>One Altar</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Chur or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
but <hi>one Altar</hi> to a Church, taking Chu: for
the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany or Corporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Faithfull, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under one Bishop or Pastor; and that was in
the City and place where the Bishop had his See
and Residence: like as the Iews had but one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
&amp; Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple for the whole Nation, united under
one high Priest. And yet, as the Iews had their
Synagogues, so perhaps might they have more
Oratories than one, though their <hi>Altar</hi> were but
one, there namely where the Bishop was. <q>
                     <hi>Die
Solis,</hi> saith <hi>Iust. Mart. omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, qui vel in oppidis vel
ruri degunt, in eunde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> locu conventus fit;</hi>
                  </q> Namely, as
he there tels us, to celebrate &amp; participate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Eucharist.</hi> Why was this, but because they had
not many places to celebrate in? And unlesse this
were so, whence came it else, that a Schismatical
Bishop was said <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stituere</hi> or <hi>collocare aliud Altare:</hi>
&amp; that a Bishop &amp; an Altar are made <hi>correlatives.</hi>
See S. <hi>Cyprian Ep 40, 72, 73. &amp; de unitate Ecclesiae.</hi>
And thus perhaps is <hi>Ignatius</hi> also to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in that fore-quoted passage of his: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,

                     <hi>Vnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Altare omni Ecclesiae, &amp; unus Episcopus

cum Presbyterio &amp; Diaconis.</hi>
                  </q> Howsoever, I here
determine nothing, but refer it to the judgement
of those who are better skilled in Antiquity:
only adding this, that if it were so, yet now that
Parishes are divided into severall Presbyteries as
their proper Cures, every one of them being as it
were, a little Diocess, the reason and significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of unity is the same, to have but <hi>One</hi> Altar in a
Parish Church.</p>
               <p>To this testimony of <hi>Ignatius</hi> of the use in his
time, I will adde another of his, in his Epistle <hi>ad
Antiochenos,</hi> where, in his salutes he speaketh thus:
<q>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>I salute the keepers of the

                  </q>
                  <hi>that is,</hi> the Doores the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entred in at. For so
we may learn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Compiler of the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <hi>Li. 2. c <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> al.</hi> 61. describing a Ch:
assembly: <q>
                     <hi>Stent ostiarii,</hi> saith he, <hi>ad introitus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum,
illos custodientes; Diaconissae ad introitus foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarum.</hi>
                  </q>
But if they had in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his time <hi>Holy
doores,</hi> (or as some render it <hi>sacra vestibula)</hi> who
can beleeve also but they had <hi>holy Houses?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Epistle indeed is none of the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
ones. The title is accepted against; as that
<hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote no Epistle <hi>ad Antiochenos,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:22899:18"/>
                  <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and after him S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> when
they rehearse his Epistles, make no mention of
any such. Yet were the <hi>Antiochians</hi> his flock, his
pastorall charge. Who would not then think it
unlikely, that, amongst so many Epistles writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to other Churches in his going that long
journey from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to receive the
crown of Martyrdom (yea to <hi>Smyrna</hi> through
which he had passed) he should not reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
with one farewell Epistle that Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he was Bishop &amp; Pastor, as well as the rest?
Thus much I dare say; that this is as strong an
argument every whit, to perswade that hee
wrote such an Epistle (especially there being
one extant under that Title) as <hi>Eusebius</hi> his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
(for S. <hi>Hierom</hi> did but follow his steps) is
that he did not. For why should it be thought
more necessary, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> should have met
with all the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in the Library
of <hi>Aelia</hi> or <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (whence he<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 6. c. 14 al. 21. Vid. Graec.</note> professeth to
have collected the whole matter of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
then he did with all the works and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
of some other Ecclesiasticall men
whom he mentioneth; many of whose wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
besides those he rehearseth, he confesseth
not to have come to his hands, or knowledge,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22899:19"/>
either what, or how many they were? See him
<hi>Hist. Li. 5. c.</hi>

                  <note n="b" place="margin">In Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co 12.</note> 10. This will be
yet more considerable, if we remember, that
some Books, even of the Canon of the <hi>N. Test.</hi>
were not known to some Churches at the
same time with the rest, and therefore a while
doubted of, after they had notice of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it is to be noted, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> in expresse
tearms undertakes only to recite those Epistles
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which he wrote, as he passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<hi>Asia:</hi> but after his comming into <hi>Europe</hi>
(whence those Epistles are dated, which he
mentions not) whether any thing were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by him or not, he informs us nothing. Nay,
which is yet more; <hi>Vedelius</hi> grants the words
and sentences of this Epistle to be the most of
them, by their style &amp; character the words &amp;
sentences of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> but he would have them
therefore to be taken out of some of his other
Epistles; to wit, according to a new &amp; strange
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of his, that the genuine Epistles of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
have been robbed &amp; guelded of much of
their conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to make up more Epistles under
new Titles. he excepts only in this Epistle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the salutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s at the end thereof; because
there were not so many, or no such<note n="a" place="margin">

lawfull to make Idols for the Gentiles, so
themselves worshipped them not; he
speaks thus: <q>

them set in opposition to an <hi>Idol-shop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this DOMUS DEI or House of
God, in his Book <hi>adversus Valentinianos,</hi> he
describes unto us the form and posture, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occasion. He compares the <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
heresie, in respect of their affected se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie,
and reservednesse in hiding the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of their doctrine, to the <hi>Eleusinian
Holies,</hi> whose Temple had many Curtains
and Doores, through which those, that
were to be initiated, were 5. years in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
before they could be admitted unto
the <hi>Adytum</hi> or sacrarie, where the Deity
was: VVhereas contrariwise, he proveth
out of Scripture, the badge and genius of
the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, to consist in a Dove-like
simplicity and opennesse, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
had its Oratories or Houses of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22899:23"/>
not like that of the <hi>Eleusinian Holies,</hi>
concealed with multiplicity of walls, vails,
turnings and windings, but agreeable to,
and as it were figuring its disposition. <q>For

For, that the Churches of Christians
anciently were turned toward the East, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the Author of the<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 57. al. 61.</note> Apostolicall
Constitutions, which surely are as ancient
as <hi>Tertullian Domus sit oblonga, ad Orientem

of<note n="a" place="margin">Apol. cap. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> himself, that Christians then
worshipped towards the East, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more than probable, their houses were
sited and accommodated accordingly.
Thus I have done my best to cleare this
passage, because the Author is crabbed and
obscure.</p>
               <p>There are two or three<note n="b" place="margin">De Spect. cap. 25. Ad Vxor: lib. 2. c. 9. De coron. milit. c. 3. De velandis vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginibus. cap. 3. &amp; 13.</note> more places in
the same Father, where the Christian Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
are mentioned by the name of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia:</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:22899:24"/>
but because the ambiguous and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
signification of this word, either for
a Place or an Assembly, makes them not
convictive, unlesse some circumstance bee
annexed, which determines it: I will only
produce that <hi>De corona Militis, Chap.</hi> 3. where
concerning the Sacrament of Baptisme he
speaks thus: <q>
                     <hi>Aquam adituri, ibidem, sed &amp;
aliquanto prius in ECCLESIA, sub Antisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
manu contestamur, nos renunciare Diabolo,
&amp; Pompae &amp; Angelis ejus. Dehinc ter mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitamur.</hi>
                  </q>
I say <hi>Ecclesia</hi> here signifies the
Place. For the clearing whereof, know,
that the Baptisteries, or places of water for
Baptisme, in those elder times, were not, as
now our Fonts are, within the Church, but
without, and often in places very remote
from it. When therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> here
saith; That those, who were to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
first made their abrenunciation in the
Church <hi>sub manu Antistitis</hi> (that is, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
the Bishop or Priest laying hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, either in the mean time, or assoon
as they had done) and afterward again at
the Water: He must needs by <hi>Ecclesia</hi> mean
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:22899:24"/>
the Place; otherwise, if it were taken for the
Assembly of the faithfull, the Church in
that sense was present also at the Water. But
<hi>Ecclesia</hi> here and the <hi>Water</hi> are supposed to
be two distinct places; in both of which
(according to the rite of the African Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
Abrenunciation was to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<q>
                     <hi>Aquam adituri, IBIDEM</hi> (.i. <hi>apud aquam)
sed &amp; aliquando prius in ECCLESIA, conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamur,
nos renunciare Diabolo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And
thus much for the testimony of <hi>Tertullian.</hi>

                  </q> Loe here, how
in those Halcyonian dayes, Christians had
not only Churches or Houses of worship,
but such as might then be called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>ancient aedifices;</hi> which how
far it may reach, let others judge: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the number of Christians being
grown so great, that those ancient Fabricks
were no longer sufficient to contain them,
they erected new and more spacious ones
in every City from the foundations: And
all this testified by one that himself lived
and saw part of those times. These sacred
<hi>Aedifices, Diocletian,</hi> and those other surroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Emperours, (which contained that
direfull ten yeares persecution begun by
him) commanded by their Edicts to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where demolished, as we may reade
in the same <hi>Eusebius</hi> at large. The like
whereunto seems never to have happened
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:22899:30"/>
in any of the former persecutions; in which
they were only taken from the Christians;
but again, when the persecution ceased, for
the most part restored unto them: as in the
former persecution they were by <hi>Galienus,</hi>
under the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>And thus I think I have proved, by good
and sufficient Testimonies, that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had Oratories or Churches, that is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
Places for Christian worship in
every of the first 300. yeares: I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
(whosoever be Iudge) long before
the dayes of <hi>Constantine.</hi> I will adde to these
authorities two or three reasons, why they
must, in all likelihood, have had such Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
First, because it is certain, that in their
sacred assemblies they used then to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and pray towards the East: which
how it could be done with any order and
conveniencie, is not easie to be conceived;
unlesse we suppose the Places wherein
they worshipped to have been situated and
accommodated accordingly; that is, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
and appointed to that end. Secondly,
because of their discipline, which required
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:22899:30"/>
distinct and regular Places in their assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
for the <hi>Poenitentes, Auditores, Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni,
&amp; Fideles,</hi> and therefore argueth they
met not in every place promiscuously, but
in Places already fitted &amp; accommodated
for that purpose. Lastly, because they had
before their eyes an example and pattern in
the Proseuchais and Synagogues of the
Iews, from whom their Religion had its
beginning; which though as contrary to
the Religion of the Empire as theirs,<note place="margin">Wheresoever ten men of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael were, there ought to be built a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. <hi>Maimon. in Tephilla. cap.</hi> 11. §. 1.</note> yet
had places appropriate for the exercise ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
wheresoever they lived dispersed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
the Gentiles. Who can beleeve, that such a
pattern should not invite the Christians to
an imitation of the same, though we
should suppose, there were no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to induce them, but that of ordinary
conveniencie.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come now to answer the
Objections brought by such
as maintain the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> which are two. First,
say they, It is not likely, no
not possible, they should have any such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
living under a Pagan and persecuting
State and Empire. I answer: this Objection
is already confuted by matter of fact. For
it is to be noted, that the greatest and most
cruell Persecutions, and the 5. last of the
ten, fall with in the third or last Centurie. In
which, that Christians had Oratories or
Houses of Christian worship, we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proved by most indubitate and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable
testimonies: But if in this, why
not aswell in the former Ages, wherein the
persecutions were, as no more in number,
so far lesse bitter? For it is to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, that these Persecutions were not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:22899:31"/>
continuall, but as it were by fits, and those
of the 2. first Centuries of no long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
so as the Churches enjoyed long
times of peace and quietnesse between
them.</p>
               <p>Besides, why should it seem to any one
lesse credible, that Christians should have
their Oratories or Houses of worship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Romane Empire, whilest the State
thereof was yet Gentile and opposite to the
faith of Christ; then that they had them
in the Kingdome of Persia, which never
was Christian? For, that they had them

yeares together, about the yeare 400. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi>
relates <hi>Lib. 5. cap.</hi> 38. namely, that one
<hi>Audas,</hi> out of an indiscreet and unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
zeale, (though otherwise a vertuous
and godly Bishop) having demolished the
Persians <hi>Pyraeum,</hi> or Temple where the
Fire was worshipped, and refusing to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:22899:32"/>
build it up again, as was enjoyned him; the
King thereupon mightily enraged, caused
all the Christians Oratories or Churches in
his Dominions to be demolished likewise,
and that horrible persecution before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
to storm against them. Could the
Christians finde means and opportunity to
erect Churches, that is, houses for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
under a Pagan government in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,
and could they not under the Romane
Empire?</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Objection indeed looks very big
at the first sight, but it is no more but a
shew, and we shall deale well enough
with it. For we are to take notice, that
these Authors all foure of them lived and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:22899:33"/>
wrote within, and after the third <hi>Seculum</hi>
was begun, and the eldest of them <hi>Minuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Felix</hi> after <hi>Tertullian; Origin</hi> after him:
yea, why do I say, after the third <hi>Seculum</hi>
was begun, or within it? when as 2. of
them, <hi>Arnobius</hi> and <hi>Lactantius,</hi> lived and
wrote rather after it was ended, and in the
beginning of the fourth; <hi>Arnobius</hi> in the
time of the Persecution of <hi>Diocletian, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi>
somewhat after him: for he was
his Scholler and dedicates his Institutions
<hi>adversus Gentes,</hi> to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p>Now then remember, what authorities
and testimonies were even now produced
for the Christians Oratories all that <hi>Seculu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

throughout, not probabilities only, but such

This they seem not to have
considered, unlesse they dissembled it, who
so securely urge these passages, to infer a
Conclusion point-blanck against evidence
of Fact. As for example (I will alledge no
more, but what is out of possibility to be
denyed or eluded.) Had the Christians no
Oratories or Churches in <hi>Gregory Thauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgus</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:22899:34"/>
his time? Had they none in S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi>
Had they none in the dayes of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
Alexandrinus?</hi> Had they none, when
<hi>Galienus</hi> released their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>?
Had they none in those halcyonian dayes
whereof <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks, when the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Christians was grown so great, that
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>ancient Aedifices</hi>
were no longer able to contain their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies;
but that they were fain to build
new and spacious Churches in every City
from the foundations? Had they none,
when the Edict of <hi>Diocletian</hi> came forth
for demolishing them? For all these were
before, that either <hi>Arnobius</hi> or <hi>Lactantius</hi>
wrote. Let those therefore, who put so
much confidence in these passages, tell us,
before they conclude, how to untie this
knott, and then they shall say something.</p>
               <p>What then, will you say, is the meaning
of these passages, and how may they be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and this scruple taken off? I answer:
The Gentiles in these Objections had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
notion of what they called a <hi>Temple,</hi>
and these Fathers and Authors, in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:22899:34"/>
with them, answer them according
unto it. For they defined a Temple by an
Idoll and the inclosure of a Deity; not of
the statue or Image only, but of the <hi>Daemon</hi>
himself: that is, they supposed their gods
by the power of spels and magicall conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations,
to be retained and shut up in their
Temples, as birds in a Cage, or the devill
within a circle; that so their suppliants
might know where to have them, when
they had occasion to seek unto them; and
that, for such retaining or circumscribing
of them in a certain Place, an Idoll was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
as the center of their collocation.
Thus much <hi>Origen</hi> himself will inform us
in those his disputes against <hi>Celsus,</hi> as in his
3. Book <hi>pag. 135. Editionis Graecolat;</hi> where
he describes, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>According to this notion of a Temple,
these Authors alledged grant, that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
neither had any Temples, no nor
ought to have; Forasmuch as the God
whom they worshipped, was such a one
as filled the heaven &amp; the earth, and dwelt
not in Temples made with hands. And
because the Gentiles appropriated the
name of a Temple to this notion of encloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering
a Deity by an Idoll; therefore the
Christians of those first Ages, for the most
part, abstained therefrom, especially when
they had to deale with Gentiles; calling
their houses of Worship <hi>Ecclesiae,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

affirm, not upon bare conjecture, these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
will make manifest. First that of

                  </q> (He speaks of a

<q>
                     <hi>Quod sanctorum BASILICAS, aut de stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerit,

                  </q> Thus
they spake, when they would distinguish:
Otherwise, now and then, the Christian
Fathers use the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Templum,</hi> for
<hi>Ecclesia;</hi> but respecting the Temple of the
true God at Ierusalem, not the notion of the
Gentiles.</p>
               <p>That this answer is true and genuine, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
prove, first, because the Gentiles themselves,
who objected this want to the Christians,
neither were, nor could be ignorant, that
they had Oratories where they performed
their Christian service, when they were so
notoriously known (as we saw before) to
the Emperours <hi>Galienus</hi> and <hi>Aurelian;</hi> and
a controversie about one of them referred
unto the latter; when also the Emperours
Edicts flew about in every City for demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
them. Why therefore do they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in this maner, but because, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of something they thought thereto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
they esteemed not those Oratories
for Temples?</p>
               <p>Secondly, because in that dispute between <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Origen</hi> &amp; <hi>Celsus,</hi> it is supposed by both, that

where <hi>Rufinus</hi> may be trusted, sure he may in
this, forasmuch as in his <hi>Peroration in Epist. ad

not his wonted liberty, to insert or alter any

stone, which hath been the main inducement
