            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>DAVID</hi> grounding upon the innocenci of his owne life and conscience, appealeth to God for relief against the oppression and cruelti of his uniust enimies: who men of the world, place their happines wholy in the corporal pleasures of this life. whereas his Feliciti consisteth in enioying Gods fauour in his righteous life here, and in the glorious vision of God in the life after the Resurrection. This Psalm seemeth to haue been made, upon occasion of the second expedition which <hi>Saul</hi> made against <hi>David,</hi> at the first instigation of the <hi>Ziphites:</hi> at which time <hi>Dauid</hi> flying from the Desert of <hi>Ziph</hi> to that of <hi>Maon,</hi> was in a plain there between the mountains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed by <hi>Saul.</hi> But by reason of a sodain message that the <hi>Philistims</hi> did invade the land, <hi>Saul</hi> left foloing of <hi>Dauid;</hi> who so escaped.</p>

               <p>This Psalm, (which seemeth to have been compozed in the time of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour, by som descendant of the famous <hi>ASAPH,</hi> and who bare also his name, which in that Tribe was frequent,) conteineth a most lamentable complaint unto God, of the ruins of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the defilements of the Temple, and massacre of Gods faithful servants. Then praying first for propitiation for the sins of the people, (the true cause of that calamiti;) he presseth on with most fervent suit, for speedi delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and large revenge upon their Hethen enimies.</p>

Therfore prezenting unto God the remembrance of his former graciousnes; the confideration of his owne Eterniti, and of humane mortaliti in general (whose life groweing shorter by sundri degrees, was now at length reduced to a period of about seventi or fourescore years ordinarily:) he beseecheth God to have particular compassion upon this his chozen people, sore wasted with the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which their sins had called doun upon them; to make them wise by his grace; to comfort them with his returning favour; and lastly so to frame the coorse of their labours, that his promise continuing cleer and hopeful to them, might at length yet in their children have a glorious accomplishment.</p>

               <p>A Celebration of the gracious providence of God, and of his merci toward mankynd, in relieving them who in ani extreme distress wholy cast themselfs upon him in praier. Which is particularized in the examples of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in those times, (beeing times of exile and great calamiti:) whereof som in their return, lost their way in wyld deserts: other in not foloing the advice of God, became prisoners in chains and dungeons: A third sort by their wicked and lascivious life, fell into the usual punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grievous diseases: And a fourth, endured sore tempests at sea. All whom having had unexpected deliverance by God, he exhorteth to be therfore grateful, and in solemn assembli of Gods people before the senatours to profess their thankfulnes. An advise foloed by the <hi>Iues</hi> even at this day in those foure cases. Lastly he sheweth that the calamities which fall generally upon Nations, be it by barrennes of the earth; by oppression of Tyrants; by contempt growne upon a land in their Nobles and Governours, (whence much mischief ensueth;) or by ani other evil or sorro what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; are all brought upon them by their sins and that odious unthankfulnes to God: who yet even in publick miseries preserveth and prospereth his humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: and when Nations apply themselfs faithfully to his service, poureth upon them all blessings opposite to those former punishments. Which things wise men will consider and make use of; especially so as to knowe and acknowlege the Crëatours goodnes.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>This Psalm is with great reason coniectured to have been made by King <hi>David,</hi> and at his first coming to the possession of the kingdom of <hi>Iuda.</hi> It conteineth first his inward great thankfulnes to God for deliveri by divine hand from so mani strong attempts against him: admonishing no assurance to be like unto trust in God. Secondly it reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the verse which the People had taken up to magnifi God with, for this victori as it were atchieved in advancing <hi>David</hi> above his enimies. And lastly it setteth foorth the dueti of a truly noble and religious King, in the example of this King <hi>David;</hi> who besides his private thankfulnes, maketh here a solemn entri into the Coorts of God; there prostrateth himself publicly in thanks and praier to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighti: which doon, he is blest of the Priests of God, and received as beeing sent to them from God to be their Governour. In fine, legal sacrifices are slain and offered up, with sound of triumphing praises, to the eternal Lord and King. In the person of King <hi>David,</hi> his Son our Saviour is here prefigured: who beeing refuzed by the Archbuilders, the Prelates and Potentates of his time; yet became by Gods grace the head-stone of the corner, whereupon the spiritual Church is builded, and wherein the <hi>Iues</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were united: beeing received of the true <hi>Israel,</hi> as sent unto them from God.</p>

            <head>PSALM 119.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>This Psalm, conceived to be <hi>Davids,</hi> and after a long time of persecution under King <hi>Saul,</hi> for that God had declared <hi>David</hi> for his successour; is a treasuri of mani excellent parts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, mani choise things for instruction: each Section beeing not incoherent within it self for matter, though not so in form of speach, by reason of tying the verse to an alphabetical order; (vzed also in som other Psalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, but in differing maner;) either in assistance of memori, or to make the matter more remarkable. <hi>David</hi> then first laieth here the ground of true blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to consist in converting our harts to God, by seeking to knowe him in his woord, and by ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to serve him in observing his commandments: which infer an aversion from their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, namely lying ways and sin. He sheweth (and often by his owne example) the excellenci, and blessed effects of Gods Law and Woord. Gods woord is a light of heavenlitrueth: It illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth the understanding: and bringeth life unto man; conducting him thereunto, as a lamp or star, through the pilgrimage of this cloudi world, wherein we are strangers. The Law also of God comprized in this woord, is a law everlasting; a law of perfect righteousnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing when all worldli perfections shall perish. Wonderful are the treasures of Wisdom, Vertu, and Ioy, wrapped up in this woord and law of God: and which beeing unfolded, bring under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to the simple: and are directions even for the yong. They advance man in wisdom, above the wit of his enimies, the science of the learned, the experience of the aged. In cases doutful, they are counselers; in dangers, they are hopes; in disgraces, countenancers; in afflicted estate, comforters; in calm meditations, most pure delights and ioys, far exceeding the ioys of wealth and worldli prosperiti. Lastly they place their foloers in so great repose of soule, that no offence from the world can subvert or interrupt it. Contrariwise we beeing all the woork of Gods hands, who hath made the whole world and all parts thereof to serve him, even as at this day they continue; and seeing also our waysly open to the sight of God: what can the proud despizers of Gods Law expect, but the curse of divine vengeance persuing them by divers iudgements to everlasting d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>struction, til as dross they be consumed from off Gods earth? For although it be true that the mercies of God are great, yea and that the whole earth is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with them; yet far is salvation from the obduredly wicked. The horrour of whose ends reprezented to prudent mynds, breedeth in them a fear of the iudgements of God; and maketh them more resolvedly to hate the vain inventions of godles persons, whose trics and falshoods are but deceivings of themselves; as also more carefully to consider their owne coorses, and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the way of trueth, to make hast to serve God, refraining from everi evil and unapprooved way which might to his divine Maiesti be displeasing. But <hi>David</hi> now applying these generals to his owne particular, discovereth an extraordinari spirit and admirable desire, toward God, his woord, his law, and iudgements: professing they were his studi, meditation, delight, yea and matter of his speach: that he dezired nothing so much, as to have his hart, and ways so addressed toward God, as to knowe him, and keepe his laws. Seven times a day, did he praize God for his iustice: His praiers to God for assisting grace and protection, were earlier then the dawning of the toilsom day: his meditation on the woord of God and heavenli misteries, prevented the nightli watches: yea all the day long, his loving and longing thoughts, ran wholy upon the law of God: And at midnight also, when other men were at their natural rest, and slept; he wakening roze up to give thanks unto God in contemplation of his righteous iudgements. These were his trust, hope, comfort, and ioy. Love of these bred an hatred in him of all lying and false ways: a care to refrain from transgressing their rules in ani thing: a lothing of the veri compani of ungodli persons: an endevour to make his companions of them who feared God and kept his precepts: a zele that even consumed him with bitternes of grief, to see his enimes not forget only and viclate the law of God, but with wicked desires and the pride of an high hand attempt utterly to displace it; which called on God himself to take his quarrel

in hand. Lastly this love of Gods woord and law, cauzed him to speak boldly thereof before Kings. And though Princes traduced him in unprinceli maner; yea and persecuted him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cause: though the pride of his enimies sought maliciously and wrongfully, to bereave and deprive him, of his goods, by robbing him; of his good name and reputation, by forging lys and dispersing reproaches against him; and lastly of life it self, by lying in ambush to surprize him: yet his hart beeing held in aw by the woord of God, he forbare to repay wrong with wrong, sin with sin: but in silent sorro, even with streams of tears, bewailed their offences, and ensuing punishment. And for himself he confesseth this affliction was for his good; that God sent it him in veri faithfulnes, to reform his straying coorses; which effect it had wrought: and that his delight in the law of God, and hope in his woord, did both preserve and comfort him in all those troubles. This beeing <hi>Davids</hi> estate and disposition of soule, his praiers are sutable. He praieth God, that looking upon him, and considering he was his, and a lover of his law; he would vouchsafe to teach him it, by inlightning his understanding, and by induing him with good sense and iudgement: that he would give him a sound hart; and so inlarge and quicken it with heavenli ioy and cheerfulnes, as redily to run the way of Gods commandments: That having inclined him to the way of righteousnes, he would disturn his eys, from regarding vaniti; his hart, from beeing caught with covetousnes: that he would deliver him from lying ways; and preserve him in such strength of vertu, that no iniquiti might get ani dominion over him. And where it had pleazed God, by private message, to cauze <hi>David</hi> to be anointed King over Israel; and on that promise to rely; for which his proud enimies did deride and persue him: he praieth God to be myndful and confirm that woord; that having how to answer the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with that trust; the shame might redound upon his scorning adversaries. From whose oppression also he praieth now at length to be delivered: that walking at liberti, he might freely apply and exercise the law of God: and good men might freely also associate themselves unto him. And for observance of the divine law for the time to com, he maketh here a solemn vow unto God: whom he humbly withall praieth to accept that and other free offrings of his mouth, vows, praiers, and praises, beeing all he could offer. Finally he concludeth with the sum of his suit, the gift of understanding, and freedom from his enimies: that his life beeing continued, he might praize the goodnes of God: who now beeing chased out by <hi>Saul,</hi> and wandring up and doun like a sheep that had straied, yet did not, ne could forget Gods commandments; whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he again imploreth, to give end to that extremiti. This Psalm (for the woorthines thus largely abridged) remaineth a cleer mirrour of the godli hart of <hi>David:</hi> which cauzed him to be a man after the hart of God, and to wear the honour of that incomparable title.</p>

At which time <hi>Saul</hi> in shew reconciling himself to righteous <hi>David,</hi> yet afterward renued sharp persuit against him: hoping (how vainly, and from how blynd desire?) at som time or other to effect his destruction, whom God had declared successour in the kingdom. <hi>David</hi> therfore in this Psalm, prezenting his humble praiers as a sacrifice to Almighti God, beseecheth him to preserve him in woord thought and deed from sin: preferring the severe reproofs of a iust man, before the delicacies and pleasures of the wicked. Then closely intimating how kyndly he had dealt with <hi>Saul;</hi> and how cruelly he was requited: he praieth God to continue still his gracious protectour; and that the snares laid by his enimies, might entrap their owne gilti selfs, whilest he with his innocenci did happily escape them.</p>
