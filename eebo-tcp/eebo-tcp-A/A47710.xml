         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOW great ſoever the Diverſion
and Pleaſure be that we find in
Reading Romances, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
true Hiſtory hath all the advantage
over it that Truth hath over a Fable. If
we ſearch Books for Examples, whereby
to regulate our Behaviour, thoſe that we
know to be falſe, can they ever gain any
Empire over our Minds? For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Can the Heroical Actions that we
read in <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> have ſo great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over us, as to engage us to imitate
them? And ſhall we ſet imaginary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for a Model before us? It is not ſo
with Hiſtory, and the reading thereof
produceth more certain Effects: When a
Man whoſe Inclinations are Warlike, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
there that a private Soldier hath by
his Valour rais'd himſelf to the greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:33398:4"/>
Dignities, he conceiveth as high an Idea of
the Succeſs as a great Merit is capable of;
he perſwadeth himſelf that he may At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
the like Adventures, ſince they
have been before really perform'd, and
this thought authoriz'd by the Truth of
Hiſtory, is able to determine him to the
boldeſt Exploits. This is it, Reader,
which hath oblig'd me to publiſh this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
the Events of which I have ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Hiſtories, Memoirs, Voyages, and other

I hope it will meet with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable

            <p>THE King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had ſent to the
King of <hi>Siam</hi> a very ſplendid Embaſſy:
To anſwer the civility of this <hi>European</hi>
Prince, the King deputed three great
Mandarins in Quality of his Ambaſſadors, with
ſix other younger Mandarins, and a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Retinue, to go to the Court of <hi>Portugal.</hi> We
embark'd for <hi>Goa</hi> in the year 1684. where we
abode eleven months, and departed thence for
<hi>Europe</hi> in a <hi>Portugal</hi> Veſſel, Jan. 27. 1686. but
on the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> we unhappily run aground
on the <hi>Cape of the Needles,</hi> and that in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33398:5"/>
That very day ſeveral Mariners were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to aſcend the Maſts, to obſerve the Land
that we deſcry'd a little towards the right hand;
by their relations the Captain and Pilot judg'd
that it was the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> ſo without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
themſelves whether the Mariners ſpoke
truth or not, they continu'd their courſe till two
or three hours, after Sun-ſet, when they believ'd
they had already paſt the Land we had before
diſcover'd, then changing the courſe, they bore
a little more towards the North. I know not
what preſage of the misfortune that threatned us
had ſo fill'd me with reſtleſs thoughts, that I
could not ſo much as cloſe my eyes to ſleep; I
then came out of my Cabbin, and amus'd my
ſelf with beholding the Ship that ſeem'd to fly on
the top of the waters. Caſting my eyes a little
further, I perceiv'd on a ſudden a very dark ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
near our right ſide; this ſight ſtruck me
with terror, and immediately I ſaid to the Pilot,
Is it not the Land that I ſee? As he approach'd
to look, we heard them crying out in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,
<hi>Land, Land before us, we are loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pilot run to the Helm to change the
courſe, but we were ſo near the ſhore, that the
Ship in veering ſtruck thrice with her Poop upon
a Rock; which made her ſtand ſtill without any
manner of motion. They run to the Poop, but
not one drop of water had yet enter'd. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
they made all efforts poſſible to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from Imminent ruine, by felling the Maſts
by the board, and unloading the Veſſel, but they
had not time, for the Wind drove the Ship up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſhore. Theſe Mountains of Water break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into foamy Billows upon the points of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33398:5"/>
Rocks that jutted out into the Sea, lifted up the
Veſſel to the Clouds, letting her fall on a ſudden
upon the Cliffs with ſuch violence that ſhe could
not hold out long. You might have heard her
already cracking on all ſides, ſome parts of her
falling off from the reſt; and at laſt, this great
Maſs of Wood being for a while thus dreadfully
ſhaken and toſs'd from Wave to Rock, was
daſh'd to pieces with a horrible noiſe. The Poop
bore the firſt ſhock, and accordingly was the firſt
part that bulg'd: To no purpoſe they cut down
the Maſts, and threw over-board the Guns, and
all that lay in their way; all their precautions
were in vain, for the ſhip ſtruck upon the Rocks
ſo often, and ſo rudely, that at laſt ſhe open'd
under the Gunners Room. The Water then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
in abundance, began to gain the firſt
Deck, and to fill the Gunners Room, it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
even to the great Cabbin, and in a moment
after it reach'd to their Girdles that were upon
the ſecond Deck, and ſtill aſcending inſenſibly,
our ſhip at laſt ſunk quite down into the Sea, till
the Keel reach'd the bottom, the body of the
Veſſel remaining for ſome time immoveable. It
would be a hard task to repreſent the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
terror and conſternation, that ſeiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every Heart in the Ship: Nothing now was
heard but cries, ſighs and groans: Some
proſtrate upon the Deck implor'd the aſſiſtance
of Heaven: Others were throwing into the Sea
Barrels, empty Casks, Sail-yards, and pieces of
Boards, to aid them in making their eſcape.
After the violence of the crying was over, they
that remain'd in the Veſſel began to think of
ſaving themſelves. They made ſeveral Rafts of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33398:6"/>
the Boards and Maſts of the Ship, becauſe they
that firſt threw themſelves into the Sea, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been cautious enough were drown'd, being
either ſwallow'd up, or daſh'd to pieces by the
violence of the Waves, which caſt them upon
the ledge of Rocks that run along the ſhore. I
was no leſs aſtoniſh'd than the reſt, but ſeeing
that they aſſur'd me that there was probability
of eſcaping, I plac'd my ſelf upon ſome boards
ty'd together, and by ſwimming gain'd the ſhore,
to which already ſome <hi>Portugals</hi> had eſcap'd.</p>
            <p>When they ſaw that no more were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
than thoſe already arriv'd, they reckon'd
up what were ſav'd, and were found to be near
two hundred perſons; ſo that only ſeven or eight
were drowned, by endeavouring to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
too ſoon. The ſecond day after our
Shipwrack, we ſet forth all together. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and Pilots told us, that we were not far from
the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> where the Hollanders
have a very numerous Colony, and that in a
day or two at moſt we might be with them.
This aſſurance made moſt part of our company
leave behind them the Victuals which they had
ſav'd out of the Veſſel, that ſo being free of all
incumbrances they might perform their Journey
with greater eaſe. We march'd all that day
without ſtopping but twice to repoſe a little;
about Four a Clock after Noon, we found a
great Marſh which comforted us not a little, the
<hi>Portugals</hi> were of opinion that we ſhould paſs no
further, but reſt by this Ditch the approaching
Night. The next day we departed very early,
the <hi>Portugals</hi> got the ſtart of us, becauſe we were
oblig'd to ſtay for the firſt Ambaſſador, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33398:6"/>
very weak and languiſhing, could not hold
pace with the reſt: But ſeeing there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
not to loſe them, we divided our ſelves
into three companies, whereof the firſt kept al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the <hi>Portugals</hi> in ſight, and the two others
obſerving the ſame diſtance, were inform'd by
Signals from the firſt Band, when the <hi>Portugals</hi>
ſtopt, or alter'd their courſe. In all this days
Journey we found but one Well, the Water
whereof was ſo brackiſh, that none of us could
drink of it. At the ſame time we took notice
by the Signal, that the <hi>Portugals</hi> had ſtop'd, we
doubted not but that they had found good Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and this hope made us redouble our pace;
nevertheleſs, we could not bring the Ambaſſador
thither till after Sun-ſet. Our Men told us that
the <hi>Portugals</hi> would not ſtay for us, ſaying, That
it would avail us nothing to dye all together,
with hunger, thirſt and miſery. The firſt Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
hearing this, told us, He felt himſelf
ſo feeble and fatigu'd, that it was impoſſible for
him to follow the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and therefore deſired
us that were in health to make haſte to fetch
them up; only he order'd us, that ſeeing the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> Habitation was not far off, to ſend
from thence a Horſe and Victuals, to bring him
to the Cape if he were alive. This ſeparation
was very ſad, but it was neceſſary. There was
a young man of about fifteen years, a Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins
Son, that would not be perſwaded to leave
the Ambaſſador, of whom he was very much
belov'd, and whom he alſo lov'd in a particular
manner; his Gratitude and Love made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to live and dye with the Ambaſſador; and
one old Servant abode alſo with his Maſter.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33398:7"/>
The ſecond Ambaſſador, another Man darin and
I, bidding him adieu, ſet forward, and made ſo
great haſte, that in the Evening we join'd the
<hi>Portugals.</hi> Continuing our March for ſome days,
we found a little Iſland cover'd almoſt over with
Muſcles, and water'd with a Spring of running
Water, we went thither with a purpoſe to ſtay
one Night, but found our ſelves ſo well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated,
that we remain'd there all the next
day, and the following Night; after which we
ſet forwards in our Journey.</p>
            <p>Before our departure we perceiv'd certain dry
Trees of a conſiderable bigneſs, pierc'd through
both ends after the manner of Trumpets; the
thirſt that had hitherto ſo cruelly tormented us,
made us bethink our ſelves of an Invention that
was of great uſe to us in the reſt of our Journey.
Every one provided himſelf of one of theſe long
Tubes, and having clos'd up the lower end, fill'd
it with Water for a days Proviſion. We had
loſt ſome <hi>Siamois</hi> in our March, ſo that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
but ten of us in all, reckoning the two
Ambaſſadors. This loſs, and the action of the
<hi>Portugals</hi> who left us, put us in a great conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
yet we took courage, and reſolv'd to
follow them. About Noon we arrived at the
bank of a River about ſixty foot broad, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight deep, we attempted to wade over,
but the current was ſo rapid, that we were in
danger of being carried away by it, and forc'd
to return to the bank, therefore concluding
that the <hi>Portugals</hi> had not paſt over this River,
but continued their march along the banks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
following the ſame courſe we arrived at the
foot of a Hill, which was hollow below as if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33398:7"/>
Nature had deſign'd to provide a Lodging for
Travellers. There was room enough here to
contain us all, and in it we abode all Night,
which was very cold. My feet and legs had been
for ſome days ſo ſwell'd, that I could neither
wear Stockings nor Shoes. We coaſted all the
next day the banks of the River, in hopes to
overtake the <hi>Portugals,</hi> whom we judg'd were
not very far before us. From time to time we
ſaw marks of them; one of our men found a
Carbine, with a Box full of Powder, left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt by ſome <hi>Portugal,</hi> unable to carry them
further. This fell into our hands very ſeaſonably
to kindle a fire withal, and ſeeing my ſwelling
render'd my Shoes uſeleſs to me, I cutted them
in pieces, and being boil'd we eat them very
greedily. At laſt, having endur'd all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of hunger, thirſt, cold and wearineſs, the
One and Thirtieth day after our Shipwrack, we
arriv'd at the Fort which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have in
the Road of the <hi>Cape of Good Hope.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
receiv'd the Ambaſſador and Mandarins
of his Train, with great Teſtimonies of reſpect
and ſorrow: We conjur'd him to ſend with all
diligence ſome men with Proviſions to the firſt
Ambaſſador, whom we had left not far from
the ſhore on which we were Shipwrack'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we hop'd he was yet alive. He told us,
that during the ſeaſon of Rains, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſend any, but that as ſoon as it was over
he would not fail to take all imaginable care to
ſeek out the Ambaſſador, and furniſh him with
neceſſary accommodations for his return.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugals</hi> arriv'd at the Cape before us,
having undergone more difficulties than we did.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33398:8"/>
A <hi>Portugal</hi> Father, of the Order of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
made ſuch a relation of their ſufferings, as drew
tears from our eyes, but chiefly when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
us of the ſad accident that befel the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Ship. He was a Perſon of Quality,
very rich and courteous; he had been long Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of a Veſſel, and had done great ſervice to
the King his Maſter upon ſeveral occaſions, in
which he had given proofs of his Valour and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.
I cannot call to mind the Name of his
Houſe, but I have often heard that few Families
were more illuſtrious in <hi>Portugal.</hi> This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had carried along with him to the <hi>Indies</hi>
his only Son, of the Age of ten or twelve years,
either becauſe he was deſirous that he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to learn his Trade betimes, and accuſtom
himſelf in his Youth to the Fatigues of the Sea,
or that he would not entruſt to any other the
Education of a Child whom he lov'd better than
himſelf. And indeed, this Lad had all the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
neceſſary to make himſelf belov'd, he was
handſome, well educated, and of an excellent
Judgment for his Age; but his reſpect, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and tenderneſs to his Parent, was admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and merited a particular Elogy. His Father
when he left the Ship, took care himſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
him ſafe aſhore. During the Journey, he
cauſed his Slaves to carry him, but all his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's
being either dead by the way, or ſo feeble
that they could hardly draw their legs after them,
three days after the <hi>Portugals</hi> left us, the poor
Boy became ſo weak and ſwoln, that lying down
upon a Rock to reſt a little, he was not able to
riſe again, his Legs being ſo ſtiff that he could
not ſo much as move them. This ſight ſtab'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33398:8"/>
the Father to the Heart, he aſſay'd ſeveral times
to ſet him upright; they help'd him to walk a
little, thereby to cure him of his numneſs, but
his Legs were no longer able to perform their
office, they could do no more but drag him
along, and they whom the Father had intreated
to aſſiſt him in this charitable office being ſcarce
able to ſuſtain themſelves, told the Captain free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they could not carry his Son any longer,
unleſs they reſolved to periſh with him. The
poor man giving himſelf up to deſpair, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to carry his Son himſelf, and endeavour'd
to take him upon his Shoulders, but his ſtrength
fail'd him, and he could not advance one ſtep
further; he fell down together with his Son, who
was more afflicted with his Fathers grief than
his own pain: He often conjur'd him to leave
him to dye alone, and told him that though they
ſhould carry him further, he could not hold out
that Night, and that his ſorrow and the tears
that he ſhed, were infinitely more grievous to
him than all the torments that he endur'd. Theſe
words far from perſwading the Captain to retire,
melted his heart yet more, and made him reſolve
to dye with his Son: The Child ſurpriz'd at his
Fathers reſolution, and ſeeing he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him to alter it, turn'd to the other <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi>
earneſtly beſeeching them with expreſſions
that rent his Fathers Heart, to take him away,
ſince his Fathers preſence was only a cruel addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his miſery and pains, and that the ſight
of him would but haſten his Death. A <hi>Franciſcan</hi>
began to repreſent to the Captain that he could
not in conſcience execute his reſolution, that he
was oblig'd to preſerve his own life, and that if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33398:9"/>
he died in that condition he would be eternally
Damn'd. Afterwards the <hi>Portugals</hi> took him up
by force, and carried him ſome paces out of the
ſight of his Son, whom they had remov'd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
out of the way. This ſeparation was ſo
ſharp and afflicting to the Captain, that he was
never able to recover his ſtrength, and his grief
was ſo violent that he died two days after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
at the Cape.</p>
            <p>We abode near four months at the <hi>Cape of
Good Hope,</hi> expecting the coming of ſome <hi>Dutch</hi>
Veſſel to carry us to <hi>Batavia.</hi> Moſt part of the
<hi>Portugals</hi> embark'd themſelves in Ships bound
for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> from whence they might have
paſſage to their Native Country; the reſt went
with us aboard a Veſſel belonging to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company, which carried us all to <hi>Batavia,</hi>
where every one took what courſe he pleas'd.
As for us, after ſix months abode in <hi>Batavia,</hi> we
ſet ſail for <hi>Siam,</hi> where we arriv'd in the month
of <hi>September 1687.</hi> The King our Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
us with extraordinary goodneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
he order'd new Garments and Money
to be preſented to every one, giving us hopes
that he would not be unmindful of us, when any

               <hi>CHriſtian</hi> the Second King of <hi>Denmark</hi> having
Levied numerous Troops to recover the
Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> which <hi>John</hi> his Father had loſt,
he gain'd a Battle in which <hi>Steno</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:33398:9"/>
was ſlain; he made all the advantage he poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
could of this Victory, and the Death of his
Competitor. The Governors of the Provinces
came to meet him, and to ſwear Allegiance to
him; <hi>Steno's</hi> beſt Friends did not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
oblig'd to preſerve their Fidelity after his
Death, and <hi>Stockholm,</hi> the Capital City of the
Kingdom, only waited to be Inveſted before it
ſurrender'd. The Conquerour to cajole the
<hi>Swedes,</hi> affected a Behaviour which they ought
to have ſuſpected, becauſe it was not natural to
him. He ſhed no other blood but what was loſt
in the Fight, he granted all the favours that were
beg'd of him without diſtinction or reſerve, none
were excluded out of the Indemnity that he
caus'd to be publiſh'd, the Offices and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were continued to thoſe that were in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of them, and the only deſign that the
new King ſeemed to have, was the re-uniting of
the two Factions that divided <hi>Sweden.</hi> After all,
he made choice of the firſt of <hi>November 1520.</hi> for
the ſolemnity of his Coronation, to which all
the perſons of Quality were invited. The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was perform'd in <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi>
Nobility, notwithſtanding their natural aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the <hi>Danes,</hi> flock'd thither in ſo great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
that there was not one Man of Note
abſent.</p>
            <p>The firſt day was ſpent in the pomp of the
Coronation, the ſecond in running at the Ring,
the third in Tilting, the fourth in Turnaments
within Rails, the fifth in Dancing, the ſixth and
ſeventh all ſorts of perſons were treated at the
Kings expence, and the eighth, the laſt day of
the Feaſt, was deſtin'd by His Majeſty for a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33398:10"/>
magnificent Entertainment to the Senators and
Officers of the Crown of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The Gueſts
were no ſooner aſſembled to the number of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four perſons, but the King march'd before
them to the principal Church, where Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
was to be made for his Coronation. Maſs
was ſolemnly Sung, and at the Communion the
King ſwore upon the Euchariſt to preſerve invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
the Priviledges of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Nation, to
forget what was paſt, to make no Innovations,
and to Govern according to the Laws of the
Country. Afterwards he call'd the Senators
and Grandees of the Kingdom to make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with them: The King, and after him all
the Aſſembly, laid their hands upon the Pix
and Chalice, ſwearing to each other by all that
is moſt Sacred in Religion, to maintain a ſincere
and reciprocal Friendſhip, and devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Hell torments if their Words did not
proceed from the ſincerity of their Heart, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
that they took the Sacrament of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
of Men to God, for a pledge of
their particular agreement. Each of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Quality receiv'd, <hi>viz.</hi> The King
firſt, and after him the five principal Officers of
State, which are the Droſſart, Conſtable, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
Admiral and Treaſurer; and ſo proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in order to the youngeſt Senator who receiv'd
laſt. The Company return'd to the Palace Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
in the ſame order that they march'd to the
Temple, and were ſeated at a Table, where all
their thoughts were employ'd in contriving new
Divertiſements, when the King aroſe under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of ſome natural Neceſſity, and paſt into a
Cloſer. A moment after was heard a terrible
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33398:10"/>
Din of <hi>Daniſh</hi> Soldiers, who ſeiſing upon all the
Avenues of the Palace, entred violently into the
Court, and tumultuouſly mounting the Stairs,
came running furiouſly with their Swords
drawn into the Gallery appointed for the Feaſt.
All the Gueſts were made priſoners in the Kings
Name, and in the ſame inſtant the Gates of the
Town were ſhut by his order. The <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Souldiers began then to pillage the Houſes of
the Burgeſſes, liberty of plundring being granted
to animate them to the executions of the next
day.</p>
            <p>In the Night a great Scaffold was erected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Palace-Gate, and to begin the Tragedy,
the Biſhops of <hi>Squargne</hi> and <hi>Stremguem</hi> were
brought thither, and there loſt their Heads. The
reſt of the Biſhops, the Grandees of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the Senators, were put to death in
the ſame manner, all but the Grand Prior of
the Order of St. <hi>John of Jeruſalem,</hi> who for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſerv'd his Prince with greater Fidelity than
the reſt, was Nail'd to a St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Croſs;
they ript up his Belly, pluck'd out his Heart,
and ſtruck him therewith on the face. After
they had rank'd the headleſs Trunks in order,
and put the Heads on Pikes planted round about,
the ſignal was given to the Souldiers to cut in
pieces the multitude of common people, that
were flock'd together to ſee the Execution. The
aſtoniſh'd crowd found themſelves as it were
caught in a Net, for the <hi>Danes</hi> were Maſters of
the Streets that abutted upon that place, and the
Kings Guards attack'd them in the Front, while
at the ſame time thoſe who favour'd the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
fell upon the Rear; they made a horrible
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33398:11"/>
and prodigious Butchery. The ſlaughter'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
lay three days in the ſame places where
they fell, and had lain longer but that they fear'd
the Air would be infected with Peſtilential Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.
This conſideration alone oblig'd them
to burn theſe mangled Carkaſſes in heaps, and
the Body of King <hi>Steno</hi> was us'd with no greater
reſpect. The Guards poſted round <hi>Stockholm,</hi>
hinder'd the Neighbouring Provinces from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpeedy Intelligence of what had paſt, and
the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> took the opportunity in the
mean while to get into his hands five or ſix Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
by whom he fear'd to be Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the News of the Death of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues.
He wheedled them in under pretence
of adviſing with them concerning an affair of
great importance, yet no ſooner were they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into the place appointed for the conference,
but by the Kings order it was ſet on fire, and
they conſumed to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>What ever precaution the <hi>Danes</hi> could uſe to
conceal this Action, it was quickly divulg'd
through all <hi>Sweden;</hi> and the four Eſtates of the
Kingdom, conſiſting of the Clergy, Nobility,
Citizens and Peaſants, roſe up together in a
manner that hath no parallel in Hiſtory, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ancient or Modern. The two oppoſite
Factions that had for ſo many Ages laid waſte
their Native Country, join'd together in an
Union ſo perfect, that to this day there hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
no mark of their former Diviſions. All
run to Arms, and ſo vigorouſly purſu'd the King
and his <hi>Danes,</hi> that they were conſtrain'd to
abandon <hi>Sweden,</hi> into which <hi>Chriſtian</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
return again; and ſome years after <hi>Guſtavus</hi>
the Firſt was choſen King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:33398:11"/>
               <hi>Chriſtian</hi> continued his Barbarities and Crimes
in the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark.</hi> A <hi>Dutch</hi> Widow
named <hi>Sigebrit,</hi> was forc'd by poverty to leave
her Native Country, and withdrawing into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
with her Daughter <hi>Colombin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> they found
means to ſubſiſt there by ſelling Victuals to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that Landed in that place. <hi>Sigebrit</hi> had a
Wit proper for the Intrigues of the Court, tho'
ſhe was Born, Educated, and had ſtill liv'd
among the Dregs of the people, and <hi>Colombin</hi>
was a compleat Courtezan. With this laſt a
Knight call'd <hi>Valquendof</hi> fell in Love, who by a
youthful Imprudence inform'd his Maſter of his
good Fortune, thinking that the Prince would
be as ſoon cur'd of his paſſion as himſelf; but
he was deceiv'd in his conjecture, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of <hi>Colombin</hi> inſpir'd the King with a
Love that he had never before found for any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Not but that he had Married <hi>Iſabel</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
Siſter of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, one of the
faireſt and moſt virtuous Princeſſes of her Age;
but as he had Married her only for Intereſt of
State, ſo he liv'd with her as one Ignorant of
the Treaſure he poſſeſs'd. Thus <hi>Colombin</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the place void, and her Lovers Heart not yet
preingag'd, and employing to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the Charms of her Beauty, and the Secrets
of the Art that ſhe profeſs'd, made <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
love her with an extream paſſion. After <hi>Colombins</hi>
death, which was ſuſpected to have been haſten'd
by Poyſon, the King fell in love with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of her whom he had loſt. It was the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Sigebrit,</hi> who not content to ſucceed in her
Daughters room, extended her power much
beyond what her Predeceſſor had aſſum'd:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33398:12"/>
All State-affairs paſt through her hands, and her
reſolutions were preferred to thoſe of the Senate.
During theſe Amours, which caus'd murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
in all the Orders of the Kingdom, the
King erected a Scale of Trade at <hi>Copenhagen.</hi>
This contributed not a little to his Ruine, for
<hi>Lubeck,</hi> and the other Hanſe Towns, finding
themſelves thereby prejudic'd, declar'd War
againſt him, and Rig'd out a Fleet that brav'd
him, making ſeveral deſcents in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and
plundring <hi>Elſenore.</hi> The King at the time of this
laſt action was at <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> where he raiſed
near ten thouſand men for the relief of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City, that was then threatned by his
Enemies.</p>
            <p>He form'd a kind of Camp at the Burgh of
<hi>Lolberg</hi> adjacent to the Town, and often viſited
it to encourage his Souldiers. One day going
thither accompanied only with <hi>Sigibrit</hi> and a
Waiting-Maid of hers, he met on the way a
Troop of Strangers, who not knowing him took
him for a Burgher of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and <hi>Sigebrit</hi>
for his Miſtreſs. They immediately reſolved to
take her from him, and executed it with the leſs
difficulty, becauſe the King ſeeing himſelf ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally
match'd, fled towards his Army. The
Waiting-Maid did not think her ſelf oblig'd to
ſhew greater courage than he, and <hi>Sigebrit</hi> found
her ſelf alone expos'd to the fury of theſe Brutal
perſons, who caſt her into the <hi>Lake of Schollars</hi>
not far from thence. The King arriving at the
Camp, tarried no longer than was requiſite to
cauſe a Troop of his Cavalry to mount their
Horſes: He returned to the place where he had
left the object of his Love, and finding no body
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33398:12"/>
there, he doubted what had befaln the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Sigebrit;</hi> he approached to the Lake, and
as a Lovers eyes are more piercing than thoſe of
an indifferent perſon, he perceived afar off <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brit</hi>
in the Water, making her laſt efforts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage
her ſelf from the mire which would have
quickly ſuffocated her, but for the timely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
ſhe had from the King, who conſidered
not a moment whether he ſhould hazard his life
to ſave hers. But <hi>Sigebrit</hi> was only reſcued
from the Lake to fall into a more threatning
danger, and the King by too diligent a care for
the alone perſon, for whom he was ſenſible of
tenderneſs, almoſt became the unwilling cauſe of
her ruine. He ſeized upon the firſt Coach he
could find to convey <hi>Sigebrit</hi> back to <hi>Copenhagen;</hi>
this happened to be an open Coach, which no
ſooner approached to one of the Gates of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but <hi>Sigebrit</hi> was known by the Guard there.
Unluckily for her it fell out that this Company
conſiſted of the Burghers of <hi>Rochild,</hi> who were
particularly incens'd againſt her for invading the
principal Priviledge of their City, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
them from all Impoſitions ordinary and
extraordinary, becauſe the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi>
had choſen it for their Burial place.</p>
            <p>The ſad and lamentable condition in which
this Object of pity appear'd, and the report of
the misfortune that preceded it, was ſo far
from moving compaſſion in them, or ſoftening
their unrelenting hearts, that they redoubled
their hatred againſt her, mix'd with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Anger, Fury and Sorrow, for her eſcape,
which tranſported them to ſuch a height, that
without deliberating or conſulting together, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33398:13"/>
if they had been inſpir'd with the ſame motion,
they diſcharg'd all at once their Harquebuſſes
againſt her. But in vain do men attempt to
puniſh the crime for which God has reſerv'd to
himſelf to execute Vengeance in another life:
<hi>Sigebrit</hi> receiv'd no hurt from ſo many perſons
that levell'd their pieces directly againſt her, and
all the Bullets that were ſhot at her, did either
paſs through her Hair, or graze upon her
Clothes.</p>
            <p>But the time was come that the King ſhould
feel the puniſhment of the many crimes that he
had committed, which had occaſion'd the Revolt
of ſome Provinces; and he depriv'd himſelf of
two Crowns upon a falſe alarm, a vain report
that had no certain Author. He was inform'd
that a Rumour was ſpread through the Town,
that his Rebellious Subjects had drawn in the
Hanſe Towns to their party, and that having
fortify'd themſelves with ſo powerful a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,
they had obtain'd a promiſe of theſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Republicks to ſend a Fleet before <hi>Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
to cut off the Kings retreat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This was ſo
improbable a piece of News, that the Kings
Enemies had not the confidence to vouch it; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
it produced an effect, which in vain
they might have expected from their Arms and
Plots. The King was ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of
the truth of it, that he determin'd to prevent, by
a ſhameful flight, the danger that he believ'd
would otherwiſe inevitably overwhelm him.</p>
            <p>One of the principal points of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
conſiſted in keeping always in the Port of
<hi>Copenhagen</hi> twenty Veſſels ready to Sail on all
occaſions; and Reaſon, and the Hiſtory of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33398:13"/>
Country, prove manifeſtly that this precaution
is very beneficial to the State, and hath ſeveral
times ſav'd it from imminent Ruine. The King
order'd all the valuable things that were in his

that he preſerv'd an entire favour for
that Monſter of Unchaſtity, for whom he had
loſt in all other things. He knew there was
not one of his Servants who did not mortally
hate her, and that if he entruſted them with the
care of her perſon, they would throw her into
the Sea, and pretend that ſhe had dyed either
through fear or by chance. If he carried her
along with him, he could not always keep his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33398:14"/>
eye upon her, and every moment that he loſt
ſight of her, he run a hazard never to ſee her
again. Should he ſend her on Board before him,
ſhe would be expos'd to the undiſcreet fury of
the firſt Mariner, who beholding this fatal cauſe
of the Civil War, might be ſo brutal as to loſe
all the reſpect that he ow'd to the Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

and led her into a Chamber where were ſeveral
Baskets and Trunks for carriage of Proviſions:
He perſwaded her to enter into one which he
judged moſt capable to contain her; he ſhut her
up in it ſo ſpeedily, that thoſe who came to carry
it away perceived nothing of the Stratagem.
The King himſelf embark'd firſt, and order'd that
Trunk to be brought into his Chamber. In the

which ſtretcheth out in length a hundred miles,
and is by them call'd the Gulf of <hi>Magaris</hi> and

drive us to <hi>Lemnos,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the

noiſe of Voices and whiſtling of the Winds

ſaw them coming, cry'd inceſſantly <hi>Orſa,</hi> or <hi>Pod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>

felt within us. The Ambaſſador in terms full
of tenderneſs that would have ſoftned the moſt
flinty Hearts, accus'd himſelf as the cauſe of our

Children, and the Youth of the reſt of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
as if he had been guilty of their Deaths.
Some made Vows, others curs'd the occaſion
that had engag'd them in this Voyage; and
amongſt the reſt there was a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> of
the Family of the <hi>Cornaro's,</hi> between eighteen

offer'd 50000 Ducats to any that would

Whilſt we were thus buſied the Tempeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd,
and the Captain of the Galley ſent to
ask us whether we would come above Deck, or
ſtay below, becauſe he was oblig'd to cloſe all
the Port-holes, that the Water might not enter
into the Ship. There were only two that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to dye without going to ſee their Graves.
For my part, I plac'd my ſelf in the Stern among
the reſt, agitated with hope and fear according
as I heard our Captain and the Mariners talk to
one another, who reſiſted the Tempeſt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
courage. But this continued not long,
and the knowledge of their Language that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
gave me ſome comfort, did quickly quaſh
all my hopes, and throw me into a violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
when I heard the Captain ſay aloud, That
in the ſpace of forty years, wherein he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that Veſſel, he had never ſeen ſuch a
Storm, and that the fury of the Winds increaſed
ſo vehemently, that all we had hitherto felt were
nothing but gentle breezes, in compariſon of the
horrible Guſts that were ready to overwhelm us.
It was not enough that they had ſtruck Sail, they
were forc'd to take down the Sail-yards, and
when he ſaw that one Wave had broke ten or
twelve Oars, he commanded the Rowers to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
thoſe that remain'd, and all the Crew plac'd
themſelves on the Courſey of the Galley.</p>
            <p>Till then the noiſe of the Slaves and Mariners
had hinder'd us from being fully ſenſible of the
Tempeſt, but when it became the only object
of our Eyes and Ears, all having left off their
uſeleſs labour, and ceaſing to reſiſt the irreſiſtible
Storm, Good God! what a Spectacle did we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!
The very remembrance of it makes me
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33398:17"/>
quake when I think on it. The furious whiſtling
of the Winds, the mountains of foamy Billows
tumbling in heaps, and threatning every moment
to Bury us in the bottom of the dreadful Abyſs,
the noiſe of the Cables and Tackling, the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Galley, the mournful ſhrieking, and
confuſed cries of ſo many perſons, every one in
his own Tongue imploring the Aid of Heaven,
when the roaring Surges advanc'd to overwhelm
us, are things that cauſe motions which are not
eaſily expreſs'd. We wholly abandon'd our
ſelves to deſpair, all but two or three, that ſtill
kept by the Helm, and the Captain who reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Tempeſt a great while.</p>
            <p>He now caus'd the Throats of two Sheep to be
cut, and caſt them into the Sea, one on each ſide
of the Veſſel, to appeaſe the Angry Heavens,
and obtain their aſſiſtance by this Sacrifice. He
not only made them throw Clothes and Baggage
over-board, but reſolv'd alſo to disburthen the
Galley of part of the Company, and would
have decimated the Slaves, if the <hi>Kodgia</hi> that
was with him, had not repreſented unto him
that it was but folly to continue longer obſtinate,
in reſiſting the Decrees of Fate, and Laws of
Providence, which muſt neceſſarily be obey'd,
and that to perſiſt in this vain oppoſition would
offend God, and incenſe him more againſt us.
The Captain yielding to the perſwaſions of the
<hi>Kodgia,</hi> commanded the Pilot and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
to leave the Helm, and abandon the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
to the fury of the Storm, and reſigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to a certain Shipwrack and Death, ſate down
upon his Ankles by the <hi>Kodgia.</hi> In that poſture,
joining their Hands before their Eyes, and ſhaking
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33398:18"/>
their Heads over their Knees, they mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
out certain Prayers, in which they often,
with fervent aſpirations, pronounc'd the Name
of God. If we had been capable of feeling new
ſorrows, this laſt reſolution of theſe men would
have certainly touched us, but it made no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
on our Souls, for we were become alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
inſenſible, and ſo hardened with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of fear and danger, that we calmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the Death-threatning Waves approaching,
and without being mov'd, look'd upon our foa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Grave, as if we had been already Buried in
it. And it may be ſaid, that the continuation of
a danger which is believ'd to be inevitable, doth
often cauſe a ſort of firmneſs of Mind which may
be call'd Courage, but is at the bottom only a
pure inſenſibility. But whilſt none of us thought
either of eſcaping or periſhing, our Galley with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sails or Oars, driven only by the violence of
the ſtormy Guſts and rolling Waves, running
four and twenty miles in an hour, approach'd ſo
near to <hi>Lemnos,</hi> that three men who had not
abandon'd the Helm, notwithſtanding of the
Captains orders, began to entertain ſome hopes
of a poſſibility of an eſcape. Immediately they
ſhouted out with a tone full of terror and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
together, <hi>Courage, Courage;</hi> but do you think
that their crying could rouze our ſpirits out of
that Lethargick Extaſie, in which they lay in a
manner Entranc'd? Not at all, for we had ſo far
loſt all our Senſes, and our Hearts were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num'd

had great difficulty to make him take away his
Hands from before his Eyes, and much more to
make him riſe up and command the Mariners to

now to breathe a little, and when we ſaw our
ſelves near Land, although there was but too
much Sea between us and it to ſwallow us up,
there was not one of us that did not ſtand ready

fearing that the violence of the Winds which

<hi>Veſſelini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Name which ought to have aſtoniſh'd,
did not at all ſurprize her, although ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen, nor heard of him, but as the Enemy
of her Prince. She knew not that he was a
Widower, nor of what Age he was, yet as if
Love had in a moment render'd her a Complice
of his Deſign, ſhe was well pleas'd with the
Letter, ſhe enjoin'd the Man ſilence, and enter'd
into her Cloſet to ſatisfie her curioſity: Scarce
had read it over, when ſhe found her Fidelity
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33398:20"/>
to her Prince betray'd by favourable Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to <hi>Veſſelini,</hi> and a little after diſpatch'd one
of her Gentlemen, whoſe Fidelity ſhe had prov'd,
with an Anſwer. This Meſſenger was very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
the Count careſs'd him extreamly, and
as Preſents have a particular Charm in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he gave him two hundred Crowns, with a
promiſe of as much more, if he would Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
an Enterview between his Miſtreſs and him.
The Affair ſucceeded according to his deſire,
<hi>Mary Secſxi</hi> appointed him to come with ſeven
Followers, at moſt, to a Wood near a ſmall
Brook that waſheth the foot of the Hill of <hi>Muran,</hi>
where ſhe would be, under pretence of taking
the Divertiſement of Fiſhing, with an equal
number of Attendants. He was firſt upon the
place with ſix Gentlemen only, and would not
prefer the Counſels of Reaſon to thoſe of Love,
to which he had abandon'd himſelf; or rather,
the ſorce of his Deſtiny drew him thither, and
promis'd him ſecurity in the midſt of ſo many
Dangers.</p>
            <p>The Count left the Thicket into which he had
retir'd, at the arrival of the Lady, nor did they
look upon each other with the ordinary aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of thoſe that have never before ſeen
one another; he ſpread his Cloak on the Graſs,
and they ſate down, and made a ſign to their
Followers to retire. He related to her how by
Inſpiration he was mov'd to demand this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
without having the Honour to know her;
and told her, that after ſuch happy ſucceſs in his
firſt deſign, he preſum'd to flatter himſelf with
hopes of her aſſiſtance in the execution of that
deſign which he had upon <hi>Muran<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> She anſwer'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33398:20"/>
that this would be a Breach of her Duty to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koczi,</hi>
and that though ſhe were willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unfaithful to him, ſhe could only be ſo in
her Mind, <hi>Muran</hi> being impregnable, not only
by its Scituation, but alſo by the Diligence and
Strength of the Garriſon, which was compos'd
of ſix hundred choſen men, drawn out of the
beſt Troops of <hi>Tranſylvania.</hi> The Count per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in imploring her aſſiſtance, and his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
did not fail him on this occaſion, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
her that their Marriage was Decreed in
Heaven, which would be favourable to them
both in this Enterprize; that he aſpir'd to no
other Honour than that of being hers, and that
ſhe would gain Immortal Glory, when <hi>Muran</hi>
Conquer'd by her Aid ſhould become the pledge
of their Love, and the Scene of the moſt famous
Marriage that ever <hi>Hungary</hi> beheld.</p>
            <p>Not one of theſe words fell to the ground,
<hi>Mary Secſxi</hi> could not deny to admit into <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
that Love which had already ſtorm'd her
Heart. In fine, the Count propoſing to Scale
the Walls in a certain place, ſhe promis'd to act
ſo that he ſhould find no Sentinels in his paſſage,
and to furniſh him with a Ladder.</p>
            <p>The Day appointed for the Scalado was the
third of <hi>Auguſt 1644.</hi> both of them ſwearing Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and all poſſible Diligence. The day being
come, <hi>Veſſelini</hi> detaching five hundred men,
made eighty of them ſwear not to abandon him.
At Night he march'd at the head of theſe towards
the Caſtle, and commanded the reſt to follow at
a diſtance. His Guide led him through a longer
and more perilous way, than he expected, for he
made him paſs through a Village where they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33398:21"/>
kept Watch, the Sentinel ſtopt him, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Carbine to his Breaſt, crying out amain,
and he as low as he could, endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him that he was a Friend, and had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
upon ſome of the Enemies Troops; at length
he appeas'd him, deceiv'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eſcap'd, but
it was only to fall from <hi>Scylla</hi> into <hi>Charybdis,</hi> for
after this, deſcending into another Village, he
was ſuddenly aſſaulted by the Rabble. This
Misfortune had near made him loſe all Hope,
and had almoſt contented himſelf with Sacking
that Hamlet, inſtead of purſuing his intended
Exploit. Nevertheleſs, his Courage and Anger
yielded to Prudence, he retir'd, and to make the
ſum of his Miſeries compleat, he wander'd ſo
far in a Garden between the Mountains, that he
remain'd a great while as loſt, his Guide taking
another way. Might he not then have judg'd
that he was betray'd? And would he not have
dy'd deſperate in ſuch a conjuncture? Yet he
ſtill ſought a paſſage out of this Labyrinth. At
length, thinking he had diſcover'd a Grot, he
perceiv'd the ſhadow of a Man, and running thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his Piſtol in his Hand, he knew him
to be one of his Souldiers that was come in
queſt of him, and to inform him that his Troops
were rallied in the firſt Village through which
he had paſt. Departing from this wild place, he
went to them in that Village, where the freeneſs
of their behaviour had made them be kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
by the Inhabitants, who judg'd them to
be their Friends. They departed all together to
ſeek out a place where they might aſcend the
Rock: They were already mounting it, when
they heard the noiſe of the Guns of <hi>Muran.</hi> Then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33398:21"/>
it was that the boldeſt of them began to quake,
and he vvas conjur'd by them all to give over a
diſcover'd Attempt; he intreated them to leave
him, and ſuffer him rather to periſh, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
him to preſerve a wretched Life, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvaded
them, contrary to his ovvn Judgment,
that they vvere not diſcover'd, and that, ſome
other reaſon occaſion'd the firing of the Guns.
Yet true it vvas, for this vvas the Signal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
for the Neighbouring Villages, and it was
for a Bravado that they had diſcharg'd more
than one. In the mean while the Generous
<hi>Mary Secski</hi> ſuffer'd ſtrange inquietudes, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the Count; ſhe had a great while
before ſhut-up the Sentinels, under pretext of
making them Drink, and alſo had ſtaid the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
who ſhould have mounted the Guard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of engaging him to play with her
Women. She walk'd along the Walls with a
great deal of Impatience, endeavouring to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Veſſelini,</hi> that ſhe might throw down a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to him, and fearing that he had taken the
Alarm, ſhe diſpatch'd him whom ſhe had ſent
to him once before, to aſſure him of the facility
that he would find in the Execution of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
This Man deſcrying ſome already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,
made a ſign to them with his Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
which two or three of them perceiving
were frighten'd. The Count advanc'd to know
what made them recoil, they told him what they
had ſeen; he run up with his Piſtol in his Hand,
the other knew him, and guided him to the
place by which he was to aſcend before he could
come at the Wall. It was a very high and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Rock, The Count ſcrambled up one half of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33398:22"/>
it without difficulty, but on a ſudden he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
fatigu'd, breathleſs, and unable to proceed;
his Men reliev'd him, and drew him up to the
top of the Hill and foot of the Wall. It was
not long before the Lady arriv'd: She caſt down
the Ladder; twenty of the Imperial Souldiers
mounted, the Count follow'd, and after him
the ſixty others only, the reſt having Orders to
March to the Gates of the Caſtle, and there to
wait till it ſhould be open'd. <hi>Mary Secſxi</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd
the Souldiers in the Chambers of her
apartment; ſhe went to Bed on purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all ſuſpicion, and ſent to pray the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to come to ſee her, pretending that ſhe had
an Advice of Importance to communicate to
him. He was no ſooner enter'd but they ſeiz'd
upon him; they led him to a remote Chamber,
and ſet Guards about him. The other Officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of the Garriſon were in like manner ſecur'd.

            <p>THreeſcore and ſix of the Inhabitants of
St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> Iſland, departed thence in
the month of <hi>September 1647.</hi> to ſettle a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the Iſle of <hi>Virgins.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who
Inhabited the Iſle of St. <hi>John Portrico,</hi> near to
that of the <hi>Virgins,</hi> having Advice that the
<hi>French</hi> were arriv'd there, Rigg'd out five Men
of War, which caſting Anchor, Man'd their five
Shallops with Souldiers, and drew towards the
place where the <hi>French</hi> were, who having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them, run to their Arms, and reſolv'd to
fight it out to the laſt extremity. Their Boats
Crew, to the number of fifteen men, join'd
them, and all together they valiantly made head
againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whoſe number alone was
able to overwhelm them. The Governour of <hi>Portrico</hi>'s 
Nephew, who commanded the Aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
receiv'd a Mortal Wound, of which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhortly after his return to that Iſland. The
<hi>French</hi> fought like deſperate men, and kill'd ſo
great a number of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they forc'd
them to retire to their Shallops, where they
took counſel together, and then return'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
their charge, and couragiouſly aſſaulted
the <hi>French</hi> with Lances, Sagays and Fire-Arms.
The ſhock was furious, three of the <hi>French</hi> loſt
their Lives, and five were Wounded, to whom
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave good Quarter. The reſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſtrength ſo inferior to that of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
abandon'd the Field of Battle, and retir'd
to the Mountains, from whence they deſcended
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33398:23"/>
not till they had ſeen the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under Sail, who
before their departure ſet the Tents on fire, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
all that belong'd to the <hi>French,</hi> ſo that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in the Iſle without Beds, Tents or Tools to
Work with, and led a very miſerable Life for the
ſpace of three or four months. Many died for want,
and the reſt ſaw themſelves in danger of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the like miſery, when five of the moſt da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of them reſolv'd to expoſe themſelves to all
ſorts of perils, rather than remain in this Iſle.</p>
            <p>They made a Pyperi or Canoa, in which
they determin'd to adventure to Sea, to ſeek out
for ſome Iſland Inhabited by Chriſtians, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
Nation they might be; and one of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
happily found an Axe on the Trunk of an
Acamas Tree, they made choice of the Wood of
the Mahot and Trumpet Tree, which are the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
in that Country, and labour'd with ſo great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
that in three days they join'd together
ſome pieces of Wood, and inſtead of Mortiſe and
Nails, they made uſe of great and ſtrong cords,
and ſo fitted out their Pyperi. It was eleven foot
wide and fourteen long, and that it might cut the
Water more nimbly they made it ſharp pointed,
and in the middle of it placed a Maſt fifteen foot
high. Two of the five ſtrip'd themſelves to make
Sails of their Shirts, and having unript them, they
tied them together with great points of Mahot
Bark, and faſten'd to them two Sheets of the ſame
Bark, to Sail near the Wind, or put out to the
Main as they ſhould ſee occaſion. Our five Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
having bid adieu to them that remain'd
in the Iſle, rather with abundance of Tears than
Words, thruſt their Pyperi into the Water, where
they ſeated themſelves two in the Poop, two in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33398:23"/>
the Prow, and one in the middle. The two
that were in the Poop held an Oar in form of a
Rudder, to conduct them whither ſoever Divine
Providence ſhould lead them; the three others
held each of them an Oar in form of a Battle-Door,
and rowing after the manner of the Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
that is to ſay, before them. They arriv'd
extreamly fatigu'd at a little Iſle call'd <hi>Virgine
Gonarda,</hi> where Landing, with their Match which
they carefully kept burning in their Pyperi, they
made a Fire upon a Bank of Sand, to boil ſome
Periwinkles and Cray-fiſhes that they found there.
Out afflicted Navigators leaving this Iſle by force
of Rowing, gain'd that of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what refreſhment they wanted, as Oranges,
Citrons, Lemons, Gouyans, Bananas, and Figs, they
abode there five days. From the Iſle of St. <hi>Thomas</hi>
they continu'd their courſe to the Southern Coaſt
of <hi>Portrico,</hi> where they went aſhore upon a great
Bank of Land. After they had march'd about two
hours within the Iſle, they knew by the great ſtore
of Beeves, Cows and Hogs, which were Wild, that
it was the Iſle of St. <hi>John Portrico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They return'd to their Pyperi, which they
trim'd a new, to fetch up another little Iſland to
the Windward of <hi>Portrico</hi> and diſtant from thence
about two Leagues; they Row'd three days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to get near the ſhore, becauſe the
Tide ſtill bore to the Main Land, but after great
toil they gain'd at laſt a little bank of white Sand,
where Landing they happily found two Wells dig'd
there by Mariners; the water of which was very
good. Here they alſo found Ring-Doves, Hens, and
other Fowls, in ſo great abundance, and ſo tame,
that they kill'd them upon the Trees with great
Poles towards Night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

All theſe ſupplies, together with the footſteps
of men that they obſerv'd, made them believe
that this place was frequented by ſome Fiſher-Boats,
and that certainly it would not be long
before ſome of them arriv'd, in which they might
obtain paſſage to ſome Chriſtian Land. For
this Reaſon they erected a little Tent, in which
they abode near three months, walking every
day round the Iſland, which is in circuit but
two Leagues, without ſeeing any perſon on Land,
or Ship in the Sea, from whence they might
hope for Succour. In fine, on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning
as they were ſaying their uſual Prayers, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Bark, which coming from the North,
Coaſted the Iſle, they made a Sign to it with a
Linnen Cloth faſtned to the top of a long ſtick,
and the Captain mov'd by their reiterated cries,
commanded to furl the Main-ſail, and ſtrike the
Top-ſail, and bear ſtraight to Land. Seeing but
five Naked men without Arms, he ſent five Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
towards them in his Boat, amongſt whom
was a <hi>Walloon,</hi> who knowing by their Language
that they were <hi>French</hi> caſt by Shipwrack, or
ſome other accident, upon the Coaſt of that Iſle,
they charitably receiv'd them into their Boat,
and brought them to the Bark. By means of
this <hi>Walloon</hi> Interpreter, they rehears'd unto the
Governour the dreadful miſeries they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd.
So pitiful a recital touch'd him ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
that he gave them Shirts and Drawers, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
them with Bread, Wine, and Aqua-vitae,
and promis'd that within fifteen days, his Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being ended, he would return and take them
along with him to St. <hi>John de Portrico.</hi> He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
his promiſe, and to preſerve the memory
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33398:24"/>
of ſo ſtrange an Adventure, he caus'd their
Pyperi to be made faſt to the Prow of his Bark,
that he might ſhew it to <hi>Don Franciſco Maldonado,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Portrico</hi> for his Catholick Majeſty.
Having left the Iſland four or five Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pilot looking from the
Poop towards the Iſle of <hi>Virgins,</hi> deſcri'd a
League off ſomewhat in the Sea, moving upon a
piece of Wood, but the too great diſtance hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
him from diſcerning what it was, as they
approach'd nearer he perceiv'd that it was Men
floating upon a Pyperi, like to that which was
faſten'd to the Prow of the Bark. They were
ſix men, the remainder of thoſe that ſtaid in the
Iſle of <hi>Virgins,</hi> who had built a Pyperi to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them thence. Theſe poor <hi>French-men</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Comrades, beſeech'd the Captain to
ſave their Lives as he had done theirs; he took
them into the Ship, carry'd them to <hi>Portrico,</hi>
and preſented them all to the Governour, who
receiv'd them courteouſly, and order'd a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be given to each of them, making the
Town their Priſon, with Liberty to earn their
Bread therein. They had no difficulty to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
here, every one look'd upon them as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
perſons, and at firſt contended who
ſhould be moſt liberal to them. Thoſe that were
skill'd in any Trade ply'd the ſame; and one of
them that could play exquiſitely well on the
Violin, gain'd enough alone to aſſiſt the reſt.
When they had gather'd a Sum of Money ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to pay for their paſſage into <hi>Europe,</hi> they all
embark'd in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſels, ſave one that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

forty Men: The Weather was very calm, ſo
that the <hi>Hollander</hi> could make no advantage of

within Cannon-ſhot of the Ship, and ſeeing that
it bore <hi>Dutch</hi> Colours, he ſent a <hi>Zelander</hi> Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado
in one of the Brigantines, who deliver'd
the following Meſſage to the Captain: <hi>General</hi>
Pegelin <hi>hath ſent me to advertiſe you, that if you
will yield, he will ſet you aſhore in ſome Chriſtian
Land; and this he hath Sworn to perform by the
Head of</hi> Mahomet. <hi>I know</hi> Pegelin, anſwer'd
the Captain, who had been a Slave formerly:
<hi>The Ship belongeth to the Owners, and the Goods to
the Merchants: I cannot give away that which is
none of my own, but if he doth covet it ſo much, let
him come aboard, and he ſhall ſee whether we can
ſatisfie him.</hi> The Renegade return'd with this
Anſwer, which Incens'd <hi>Pegelin</hi> to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that he gave Orders to the Gallies to rank
themſelves in form of a Half-Moon, and in that
order to come up with the Poop of the Ship, and
to diſcharge their Guns all together, and to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her croſswiſe. Their pieces were forty eight
Pounders. His Orders were Executed, but as
they were ready to Fire the Guns, the <hi>Hollander</hi>
who was a skilful and experienc'd Seaman, by
the help of a ſmall Gale that God ſent him,
without loſing time turned about his Ship. By
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33398:25"/>
this means he put the Enemies into confuſion, and
broke all their meaſures: For the five Galleys
coming with full Sails, and haſten'd forwards by
the utmoſt endeavours of the Rowers, inſtead
of ſurrounding the Ship in form of a Half-Moon,
as they deſign'd, they found themſelves
pell-mell daſhing and breaking upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Nevertheleſs, <hi>Pegelins</hi> Galley boarded the
Ship, and ſeventy <hi>Turks</hi> entring it with their
Scimitars in their Hands, begun to cut the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and throw Fire-works to burn the Ship;
but the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain, who had all his Men
under Deck, made them Fire both from Poop
and Prow ſome Guns charg'd with Musket-Bullets,
which kill'd abundance of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while the Galley that had board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Ship durſt ſtay no longer in ſo hot a place,
becauſe the Veſſel being deep Loaden, the
Mouths of the Guns lay ſo low, that they juſt
flank'd the Deck of the Galley; which <hi>Pegelin</hi>
ſeeing, he commanded the Galleys to retreat.
The <hi>Turks</hi> who at the beginning of the Fight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the Ship, were much aſtoniſh'd to ſee the
Galleys abandon them, and leave them to the
Mercy of their Enemies, and loſing all Courage,
they that could ſwim threw themſelves into the
Sea, and the Wounded, and they that could not
ſwim, remain'd idle Spectators of the Fight.
The <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain caus'd his Men to diſcharge
the Guns charg'd with Nails, Musket-Bullets,
and pieces of Iron, and in leſs than a Quarter
of an hour more than two hundred <hi>Turks</hi> were
kill'd in the Galleys, who retir'd without ſeeing
an Enemy. The <hi>Hollander</hi> finding himſelf out

kill all the <hi>Turks</hi> that were left in the Ship, who

ſoon as he was well able to wield them, making
his firſt Campaign under that Great Chancellor
and Captain of <hi>Poland, John Zamoyski,</hi> who at
the famous Battel of <hi>Byezin,</hi> which decided the
conteſt between <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that Crown in favour of the former, had
the Honour to command the Right Wing of
<hi>Zamoyskies</hi> Army, to the defeating of that Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
which oppoſed him; in which Encounter he
received a dangerous Wound in the Knee. His
conduct in this Ingagement, ſoon after advanced
him to be Lieutenant-General of <hi>Poland;</hi> during
which command, he was imployed againſt the
Rebellious <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> whom after many doubtful
Fights, he reduc'd to his own Terms: Of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
up their General, a common Souldier,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33398:26"/>
but of great Conduct, with three other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Officers, into his Hands. He defeated the
<hi>Swedes</hi> at <hi>Revel,</hi> and afterward being made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
he beat the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> at <hi>Cluſinum,</hi> entred
<hi>Muſko,</hi> forced <hi>Demetrius</hi> to quit his Siege, and
led away the Emperour <hi>Zuiski,</hi> and his two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Captives into <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being ſeventy years of Age, he was created
Great Chancellor of <hi>Poland:</hi> He repreſſed the
<hi>Tartars</hi> in their Invaſion at <hi>Orimen,</hi> and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
marched with his Army into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> to
the Aid of <hi>Gratian</hi> the Vayvod, againſt the
<hi>Turks,</hi> who ſo extreamly oppreſſed him, that he
came in to <hi>Zolkierius</hi> with but ſix hundred
Horſe, and ſo ſatally negligent, that he could
give no account of the Enemies number or force,
even in his own Country; ſo that the General
had no certainty till he ſaw them cover the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
Fields with their numerous Hoſts.
He himſelf had Incamped upon the Plains of
<hi>Cicora,</hi> determining in that place to attend their
motions.</p>
            <p>This was in <hi>September 1620.</hi> The <hi>Tartars</hi> who
had joined with the <hi>Turks</hi> upon this occaſion,
having taken ſome Chriſtian Priſoners, gained
from them an Account of their Strength, which
did not exceed Ten Thouſand effective Men;
whereupon they drew up within view of them,
with an Army double their number, led by
their Commander <hi>Cantimer Murſa.</hi> A few hours
after they were followed by <hi>Skinder</hi> Baſſa, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, who pitch'd their
Tents near thoſe of the Confederates, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in ſight of the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> contained themſelves within their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33398:27"/>
Trenches till a Squadron of <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who had
the Out guard, Encountred that of the <hi>Tartars;</hi>
whom after a ſmart diſpute, they forced to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
but being relieved by their own Men,
they turned upon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> purſuing them
up to their very Trenches, where they alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeaſonably reinforced, oppoſed the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Enemy with ſo great Succeſs, that having
killed a great number, they chaſed them into
their main Body, but giving no Quarter, did
conſequently take no Priſoners, and ſo made no
diſcovery of the Enemies ſtrength, inſomuch that
<hi>Zolkierius</hi> making his computation by what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in view, and finding his Army chearful
upon the Succeſs of that days Action, reſolved
to put all upon the Fortune of a Battel. That
Night there came to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp Sultan
<hi>Galga</hi> the great <hi>Chams</hi> Brother, with a freſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of thirty thouſand choice Souldiers, whereof
<hi>Zolkierius</hi> had no knowledge, and therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his former determination, he drew
out his whole Army early the next Morning,
and ranging them in Battel, ſtrengthned both
Wings with Forts made of his Waggons and
Carriages, cloſed together on all ſides, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Foot and Cannon, ſo that the Enemy
could make no advantage of their numbers to
infeſt their Flanks. <hi>Skinder</hi> Baſſa on the other
ſide ſeeing the Order of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> drew his
Army into a Line of Battel, placing only the
<hi>Turks,</hi> Revolted <hi>Walachians,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvanians,</hi>
in view, the Auxiliary <hi>Tartars</hi> being placed out
of ſight, and commanded not to ſtir till a Signal
was given them to move, which ſhould be when
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were Ingaged. The <hi>Poles</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33398:27"/>
ordered their Reſerves, but by an over
confidence advanced upon the Enemy, without
the Protection of their Forts, contrary to the
Generals Orders, which the <hi>Turks</hi> obſerving, the
<hi>Tartars</hi> ſhewed themſelves on the Right Wing,
and extending that way, endeavoured to get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Camp and the Rear of their
Army, which obliged <hi>Zolkievius</hi> to oppoſe againſt
them his Reſerves. The Fight was bloody and
doubtful for two hours together, but the main
Battel of the <hi>Poles</hi> having no ſeconds, (by reaſon
of the diverſion of their Reſerves to defend the
Rear) oppreſſed by the often repeated charges of
the Enemies freſh Troops, though keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the Left Wing, within the protection
of their Forts, yet were no longer able to ſuſtain
the force of thoſe multitudes that ſwarmed
around them; they therefore faced about, and
breaking through thoſe Squadrons of <hi>Tartars</hi>
who had got between them and the Camp, made
their Retreat in reaſonable good order, the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi>
being checked in their purſuit by the
Forts above-mentioned, which were ſtill defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Poles.</hi> That on the Right Wing was
violently aſſaulted by the Enemy, who killed
three hundred of the Defendants, and took four
of their Field-pieces. Neither had their ſucceſs
reſted there but that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> valiantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in this extremity, with their beſt Troops
to their relief, obliging the Infidels, after a hot
diſpute, to a confuſed Retreat. The Fort or
Caſtle on the other Wing was left unattempted,
and Night coming on, the Enemy after a kind
of drawn Battel, wherein there fell one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of theirs, and about ſix hundred <hi>Chriſtians;</hi>
retreated to their Tents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:33398:28"/>
That Night and the next day paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Action, the <hi>Poles</hi> in the mean time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
what to do in this Exigency, but could not
readily come to any determination; during
which, a Report was ſpread about the Camp that
the chief Officers deſigned to ſteal away from
the Army, which cauſed much diſturbance, till
the generous aſſurances of their Leaders had
compoſed their Spirits, who vowed to live and
dye with them. <hi>Zolkierius</hi> propoſed in Council
that they ſhould next day try the Fortune of
another Battel, wherein they might eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Errors of the former Day; and being
now informed of their own and the Enemies
ſtrength, they could better underſtand their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
having hitherto failed more in Conduct
than in Courage, and if the Succeſs ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Attempt, they might then think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
towards the Confines of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where they would be ſure to meet with new
Supplies, for the further proſecution of the
War.</p>
            <p>The very mention of another Battel ſurprized
many of the great Perſons, eſpecially <hi>Alexander
Kalinowski,</hi> Duké <hi>Corecki,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Struſe,</hi>
three of the moſt Eminent Lords in the Army,
who envying the Command of <hi>Zolkierius,</hi> were
the more apt to oppoſe his Advice, eſpecially in
this juncture, when they muſt bring their Lives
to an apparent hazard: They therefore abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
declared againſt it, and that there was no
ſafety but in a ſudden flight, by vvhich means
they might avoid Death, or a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Bondage,
vvhich vvas yet more Terrible. And being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to put the Councils they had given in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33398:28"/>
that Night they took the firſt opportunity,
after the Watch vvas ſet, to quit the Camp, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
to themſelves, that by the favour of the
darkneſs they might get over the River <hi>Prut,</hi>
which covered the Rear of the Camp, before the
Enemy could take the alarm of their departure;
<hi>Gratian</hi> the Vayvod, for whoſe preſervation the
War was undertaken, went away with them,
and having, by the number of their Train and
Dependants, made a conſiderable party, they
concluded themſelves of Strength able, by the
advantage of the Night, to break through all
oppoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There was a ſecond Report ſpread in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that the General himſelf was gone likewiſe,
which carrying Terror with it, the inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Souldiers were upon preparation for the
flight alſo; whereof</hi> Zolkierius <hi>having ſpeedy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
mounted on Horſeback, and cauſed many
lighted Torches to be carried before him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf to his Souldiers, ſurrounded their
Quarters, ſpoke to every one he met, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
all with his preſence and chearfulneſs.
He added,</hi> That he could not be guilty of ſo nefarious
a Treaſon as to deſert fo many brave Men his fellow
Souldiers; that they had ſerved too long under his
Command, to conceive their General capable of ſo
wicked an Act, as to ſully all his Honour by ſo ſordid
a Retreat: That for his part, he had no other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
for his Life, but in order to their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſince ſome (he muſt confeſs Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
had preferred their own Safety above all ſenſe
of Honour, he was glad they were gone, hoping they
had carried away with them that Contagion of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice
which might have infected the whole Army.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33398:29"/>
He alſo would wiſh them a good Journey, provided
they would tell the King, and ſuch of their Friends
as ſhould inquire after them, That they had Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
the Army and their General, in the Plains of
<hi>Cicora,</hi> engaged againſt theirs and the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Zolkierius</hi> had harangued his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in ſuch Terms as theſe, and with a ſerene
Countenance, yet he could ſcarce compoſe the
Minds of thoſe who were diſturbed with Terror
and Fear, and could not be obliged to return to
their Duty, till a ſence of the danger of their
Diſobedience obliged them to it: But they were
wholly confirmed by the ill ſucceſs of thoſe
Lords, and others, that had Deſerted them, who
by their Ungenerous flight had haſtened, and
not prevented, their own Ruine; for in paſſing
the River, which was rather rapid than deep,
many of them miſſing the Ford were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
in it, <hi>Kalinowski</hi> himſelf periſhed in
the Stream, and ſuch as got over were moſt of
them knocked on the Head by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who
Guarded that Poſt. <hi>Gratian</hi> and his <hi>Moldavians</hi>
being skilled in the paſſage and ways got clear
off, but being purſued by his ill Fate, had the
recompence of his Infamous flight rewarded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by the Treachery of his own Servants,
who murdered their Lord to poſſeſs themſelves of
what Treaſure he had brought away with him.
The reſt of the party, after a vain attempt to
paſs the River, not daring to Land on the other
ſide, wet, weary, and confounded with ſhame,
came back to the Camp, which awhile before
they had forſaken as deſperate, repoſing now all
their ſafety in that of the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:33398:29"/>
The <hi>Poles</hi> by theſe loſſes, and the eſcape of
nine hundred <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> (who by a more lucky
Fate than that of their Fellows, had broke
through a neglected Quarter without oppoſition)
being much weakned, and far unequal in ſtrength
to the Enemy, and not daring to attempt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fight, without manifeſt danger of loſing
all, they reſolved upon a Retreat. They had
loſt many of their Horſes, and more died daily
for want of Forrage; they were haraſſed with
Duty, and had no hope of Relief from <hi>Poland,</hi>
being Beſieged by a Barbarous Enemy, ready
in their apprehenſions to Storm their Camp
every moment. Their Proviſions were ſhort,
and no poſſibility of Supplies from without, all
the ſides of their Camp being Inveſted ſo, that
it was impoſſible for them to ſubſiſt for want of
Food, in expectation of Succour from their own
Country; neither had the King, by reaſon of
the Interruption of the Paſſages, received but
one Letter from <hi>Zolkievius</hi> when it was too late,
wherein he gave him an account of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and how he had been unſeaſonably aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
by ſome of the Army.</p>
            <p>This was the State of Affairs in the Camp,
while the Enemy without lay cloſe upon them,
and computing the diſtreſſes and diſorders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
by the Deſertion of thoſe that had left them,
they were much raiſed in their hopes, deſpiſing
all Propoſals of quitting the place; ſo that <hi>Sept.
22.</hi> the whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army was drawn up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Camp, threatning a general Aſſault
unleſs they inſtantly ſurrendred at diſcretion.
Next day they did the like, and on the 26th. the
Galga, or Prince of <hi>Tartary,</hi> approaching near
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33398:30"/>
the Trenches was met by Duke <hi>Corecki</hi> upon
Parole, who propoſed an exceſſive Ranſom for
himſelf, and ſome few with him, and deſcending
to ſome particulars for Rendition of the Camp,
deſiring only that the Souldiers might March
away with their Swords, the <hi>Tartarian</hi> left them
with Scorn and Anger, and clapping his Hand
to his Scimiter, bid them expect no other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
than what the ſharpneſs of that would afford
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zolkierius</hi> having throughly computed the
State of his Affairs, reſolved to quit the Camp,
and having ordered all things accordingly, which
took up three days time, being aſſiſted in the
Method of his Deſign by <hi>Martin Kaſanowski,</hi>
an old Experienced Collonel, <hi>Sept. 29.</hi> that part
of the Wall through which the Camp was to
paſs being opened, the Army about Sun-ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
its March in the following Order: On both
ſides a row of Waggons, as it were chained toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
five hundred paces in length, drawn by
their Horſes, cloſed the Wings, the Front con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
likewiſe of linked Waggons, took up
three hundred paces, and the Rear being fenced
with the like Barricado, together with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the Camp, was fortified with Cannon.
The Wounded, Sick, Baggage, and all the beſt
Horſes of the Army, were placed in the midſt,
while the Officers and Souldiers marched on the
outſide of the Camp with Colours flying, and
their Arms ready fixt to reſiſt any Aſſault.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> obſerving this order of the <hi>Poles,</hi>
at firſt imagined they had drawn out to Fight,
but when they diſcerned the whole Camp to
move, and that no Man ſtirred out of his Rank,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33398:30"/>
they ſtood amazed at the Novelty, and the
Night approaching, they durſt only ſend out
ſmall parties to obſerve their motion, and ſo
they marched two <hi>Moldaviſh</hi> miles that Night,
without any diſorder but what they received at
the paſſage of a Lake, which yet did not much
incommode them, ſince they were not eagerly
preſſed upon by the Enemy. <hi>Sept. 30. Skinder</hi>
Baſſa aſſaulted the Camp on all ſides with his
united Forces, but being repulſed with great
loſs, they marched yet two <hi>Moldaviſh</hi> miles more
that Night, which is about Ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles.
<hi>Oct. 1.</hi> The Camp being Lodged near a great
Pool, continued there that whole Day and the
Night following. The Infidels galled them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
from the other ſide of the Water with
their Shot, and from the open ſide by their
Skirmiſhing, but were bravely repulſed with
great ſlaughter of their Men. About Noon that
Day they prepared for a freſh Aſſault, but inſtead
thereof ſent a Trumpet to the Camp to demand
their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Interpreter, that they might ſpeak
with him; which being granted, they only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him, making no attempt that Day.
<hi>Oct. 2.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> having viewed the Camp,
Stormed it with greater fury than ever, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
repulſed, returned fifteen times to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.
The Courage of the Defendants increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
by their being able to reſiſt, it did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
them at length to make good their Station,
but they followed the flying Enemy a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from it, taking in the purſuit two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and a piece of Cannon, having killed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of their Men. Towards Sun-ſet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
their March<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with their Shot <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:33398:31"/>
which muſt needs hinder their pace, and yet
they had advanced fifteen <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles before
Morning.</p>
            <p>The next day having gained the advantage of
a Rivolet, and heights of Ground, they eaſily
repreſſed the violence of the Enemy, and took
a <hi>Tartars</hi> Colours; they alſo eluded an Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade,
and continued their Journey that Night,
ſtrengthning their Camp by the Neighbourhood
of a River.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Skinder</hi> Baſſa conſidering that by theſe Night
Marches the Prey might ſlip out of his Hands,
and being ſenſible of the diſgrace that would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him to ſuffer it, reſolved to make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
with the hazard of his whole Army, and
conſequently gave order for a general Aſſault:
But the <hi>Tartars</hi> not ſeeming ſo forward as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
having already been ſo often rudely
handled, and pretending the great difficulty of
the Deſign, by reaſon of the poſture of the
Camp, ſeated upon the advantage of a River,
whereby they would be able to bring more hands
to the defence of thoſe parts that were Aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
The Inraged Baſſa, impatient of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
turned haſtily to his Janiſaries, <hi>And are
you alſo affrighted with the greatneſs of the danger,</hi>
ſaid he? <hi>And will you ſuffer this handful of Men
to ſlip out of your hands for want of a vigorous
attempt upon them?</hi> But they cried out, <hi>He
ſhould not reproach but Command them, for nothing
was terrible to them but the Anger of their General.</hi>
The reſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſwayed by his example,
would be of the party, prompted by an Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to do the Service with their own hands,
without the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Armed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33398:31"/>
with theſe Reſolutions they Aſſaulted the Camp
from all their Quarters, and incited by a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Shame and Fury, broke in upon it in
one place, carrying Terror into the Bowels of
the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance
made againſt them; all their former Diſputes
and Conflicts ſeemed but Sport to this. The
<hi>Turks</hi> hurried on by their Principle of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
added to a Zeal of Gratifying their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
expoſed their Lives without Diſcretion,
to preſerve the Footing they had gained in the
Camp, doing more than Men in proſecuting the
Advantage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Armed with a Native Courage,
and more Inflamed by their Deſpair, exceeded
their Enemies, for deſpiſing their multitudes, and
reſolving to Conquer or Dye, they made a
Charge upon thoſe that had entred, with a fury
ſuitable to the circumſtance of their Affairs, and
forcing the foremoſt back on their Fellows,
made them contribute to their own Diſorders;
ſo that not being able to Rally, they were repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with a great Slaughter, and having cleared
themſelves from this Storm, they continued
their March that Evening along the Banks of
the River for three miles, the Enemy Coaſting
them on the other ſide with an equal pace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> having got before them, <hi>Oct. 5.</hi>
lay directly in their way, but they having taken
up a Reſolution to ſurmount every difficulty,
and being grown Skilful in this kind of March,
broke through all the Reſiſtance made againſt
them, though with ſome diſorder in the Rear,
occaſioned by the Fears of the Waggon-men
which rendred them leſs exact and faithful i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:33398:32"/>
their Charge; but by the Valour and Conduct
of <hi>Zemberg,</hi> who commanded in that part, the
Enemy was Repulſed, and the Diſorder being
Regulated, they Marched two Miles that Day.
They ſtill continued to advance, and like a
Wedge of Iron, divided their paſſage through
the numerous Squadrons of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who
clouded their very ſight with their ſhowers of
Shot and Arrows, but ſince they could make no
Impreſſion upon them, they burnt up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
all their Graſs and Forrage in the way,
whereby they were extreamly incommodated,
and by reaſon whereof, and their often Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing,
they were able to March but one <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daviſh</hi>
Mile a Day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> ſtill followed the Banks of the River
<hi>Tire,</hi> with a deſign to gain <hi>Mokilow,</hi> a ſafe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
after their tedious March. They were
conſtrained to avoid the neareſt way thither, as
Mountainous and Boggy, beſides great Woods
in it, which would obſtruct them in the manner
of their motion, chuſing for the ſake of a more
even paſſage, to go about by ſuch a way as
brought them within a mile of their deſired Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
The Camp was in perfect order, and
the Enemy tired with the repetition of their
fruitleſs Attempts and Labours, had forborn to
preſs upon them, being content to wait their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with a few Scouts only. The <hi>Poles</hi> about
the Evening of this ſeventh Day of their March,
continued their Journey according to their former
Method, and meeting in their way ſome Barns
Stored with great quantities of Hay and Corn,
many of them, but without Order, run to the
Bait to ſupply themſelves with Proviſions for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33398:32"/>
their well nigh ſtarved Horſes: In the mean
time the Van of the Camp began to March with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
calling in their Forragers, or giving notice as
they ought and uſed, to the Rear of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Rear, for want of the accuſtomed
Sign, being thus ſeparated from the Main Body,
was ſeized on by a ſudden Horror and Pannick
Fear, which having affected ſome, was like
Wild-fire ſpread through all: Their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
were various, but all upon the account of
fear heightned by the darkneſs, and imaginary
noiſes, concluding the Van was cut off, and
that the Sword was at their Throats. The
ſame Plague being carried over the reſt of the
Army, infected the whole in a moment with its
Contagion; whereupon the Carters, Waggon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Paddees and Servants; imployed about the
Carriages, unloſed the Horſes to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by flight upon them, ſo that the whole
Fabrick and Machine of the Camp being diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they could move no further. There was
yet another cauſe that contributed to this
Evil:</p>
            <p>Upon the departure of <hi>Gratian,</hi> and other
Fugitives, from the Camp of <hi>Cicora,</hi> the Raſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Army, with a mixture of Souldiers,
Robbed and Plundered their Tents and Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but being got on the Banks of the River
<hi>Tire,</hi> they began to ſpeak of it, and <hi>Koninkspolski</hi>
the Lieutenant-General, had that very Evening
very Imprudently uttered ſome threatning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
about it. The number of the Guilty
being many, they began to think of their proper
ſafety, and the avoiding that puniſhment, which
if they ſtood to it, would fall upon them; they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33398:33"/>
therefore, in great numbers, fled away from
their Friends as well as from their Foes. Theſe
Wretches having begun a Tumult upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
it was ſeconded by the dividing of the
Camp, as is before declared: The confuſion
was ſo great, that <hi>Zolkievius,</hi> and the chief
Officers about him, could not be heard,
the variety of noiſes, with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the danger, and the darkneſs of the
Night, rendring the Army deaf to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Orders.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> being advertiſed by their Scouts,
of theſe Diſorders and Tumults, failed not to
haſten thither, and catching hold of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
given them by the <hi>Poles,</hi> prepared to it by
their own fears, fell in among them with Shouts
and Terrors. <hi>Zolkievius</hi> had commanded, that
for the better ſafety of the Quarters, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
of the Souldiers, That all Men ſhould
quit their Horſes and March on Foot, wherein
himſelf was the firſt Example; which was the
Reaſon that ſo many of the chief Commanders
fell, and were taken in that Encounter, for
when the Rout was become ſo Univerſal that all
Reſiſtance was to no purpoſe, they periſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place for want of Horſes to carry them
off, except ſuch as eſcaped by ſwimming, and
ſo got away. <hi>Zolkievius</hi>'s Son, with his Nephew,
and <hi>Struſius,</hi> the two former being weak of
their Wounds, and forſaken by their Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
were made Priſoners, and preſented to the
<hi>Tartarian</hi> Galga. <hi>Zolkievius</hi> had before taken an
eternal farewel of his Son, and then having
made a ſhort confeſſion of his Sins, was loſt in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33398:33"/>
the confuſion, and found dead next morning
upon the Skirts of the Camp. Some ſay he
cauſed himſelf to be killed by one of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
a <hi>Coſſack</hi> chuſing rather to periſh with his
Army than fall into the Enemies hands, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
his own Glory; but the Wounds in his
Sword-hand, on his Face and Breaſt, and a
<hi>Tartarian</hi> laid Dead along by him, ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that he dyed Fighting. <hi>Skinder</hi> Baſſa cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Head to be cut off and fixed upon a
Pike, expoſing it for that day to the view of the
whole Army, and afterward to be ſent to the
Signior his Maſter, as a Teſtimony of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The Lieutenant General <hi>Corecki,</hi> the young
<hi>Zolkievius,</hi> with the other Priſoners of Quality,
were ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where after three
years Impriſonment they were Ranſomed, and
returned to their own Country; and thus, like
a Ship after a long Voyage ſunk in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zolkievius</hi> having through all the accidents of
his Life proceeded regularly, from the Quality
of a private Souldier to the Supream command
of an Army, was raiſed by his own Virtue to
thoſe Honours which rendred him eminent in
thoſe parts of the World; neither was there any
thing wanting to compleat his Glory, beſides
the ſucceſs of this Unfortunate Retreat, which
was reduced to that point, that there wanted
but one hour to render him eminent among
the moſt Illuſtrious Captains of Antiquity.
It is held on all hands, that the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
part of Military Service is a Retreat, and
it may be judged hard meaſure to deny
<hi>Zolkievius</hi> the Honour of having acquitted
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33398:34"/>
himſelf well in that particular, ſince he had
brought it within view of the Harbour; but as
the Honour of the Succeſs had been intirely his
if he had proſpered, ſo his memory muſt be
patient of this Cloud drawn over the luſtre of
it, by the failing of ſome mean Officer in omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to give the Signal of his March. But here
did he fall, and was laid upon the Bed of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
in the extremity of his Age, refuſing to
live when he could not do it gloriouſly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Skinder</hi> Baſſa, either grown uneaſie at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of this Victory, or that ſome great ones
at Court were unworthily emulous of his Glory,
had contracted many Enemies near the Grand
Signior, who upon all occaſions did him ill Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but finding that infection to work ſlowly,
they corrupted ſome of his neareſt Servants,
who by the infuſion of Poyſon in his Drinks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
him ſuddenly, ſo that he did not long
ſurvive the Unfortunate <hi>Zolkierius,</hi> being in
this more Unhappy, That he expired in the
quality of a Criminal, and that no certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
can be given of him, but that he Died in
the year 1620.</p>

            <head>The Fiery Misfortune.</head>
            <p>IN the year 1618. <hi>Dec. 28.</hi> I <hi>George Bonlekoe</hi>
went Aboard the Ship Named the <hi>New Horn,</hi>
burthen eleven hundred Tun, and two hundred
and ſix Men, and Sailed from the <hi>Texel</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
bound for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> In three days
we loſt ſight of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts, the fourth ſo
great a Storm aroſe, that we were forced to let
down our Top-Sails, and increaſing in the Night,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33398:34"/>
five great Waves rolled over our Veſſel, which
filling our Deck with Water, made our Men cry
out, <hi>We ſink, the Port-holes are open.</hi> Hearing
that, I ran to the fore part of the Ship, but found
them all cloſe, and freed the Men from their
fear. I ſent a Man into the Hold, who found no
Water there. We drained our Deck with Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
and threw over-board the Seamens Cheſts,
which by rolling about much incommoded us;
the Wind and Rain were ſo violent, that the
Sky and Sea ſeemed joined together, and the
Lightning made all appear like a Flame. The
Storm ſtill continued, when we perceived great
Flocks of Sea-Gulls, which made us think we
were near the Iſle of <hi>Breſil,</hi> though we could
not ſee it; at length the fury of the Winds broke
off our Main-Maſt about five yards above Deck,
which put us in great fear, but with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
we made our Fore-maſt to ſerve in the
place.</p>
            <p>The Tempeſt continued ſixteen days and then
the Wind ceaſed. When having repaired our
Tackle we purſued our Voyage, ſteering our
courſe to the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, and perceiving a
Ship behind us we ſtopt our courſe expecting
her, and found it was the <hi>New Zealand,</hi> who
had ſuffered no dammage by the Storm. Next
day we met with another, called the <hi>New Enchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi>
both bound for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> ſo we Sailed
all three in company, making merry every day
Aboard of each other, and paſſing by the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
came to the Iſles of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Fonges,</hi> where
the Miſts and Rains were ſo thick, that we loſt
ſight of each other. We ſounded at <hi>Fonges</hi> but
ſound no bottom, and ſent our Long-Boat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33398:35"/>
the ſhore, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at Land ſhot
at them with Muskets, and would not ſuffer
them to come aſhore; whereupon having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a few Fiſh, we weighed Anchor and Sail'd
toward the Equinoctial Line. Next morning
we again diſcovered our two Companions, and
joyfully ſaluted each other, who told us, That
Landing at the Iſle of <hi>May</hi> to buy ſome Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> oppoſed and killed two of
their Men, which made them return empty.
At length arriving under the Line, the Weather
calmed, and the Winds were ſo uncertain, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
turning all the Compaſs at once, that we
were obliged to ſtay there three Weeks. The
Sea was calm in the Day and rough at Night,
and the Waves that beat againſt our Veſſel
ſeemed like Flames of Fire.</p>
            <p>We proceeded toward the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi>
and ſaw Sea-Gulls chequer'd with black Spots
on their Wings, of which we took ſeveral, with
an Inſtrument whereto a little Bell was tyed. Theſe
Fowls appear always near the Cape, and guided us
thither, but the Wind blowing hard, we paſſed it
without Landing, ſince all our people were in
Health, this being about the end of <hi>May,</hi> five
months after our departure from <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſteered our courſe toward <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> and
parted company with the two other Ships, who
both took a different courſe. At this time ſeveral of
our Men were Sick, whereupon we endeavoured
to Land, perceiving ſeveral perſons walking along
the ſhore; one of our Men got aſhore and ſpoke to
them, but could not underſtand what they ſaid, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by ſigns perceived that they informed us there
was a better Landing place a little lower. Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33398:35"/>
with no freſh Proviſions here, to the great grief
of the Sick people (whoſe number daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and ſome of them dyed) they came to the
Captains Cabbin, and deſired him to ſeek Land,
affirming they ſhould recover as ſoon as they
came aſhore by the help of the Air.</p>
            <p>The Captain hereupon reſolved to Sail to the
Iſle of <hi>Maſcarius,</hi> but when he arrived there,
the Wind was ſo ſtrong, that <hi>Heyn Roll</hi> our
Merchant would not conſent they ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to go aſhore, yet at length, by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of the Sick men, they were put into a
Shallop, having a Sail to make a Tent, with
Oil, Vinegar, Kettles, and other Utenſils, along
with them, and ſo were ſet aſhore, where they
inſtantly threw themſelves on the Graſs, and in
a ſhort time found much benefit from the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Air. We diſcovered ſeveral Pidgeons
and Ring-Doves on the Trees, who ſuffered us
to take them with our Hands; of which we kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and waſted two hundred in one Day. We
found likewiſe ſtore of Shell-fiſh, which we Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Damask-Prunes brought from <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this place being inconvenient, I went in
the Shallop, vvith ſeveral others, upon diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and five Leagues further vve found Springs
of Water near the ſhore, but ſomevvhat brackiſh
by communication vvith the Sea. Here vvere
Ring-Doves, gray Parrots, and other Fovvl, vvith
a great number of Tortoiſes, 25 of them together
ſometimes ſhading themſelves under a Tree; vve
took as many as vve pleaſed, for they did not fear
us. There vvas likevviſe a ſort of Animals vvith
ſmall Wings but could not fly, being ſo fat that
they drevv their Tails after them on the ground;
and vvere ſcarce able to move.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:33398:36"/>
It was pleaſant to obſerve, that when we made
a Parrot or other Bird cry and make a noiſe, all
that heard it came to his relief, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
taken. We then put our Sick men aboard
the Ship, and brought them to this place, and
then eight of our Seamen were ſent to fetch in
Proviſion and Fiſh in the Rivers, where they
catch'd ſtore of excellent Fiſh, ſome as big as
Salmons. Here was a little River of freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
on the brink whereof grew ſuch thick Trees,
and in ſo exact order, as if they had been plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yielding a very fine proſpect. We found
here a Plank, wherein was cut in great Letters,
<hi>That Admiral</hi> Adrian Maerts, <hi>ſtanding into this
Road with thirteen Sail of Ships, and having ſent
ſome Shallops to Land, they were all daſhed in pieces
by a furious Storm, and all the Men drowned;</hi> but
during our ſtay the Sea was calm enough. Our
Men run over all the Iſland without meeting
with any Humane Creature, but found good
ſtore of Birds, and another River full of Fiſh;
and pulling off their Shirts, and ſpreading them
on the Water, catch'd ſeveral excellent Eeles.
Every morning we had the pleaſure to ſee the
Tortoiſes come out of the Sea to run upon the
ſhore, digging holes in the Sand wherein to lay
their Eggs, the number of which were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two hundred, and then covering up the
holes that lay next the Sun, they left them to be
hatch'd by the heat thereof, from whence we
might ſee young Tortoiſes no bigger than Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts,
running upon the Sand.</p>
            <p>In this place were many Palm-trees, from
whence we drew a very pleaſant Liquor. We
ſaw ſeveral Deer, but ſo Wild that we took only
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33398:36"/>
an old one whoſe Horns were Worm-eaten, and
the fleſh unpleaſant to eat. We ſet up a Sun
Dial to know how the time paſſed. Our Sick
being fully recovered, and our Veſſel trimmed
and aired, we beat a Drum for our people to
bring aboard all the Proviſions; one of whom
by ſhooting at a Fowl, loſt his Eye by the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gun. After we had Sojourned twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
one days in this ſmall Iſland, we Sailed for
St. <hi>Marys</hi> near <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> the Water on the
ſhore being clear like Chryſtal, ſo that we could
diſcern the bottom; the Inhabitants perceiving us,
came in their Canoa's, made out of an hollow
Tree, to our Ships ſide, bringing with them
Apples, Citurns, Rice and Fowl, but we could
not underſtand them, only they cried out, <hi>Bonu
Bee Cou, Que Cicou,</hi> ſignifying thereby that they
had Cows, Calves, Sheep and Fowls, and that
what they brought was only a ſmall ſample.
We beheld them with much amazement, and
gave them a great Bowl of Wine, into which
putting their Heads they drunk like Beaſts, and
the fumes of the Wine getting into their Brains,
made them ſhew a thouſand Antick Tricks.
They vvere Naked, only their Nuditives cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vvith a Skin, their complexion yellovv, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to brovvn, by rubbing themſelves vvith a
certain Oyl to keep off the heat of the Sun. We
went daily on ſhore to exchange with them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Bells, Spoons, Knives, and Coral for Calves,
Sheep, Rice and Milk. They brought Milk in
Leaves made like a cloſe Basket, ſo that we
were forced to pierce a hole to get it out.</p>
            <p>After two or three days ſtay, we Sailed three
or four Leagues further, where going on ſhore we
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33398:37"/>
met vvith nothing but Apples and Melons,
which we little valued. The Ships Council or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
me to go aſhore at <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> where we,
found little Fruit. We had a Muſician in the
Ship, who playing before the Inhabitants, they
were ſo taken therewith, that they ſtood ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
for ſome time admiring him, and then fell
a Dancing round him, in ſeveral pleaſant poſtures.
They ſeem ignorant of any God, ſetting up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Houſes the Heads of Oxen on Spikes,
to whom they kneel, and make Adoration; we
endeavoured to inform them better but to no
purpoſe, and returning aboard, directed our
courſe to the Streight of <hi>Sumda,</hi> and arriving to
the height thereof, which was five Degrees and
an half North Latitude, <hi>Novemb. 19.</hi> the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
after Dinner went down into the Hold with
a Candle to fill his Runlet with <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi>
that it might be ready next morning to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
a Cup to every one according to Cuſtom.
He ſtrikes the ſharp end of his Candleſtick into
an Hogſhead above that he drew from, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
finiſhed his buſineſs, endeavours to pluck
it out again, which he did with ſuch force, that
a ſpark of the Light fell into the Hogſhead of
<hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> which inſtantly took Fire, and put
it all into a Flame; I being on the Deck, and
hearing the Steward cry Fire, look'd down
through the Hatches and ſaw him throwing
Water into it, and running down could then
perceive no Fire. Nay, I thruſt my Arm into
the Hogſhead, and could feel none, the Water
ſeeming to have extinguiſhed it: I went away,
but ſoon after the Fire increaſed ſo much, that
its violence cauſed the bottom of the Hogſhead
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33398:37"/>
to fly out, whereby the Flame diſperſed it ſelf
on a heap of Sea-coal that lay underneath, and
ſet it on Fire, which ſo much alarm'd us, that
we all run to quench it, but found it difficult,
ſince three rows of Hogſheads lay one upon
another; and by throwing Water on the Coals,
ſo thick and ſulphurous a ſmoak aroſe as almoſt
ſtifled us. I propoſed to <hi>Heyn Roll</hi> our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
to throw the Gun-powder over-board,
but he abſolutely refuſed to conſent to it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
It was ſtill poſſible to quench the Fire.
<hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we throw our Powder away, how ſhall
we defend our ſelves if attack'd by an Enemy?
And if taken, How ſhall we excuſe our ſelves to our
Owners?</hi> So the Powder remained in the
Ship.</p>
            <p>The Fire ſtill prevailing, and none being able
to ſtay in the Hold for the ſmoak, we made,
divers holes in the Deck, through which we
threw down a great quantity of Water, but all
in vain: The Shallop had been near three
Weeks in the Water drawn after the Ship.
Some of the Men got into the Cock-boat to
have more room to Work, and our fear increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
ſeeing nothing but the Heavens and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without hope of Succour, others ſlid along
down the Ships ſide into the Sea, and Swam to
the Shallop to ſecure themſelves. <hi>Heyn Roll</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Fore-Deck, wondred to ſee ſo many
people in the two Boats; they ſpying him, called
out they were ready to depart, and if he would
go along with them he muſt haſten down. He
accordingly conſented, and being come down,
deſired them to give the Captain notice and take
him in, but they would not conſent to it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33398:38"/>
cutting the Ropes and going off. I
knew nothing of this, being very earneſt in
quenching the Flames, when a Sailor ſurprized
me, ſaying, <hi>Good Captain what ſhall we do,
ſince the Shallop and Long-Boat have left the
Ship, and are under Sail? If they are gone,</hi> ſaid
I, <hi>They never deſign to return again;</hi> and running
up the Ropes I perceived them, and thereupon
cauſed all the Sails to be hoiſted up, and Sailed
after them, but coming within three Ships
length, they rowed up againſt the Wind and
eſcaped: Whereupon I incouraged the reſt of
my Men afreſh, ſaying, <hi>Sirs, next to God, all
our Help is in our own Hands, let us every one
fall to Work, and try again what we can do;
go firſt and throw away the Powder.</hi> Which
was done, but the Fire being got to the loweſt
part of the Hold, we could not come near it
becauſe of the Iron and other Goods, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I reſolved to let in the Water five Foot
deep to quench it, and the Carpenter made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Holes to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Nothing but Sighs and Weeping were now
obſerved amongſt us, yet continuing vigorouſly
to pour down Water, the Fire ſeemed to abate;
but to check our hopes, it ſoon after took hold
of the Oyls which we had in great quantity
aboard. After which, the more Water we threw
the more the flame increaſed: Then it was that
our Ruin appeared to be without remedy, and
our Wailings and Lamentations grew greater,
all Succour failing, and the devouring Ocean
being ready to ſwallow us up, and though we
had thrown ſixty Barrels of Powder over-board,
yet there remained at leaſt three hundred ſtill in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33398:38"/>
the Ship which we could not get at, ſo that at
length the Fire reached them, and immediately
the Ship, with one hundred and nineteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
were blown up into the Air: I, with ſixty
five more, were on the Deck, expecting this
fatal blow, clinging to the Main-maſt, in hope
to fall with it into the Water and ſave our
ſelves, but are all blown into the Air with the
reſt, and I who was their Captain, ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Death before my Eyes, cryed out,
<hi>O my God, have pity upon me,</hi> verily believing
this was the laſt moment of my Life, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the blow did much aſtoniſh me, yet I was
not wholly ſenceleſs, but retained ſome remains
of Hope and Courage. Thus I fell into the
Water, near the Wreck of the Ship which
was ſhivered into a thouſand pieces, and taking
breath a little, looking about I perceived the
Main-maſt on one ſide of me, and the Fore-maſt
on the other, whereupon I got aſtride on
the Main-maſt, and obſerving the diſmal Ruins
of the Ship, I cryed out, <hi>Good God! what a
fine Veſſel is periſhed and deſtroyed in a moment
like</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorah! In making theſe
Reflexions, I perceived a Young man Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
who got hold of the Keel of our Ship,
ſaying, <hi>I have caught it: Good God!</hi> ſaid I, <hi>is
there any one yet alive?</hi> I obſerved a little
Maſt driven by the Waves toward him, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to thruſt, it toward me, that whereon
I was ballancing too much, and I being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
without great pain, to ſtir my ſelf, having
two large Wounds in my Head and Back, and
my Arms and Thighs ſorely bruiſed, <hi>O God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
ſaid I, <hi>yet but a little while and I am a loſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33398:39"/>
Man.</hi> We got both on this Maſt, he before
and I behind, with each of us a Board in our
Hands, when the Young-man hoiſting up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
diſcovered the Shallop, but at ſo great a
diſtance, that he could not perceive whither the
Poop or Prow were towards us.</p>
            <p>The Sun was now ſetting, which much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
us, who had no hope but in Heaven, to
which we continually addreſs'd our Prayers:
At length we were comfortably ſurprized with
the ſight both of the Shallop and Cock-Boat,
which came very near us; I called out to them,
<hi>Save your Captain:</hi> They anſwered me, <hi>Is our
Captain ſtill alive?</hi> I told them, <hi>I am the Perſon.</hi>
The Young-man, my Companion, ſet himſelf
couragiouſly to Swimming, but I being diſabled
by my Wounds and Bruiſes, cried out, <hi>If they
would have me they muſt come and fetch me.</hi>
Then they made up toward me, and our Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter
threw out a Rope, which I faſtened about
my middle; and thus they drew me to them.
I had formerly made a little Lodge in my Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
for two perſons, wherein I was laid, it being
thought I would ſoon expire. <hi>Heyn Roll,</hi> and
others, viſited me, whom I adviſed to keep all
Night near the Wreck, to ſee if they could find
any Proviſions, or a Compaſs to find Land,
for they left the Ship in ſuch haſte, that they
took not any Meat nor Drink with them:
They told me likewiſe, that the Pilot had taken
away the Compaſs out of his Lodge, as foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we muſt abandon the Ship.</p>
            <p>That Night <hi>Heyn Roll</hi> made the Sea-men
Row hard to try if they could perceive Land,
but at Day-break, to their great trouble, they

could ſee none. They came and asked my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
I told them they had done ill in not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
near the Wreck laſt Night, where they
might have found ſtore of Proviſions, ſince I
had ſeen pieces of Fleſh and Cheeſe ſwim in
great quantities about our Legs, ſo that we
could ſcarce make way for them when we were
on the Maſt. They deſired me to riſe a little,
which I did with much difficulty; I demanded
what Proviſions they had, they brought me two
little Barrels with about eight pound of Bisket,
which was their whole Stock. <hi>Comerades,</hi> ſaid
<hi>I, this will not do, lay by your Oars, for you do
but weary your ſelves with Rowing, take your
Shirts and make Sails of them;</hi> which they did.
I offered mine but they would not accept it,
deſiring to preſerve my life. We were about
forty ſix perſons in the Shallop, and twenty ſix
in the ſmall Boat; in all ſeventy two. There
was a good Morning Gown and Cuſhion in the
ſmall Boat which were given me. Our Surgeon
having no Remedies left, ſtop'd the two holes in
my Head with chewed Bread, which with Gods
aſſiſtance cured them.</p>
            <p>Our Sails being ready, we ſteered by the
courſe of the Stars, though we could ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
their Riſing and Sitting; the Night was
extream cold, and the day very hot, the Sun
ſhining juſt over our Heads. We invented an
Inſtrument, by the Coopers help, to take the
Suns height, and afterwards with Chalk made
a little Sun-Dial. I cut on a Plank, behind the
Shallop, a Chart, in the beſt manner I could,
and there deſcribing the Iſles of <hi>Sumatra, Java,</hi>
and the Streight of <hi>Sunda,</hi> lying between theſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33398:40"/>
tvvo Iſlands. That day the Ship vvas loſt, I
had taken the height, and found we were in
five Degrees and half South Latitude, and now
found we were near ninety Leagues from Land.
I made likewiſe a Compaſs, and directed our
courſe ſeventy Leagues ſide-ways to get Land,
that we might the better know where to
go.</p>
            <p>I now diſtributed our ſmall ſtore of Bisket,
giving every man his allowance, which was not
much bigger than ones Finger; this was ſoon
gone, and we had no Drink, ſo that our thirſt
was inſupportable, but ſoon after it happened to
Rain, and we ſtretch'd out our Sails to receive
it, and wringing the Water into our little Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
filled them therewith. I made one of my
Shooes ſerve for a Cup, and cauſed every Man
to take his turn in coming to the Barrel, and
having drank, to give place to his companion.
They intreated me to Drink my fill, which I
would not, contenting my ſelf with the ſame
portion as the reſt. And thus we kept together,
but the Shallop out-ſailing the Cock-boat, and
there being none in it that underſtood Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they beg'd of me to be received into the
Shallop, but the Seamen oppoſed it, ſaying,
That though the Shallop was large, yet it could
not hold ſo great a number, and thereupon they
cut the Ropes and left them. Great was our
calamity being without Proviſions, and out of
ſight of Land, yet I ſtill incouraged them, by
ſaying they were not far from it; but they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
often, crying out, <hi>Our Captain tells us
more than he knows, ſince we every day ſeem
to be at a greater diſtance from it.</hi> But when it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33398:40"/>
ſeemed impoſſible for us to ſubſiſt any longer,
it pleaſed God to ſend a great number of Sea-Gulls,
who flew about us as if they deſired to
to be taken; we caught ſome of them, but had
not patience to pluck off the Feathers, yet eat
them with as good an Appetite as if they had
been dreſt.</p>
            <p>But ſtill deſcrying no Land, we began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair;
thoſe in the other Boat coming up, again
beg'd us to take them in, which at length we
did, eſteeming it better to dye all together, ſince
there was no ſign of Relief, being then in all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
two Souls without either Meat or Drink,
or expectation of getting any. Looking thus
woefully upon each other, by the goodneſs of
Heaven a great quantity of flying Fiſh roſe
from the Water, flying till their Wings were
dry, and then fell down into our Boat; we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſeized and divided them, and eat them
raw, which comforted us and kept us from ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
ſo that none dyed, which was wonderful,
ſince many already drank Sea-Water, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all my Remonſtrances; others held
Musket-bullets in their Mouths; other again
drunk their own Urine ſo long as it was good,
but at length it would not ſerve.</p>
            <p>Our calamity ſtill increaſing, we began to
look upon one another with a cruel eye, plainly
diſcovering our deſign to feed upon each other:
At laſt, it came almoſt to an open reſolution,
that the Boys ſhould be killed and eaten firſt,
and then they would caſt Lots amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
It is impoſſible to expreſs the Horror
which I had at this propoſal, perceiving their
readineſs to execute it; I therefore earneſtly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33398:41"/>
begged of God to change their Minds, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them from this Cruelty, and going to
them, ſaid, <hi>Friends, I do aſſure you we are not
far from Land, for I know it by my Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
hope in God and he will relieve us.</hi>
They replied, <hi>I were uſed to entertain them
with ſuch diſcourſes,</hi> telling me plainly, <hi>That if
they diſeerned no Land in ſuch a time, they
would certainly begin to eat the Boys.</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
their barbarous Reſolution, I reiterated
my moſt earneſt Prayers to the Almighty, not
to ſuffer us to be tempted beyond our power,
but to guide and direct us to ſome place of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We were grown ſo lean and faint that we
could ſcarce ſtand, and our Merchant <hi>Heyn Roll</hi>
was not able to riſe from the ground, ſo that my
whole buſineſs was to go from Poop to Prow to
comfort them, though I wanted as much conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
my ſelf.</p>
            <p>We Sailed thus at all Adventures till <hi>Dec. 2.
1619.</hi> being the thirteenth day ſince we loſt our
Ship: We had then ſome Rain, which we
greedily received, and filled our two ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and every Man at Night ſtood back to
back againſt each other like Sheep againſt the
cold. Next morning the Weather cleared up
and the Quarter-maſter being at the Helm, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
out, <hi>Land, Land, Land:</hi> All our people
extreamly rejoyced at the News, and taking
freſh ſtrength and courage; we hoiſted up our
Sails, and got aſhore that very Day, where we
praiſed God, that had not ſuffered us to commit
the crime we were about to perpetrate, for this
was the laſt Day prefixt for this cruel and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Reſolution of eating the Boys. We forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33398:41"/>
the Iſland, and found abundance of Coco-Nuts
but no freſh Water; we drew a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Liquor from them, and eat the Meat. We
could find no Man on the place, though it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have been Inhabited, but ſaw a Serpent as
big as our largeſt Barrels. This Iſland is diſtant
four or five Leagues from <hi>Sumatra;</hi> we coaſted
Eaſtward as long as our Nuts laſted, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpent, we kept near the Iſle to find a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
to Land, becauſe the roughneſs of the
Sea made it dangerous, and likewiſe a Bank of
Sand; but at length, we got aſhore without any
other dammage than being wet with the daſhing
of the Waves.</p>
            <p>Here we found freſh Water, and Beans
amongſt the Herbs, and a little further Tobacco
and a Fire, which was very pleaſing to us Since
we knew the Iſland was Inhabited, we kindled a
Fire in ſix or ſeven places, repoſing our ſelves
about it, and at Night placed Sentinels to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſurprizals from the Inhabitants. In the
Night we were as ſick and griped with the Beans
as we had been before with the Coco's; and at
the ſame time the Natives, favoured by the
darkneſs, came upon us; of which our Sentinels
gave us notice, and though we were Sick, and
had no other Weapons but two Hatchets and an
old ruſty Sword, yet we reſolved to ſell our
Lives as dear as poſſible, and ranging our men
in Battle, vvith each a Fire brand ſtretch'd out
at full length in his Hand, and the ſparkles fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Air, vve approached the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
vvho vvere much aſtoniſh'd, not diſcerning
vvhat Arms vve had, and thereupon fled vvith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
all ſpeed, and vve returned to our Fires, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33398:42"/>
ſtood upon our Guard. In the morning vve
ſaw three Men coming toward us, and ſome of
our Company ſpoke to them in the <hi>Malay</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and they asking who we were, he told
them <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that had loſt their Ship by Fire,
and deſired Proviſions, which they ſoon after
brought, both of Rice and Fowl, for which
we paid eight Crowns, and divided it betwixt
us, and met with a Liquor as ſtrong as Wine,
in a ſmall Village, of which we drunk each his
ſhare. The Natives ſet down by us, but ſpake
not a Word, ſeeming amazed to ſee us.</p>
            <p>After this I bought a Buffle of them for five
Crowns, but he was ſo Wild I could not take
him, ſo our Men ſtaid aſhore to catch him, and
I went in a Canoa, with two Negro's, to the
Shallop, who I ſuppoſe deſigned to do me a
miſchief if there had been opportunity, but I
uſed ſuch rough Language toward them, that
they ſaw I did not fear them. Next morning
we ſaw two men bringing a Buffle, which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
not to be the ſame, asked them why
our Men did not return; they ſaid, They had
not yet caught the Buffle. Well, ſaid I, we will
make ſure of this, and ordered the Serjeant to
cut off his Legs, at which the Buffle fell, and
the Negro's ſet up an horrid cry, upon which
two or three hundred more came out of a
Wood upon us, deſigning to ſurprize us by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
betwixt us and the Shallop, but our three
Sentinels gave notice of it, and came to our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
they approaching us with Swords and
Javelins; whereupon we made to our Shallop,
and they purſued us furiouſly to the ſide of it.
The Baker of our Ship wrought Wonders with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33398:42"/>
our ruſty Sword, and two others did the ſame
with the two Hatchets, but finding our ſelves
over-powered, we cut our Cable and Sailed
away; ſome of the Negro's lay Dead, and
others Wounded, on the Water. The valiant
Baker received a Wound in his Belly by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed
Arrow, of which he died. We loſt
twelve Men in the Fight, and four that were
left aſhore, which we were very loth to depart
without, but having only eight Hens, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Rice for fifty perſons, we Sailed along the
Coaſts, near the Rocks, and found ſtore of
ſmall Oyſters.</p>
            <p>We left the Bay, and Sailed upon the Main
Sea, to find out the Iſland of <hi>Java,</hi> and went
aſhore again in another Iſland, where we found
ſome Bamboos and Palm-trees, the tops where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
being very tender we eat. Here from the
top of an high Mountain I diſcovered the
Streight of <hi>Sunda,</hi> and the Iſles of <hi>Java</hi> and
<hi>Sumatra,</hi> which was joyful news to us all, being
impatient to ſee ſome of our own Country-men
once more, who had a Factory there. Sailing
on we met with ſome <hi>Holland</hi> Ships, and among
others, one of thoſe who loſt company of us
near the <hi>Canary</hi>-Iſlands, who at firſt did not
know us, but when we diſcovered our ſelves,
the Captain embraced us with Tears of Joy,
and we went aboard his Ship, relating to him at
large our woeful Misfortunes, which he could
not hear without much emotion. He gave us
a Yatch to go to <hi>Battavia,</hi> where <hi>John Peter
Koen</hi> kept his Court, where being arrived, we
told the Guards we deſired to ſpeak with the
Lord-General, who having notice thereof, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33398:43"/>
us to be brought into his preſence: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we had paid our reſpects to him, we gave
an account of our ſelves, and of the fatal acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that had occaſioned the burning of our
Ship, and all the ſad Diſaſters attending us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
He replied, <hi>It was indeed a miſerable
Accident, but God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>has miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
you in all your Dangers.</hi> He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Attendants to bring ſome Canary: My
Lord Drank to me in a great Cup of Gold, and
ſaid I was welcome, and that we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
our ſelves as Men that had once loſt our
Lives, and now by Gods great Mercy had found
them again; adding, <hi>I muſt be gone this Night
to</hi> Bantam <hi>upon urgent occaſions, do you remain
here and eat at my Table till my return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eight days after we were ordered to attend
him at <hi>Bantam,</hi> where he ſent for me, ſaying;
<hi>Captain</hi> Bontekoe, <hi>go on Board the</hi> Shepherd
<hi>Veſſel till further Order.</hi> I accepted this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
with hearty thanks, and <hi>Heyn Roll</hi> had
likewiſe a Commiſſion to exerciſe Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize:
Soon after my Ship, with two others,
were ſent toward the Coaſts of <hi>China,</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to a Town called <hi>Laritoeken,</hi> whoſe Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
named <hi>Specks</hi> and <hi>Meſtis</hi> much obſtructed
Trade, thereupon our Council reſolved that we
ſhould Attack, and endeavour to Deſtroy them;
in purſuance whereof, we put ſome Men aſhore,
who ſet ſome Houſes on Fire, on purpoſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Inhabitants by quenching them, to give
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the better opportunity to Land our Forces,

               </gap>, made two Sallies upon us, and killed twenty

            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:33398:43"/>
Having taken in freſh Water, we Sailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Amboina,</hi> and parting with <hi>Heyn Roll,</hi> not
without much regret, remembring the miſeries
we both jointly ſuffered, we at length arrived at
the famous City of <hi>Batavia,</hi> where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
received me favourably, and made me
Captain of a better Ship, newly arrived from
<hi>Holland,</hi> called the <hi>Groningen,</hi> in which I Sailed
to the Road of <hi>Jambay.</hi> Our Pilot went in a
Boat up the River to viſit Captain <hi>Martes,</hi> who
entertained him very kindly; departing from
thence he found himſelf drowſie, and repoſed
on an Hill near the Sea, but in the Night fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Water and was Drowned.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed two years in Voyaging, I was
ſent in company with eight Ships more, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from General <hi>Koen,</hi> to go to <hi>Piſcadoris,</hi> to
oblige the <hi>Chinois</hi> to Trade either by fair means
or foul; and <hi>April 22.</hi> we caſt Anchor before
<hi>Macou,</hi> being now fifteen Sail, and next day we
began to batter the City, and in the mean time
our Commander in chief took the opportunity of
the great Fire we made, to Land ſix hundred
Men, the Enemy endeavoured to hinder them,
but our men, with their Swords in their Hands,
drove them out of the Trenches which they had
made, and we became Maſters of the lower
ground, and purſued them vigorouſly, when by
accident the fire took our Powder, which the
Enemy underſtanding, came upon us with ſuch
fury, that we were wholly diſordered, and
forced to fly towards our Shallops, in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
with the loſs of one hundred and thirty
of our Men, and near as many Wounded, the
Commander <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> being ſlightly hurt in his Belly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:33398:44"/>
We Sailed from hence toward the Coaſt of
<hi>China,</hi> and met a Jonque richly Laden, bound
for the <hi>Manilles;</hi> we took her, and made two
hundred and fifty <hi>Chinois</hi> Priſoners, and faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Jonque behind our Ship, we ſet fifteen
of our Men to Guard thirty of them, yet ſcarce
thought our ſelves ſafe, and therefore put them
all down in the Hold, and ſhut the Hatches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, ſetting ſix men with their Swords
drawn, and Lamps burning all Night, to Watch
them, making them come up one by one to
Eat. This caution cauſed them to have ſuch
awe of us, that when I walk'd on the Deck, they
ranged themſelves on both ſides to make way,
falling on their Knees before me. One of them
told us, <hi>That a</hi> Chinois <hi>Prophet predicted their
Country ſhould be invaded by Men with red
Beards, and becauſe mine was ſo, they were
perſwaded I was the chief Perſon meant by that
Propheſie.</hi> They came every morning above
Deck to Comb themſelves: There was ſome
among them, whoſe Hair was ſo long that it
come down to their Heels when they ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
which they tyed in knots, and faſtened
with a Bodkin behind. We carried them to <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoris,</hi>
which was the General Rendevouz of
all the Priſoners, who were ſet to work on the
Fortifications of the Fort.</p>
            <p>Having been ſo long abſent from my Native
Country, I was now deſirous to return home
again, and hearing that the Ship called the <hi>Good
Hope,</hi> was bound for <hi>Batavia,</hi> I deſired leave of
the General to return to <hi>Holland,</hi> which at length,
with ſome difficulty, I obtained, and ſet Sail
with the firſt opportunity in company of two
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33398:44"/>
Ships more, and coming toward the <hi>Cape of Good
Hope,</hi> a great Tempeſt aroſe, ſo that I was forced
to let down all my Sails, and give way to the
Wind, which drove our Ship Southward, the
two other Veſſels following our Example, toward
Midnight the Wind increaſed ſo violently, that
we could not ſee what courſe to hold, for the
Wind turned about the Compaſs. Our Main-maſt
was broke off and thrown into the Sea.
This violent Storm or Hurricane continued about
four hours the Sea being not much moved by
it, but the Wind a little abating, it grew ſo
rough and boiſterous that we narrowly eſcaped
being caſt away: Our Decks took in ſo much
Water, that we found it ſeven foot deep in the
Hold. We had ſixty pieces of Braſs and Iron
Cannon aboard, vvhich lay under the Pepper
and Ginger, and rowling about ground ſeveral
Bags of Pepper to Powder, which ſtop'd the
paſſages of our Pump, and much indangered
us; at length we cleared it, and falling ſtoutly
to Pumping, were much incouraged when we
found the Water abate. Our Main-maſt, which
was in the Water, beat ſtrongly againſt our
Ship, ſo that we feared it would much damnifie
it, and obliged us to cut the Ropes that held it.
Next Morning we diſcovered the <hi>Midleburg,</hi> one
of our Company, which had loſt all her Maſts
by the Tempeſt, but the other Ship we ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
was caſt away, for we were carried into a
place where the Sea was of a brovvn colour, and
vve drevv from thence a quantity of Pepper,
vvhich confirmed us in our belief of her loſs,
to our great grief. The Captain of the <hi>Midleburg</hi>
came in his Long boat, deſiring us to furniſh him
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33398:45"/>
vvith ſome Maſts, which we concluded to do,
much pitying his miſerable condition, but the
Seamen mutiny'd, and ſaid, They had need of
them themſelves; but at length, with threats
and fair Words, I prevailed with them, and ſo
vve furniſhed them with what neceſſaries we had,
and then left them, Sailing toward <hi>Madagaſcar.</hi>
In Coaſting which, we ſavv a certain place on
the Land that burned; and ſoon after, finding
a convenient Road, vve caſt Anchor, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
our Merchandizes aſhore to dry them, and
to repair the Ship. And ſeeing ſome of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
vve made them by ſigns underſtand
vve vvanted a Maſt, and they very obligingly
directed us where to cut one down, which we
did. Whilſt we were thus imployed, the people
hearing of our being there, came from all parts,
bringing with them Cattle, Honey, Wax, and
ſeveral Fruits, ſetting up Tents the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
to Trade with us, telling us, They
vvere at War, and deſired us to aſſiſt them, for
vvhich we ſhould have what we would deſire,
telling us, Their King ſpake <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and kept
his Court ſix miles from thence. We ſent four
perſons to Treat with the King about ſome Rice,
vvho received them kindly, but told them it was
very ſcarce that year, the Locuſts having ſpoiled
it: Which might very well be, for I being one
day far advanced into the Country, they roſe
from the ground like a Cloud, and fell upon
me in ſuch numbers, that I had much difficulty
to breathe. They have Wings to fly; but when
on the ground they leap like Graſhoppers. The
King ſaid he was forced ſometimes to ſend <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
 three hundred men into the Fields to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:33398:45"/>
the Rice, but often to little purpoſe. Some of
the Inhabitants pluck'd off their Wings, and
boil'd and eat them, making ſigns to us to do
the like, but we had no Stomach to them. The
King having Treated our Men, came along
with them to our Ship, and preſented us with
four Oxen, which we kindly received, and gave
him two Muskets, who accepted them, and
took his leave of us. Our Men were ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
they were loth to come away, but that I
threatned them, if they ſtaid, to return to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia;</hi>
ſo they haſtened to repair the Ship, which
was ready to Sail in <hi>April.</hi> Moſt of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
are black, ſome of them had their Hair
dangling about their Shoulders, others wore it
in little curles like Wool, the Women tye up
theirs behind their Head; they rub themſelves
with Tar, and then ſtand in the Sun to make
it ſhine on their Bodies. They go Naked, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome have a little cloth about their Secrets;
others none.</p>
            <p>We now reſolved to depart, but two of our
Seamen having deſerted us, we ſent to find them
but could not; we ſuppoſed ſome Women had
inveigled them away, who are great Lovers of
<hi>Dutch-men,</hi> and we ſaw ſeveral Children half
white: And ſurely had the Country abounded
as well with Wine and Beer as it did with
Women, we ſhould not have got our Men ſo
ſoon off from this Iſland. Therefore leaving
them in this barbarous Country, we ſet Sail for
the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> and ſo Sailing along the
Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> we at length arrived at <hi>Kinſale</hi>
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>November 15. 1625.</hi> after ſo
many perils, misfortunes and deliverances, by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33398:46"/>
Gods Aſſiſtance we came ſafe to <hi>Zealand,</hi> ſeven
years after our departure from thence.</p>

            <p>SOme years ſince, two Ships were ſet forth by
the Town of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to Sail into the
North Seas, to diſcover the Kingdoms of <hi>Cathay</hi>
and <hi>China,</hi> in which <hi>William Barents</hi> went as
chief Pilot. The tenth of <hi>May</hi> we Sailed from
<hi>Amſterdam:</hi> On the fourth of <hi>June</hi> we ſaw
three Suns and four Rainbows; and <hi>John
Corneliſon,</hi> Maſter of the other Ship, with his
Officers, came aboard our Ship, to perſwade
us to alter our courſe, which we refus'd to do,
and ſo parted company. The Ninth of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
our Ship was wholly enclos'd with Ice, on
the Coaſt of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> ſo that we lay three
or four Foot deep in the Ice, and ſeeing that we
could not free our Ship, and that Winter was
coming on, we reſolv'd to Winter there, and
caſt our ſelves upon the Providence of God;
and taking counſel together, we determin'd to
build a Houſe. Immediately eight of us went
aſhore, to find out the convenienteſt place to
erect our Houſe upon, and God in our extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
need ſent us unexpected comfort, for we
found certain Trees, which had been driven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſhore from ſome Neighbouring Region,
for we ſaw none growing in this Deſart Land.
And this Drift-wood ſerv'd not only to erect
our Houſe, but alſo to burn all the Winter long;
which we laid in heaps, that it might not be
cover'd over with Snow. The Wind being
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33398:46"/>
North-Eaſt it was exceeding cold, freezing two
Fingers thick in the Salt Water. We made a
Sled to draw the Wood to the place where we
had concluded to build our Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September 25.</hi> our Carpenter died, and we
Buried him next day under the Sedges, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to dig up the frozen Earth. We began
to Work hard on our Houſe, being ſixteen
Men in all, whereof there was ſtill one or other
Sick; we then carry'd the greateſt part of our
Bread from the Ship to our Houſe, and the day
following brought aſhore our Wine, and other
Victuals. <hi>October 19.</hi> there being but two Men
and a Boy in the Ship, a Bear indeavour'd by
force to get into it, and though they ſhot at her
with pieces of Wood, yet ſhe advanc'd boldly,
whereupon the two Men leapt into the Ballaſt,
and the Boy climb'd to the Fore-maſt top, to
ſave their Lives; but in the mean time, ſome
of our Men fir'd a Musket at her, and then ſhe
run away. The Twentieth being calm Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
Weather, we went to fetch the reſt of our
Beer out of the Ship, where we found ſome of
the Barrels, and even their Iron Hoops, frozen
in pieces. The next day it was ſo great a Snow,
that we could not ſtir out of Doors; the day
after being calm, we went on Board to bring
the reſt of our Men home to our Houſe; but we
found one of them ſick, and perceiving that
the Wind began to blow hard, we were forced
to lye ſtill that day. The Twenty fourth, the
reſt of our Men came to the Houſe, drawing
their ſick Companion on a Sled, and then with
great difficulty we drew our Boat home, and
turn'd the bottom thereof upwards, that if God
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33398:47"/>
in his Mercy ſhould preſerve us, we might make
uſe of it, when time ſerv'd us.</p>
            <p>The Sun in its higheſt Altitude began now to
be very low, and we uſed all the diligence we
could to fetch all neceſſaries out of the Ship, but
when we had Laded the laſt Sled, our Maſter
looking about him perceiv'd three Bears, coming
towards us from behind the Ship, whereupon
he cried out aloud to fright them away, and we
put our ſelves in a poſture of Defence, and, as
good Fortune was, there lay two Halberds on
the Sled, whereof the Maſter took one and I
the other, and reſiſted them as well as we could,
but the reſt of our Men running to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Ship, one of them fell in a Clift of
Ice, which put us in great fear, leſt the furious
Animals ſhould run to devour him, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to purſue the Men that fled towards the
Ship. In the mean time, we and the Man that
fell in the Ice, taking our advantage, got into
the Ship on the other ſide, which the Beaſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
came fiercely towards us, and we doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the two Halberts would not be ſufficient
to defend us, ſtill kept them in play by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Billets at them, and they, every time we
threw, ran after them, as a Dog uſeth to do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Stone that is caſt at him: Mean vvhile
vve ſent one dovvn under Hatches to ſtrike
fire, and another to fetch Pikes, but he could
get no fire, and ſo vve could not ſhoot. At laſt,
as they ruſh'd furiouſly upon us, vve ſtruck one
of them vvith a Halbert on the Snout, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith
feeling her ſelf hurt ſhe gave back, which
the other two being leſs perceiving ran away, and
left us at liberty to draw our Sled quietly to our
Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:33398:47"/>
               <hi>Oct. 27.</hi> it Snowed ſo faſt that we could not
Work without Doors: That day we kill'd a
white Fox, which we Roaſted and eat, it taſted
like Conies fleſh. We alſo ſet up a Lamp, in
vvhich we burnt the Bears Fat. We then fetch'd
Sedges from the Sea ſide, which we laid upon
the Sail that was ſpread upon our Houſe, for we
could not drive the Deals cloſe together for Ice;
vve had great ſtore of Snow, ſo that we durſt
not look out of doors all that day, nor the day
following. <hi>November 2.</hi> one of our men kill'd
a Fox with a Hatchet; before the Sun declin'd
vve ſaw no Foxes, and then the Bears began to
go from us. The fourth day was calm, and the
Sun diſappear'd. Then, our Chyrurgeon made
a Bath for us in a Wine-pipe, into vvhich vve
enter'd one after the other, receiving great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
thereby. The ſame day vve catch'd a Fox.
When the Sun had forſaken us, vve ſavv the
Moon continue both Day and Night.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh day vvas ſo dark, we could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcern the Day from the Night, becauſe our
Clock ſtood ſtill. The eighth, ſtill Weather, we
fetch'd another Sled of Fire-wood, and took a
Fox. Now we ſhar'd our Bread, allowing to
each Man four Pound and ten Ounces in eight
days; our Fleſh and Fiſh we ſhared not, becauſe
vve had greater ſtore thereof, but our Drink
failing, we were oblig'd to divide that alſo:
Yet our beſt Beer had almoſt loſt all its ſtrength
and became inſipid, and beſides there was a
great deal of it ſpilt. The tenth day was calm,
and our Men went into the Ship and found the
Ballaſt cover'd with Water, which they could
not Pump out becauſe it was frozen. We made
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33398:48"/>
a round thing like a Net of Cable-yarn to catch
Foxes withal, and the ſame day caught one.
We ſhar'd our Wine, of which each Man had
for his allowance two Glaſſes a day, but our uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Drink was melted Snow.</p>
            <p>The twentieth was fair ſtill Weather; we
Waſh'd our Sheets, but the cold was ſo violent,
that no ſooner had we wrung them, but they
froze ſo ſtiff, that we might have ſooner torn
them in pieces than open'd them; ſo that we were
forc'd to put them into the Boiling Water again
to thaw. We had now but ſeventeen Cheeſes
left, whereof one we eat amongſt us, and the
reſt were diſtributed to every Man one. The
ſame day we took Foxes in our new Springes:
The twenty ſixth, we were ſo clos'd up with
Snow that we could not get out, but the twenty
ninth being clear Weather, we open'd one of our
Doors, Shoveling away the Snow, and making
clean our Springes, and took a Fox, of whoſe
skins we made Caps to defend our Heads againſt
the extremity of the cold. The thirtieth being
fair Weather, ſix of us went to the Ship well
Arm'd to ſee how it lay, and took a Fox alive
under the Fore-Deck. Then for three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the Snow fell in ſuch abundance, that we
could not ſtir out of the Houſe, and were ſo
tormented with ſmoke that we durſt hardly make
a Fire; and ſo we were forc'd to lye ſtill in our
Cabbins, heating Stones to warm our Feet.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Froſt was ſo vehement,
that the Walls and Roof of our Houſe were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Ice tvvo Inches thick, and becauſe
vve could not get out, vve ſet up a Glaſs of
tvvelve hours, ſtill vvatching to turn it up vvhen
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33398:48"/>
run out, leſt we ſhould miſs our time. The
fourth of <hi>December</hi> it clear'd up, and then we
began by turns to dig open our Doors, and made
clean our Fox-Traps. The ſixth was foul again,
and the cold ſo inſupportable, that what Fire
ſoever we made it would not warm us; yea, our
Sack was frozen ſo hard, that we were forc'd to
melt it in the Fire, of which each man had
about half a Pint allow'd him every ſecond
day, at other times drinking Water. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
continued foul and ſtormy, ſo that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
together what were beſt for us to do, one
of the company advis'd us to burn Sea-coals,
which would caſt a great and durable heat; at
Evening we made a great Fire thereof, which
caſting a good and agreeable warmth, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us much: And therefore being deſirous to
continue the heat, we concluded to ſtop up all
the Doors and Chimney, and lying down in
our Cabbins a while talking together, at laſt we
were taken with a vertiginous dizzineſs in our
Heads, and almoſt all ſtifl'd with a choaking
Vapour. We firſt perceiv'd our danger by
means of a Sick man, who was leſs able no bear
it, and immediately ſome of the company that
were ſtrongeſt, ſtarting out of their Cabbins,
firſt open'd the Chimney and the Doors, but he
that open'd the Door fell down in a Swoon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Snow, which I hearing, for my Cabbin
was next the Door, I run to him, and throwing
Vinegar upon his Face, brought him to his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
again. No ſooner were the Doors open, but
we all recover'd our former Healths, and ſo
the cold, which till now we had eſteem'd as our
bittereſt and moſt dreadful Enemy, prov'd our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33398:49"/>
beſt Friend, and the only Preſerver of our
Lives.</p>
            <p>After this, the Maſter gave to every one of us
a little Wine to comfort our Hearts, and the
Weather being clear, and the Sky full of Stars,
we ſet our Door wide open, and made ready
our Springes, and took two Foxes. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
the Air was clear, but ſo cold that our
Shooes froze as hard as Horns on our feet, ſo
that we could not wear them, and therefore
made things reſembling great Pattins, the upper
part being of Sheeps skins, which we put on
over three or four pair of Socks. Our Clothes
were all white with Froſt, yet we durſt not
burn more Coals, for our late misfortune had
taught us, That to ſhun one danger we ſhould
run into another. We had now burnt all our
Fire-Wood, but there lay ſome round about the
Houſe, which with great pain we dig'd up and
brought in, Working by turns, being hardly
able to endure the extremity of the Cold, though
we wore Fox-skins about our Heads, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Apparel on our Backs. The eighteenth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clear Weather, ſeven of us going to the
Ship, found a Fox in the Cabbin, and obſerv'd
that in eighteen days abſence the Water was
riſen about a Finger high, but it was all Ice.
Next day there aroſe ſuch a Storm, that the
Houſe was encloſed with Snow, yet we heard
the Foxes running over our Houſe, and one of
our company ſaying it was an ill ſign we ask'd
the reaſon; he reply'd, Becauſe we could not
put them into the Pot, or Roaſt them. The
foul Weather and the cold were now ſo invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
that all the means we us'd to defend our
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33398:49"/>
ſelves againſt it were to no purpoſe, and in the
morning our Cabbins were all frozen, ſo that
as the days began to lengthen, the cold began to
ſtrengthen, for <hi>December 27.</hi> it continued ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and cold, ſo that as we ſat by a great Fire
and were ready to burn on the fore-ſide, our
Backs were frozen white. The day after it
clear'd up, and we open'd the Door, digging a
hole through the Snow, and went out of the
Houſe upon ſeven or eight ſteps, each of the
height of a Foot, and going to make clean
our Springes, we found in one of them a dead
Fox, frozen as hard as a Stone, which we
brought into the Houſe, and ſome of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thaw'd and eat it. The thirtieth, next day,
was ſtormy again, ſo that all our labour was in
vain, and we were ſtill Priſoners, and ſo cold,
that we burnt our Hoſe before we could feel the
heat, and if we had not ſooner ſmelt than felt
them, we ſhould have burnt them before we had
known it.</p>
            <p>The firſt day of the New-year, the Weather
continued as cold, foul, and Snowy, as before,
and we ſhar'd our Wine again, dividing it into
ſmaller portions. We had almoſt burnt all our
Wood, yet durſt not go out to fetch more, but
we found ſome pieces that lay over the Door,
and alſo clove the Blocks whereon we us'd to
beat our Stock-fiſh, but not daring yet to ſtir
abroad to know from what point the Wind blew,
we thruſt a Half-pike out at the Chimney, with
a little cloth or feather on the top, but to no
purpoſe, for it was inſtantly frozen as hard as
Wood. <hi>January</hi> the ſixth was calm, ſo we
dig'd our Door open, and carrying out the filth,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33398:50"/>
made every thing handſom, and fetch'd in Wood.
We alſo dug a great hole in the Snow without
the Houſe, in which we might caſt our filth;
and after all our labour, remembring that it
was <hi>Twelfth-day,</hi> we pray'd the Maſter to let us
be merry that Night, and were content to ſpend
ſome of the Wine that we had ſpared before,
ſo that Night we drank to the three Kings, and
having two pound of Meal, we made Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes
with Oil, and a white Bisket for every
Man, which we ſop'd in Wine. We alſo made
Tickets, and our Gunner was King of <hi>Nova
Zembla.</hi> The eighth being fair Weather, we
began to obſerve Day-light, which comforted us
not a little. The tenth, ſeven of us well Arm'd
went to the Ship, which we found in the ſame
ſtate we left it in, but obſerv'd many foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
of Bears, and perceiv'd that the Water
was riſen a foot higher in it. The eleventh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill fair, we adventured to go to a Hill, a
quarter of a Mile off, from whence we brought
ſome Stones to keep our feet warm in our Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins.
The fifteenth, ſix of us went aboard
the Ship, and found a Springe that we had
plac'd in a hole of the Fore-Deck to catch
Foxes, lye in the middle of the Ship, all torn
in pieces by Bears, as we perceiv'd by their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps.
The ſixteenth was fair, and we went
out now and then to exerciſe our Limbs, and
ſtretch our Joints, with going and running, leſt
we ſhould become Lame. About Noon we
perceiv'd a certain redneſs in the Sky, a welcome
Meſſenger of the approaching Sun, <hi>Aurora</hi> bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to lye ſo long a Bed. The ſeventeenth, we
had yet more comfortable tokens of the Suns
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33398:50"/>
Neighbourhood, for the Air was ſomewhat
warmer, and the Ice melted in our Cabbins,
but the Night prov'd cold again, and our Wood
conſuming, we adventur'd to burn ſome Coals,
keeping open the Chimney, and receiv'd no hurt
thereby.</p>
            <p>Now the Foxes began to fail us, which made
us fear the return of the Bears, but it being
fair, we went out again to caſt the Bullet.
Next day four of us went to the Ship, praiſing
God for that the hardeſt part of the Winter
was paſt over, and comforting our ſelves in the
hopes of ſeeing our Native Country once again;
when we were come thither, we found that the
Water ſtill roſe higher. Two more went to the
South-ſhore of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> and contrary to
expectation, I firſt perceiv'd the edge of the
Sun. Immediately we return'd to make the reſt
of our company partakers of theſe joyful Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
but Mr. <hi>Barents</hi> would not believe us, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that it was yet fourteen days too ſoon
for the Sun to appear in that Climate, being in
the Latitude of ſeventy ſix degrees; and many
offer'd to lay VVagers about it. The two days
following, the Air was over-ſpread with foggy
Miſts, ſo that we could ſee nothing, which made
them that contradicted us inſult over us, but
upon the twenty ſeventh, the full Orb of the
Sun appear'd above the Horizon, which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
juſtify'd our Aſſertion. This is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and ſurprizing effect of Horizontal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction.</p>
            <p>The twenty fifth was again cloudy, and our
VVagerers began to doubt of what they had
ſeen the day before. VVe now perceiv'd a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33398:51"/>
Bear, having ſeen none all the time of the Suns
abſence; we cry'd out to fright her, and ſhe
ran away. But a dusky Cloud cover'd the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
whereupon our incredulous Companions
continued to mock us. In the Evening, one of
our Company that had lain long Sick, felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
extreamly ill, and apprehended the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Death; we comforted him as well as
we could, but he died that Night. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we dig'd a hole, by turns, in the Snow, hard
by the Houſe, ſeven foot deep, in which we
Buried our Companion; which done we went
to Breakfaſt, and while we were at Meat, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
concerning the huge quantity of Snow
that fell in this Icy Region. At laſt we reſolv'd,
if it fell out that we were again enclos'd, we
would endeavour to get out through the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
immediately our Maſter went to try vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could climb up that vvay, and vvhile he
vvas ſcrambling up, one of our Men vvent
forth to ſee if he vvere out or not, vvho deſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sun, call'd us all out to behold that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Light in his full roundneſs, a little above
the Horizon; this put an end to our Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and evidently confirm'd our firſt Aſſertion,
hereupon vve all rejoyc'd, and return'd humble
and hearty thanks to our Almighty Protector.
<hi>January 28.</hi> vve ſpent in various kinds of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
refreſhing our dull and num'd Joints, but
tvvo days after vve vvere again clos'd up vvith
a prodigious Storm of Snovv. The laſt day of
the Month vve made the Door clean, and going
out vvere comforted vvith a ſight of the Sun in
its full Luſtre; mean vvhile vve ſavv a Bear
coming tovvards us, but vvhen vve ſhot at her
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33398:51"/>
ſhe ran avvay. The firſt of <hi>February,</hi> a boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Storm made us again Priſoners; this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
us again much, for hoping that the
Sun vvould have rid us of the foul VVeather,
vve had made no great Proviſion of VVood.
The third vve dig'd our Door open, but a thick
and dark Miſt cover'd the Sun; this day vve
brought in ſome VVood vvith great pain. But
the very next day vve vvere again ſhut up by
the Snovv, and ſo vvere forc'd to climb out at
the Chimney to eaſe our ſelves. VVe vvere
much perplex'd that vve could not enjoy the
comfortable heat of the Sun that we had lately
felt, and yet were forc'd to have patience till
the eighth, before the fury of the Storm was
over, and on the tenth we were ſenſible of that
agreeable warmth we had ſo much long'd for.</p>
            <p>The eleventh we ſaw a Bear, but ſhe came not
vvithin the reach of our Muskets, but the day
following we ſhot one into the breaſt, as ſhe
came right before our Door, the bullet paſs'd
quite through her Heart, and came out at her
Tail as flat as a ſhilling; the Beaſt feeling her
ſelf wounded leapt backwards, and run ſome
five or ſix paces from the Houſe before ſhe fell:
VVe coming up found her ſtill alive, and when
ſhe ſaw us, ſhe rear'd up her Head in a threatning
manner, and we ſhot her twice in the body again
before we adventur'd to touch her. Having
drawn her home to the Houſe we flay'd her,
and took at leaſt one hundred pound of fat out
of her belly, which we melted to burn in our
Lamp, and every Man had enough to burn a
Lamp in his Cabbin, for Reading and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
which before we could not do. This
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33398:52"/>
was a great comfort to us in our diſmal Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Next day five of us went to the Ship, and
found that the VVater did not increaſe much.
The fifteenth we were again clos'd up, and on
the morrow, being <hi>Shrove-Tueſday,</hi> we made
merry in the middle of our ſorrow and anguiſh,
and every one of us drank a draught of VVine.
The twenty ſecond being clear VVeather, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of us well Arm'd for fear of the Bears,
went to the place where we uſually had our
VVood, but not being able to dig it up, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that it lay ſo deep in the Snow, we were
forc'd to go a little further, where we toil'd hard
to get ſome, but returning home with the Sled,
our ſtrength fail'd us, for the long and ſore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
that we had ſuffer'd, had ſo enfeebled us,
and ſo much impair'd our bodies, that we were
quite diſhearten'd, and almoſt reſolv'd to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
our ſelves to the untimely Death that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
us; but unavoidable neceſſity at length
compell'd us to make another effort to proceed,
and our hopes of better VVeather redoubled
our fainting ſtrength, and when we drew near to
the Houſe, we ſaw much open VVater in the
Sea, which increas'd our hopes, and ſo at laſt,
vvith great difficulty, we finiſh'd our irkſom
labour.</p>
            <p>Next day we vvere again clos'd up, yet vvere
conſtrain'd to get out for more VVood, which we
brought home with no leſs difficulty than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for one of our Companions had one of his
Toes frozen off. VVe reſolv'd to ſpare our
Wood, exerciſing our ſelves, when it was day,
vvith running, leaping, and walking. To them
that lay in their Cabbins we gave hot ſtones to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33398:52"/>
warm them, and towards Night made a good
Fire. The fourth of <hi>March,</hi> five of us going
to the Ship, found that the Bears had open'd
our Cooks Cup-board, that was cover'd over
with Snow, and had drawn it out of the Ship,
Three days after we were again ſhut up, but
we were now us'd to climb up through the
Chimney. The Storm continued two or three
days, and we perceiv'd ſtill more open Water
in the Sea. Twelve of us went to fetch Wood,
our pain and labour ſtill increaſing, becauſe our
ſtrength decreas'd. When we came home, we
intreated our Maſter to give each of us a Glaſs
of Wine, which he did, and this not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
and reviv'd our drooping Spirits, but
made us more willing and cheerful in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Laborious Tasks: Yet would we often
ſay to one another, That if Wood might be had
for Money, we would gladly part with all our
Wages for it, for the cold was as piercing as in
the depth of Winter, and daily increaſed rather
than diminiſh'd, and therefore we made Shooes
of Felt, for the Leather was frozen as hard
as a Horn. The twenty firſt we brought home
another Sled full of Wood, yet the cold was
inſupportable, and it froze very hard on the
Roofs and Walls of our Houſe, and the day
after a ſtorm enclos'd us, and then our Coals
were very uſeful to us, but we dig'd our ſelves
out two days after, and fetch'd home more
Wood, the pinching extremity of cold having
forc'd us to burn up all that we had. The
twenty eighth, ſix of us went aboard the Ship,
and found there many marks of the Ravenous
Bears, one of them coming to our Houſe; we
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33398:53"/>
attempted to ſhoot at her, but the Weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moiſt, and the cock foiſty, the Piece would
not give Fire, mean while the Beaſt advanc'd
boldly forwards, and coming down the Stairs
cloſe to the Door, endeavour'd to break into
the Houſe. Our Maſter run to ſhut the Door,
but being in great haſte and fear, could not make
faſt the Bolt, but it pleas'd God that the furious
Creature ſeeing the Door ſhut retir'd, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two hours after returning, ſhe got upon the
top of the Houſe, and made ſuch a hideous roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and helliſh noiſe, as fill'd us all with a pannick
Terror, ſo that we verily believ'd ſhe would
have broken it down; ſhe tore the Sail that
cover'd it in pieces, but the darkneſs of the
Night hindering us from ſeeing her, we made
no reſiſtance, and ſo at laſt ſhe left us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April 15.</hi> being calm, ſeven of us went
aboard the Ship, and found it to be ſtill in
the ſame caſe, and as we return'd homewards,
a great Bear came towards us; we put our
ſelves in a poſture to meet her, whereupon ſhe
gave back, and we obſerving the place from
whence ſhe came went to ſee her Den, where
we found a great hole made in the Ice about
two foot deep, the entry thereof was narrow,
but it widen'd inward, we thruſt in our Pikes
to feel if there was any thing in it, but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it was empty, one of our Men crept in,
yet durſt not proceed too far, for it was fearful
and terrible. Then going along by the Sea-ſide,
we ſaw the Mountains of Ice piled upon one
another, in ſo wonderful a manner, that they
appear'd like Icy Towns and Caſtles fortify'd
with Towers and Bulwarks. The ſeventeenth,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33398:53"/>
ſeven of us went again to the Ship, and from
thence clamber'd over the Icy Hills to the open
Water, and when we were got thither, ſaw a
little Bird ſwimming, which as ſoon as it eſpy'd
us div'd under Water. The thirtieth, in the
Night, we ſaw the Sun North, juſt above the
Horizon, and from that time had ſight of it both
Night and Day.</p>
            <p>The firſt of <hi>May</hi> we dreſt our laſt Fleſh,
which we had long ſpared, and it was ſtill very
good, and the laſt Morſel taſted as well as the
firſt; we then began to think that we had kept
Houſe long enough here, and to talk of our
departure, and the Maſter conſidering that our
beſt Meat began to fail us, when the Labour we
were to undergo required the greateſt ſtrength,
he ſhared the reſt of the Bacon amongſt us,
which was only a ſmall Barrel of Salt Bacon
and Pickle, whereof every one had two Ounces
a Day, and ſo in three Weeks it was all eaten
up. The ſeventh Day we were yet once again
clos'd up in our Houſe: The fourteenth we
fetch'd our laſt Sled of Fire-wood, ſtill wearing
our Rug-ſhooes. The twenty ninth in the
Morning, ten of us were to bring our Scute to
the Houſe to clean it, and were fain, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
pain, to dig it out from under the Snow
wherewith it lay cover'd, but beginning to
draw it, we ſoon found our ſelves unable to
proceed, by reaſon of our extraordinary fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs.
This quite diſheartned us, but our
Maſter encourag'd us, repreſenting unto us that
our Lives lay at the Stake, and that if we did
not draw away, and fit out the Scute, we muſt
reſolve to continue Burghers of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:33398:54"/>
and make our Graves there; but we were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
conſtrain'd to give over at this
time, and return home comfortleſs, yet in the
Afternoon taking heart again, we determin'd to
turn the Boat that lay by the Houſe, and to
amend it, that it might be fitter to carry us
through the infinite number of dangers that
threaten'd us, in the performance of ſo long
and troubleſome a Voyage. While we were
buſie at Work, a huge Bear aſſaulted us with
greater fury and boldneſs than ever any had
done before, but we got into the Houſe, where
we expected her coming in our three Doors
with Harquebuſſes, and one ſtood with a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
in the Chimney; at leſt the over-grown
Beaſt advanc'd as far as the loweſt ſtep that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into one of our Doors, and which is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to relate, the Man that Watch'd there was
at that inſtant looking towards another Door,
and ſaw not his furious Enemy, till a ſudden
ſhout of theſe that perceiv'd her from within
made him turn about: yet though the horrible
ſight of imminent Death ſtruck him with terror
and aſtoniſhment, he fir'd his Piece to ſo good
purpoſe that he ſhot her quite through the Body,
whereupon ſhe run away. Thus did Divine
Providence preſerve us from this terrible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
for if his Piece had fail'd him, it had coſt
us perhaps more Lives than one. The wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Beaſt had not run far when ſhe fell down,
then we went and kill'd her out-right, and rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
open her belly found a piece of a Buck
therein, skin, hair and all, which ſhe had not
long before devoured. It ſeems they ſmelt that
we would ſoon be gone, and reſolved to taſte
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33398:54"/>
a piece of ſome of us, for two days after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
attack'd us, and that ſo fiercely, that we
were forc'd to leave our Work and run into the
Houſe, whither alſo ſhe purſu'd us, but we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
three Pieces at her, which all hit her,
but her Death did us more hurt than her Life,
for we dreſs'd and eat her Liver, which pleas'd
our taſte very well, but made us all ſick, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
three, who were in great danger of their
Lives, yet they recover'd their Healths beyond
all expectation, but loſt their Skins from Head
to Foot.</p>
            <p>At laſt we got our Boat ready, after we had
wrought ſix days upon it; and <hi>June 4.</hi> eleven
of us drew the Scute to the Ship, and now our
Labour ſeem'd lighter to us than formerly; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
becauſe our hopes were ſtronger, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
higher, and we had reckon'd to meet with
no greater difficulties than we found, becauſe
the Snow now lay harder on the ground, but
eſpecially, the earneſt deſire and great pleaſure
we had to Work at that time, augmented our
decay'd Spirits. We were forc'd before we
could draw our Boats to the Sea, to make the
way plain with Hatchets, Shovels, and other
Inſtruments, for it was full of Hillocks and
Mountains of Ice, and while we were thus bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied,
a great lean Bear aſſaulted us, who we
judg'd came from <hi>Tartary,</hi> for we had ſeen of
them twenty or thirty miles upon the Sea, and
ſince we had only one Musket which our Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
carry'd, I run in great haſte towards the
Ship to fetch ſome; the cruel Beaſt purſued
me cloſe, and I expected to have been torn in
pieces by her ravenous Teeth, when our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33398:55"/>
ſeeing my danger follow'd her, which made
her turn towards them and leave me, but in the
mean time the Surgeon happily diſcharg'd his
Piece and ſhot her into the Body, whereupon
ſhe run away, but the Ice being very uneven
and full of knobs, we quickly overtook her,
and killing her outright ſtruck her Teeth out
of her Head.</p>
            <p>As we were ready to depart, <hi>William Barents</hi>
our Pilot left a Letter in a Musket hanging in
the Chimney, wherein he gave an account of
our diſaſtrous Voyage, and how we had lain
ten months in that deſolate, dark and diſmal
Country, and at laſt were forc'd to commit our
ſelves to the cruel Mercy of that Icy Sea, in two
ſmall Boats, under the protection of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Creator. So having finiſh'd all things
as we determin'd, we drew the Boat and Scute,
and eleven Sleds of Goods and Victuals, to the
Water-ſide; we then divided our ſelves equally
into the Boats, and recommending our ſafety to
the abundant Mercies of our Heavenly Guide,
with a Weſt North-weſt Wind, and indifferent
open Water, we put to Sea on the thirteenth
day of <hi>June.</hi> The twentieth of the ſame month
our Pilot Mr. <hi>Barents</hi> died, the loſs of whom
diſhearten'd us not a little, as being the only
Guide, on whoſe Conduct, next under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, we relied. At laſt, after innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
dangers, and as many miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,
having Sail'd almoſt four hundred
<hi>Dutch</hi> miles along the Coaſt, we enter'd the
River of <hi>Coola</hi> in <hi>Lapland,</hi> on the firſt of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
and when the Flood was paſt, we caſt
our Stones that ſerv'd us for Anchors aground,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33398:55"/>
till the Tyde came in again, and then ſet Sail
till Midnight, and after that Anchor'd till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
There rowing up the River, as we paſt
along we ſaw ſome Trees, which comforted us
as much as if we had enter'd into a new World,
for all the time that we had been out we had
ſeen none. At length we got to a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship,
which we had news of ſome days before, little
dreaming it was our Conſort, that the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſet out with us, and left us about the Bear
Iſland. There we began to make merry with
our old Companions, and bid each other wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
then we rowed forward, and Landed at
<hi>Coola.</hi> Here with the Governors leave, we
brought our Scute and Boat to the Merchants
Houſe, and ſet them up for a Monument, of
our tedious (and never before Sailed) Voyage.
The ſeventeenth of <hi>September</hi> we ſet Sail from
thence, and on the twenty ninth of <hi>October</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> and on the firſt of <hi>November</hi>
got to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in our <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> Clothes,

            <p>A <hi>Venetian</hi> Ship, in which were above ſeven

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33398:56"/>
chance into the Mouth of the Channels of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and were driven by a ſtorm from the South
towards the North-weſt. The fury of the
Winds was ſo great, that it broke five of the
Hinges off our Rudder, and the ſtorm hourly
increaſing, beat upon our feeble Rudder with
ſuch violence, that it hung on the one ſide;
wherefore, for the laſt Remedy, we faſten'd a
great Cable to it, with which we drew it after
us three days, in which time, in our judgment,
we had run above two hundred Miles againſt
our wills. Afterwards, with many pieces of
Timber, we made a ſhadow of another, and
fitted it to the Ship; but this alſo was carried
away by the breaking Surges, on the twenty
ſixth of this month, ſo that then we loſt all
hopes of directing our Ship. On the fourth of
<hi>December,</hi> the Winds grew ſo outragious that
they carried away our third Sail, and ſo we
wander'd at adventure, not knowing by what
means to provide for our ſafety. Afterwards the
rage and violence of the Winds increaſing, the
Sea began to ſwell ſo high, that the Waves
ſeem'd Mountains, and our Terror was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the darkneſs of the extream long
Nights, ſo that we ſeem'd to be ſwallow'd up
in the bottomleſs Depths of the Abyſs: It's hard
to imagine how great the anguiſh and trembling
of our hearts was, living in a continual expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Whilſt we remain'd uſeleſs Spectators of this
woeful Tragedy, pitifully beholding one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a rolling Billow came over the Ship with
ſo great fury, that it was fill'd almoſt half full
of Water, ſo that ſhe turn'd up her Keel, and
lay as if ſhe had been ready to ſink: But Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
forſaketh not them that Religiouſly call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

We cut down the Main-maſt, and threw it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
together with the Main-yard and Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which eaſed the Ship very much, ſo that
we began to caſt out the Water, which at laſt
we over-came, though not without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and pain. The day appearing, we agreed
to make ready the Boat and Skiff, and parted
equally our ſmall remainder of Proviſions;
forty two perſons were willing to enter into the
Skiff, and therefore we were forc'd to caſt Lots
who ſhould go therein, it being capable only of
one and twenty. The Maſter and forty ſeven
more enter'd the Boat, unto whom ratably fell
their proportion of Victuals. We were, in our
judgment, diſtant from the neareſt Land or
Iſland, above five hundred miles, and then came
to Sail in a quiet Sea for ſome time; but a dark
Miſt ariſing in the Night we loſt ſight of the
Skiff, and never ſaw it more. The Morning
appearing, we were much troubled that we could
ſee no tokens of the Skiff, which made us fear
the worſt, and ſuſpect what had befaln them,
for the Storm was ſo furious, that an impetuous
Billow ruſhed into the Pinnace behind the Poop,
where I was, with ſo great violence, that two
Stays were batter'd and bent by the vehemency
of the Shock, which filled our hearts with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33398:57"/>
and terror, for now was the Pinnace
more charged with the weight of the Water than
with her own burthen; but Neceſſity ſet us all
a working, and fear of ſo imminent a danger
made the feebleſt of us beſtir themſelves, and
fall to lading it out with their hands, and being
in a dreadful hurry, we threw over-board all
that lay in our way. As ſoon as we had drain'd
the Pinnace, the Storm continuing, we agreed
to caſt out ſome Casks of Wine to lighten her,
which we did with ſo great haſte and precipitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that we had ſoon reduc'd our ſelves to ſuch
extremity, that if we deſir'd to taſte of that
chearing Liquor, to reſtore our drooping Spirits,
we were forc'd to content our ſelves with one
Goblet apiece every day, which was all that
could be allowed to each of us; and if any
could not ſatisfie his parch'd Throat with this,
he was conſtrain'd to have recourſe to the
brackiſh Liquor, that threaten'd to ſwallow us
up every moment.</p>
            <p>But all this was Luxury in reſpect of what
our cruel Deſtinies reſerv'd for us, this Meaſure
of Wine held out only a Week with us; at the
end of which, our tormenting fears quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting
our ſmall ſtore, conſtrain'd us to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
our proportion to half a Goblet a day
each Man. Thirſt was not the only, nor great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Miſery that attended our deplorable and
forlorn Company, perpetual Terror, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
Doubts, did ſo diſturb our afflicted
Minds, that we could never compoſe our ſelves
ſecurely to ſleep, and notwithſtanding our tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Limbs were hardly able to ſuſtain our
ſinking Bodies, we were forc'd to tug hard

Night and Day, both at Helm and Pump, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the ſame time almoſt frozen to Death
with intolerable cold, which was incomparably
more grievous than that which, to the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all Men, not many years ago cover'd all
the Channels at <hi>Venice</hi> with thick and impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
Ice. And now the compaſſionate Reader
may conſider how lamentable our caſe was, we
wanted Clothes to fence us from the pinching
cold, our Meat and Drink fail'd us, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
amidſt the Horrors of an unknown and
ſtormy Ocean, deſtitute not only of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
but even of neceſſaries to ſuſtain our
fainting Bodies; and leſt any thing ſhould be
wanting to compleat our Miſery, the Nights
were twenty one hours long, and very dark.
The growing cold now began to produce terrible
effects of its cruelty among us, we were all of
a ſudden ſeized with a certain numneſs, which
began at our Feet, and then gradually aſcending
over-run our whole Bodies, cauſing in us a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd
and raging appetite, which was no ſmall
addition to our Sorrow, for every Man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to filch what he could from his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and Ranſacking every corner greedily,
devour'd all he could find. Then did Death
Tyrannize among us, and you might ſee here
one, and there another, breathe out a broken
ſigh, ſhake his giddy Head, and fall down dead
on a ſudden. In which extremity, of forty
ſeven Men which made up our deſolate Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
twenty ſix gave up the Ghoſt, and this was
ſo far from being a Wonder, conſidering our
helpleſs condition, that it was certainly a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Divine Bounty, that any of us were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33398:58"/>
alive to Celebrate the never-failing good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Almighty Deliverer, and exalt the
Glory of his power. Theſe twenty ſix died
between the twenty third of <hi>December</hi> to the
fifth of <hi>January,</hi> and found their Graves in the
bottom of the mercileſs Ocean.</p>
            <p>And now the laſt day of this diſaſtrous year
preſented us with a diſmal proſpect of unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Ruine, for our little ſtock of Wine was
wholly exhauſted, and the ſad experience of
our dead and dying Companions taught us, that
the Sea-water with which we were wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the intolerable fury of our Thirſt, did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haſten our approaching Death; ſo that, not
knowing what to do, we forc'd our own Water
down our Throats. How deplorable and heart-breaking
an object was it to ſee ſome gaſping
Wretches, whoſe parcht Entrails refus'd to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
any moiſture, with dying groans and rueful
looks, imploring the favour of a ſmall draught
of the Urine of their Companions, who, either
unwilling to part with what they fear'd would
quickly be ſpent, or rather unable to ſpare any
from themſelves, refus'd to ſave the Lives of
their deareſt Friends, at the expences of a ſmall
quantity of that unſavory Liquor, which was
the only means left to preſerve their own. 'Tis
true, ſome of us had the prudence to temper
it with a little Sirrup of Green Ginger and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
which by Providence was not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd.
At laſt, when there was no hopes left,
when Deſpair and Paleneſs were painted on our
hollow Cheeks, and the Grim-King of Terrors
in the moſt frightful ſhape ſtar'd us in the Face,
then did our pitiful Redeemer ſtretch forth his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33398:58"/>
helping Hand, and on the third of <hi>January 1431.</hi>
we deſcry'd Land afar off, being a ledge of
ragged Rocks, cover'd to the top with huge
Mountains of Snow, and lying to the weather
of us: But it ſeems Fortune ſtill ow'd us a
ſpite, for the Winds being contrary we durſt not
ſpread our Sails, and our feeble Arms were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unable to manage the Oars, ſo that a
ſtrong current driving us along, we loſt ſight of
Land and all our Hopes together. But magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
be the wonderful Goodneſs of our God,
we eſcaped ſafe out of a Deluge of Dangers,
in which we were almoſt over-whelmed, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been long toſs'd and batter'd by the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of outragious Guſts, among the Death-threatning
points of lurking Rocks, which by
reaſon of the horrible darkneſs of the tedious
Night we could not avoid; at laſt, fear of
Death, and deſire of Life, inſpiring us with
unwonted Vigour, we enter'd into a Bay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two ſteep Rocks. No ſooner did our Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
touch upon the Sand, but five of our men
made deſperate by tormenting Thirſt, leap'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, without knowing the depth thereof,
which was conſiderable, and making haſte to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Snow, thruſt ſuch great quantities
down their inſatiable Throats, that they ſeem'd
to delight in glutting themſelves therewith; at
length they return'd Laden with huge quantities
thereof, which we alſo gulp'd down very
greedily.</p>
            <p>Now from the time that we left the Ship,
until <hi>January 6.</hi> being eighteen days, we made
account, according to our beſt Judgments, that
we had run two thouſand five hundred miles
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33398:59"/>
at leaſt, without ſeeing Land, for Sailing all that
time between the Eaſt and North-eaſt points of
the Compaſs, we never hand leſs Wind than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the rate of ſix miles in an hour. On the
forementioned day, being the Feaſt of <hi>Epiphany,</hi>
Nineteen of us went aſhore on this deſolate and
barren Iſland, called the <hi>Iſle of Saints,</hi> which lies
on the Coaſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> and belongs to the King
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> leaving only two men to look to
the Boat: Being Landed, we retired to a place
that was cover'd from the fury of the piercing
Winds, and kindled a Fire by means of a Tinder-Box
and an Oar, the ſight of which was very
comfortable to us. But perceiving that this Iſland
was Uninhabited, we reſolved to go to another,
which we deſcry'd about five miles diſtant. But
alas! our Pinnace was ſo Leaky, that deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be ever able to fit her out for the Sea
again, we drew her not without great pain to
Land, and determin'd to make a little Hovel of
her, to ſhelter us from the violence of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
To accompliſh which, we divided her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two parts, of the firſt and greater of which
we made a Shed for Thirteen of us, and of the
leſſer another for the reſt, covering them with
part of our Sails, and reſerving the remainder,
with the Cordage, for Fuel, to comfort our fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Limbs. And now being utterly deſtitute of
all Suſtenance to preſerve our wretched Lives,
we wander'd along the ſhore to gather ſome
ſmall quantity of <hi>Periwinkles</hi> and <hi>Barnackles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
which by chance we found there, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Snow in ſome places we found cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Herbs, which we boiled with Snow in our
Caldron, and then eat them through extream
Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:33398:59"/>
Thus did we live for thirteen days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if I may call that Life which was ſpent
in perpetual agonies and terrors, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
rather the Name of a lingring Death.
In the middle of theſe extremities, four of
our Companions of the greater Shed, unable
to hold out longer, under the inſupportable
weight of miſery that overwhelm'd us, gave
up the Ghoſt, notwithſtanding all the pains that
our poor afflicted Maſter took to provide ſome
ſmall remedies and comforts, both for their Souls
and Bodies. Our feebleneſs was ſo extream, that
we were not able to remove their worn and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Carkaſſes two yards, the ſight whereof was
as grievous and lamentable as the ſtench was
contagious and noiſome. Now was Nature ſo
much decay'd in us, that we could not retain
the little Food we had provided, and no ſooner
poured a little melted Snow, down our Throats,
but we preſently caſt it up again, and yet were
not able to abſtain from it, which ſo weaken'd
us that our Legs could hardly ſuſtain us; and
withal, the cold was ſo pinching, that to preſerve
our ſelves from being frozen, we were forc'd
to ſtand ſo cloſe crowded together, that we
ſeem'd to be ſew'd to one another. We had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
our Cottages with our Sails round about
down to the ground, without leaving any vent-hole
for the Smoke, which aroſe in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and ſo thick, from the pitched Wood of
our Pinnace, being all the Fuel we had, that
our Eyes were ſo ſwoln therewith, we could
not ſee one another, and yet were willing to
endure any thing rather than to expoſe our
ſelves to the more intolerable cold. In the mean
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33398:60"/>
time we were almoſt eaten up by Vermine, for
we never ſhifted our Clothes, and the Lice
ſwarm'd upon us in ſuch numbers, that we caſt
them by whole handfuls into the Fire; yet they
not only gnaw'd off our Fleſh, but pierc'd even
to the Bones, and at laſt eat their way to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bowels of a Young-man of our company, a
Notary by Calling, who expir'd in unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Torments. All this could not humble our
Pride, nor mortifie the contentious haughtineſs
of our Minds; our common Calamity could
not unite us together, nor make us bear with
one anothers Infirmities. So that Charity wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cold, and diſcord ariſing among us, part of
our Company wandring about the Savage and
Uninhabited Iſland, came to the knowledge of
a lonely retiring place, made by ſome Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
to ſhelter themſelves during their abode
there; it was ſeated in the higheſt part of the
Weſtern Coaſt of the Iſland, diſtant from our
Hutts about a mile and a half. To this ſix of
the eight that remain'd in the greater Cottage
determin'd to withdraw, leaving their two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
alone in their deſolate and abandon'd
Habitation, they being neither able to Travel,
nor the others to conduct them to this New-found
Dwelling.</p>
            <p>But now to confirm the Truth of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
That <hi>every thing ſhall turn to the good of
thoſe that put their Truſt in God,</hi> he ſent us an
exceeding great Fiſh, to which I know not what
Name to give, whether <hi>Whale</hi> or <hi>Sea-Porpoſs.</hi>
When we ſaw it caſt upon the ſhore, dead, yet
freſh, great and good, and at a time when we
deſpair'd of all relief, we could not but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33398:60"/>
it to be an amazing effect of the Divine
Bounty towards us, and praiſe the never-failing
Mercy of God, in ſending us ſuch ſeaſonable
and comfortable Nouriſhment for our enfeebled
and diſeaſed Bodies. On this Fiſh we feaſted
for nine days together, and to heighten our
grateful ſenſe of this wonderful Providence, and
make us reliſh the ſweetneſs thereof more fully,
it happened that theſe nine days were ſo Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous,
with Wind, Rain and Snow, that the
cruel Storm would not have permitted us to ſtir
one foot out of our Cottage. The miraculous
Fiſh being ſpent, the fury of the Tempeſt was
ſomewhat mitigated, wherefore not having
wherewithal to ſuſtain Life, and oppreſſed with
extream hunger, we Ranſack'd every Clift of
the deſert Rocks to ſeek for ſome Relief, and
at laſt found a few <hi>Sea Perriwinkles</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
with which neceſſity conſtrain'd us to be
contented; and with this ſlender nouriſhment we
maintain'd our ſelves until the laſt of <hi>January.</hi>
While we were thus wandring about, lean,
pale, afflicted and half Dead, we found ſome
Oxes Dung dried and baked by the Cold and
Winds, whereof we gathered every day ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make a ſmall Fire. By this we came to
know that the place was frequented by Oxen,
which gave us ſome hopes of finding an end of
our miſery, and in the ſtrength of this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
aſſurance, we were better enabled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
our inſupportable Sorrow and Anguiſh; at
length the long look'd for hour came, wherein
our compaſſionate Lord vouchſafed to conduct
his little afflicted Flock into the Haven of their
deſired ſafety, whoſe Hand was evidently ſeen
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33398:61"/>
Two young Heifers had ſtray'd the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from a certain Fiſher-man, living in <hi>Ruſten,</hi>
an Iſland five miles diſtant from the Savage
<hi>Iſle of Saints</hi> wherein we were, and he had
long ago given over all hopes of ever finding
them again: Now it happen'd that on the
firſt of <hi>February,</hi> at Night, one of the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Sons, a Youth of ſixteen years of Age,
Dreamed that certainly the two Heifers were
ſtill alive, and were got over to the Weſtern
point of the <hi>Iſland of Saints,</hi> whereupon he
earneſtly beſought his Father and elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they would accompany him to
that place, who yielding to his importunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
they all three enter'd into a Fiſher-Boat,
and Rowed towards the ſaid point,
where they were no ſooner Landed but they
deſcry'd a Smoke ariſing from the Habitation
which they had formerly uſed, which ſurpriz'd
them with great aſtoniſhment, whence and by
what means ſo ſtrange an accident could come
to paſs, ſo that they ſtood a great while much
amazed; and at laſt, endeavouring to gueſs at
the cauſe thereof, they began to talk to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But though we heard the ſound of their
Voices, yet we could not imagine whence it
ſhould proceed, and thought on nothing leſs
than the truth, but judged it to be the crying
of Crows, and not the Voice of Humane
Creatures; and we were the rather induced to
entertain this conceit, becauſe not many days
before we had beheld an infinite number of
theſe ravenous Birds, preying upon the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Carkaſſes of eight of our Companions that
lay expos'd to Wind and Weather, and often
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33398:61"/>
heard them rend the Air with their harſh Notes.
At laſt we were ſenſible of our Error, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtinguiſhed the Voices of Men, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<hi>Chriſtophoro Fiorovanti,</hi> one of our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
went forth, and ſeeing two young ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
return'd ſhouting for Joy with the welcom
News, ſaying, <hi>Be of good cheer, behold two Men
come towards us.</hi> Theſe words put new Life in
us, ſo that we began to try whether we had
yet forgot to run, though indeed our hearts ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
us rather than our Legs; as we drew
near to the Young-men, we perceiv'd that they
were diſmay'd with the unexpected ſtrangeneſs
of the ſight, and that a ſudden paleneſs began
to over-ſpread their Faces, but on the contrary
we took Courage, and being comforted with
a certain hope, gave them to underſtand, by
the humbleſt Geſtures which we could make,
that we came not with a deſign to offend them.
Then did we begin to deliberate what might be
the beſt courſe for us to take, divers uncertain
and fleeting reſolutions were ſuggeſted to our
Minds, and we were perplexed with a thouſand
doubts. Sometimes we determin'd to detain
one or both of them, but ſoon forſook that
raſh reſolution, not knowing with whom, nor
how many we had to do. Then we adviſed
together, whether one or more of us ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to go along with them, and this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
alſo was not without its difficulties, for
we were afraid to hazard our ſelves among
ſtrangers, whoſe Language we were ignorant
of, and they of ours. At laſt, caſting off all
fear, and committing our ſelves to the gracious
protection of God, we went down to their Boat.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33398:62"/>
in the moſt amicable manner poſſible, and in
friendly and humble wiſe ſaluted the Old man,
who ſtood there expecting his Sons, and was no
leſs aſtoniſh'd to ſee us than they had been. In
the mean time our hunger was ſo preſſing, that
we could not forbear to ſearch in the Boat,
whether happily we might find any thing to
relieve our neceſſity, but to no purpoſe, for
we could meet with nothing.</p>
            <p>The pitiful ſtrangers perceiving by our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the ſigns we made, that we were almoſt
ſtarv'd for want of ſuſtenance, were moved to
compaſſion, and chearfully agreed to carry
along with them two of our Company, <hi>Ghirardo
di Lione</hi> a Sewer, and <hi>Cola di Otrunto</hi> a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who ſpoke <hi>French</hi> and <hi>High-Dutch,</hi> leaving
us in great hopes of ſpeedy aſſiſtance. As they
drew near to <hi>Ruſten,</hi> the amazed people came
running to the Sea-ſide, gazing upon the ſtrange
Countenances and unuſual Garb of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and queſtioning one another, how and
from whence they were come thither. To ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their curioſity, they attempted to diſcourſe
with them in ſundry Languages, but at laſt a
<hi>German</hi> Prieſt, of the Order of the <hi>Praedicators,</hi>
ſpoke to one of them in <hi>High-Dutch,</hi> by whom
they were certified who we were, from whence
we came, and how we were caſt upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart
Iſland; and all this the Prieſt publiſhed to
the people next morning, earneſtly exhorting
them to have compaſſion on our neceſſitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and relieve us according to their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
Which had ſo good effect, and found the
Spirits of the people ſo much dispos'd to pity,
that the day following, being the third of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:33398:62"/>
the kind <hi>Ruſteners</hi> came to us that were
left in Courteous manner, bringing along with
them plenty of Proviſions to refreſh our feeble
bodies, and very affectionately invited us to
their Habitations. We embraced their offer'd
kindneſs with a thankful willingneſs, and with
glad Hearts accompanied them to their Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Iſland, where we were receiv'd with unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Sincerity, and entertained with great
plenty of Reſtorative Food, the exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
whereof had like to have prov'd fatal to
us, for we could not reſtrain our ſelves from
obeying our craving Appetites, neither could
we ever ſatiate our ſelves with ſeeding; but
neither were our weak Stomachs able to concoct,
nor decay'd Nature to bear ſo unuſual a Load
of Meat, ſo that what we eat to ſuſtain Life,
had almoſt brought us to an untimely Death.</p>
            <p>There were yet remaining two of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the <hi>Iſle of Saints,</hi> whom we had left
in the greater of our Cottages, and who were
ignorant of our miraculous Succour; wherefore
we inform'd our kind Friends of their helpleſs
condition, and likewiſe of our eight deceaſed
Companions, who lay rotting above ground.
Whereupon they aſſembled themſelves together,
and went with the Prieſt, Singing Pſalms and
Hymns, as well to Bury the Dead as to reſcue
the Living; when they were arriv'd at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
Iſland, they Interr'd the Bodies of the
eight deceaſed perſons, to which number one
of the two remaining was now added, whom
they likewiſe buried: And you may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
in how ſad a plight they found the other
poor Wretch, who had been thus utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33398:63"/>
both of Humane Society and Suſtenance
yet he was brought to <hi>Ruſten,</hi> with ſome little
remainders of Life, where at the end of two
days, he found an end of his miſeries in Death.
Eleven of all our numerous Company were
ſaved, and came alive into this Iſland, among
vvhom vvas our Maſter <hi>Piero Quirini,</hi> a perſon
of conſummate prudence, and diſcreet humility,
of vvhich he gave a notable inſtance vvhen he
enter'd into the Houſe of our affectionate and
charitable Hoſt; for ſeeing his Wife, in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that he acknovvledg'd her to be Miſtriſs
of that Life vvhich her Husband had preſerv'd,
he caſt himſelf dovvn at her Feet, but ſhe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo great ſubmiſſion, Courteouſly lifted him
up from the ground, and kindly embracing him
vvith her ovvn Hand, gave him ſomevvhat
to Eat. With theſe loving and Hoſpitable
people vve abode three months and eleven days,
expecting to have paſſage into <hi>Sweden</hi> vvith our
Hoſt, vvhither he intended to go vvith his
uſual Fraight of Stock-fiſh, for every year in
the month of <hi>May,</hi> the people of this Iſland
Travel to <hi>Sweden,</hi> vvith mighty plenty of that
Commodity, vvith vvhich they furniſh a great
part of that Kings Dominions.</p>
            <p>At laſt, on the fourteenth of <hi>May 1432.</hi> came
the happy Hour, in vvhich, after ſo tedious and
lamentable an Exile, vve ſet our Faces home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards,
and began our Journey tovvards our
beloved Native Country. So vve took our
leave of our Charitable Hoſteſs, and all our
other affectionate Friends, leaving vvith her for
a Token of our Love, not vvhat her kindneſs
deſerv'd, or vvhat Juſtice and Gratitude oblig'd
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33398:63"/>
us to have given, but vvhat the mercileſs Sea
had left us, which was only a few Trifles, as
Cups, Girdles, and ſome ſmall Rings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
the grateful ſenſe we had of ſo many,
and ſo ſignal Favours, with the beſt and moſt
hearty Eloquence we were Maſters of, to the
Prieſt, our Interpreter, by Words, and to the
people by Signs. Having thus perform'd all
due Salutations, we Embarked in a ſmall Veſſel
of the burthen of twenty Tuns, Laden with
Fiſh, in which our Hoſt went alſo Maſter and
Pilot, and the Ships Crew conſiſted of his Sons,
and other Kindred. We ſet Sail then on the
fore-mentioned Day, directing our courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Bergen,</hi> which was the firſt convenient
Haven for Unlading and Vending our Fiſh,
and diſtant from <hi>Ruſten</hi> about a thouſand miles.
Theſe Fiſher-men conducted the Bark ſafely,
and with great eaſe, through various Channels,
with which, and all the Currents in them, they
were perfectly acquainted, ſo that our Voyage
prov'd very commodious to us. When we
were about two hundred miles off <hi>Ruſten,</hi> we
found certain Relicks of the Wreck of our
Skiff, which certify'd us of the ſad Fate of our
Companions that were aboard her; and we
concluded, they periſhed the firſt Night we loſt
ſight of them. The twenty ninth of <hi>May 1432.</hi>
we arriv'd at <hi>Tronden,</hi> a Town upon the Coaſt
of <hi>Norway,</hi> and the Royal Seat of the King of
<hi>Denmark</hi> when he reſides in thoſe parts, and the
Burial place of the famous Saint and King
<hi>Olaus.</hi> Here we abode ten days, waiting for
ſome conveniency to continue our Voyage, but
finding none, were unwilling to loſe more time,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33398:64"/>
and therefore determin'd to proceed on our
Journey by Land; but firſt we took our final
leave of our bountiful and charitable Patron
and Hoſt, and his Company, inſtead of rewards
offering him only our ſincere thanks, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
prayers to God for him.</p>
            <p>The ninth of <hi>June</hi> we departed from <hi>Tronden,</hi>
Traveiling on foot towards <hi>Vaſtena,</hi> a Town
within the limits of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> where we
underſtood, by two of our Country-men, whom
to our great joy and comfort we found there,
that the Inhabitants (for the reverend reſpect
they bore to the memory of their Glorious
Monarch St. <hi>Olaus,</hi> unto whom (as they well
knew) the <hi>Republick of Venice</hi> ſhewed extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Favour and Courteſie, when he paſt
through that City in his Voyage to, and Return
from <hi>Paleſtine)</hi> were affectionately diſpos'd to
aſſiſt us both with Counſel and Money. And
indeed, we were not fruſtrated of our Hopes,
receiving very loving Entertainment among
them, and were inform'd that if we continued
our Journey directly forwards, we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
our ſelves to infinite dangers, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
aſſaults of Wild Beaſts, and therefore
they adviſed us to go to <hi>Stichimborgi,</hi> although
it would be no leſs than thirty days Journey
out of our way, where we ſhould find a Valiant
and Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> Cavalier <hi>M. Giovanni Franco,</hi>
who would not fail to receive us graciouſly, and
aſſiſt us plentifully with all Neceſſaries for our
Journey. Following this Advice, we ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and on the eighteenth day arriv'd at the
Court of that Honourable and Valorous Baron,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33398:64"/>
who being inform'd of us, came to receive us
with a chearful Countenance, and ſhewed us ſo
great favour, that we ſoon perceived his Noble
Heart was full of Love to his Country. We
had no ſooner in an humble manner acquainted
him with all our Calamities, and preſent Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous
condition, but he bid us be of good
Comfort, for he was abundantly able to relieve
us; and indeed, he could not ſatisfie himſelf
with heaping honours and benefits upon us, and
entertaining us ſplendidly. He alſo fill'd our
Purſes with Money, and furniſh'd us with good
Horſes; yea, in his own proper perſon, together
with <hi>M. Mapheo</hi> his only Son, and one hundred
and twenty Horſemen of his Domeſtick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
he brought us on our way for ſeveral
days Journeys, through his Territories, Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
always with all this great Company at his
own Charge. Being come to the Confines of
his Land, we took our leave to depart, yielding
him our moſt humble and hearty thanks for his
unparallel'd bounty to us. At his departure he
left his Son to be our Guide, with an Attendance
of twenty Horſemen, who kept us company all
the way to <hi>Vaſtena,</hi> from whence we came
about forty days before, and where we arrived
on the thirtieth of <hi>July.</hi> We abode here till the
ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> maintain'd at free-coſt by
<hi>M. Mapheo,</hi> and then humbly taking our leaves
of him, and preſenting him with our ordinary
Retribution for received benefits, Thanks, we
ſet forwards on our Journey, directing our
Courſe to <hi>Ladeſe,</hi> where we arrived on the
eleventh.</p>
            <p>Here we found opportunity of paſſage in two
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33398:65"/>
Veſſels, one bound for <hi>England,</hi> and the other
for the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and agreed for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
conveniency, to divide our ſelves into two
Companies; in the latter Ship went <hi>Chriſtophoro
Floravante</hi> one of the Council of our Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Veſſel, <hi>Girardo da Lione</hi> the Sewer, <hi>Nicolo
de Michiel</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> Notary, (and Writer of
one of the two Relations out of which this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

many troubleſome and dangerous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Travelling ſometimes on Foot, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
on Horſeback, by the merciful Providence
of Almighty God, arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> in good
Health, leaving <hi>Girardo da Lione</hi> at <hi>Vaſenech,</hi>
from thence to continue his Journey to his own
Native Country. Among theſe who embark'd
in the Ship bound for <hi>England,</hi> being in all eight
perſons, were the <hi>Sieur Quirini,</hi> Son of Mr. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>como</hi>
a <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentleman, Maſter of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Ship, who ſaid, that when he ſet foot on
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhore, it ſeem'd unto him that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
new Life, and that he was come out of
Hell; he viſited <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where a charitable
perſon gave him ſixteen Crowns, and abode two
months in <hi>London.</hi> In the ſame Ship went <hi>M<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Piero
Gradenico,</hi> Son of <hi>M. Andrea,</hi> a young Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
of the Age of eighteen years, and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo

young, hearing no News of her Husband in ſo
long time, believ'd certainly that he was Dead,
and without mature deliberation Married ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Husband at <hi>Treviſo;</hi> but hearing of our
arrival, and being inform'd that her former
Husband was ſtill alive, ſhe immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
the Bond of her ſecond Marriage, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33398:65"/>
retir'd into a Nunnery, to teſtifie the honeſty of

            <p>THE News of the War that was declared

1666. coming to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi>

Orders, forbidding, under pain of Death, ſome
<hi>French</hi> that lived among them, to go out of the
Limits of their Habitations; notwithſtanding
which prohibition, <hi>Vrban de Frecide,</hi> Lord of
<hi>Grand Maiſon,</hi> reſolved to hazard his Life to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
his Liberty. The Attempt was very bold,
and he expos'd himſelf to a thouſand dangers,
for there was an abſolute Neceſſity to find out
ſome reſolute Companions to carry off a Boat,
and make Proviſion of Victuals, and all this in
a place where the <hi>French</hi> were look'd upon as
Enemies, and as ſuch diligently obſerv'd; but
the deſire of Liberty made this daring perſon
over-look all thoſe difficulties, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
appear'd unſurmountable. He pitch'd
upon two of his own Nation to be his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
of whom one was a Carpenter, and with
joint-conſent they determin'd to carry off a ſmall
Shallop, which was Chain'd to a Stake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſight of an <hi>Engliſh Corps du Guard.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they us'd to Lock up the Oars every
Night, the Carpenter undertook to make new
ones, and <hi>Grand-Maiſon</hi> took upon himſelf the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33398:66"/>
care of making neceſſary Proviſions. The
Night appointed for the Execution of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
being come, out three Fugitives, and two
Negro's, whom they had gain'd, carried their
Proviſions to the Sea ſide, to the place whither
they had reſolv'd to bring the Shallop. About
Mid-night the bold Chirurgion, accompanied
with the Carpenter and a Negro, who carried
the Oars, came to the place where the Boat lay,
and the Carpenter having ſaw'd aſunder the
Poſt to which it was faſten'd, they carry'd it off
with ſo little noiſe, that they were not heard by
the Centry, and without any moleſtation brought
it to the place of Rendevouz. Moſt part of
the Night was employed in this Work, and in
carrying on Board the ſlender Proviſion of
Victuals, that <hi>Grand-Maiſon</hi> was able to furniſh,
ſo that having Embark'd themſelves, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
by force of Rowing to get clear of the
hated ſhore, they were ſurpriz'd, when by the
glimmering light of the Morning they diſcover'd
that Land, which they endeavour'd to ſhun, but
half a League diſtant. This oblig'd them to
retire into the <hi>Iſland of Birds,</hi> a Deſart place,
and of difficult acceſs. At Sun-ſet our diſmay'd
Company put to Sea again, endeavouring to
double the Eaſt point of the <hi>Iſle of Antego,</hi> that
they might afterwards gain that of <hi>Guadeloup;</hi>
but they were aſtoniſh'd to find next morning,
that all their Efforts had been in vain againſt
the ſtrength of the Current, and that they were
not advanc'd above a League. Their wearineſs
and fear of being diſcover'd by thoſe that were

with Trees, amongſt which having hid their
Boat, they ſearch'd all around for freſh Water
and Herbs, though with little ſucceſs, for the
Sea ſwelling mightily in the Night, had daſh'd
againſt their Boat, and ſo wet their <hi>Caſſave</hi>
Bread, that it was altogether unfit to be eaten;
ſo that they had nothing left to feed upon but
a little Salt Pork, and only one Pot of Water
to Drink, with a little <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> made of Sugar
Canes.</p>
            <p>At Night they put to Sea again, ſteering the
ſame courſe that they held the foregoing Night,
but had not got above a League from the ſhore,
when they found themſelves in the middle of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Rocks lurking under Water, upon which
they ſtruck ſo dangerouſly, that it was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
they were not buried in the Waves. Want
of Water and Victuals, and the breaking of
their Rudder, conſtrained them to go aſhore

ſome Fruits of the Country, and enough freſh
Water to fill one of their Barrels. They found

alſo much leſſen'd, and their Spirits almoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
by the Fatigues which they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Grand-Maiſon</hi> was of opinion, that
it would be their beſt courſe to endeavour to
gain the <hi>Iſland of St. Chriſtopher,</hi> which lay to the
Lee-ward, whither they might eaſily go with full
Sails. This Advice was unanimouſly followed,
but having no Sails, they were at a ſtand what
to do, when <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> the Mother of Invention,
taught them to make uſe of a Hammock, or
Cotton-Bed, which they had in the Shallop, and
the Carpenter made a little Maſt, to which
they faſten'd it. In this condition they coaſted
the Iſle of <hi>Antego,</hi> two Leagues from the ſhore,
and towards Night they began to loſe ſight of
it, directing their courſe towards St. <hi>Chriſtophers.</hi>
By break of day they found themſelves ſo near
the ſhore of the Iſle of <hi>Nevis,</hi> which alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to labour hard to paſs to the Wind-wards
of that Iſland, thereby to gain the Salt-pits of
St. <hi>Chriſtophers.</hi> Their Efforts were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vain, for they doubled <hi>Nevis;</hi> but withal,
were forc'd to run ſo near the ſhore, that they
look'd every moment for the appearing of
ſome Barks from thence, to ſeiſe their Veſſel and
Perſons.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they paſs'd the Streight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Nevis</hi> and St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> and finding
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33398:67"/>
themſelves over againſt the Salt-pits of this laſt
Iſland, they endeavour'd in vain to get to Land,
for when they were come within half a League
of the ſhore, they were ſuddenly engaged
among hidden Rocks and breaking Waves,
where they were toſs'd with ſuch violence,
that the Boat daſhing againſt one of the Rocks,
they had much ado to bring her off, being
much weakned by hard Labour and want of
Suſtenance; nevertheleſs, they were ſo happy
as to get clear of all theſe dangers, and held
out one Night more with Hunger, Thirſt and
Toil. Finding themſelves at the dawning of
the day, over againſt the Head land of St. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Iſland,</hi> and knowing that they might eaſily
aad ſafely Land there, they took Courage, Fear
and Sadneſs being baniſh'd out of their Hearts,
and Joy ſucceeding in their Room; ſo that
forthwith one of them tore his Shirt, of which
he made two Flags, and another tied his Cravat
to the top of the Maſt, to ſerve for a Streamer.
In this manner they drew near to ſhore, which
was cover'd with <hi>French,</hi> who came running
from all parts of the Iſland to behold the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Boat. The <hi>Sieur Sannois,</hi> Captain of that
Quarter, being there alſo, gave them notice by
a Signal of the right Landing place; at length
they came aſhore with glad Hearts, and were
received by their Country-men with a great deal
of Humanity.</p>

               <hi>FRancis,</hi> Lord of <hi>Noue,</hi> Sir-named <hi>Iron-Hand,</hi>

Lord <hi>de Vezins,</hi> of an illuſtrious Houſe in <hi>Anjou.</hi>
Of this Marriage were Born a Son and two
Daughters. <hi>Vezins</hi> being a Widower, Married
his Ladies Waiting-maid; ſhe deſiring that her
Children might be the only Heirs of that rich
Man, cauſed the three Infants of the laſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to be ſecretly carried to <hi>Pardic</hi> in low
<hi>Bretagne,</hi> a Houſe ſeated upon the Sea-ſhore,
and pertaining to the Lord <hi>de Vezins.</hi> There
they were put into the Hands of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
who had agreed to throw them into the Sea,
but touched with compaſſion, he contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to leave them with a Peaſant on the Coaſt
of <hi>England,</hi> to be by him Educated as Children
of mean Birth, and without giving them the
leaſt knowledge of their Extraction, for they
were as yet ſo young, that he did not think
they could remember it. Then were they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the Iſle of <hi>Guernſey,</hi> and with a little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
committed to certain Perſons in that Iſle, to
be there brought up. In the mean time Reports
were ſpread abroad from time to time, that the
Children died one after the other in their Fathers
Houſe, and counterfeit Funerals were Solemniz'd.
The Daughters did not intirely loſe the memory
of their Birth, and being ſomewhat grown up,
they heard of the Lord <hi>de la Noue,</hi> and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
that he was their Unkle, and that they had
heard him ſo call'd in their Fathers Houſe; they
wrote unto him, and he did all that he could to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33398:68"/>
haſten their Return into <hi>France,</hi> and to diſcover
the Truth. The Father, who was ſuſpected to
have been privy to the Mother in-Laws Plot, at
firſt reſiſted his endeavours, but at length he
conſented, and profeſs'd he would have been
glad that his Children had been Educated near
the Lady <hi>de la Noue,</hi> who was a Virtuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
but there fell out ſeveral things that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
their proceedings, and the Girls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in <hi>Guernſey</hi> till they died. As for the Son,
he was carried from thence to <hi>London,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was younger than his Siſters, and had
no correſpondence with them, he almoſt intirely
loſt the memory of his Extraction, and was
bound Prentice to a Shoomaker; nevertheleſs,
when he was grown up, having ſtill ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd

Girls, he ſuſpected that he might be their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and being inform'd that <hi>La Noue</hi> was in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> he went thither to preſent himſelf to
him. He did ſo, but he produc'd ſo few marks
of his Birth, and <hi>La Noue</hi> ſaw ſo little light in
this Affair, that he contented himſelf with Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>Vezins,</hi> that a Young-man had preſented
himſelf to him, who call'd himſelf his Son. <hi>La
Noue</hi> being made a Priſoner in the Wars of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
ſix or ſeven years paſt over before he heard
any more of this buſineſs, and in the mean time
the Young-man plying his Shoomakers Trade,
went at laſt to <hi>Geneva,</hi> to Work there; he had
not been there long when <hi>La Noue</hi> arriv'd, one
of them not Dreaming of the other. <hi>La Noue,</hi>
by chance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſent to his Maſters Shop for ſomething
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33398:69"/>
belonging to that Trade which he wanted. That
Young-man carried it to him, and knew <hi>La Noue</hi>
by his Iron-Hand, but durſt not diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
becauſe he had not a very favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
the former time, and was afraid to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

            <p>
               <hi>La Noue</hi> did not mind him, and ſix or ſeven
years producing a great alteration in the face
and ſtature of Young-men of that Age, he
thought upon nothing leſs than his Nephew;
nevertheleſs, having obſerv'd ſome Geſtures and
Words that did not ſavour of a Shoomaker, he
ey'd him more attentively, and fancy'd that he
beheld in him the Air not only of him whom
he had ſeen in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> but alſo of his
Brother <hi>de Vezins,</hi> which oblig'd him to ask him,
who and whence he was: The Young-man
modeſtly anſwer'd, that he was unable to give
him a clear anſwer, but that he was the Man
that had the Honour to ſee him in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and who there told him that he believ'd himſelf
to be his Nephew, the Son of the Lord <hi>de Vezins.
La Noue</hi> began to think that the Boy was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what he call'd himſelf: Afterwards asking
him ſeveral queſtions concerning the manner of

            <p>The Young-man who had acquired more
Judgment and Knowledge than when he ſaw
him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and perhaps was better able
to explain himſelf diſtinctly, gave him ſo great
ſatisfaction, that he remained convinced that
this was the true Heir of the Houſe of <hi>Vezins.</hi>
He might have abandoned him, and thereby
taken the advantage of his Siſters Succeſſion,
which was conſiderable, but he had too Noble
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33398:69"/>
a Soul to prefer profit to his Duty; he took the
Young-man along with him, and Educated
him in a manner ſuitable to his Birth, and his
Father, to whom he writ an account of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,

            <head>The Raging Duke.</head>
            <p>THE Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> was a great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, Grandfather to
the preſent <hi>French</hi> King, but his Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
prompting him to imagine that his Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to his Maſter were not rewarded according
to his Merit, he, with ſeveral others of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans,
entred into dangerous correſpondences
with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
to the prejudice of the Kings Affairs, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
conſpired to ſeize and deſtroy his Perſon.
King <hi>Henry</hi> had Intelligence of the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue,
yet had ſuch an entire love and favour
for him, that he ſent for him and acquainted him
with what diſcoveries he had made; but added,
That if he would be ſo ingenuous to give him
a full account of all the Tranſactions, he ſhould
certainly find Mercy and Pardon from him.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33398:70"/>
The Duke being ignorant that one <hi>La Fin,</hi> to
whom he had declared his Reſentments, and
made privy to the Deſigns he was managing,
had acquainted the King with the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
obſtinately refus'd to confeſs any thing, and
denied he was any way concerned in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
againſt him or his Government, making
many Preteſtations of his Innocency, beſeeching
the King to do him Juſtice againſt thoſe who
deſigned his Ruin by Slanders and falſe Reports,
which were inſupportable to ſo clear a Soul as
he had, deſiring leave to take his Revenge by
the Sword. The King led him to the Tennis-Court,
where the Duke propoſed the Match,
ſaying, <hi>That the Duke of</hi> Eſpernon <hi>and he would
play againſt His Majeſty and the Count of</hi> Soiſſons.
The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ſuddenly replied, <hi>My
Lord, you play well, but you make your Matches ill.</hi>
At Supper he ſeemed diſcontented, eating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor any Man ſpeaking to him, eſteeming
him a Man abandoned to Misfortune; yet he
thought he had ſo much Courage, that no
Man durſt lay hands on him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King in the mean time walked in his
Chamber, much diſturbed how to come to a
Reſolution, and ſpeaking of him and the Count
of</hi> Auvergne, <hi>with the other Conſpirators, being
full of Mercy and Clemency, he ſaid,</hi> If they
will yet return to their Duties, and give me the
opportunity to prevent the ill Deſigns of my Enemies,
I will ſtill pardon them: If they weep I will weep
with them; if they will remember the Duty that
they owe me, I will not forget to be kind and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to them; they ſhall find me as full of Clemency
as they are of Diſloyalty and Ingratitude. I would
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33398:70"/>
not make the Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> the firſt Example of
the Severity of my Juſtice, or that he ſhould cauſe
my Reign, which hath hitherto been like a calm and
ſerene Sky, to be over-caſt with Clouds, Thunder,
and Lightning; but yet I am reſolv'd he ſhall either
bend or break.</p>
            <p>Next morning the King commanded the
Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> to go to him, and endeavour
to mollify his Mind, and draw the Truth out
of him: He goes to him, he perſwades, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures,
beſeeches him to ſubmit himſelf to the
King, and to fear the Indignation of a Prince
as he would do the paw of a Lion. The Duke
of <hi>Biron</hi> anſwered roughly, <hi>That the King had
no reaſon to complain of him, unleſs it were for
his good Services, and that he himſelf had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
cauſe to complain that his Loyalty ſhould be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
who had given ſo many and ſo great proofs
thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> finding all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
were fruitleſs againſt his obſtinate temper,
left him, and the next morning early the King
ſent for him into the little Garden, and diſcours'd
with him a long time, he making ſtill great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
of his Innocency, beating his Breaſt,
and caſting up his Eyes to Heaven in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof. At their parting there appeared
Anger in the Kings Countenance, and by the
Dukes carriage there ſeemed Fire in his Words.
From thence the Duke went to Dinner, and had
a Letter delivered him with Advice to retire
himſelf; but he laugh'd at all warnings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
any Advertiſement of his fall. The King
had an account of his Bravado's, but took little
notice of them; at length, upon conſultation
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33398:71"/>
with ſome of the Lords of the Council, it was
reſolved that he ſhould be apprehended, and
likewiſe the Count of <hi>Auvergne;</hi> the King
would not have them taken in the Court but in
their own Lodgings, which the Duke of <hi>Biron</hi>
was ſomewhat apprehenſive of, and therefore
thought he need fear nothing in the Preſence-Chamber,
but that his danger would be moſt
in going forth, to prevent which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
a ſhort Sword, wherewith to make his
way by the Death of any Oppoſer. The King
was informed, that if he were not ſeized in the
Preſence-Chamber it would occaſion Blood-ſhed,
to prevent which it was convenient to paſs by
ſome unneceſſary reſpects; the King ſent for
<hi>Vitry</hi> and <hi>Pralin,</hi> Captains of his Guards, and
ordered them in what manner to execute his
commands.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> ſup'd at <hi>Montignys</hi> Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
where he diſcours'd more proudly and
vainly than ever of his own Merits, and his
many Friends in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and proceeded
highly to commend the Piety, Juſtice and Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
of the late King of <hi>Spain. Montigny</hi>
ſudenly interrupted him, ſaying, <hi>The greateſt
commendation due to that Princes memory, was,
That he put his own Son to Death, for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to promote troubles and diſturbances in the
State.</hi> This put an end to the Dukes Haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
who by his Eyes ſeemed to hear this ſharp
reply with much amazement and ſurprize.</p>
            <p>After Supper, the Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> and the
Count of <hi>Auvergne</hi> waited on the King in the
Garden, with a greater Train of Guards than
they expected. The King invited the Duke to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33398:71"/>
play in the Queens Lodgings; they plaid at Cheſs,
and the King being perplex'd, went often to and
again to his Cloſet. As they entred the Door of
the Chamber, the Count of <hi>Auvergne</hi> whiſpered
the Duke in the Ear, <hi>We are undone:</hi> The King
was much unreſolved, but at length he pray'd
God to aſſiſt him with his Holy Spirit, and to
infuſe ſuch Reſolutions into him as might be for
his Glory, and the good of his people, over
whom he Ruled only by his Grace. His Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ended his doubts were ſatisfied, and he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
abſolutely to deliver the Duke into the hands
of Juſtice. The Count of <hi>Auvergne</hi> was retir'd,
the King ſent for him, and walked about the
Room while the Duke minded nothing but his
Game; <hi>Varennes,</hi> Lieutenant of his Company,
pretending to take up his Cloak, told him in his
Ear, <hi>He was undone.</hi> This laſt word aſtoniſhed
him ſo that he neglected his Game, which the
Queen obſerving, told him, <hi>That he had miſreckon'd
himſelf to his own loſs.</hi> The King anſwered, <hi>That
they had plaid enough,</hi> commanding every man to
retire. He took the Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> into his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet,
and charged him, once for all, freely to
declare what Tranſactions he had managed with
the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Fuentes,</hi>
Governour for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> aſſuring him
that his Clemency ſhould ſurmount his Crimes.
The Duke, though he was conſcious to himſelf
that he deſerved Death, yet had not the humility
to deſire his Life, nor a Tongue to beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
but anſwered the King more reſolutely
than ever: <hi>That they had contrived the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of an honeſt Man, and that he had no
other deſign than what he had already diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:33398:72"/>
I wiſh to God it were ſo,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>but I
find you will not acquaint me with it. Adieu, Good
Night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Duke was going out of the Cabinet,
and had paſſed the Chamber-Door, he met <hi>Vitry,</hi>
who laid his Hand upon <hi>Birons</hi> Sword, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the delivery of it by the Kings Order:
<hi>From me!</hi> ſaid the Duke, <hi>What to take away my
Sword, who have ſo faithfully ſerved the King? My
Sword! Who have ended the War, and have ſettled
Peace in</hi> France? <hi>That my Sword which my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
could never wreſt from me, ſhould be now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away by my Friends.</hi> He intreated the Duke
of <hi>Montbazon</hi> to beſeech the King to give him
leave to deliver it into his own hands; the King
ordered <hi>Vitry</hi> to do as he had commanded him.
The Duke was forced to ſuffer it to be taken
from him, and in delivering in caſt his Eyes
about to ſeize upon another, but they prevented
him. When he ſaw all the Guard placed in the
Gallery, he thought they would have killed
him, and deſired to have ſomething in his Hand
that he might have the Honour to dye in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
himſelf, and ſome little time to pray to
God. They anſwered, That no Man ſhould
hurt him, they having Order from the King on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to conduct him to his Lodgings. <hi>You ſee</hi> (ſaid
he in paſſing by) <hi>how good Catholicks are Treated.</hi>
He was carried to the Cloſet of Arms, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſlept nor lay down. <hi>Praliu</hi> was ſent to
the Count <hi>Auvergne</hi> to demand his Sword in the
Kings Name: <hi>I take it</hi> (ſaid the Count) <hi>it hath
never killed any but Wild Boars, if thou hadſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
me of this I had been a Bed and aſleep two
hours ago.</hi> Theſe two Noble-men were like
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33398:72"/>
Torches in a Field of Corn, able to inflame
the Kingdom. The Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
impatient, ſcarce ſpeaking a Word but
it was either againſt God or the King, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
all the rage and fury of a Mad-man;
but ſuddenly recollecting himſelf, <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>I find this is but Folly, for all my paſſion and raving
will do me no Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King returned from <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> where
the Conſpiracy was diſcovered, to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
was received with the Shouts and Acclamations
of the people for his ſafe return, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from Slavery. The Priſoners were
led to the Baſtile, the Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> was melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
and dejected, the Count of <hi>Auvergne</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and pleaſant; the firſt entred the Baſtile as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Grave, the ſecond as into a Palace, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that no place could be a Priſon to him.
They had the liberty of the Houſe, but fearing
the Dukes deſperation might make him deſtroy
himſelf, they ſuffered none that came near him
to wear Arms; and ſeeing himſelf ſerved with a
Knife without a point, he ſaid, <hi>That this was to
the</hi> Greve, which is a place in <hi>Paris</hi> where great
perſons are Executed, and ſpeaking of Death
with diſdain, ſaid, <hi>That it could never come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
for to a Man well reſolved, nor ſtrange to him
that doth foreſee it, nor ſhameful to a Generous
Mind.</hi> He continued ſome time, after his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
without eating or ſleeping, and the
violent motions of his Heart caſt him into a
Fever, yet would take no Phyſick but what his
Phyſicians taſted firſt, for fear he ſhould be
Poyſoned; yet the fire of his Courage was not
ſmothered with his Diſtemper, what did he ſay,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33398:73"/>
or what did he not ſay, Fury and Choler made
him utter ſenceleſs Speeches. <hi>If they will put
me to Death,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Why do they not diſpatch
me, that they may not boaſt they have made me
afraid of Death? And then let them drink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Drunk with the Blood which remains of five
and thirty Wounds that I have received in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of</hi> France. To pacifie his furious diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourges</hi> was ſent to him
to rectifie his conſcience, and to remove ſome
Atheiſtical Opinions that he had imbraced, and
to aſſure him that if he did heartily repent and
confeſs his Crimes, he might yet expect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
both from God and the King. As ſoon
as he was a Priſoner, every one ſaid he was a
Dead man, and ſeeing himſelf ſo ſtrictly Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he ſaid, <hi>They did not put Birds of his kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Cage to ſuffer them to eſcape; for when once a
Man of Courage and Faction comes to be Impriſoned,
it is more dangerous to abſolve than to condemn
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King ſent to the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> to
proceed againſt him, and Commiſſioners were
appointed, who took Informations in the Baſtile.
The Priſoner at firſt was a little ceremonious
in his anſwers, but being entred into diſcourſe,
he gave the Commiſſioners matter enough to
work upon, confeſſing in a manner all he was
accuſed of, ſo that from his own Mouth they
might have juſtly condemned him, to loſe as
many Lives as he had Years. He had ſo ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
his Judgment in Proſperity, that it was
prejudicial to him in his Adverſity, yielding
ſometimes to Grief, then to Rage, and always
to Indiſcretion, ſpeaking as much to Ruine as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33398:73"/>
Diſcharge himſelf; he was confronted with the
Witneſſes face to face, but when he ſaw <hi>La Fin</hi>
he fell into an extream trembling. The Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
asked him if he would except againſt
<hi>La Fin;</hi> he replied, <hi>That he judged him a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of Honour, and his Friend and Kinſman.</hi>
But when he had heard his Depoſition, he cried
out againſt him as the moſt execrable Villain
in the World, appealing to all the Powers of
Heaven and Earth to juſtifie his Innocency. <hi>La
Fin</hi> being diſturbed to hear himſelf thus accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
told him, <hi>That he was ſorry they were in a
place where one was allowed to ſpeak all, and the
other to hear all;</hi> he juſtified all he had ſaid
againſt the Duke, and made a more full diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the conſpiracy than before. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
ſaid, <hi>That if</hi> Renaze <hi>were there he would
aver the contrary.</hi> This was another of the
Conſpirators, who was inſtantly brought before
him, at which he was extreamly ſurprized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that he had been dead in <hi>Savoy</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
He then alledged, that the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
had ſet him at Liberty to Ruine him, and
ſeemed confounded to find all things conſpire to
his deſtruction, for <hi>Renaze</hi> was made a Priſoner
in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to prevent him from diſcovering
this Treaſon, but making his eſcape, he came
juſt now, by an admirable Providence, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
the Teſtimony of his Maſter <hi>La Fin,</hi> who
elſe had been but a ſingle Witneſs.</p>
            <p>He had many friends, but the King repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
his crime to be ſo deteſtable and odious
to the Princes and Nobility, that none of them
had the courage to intercede for him; his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
being finiſhed, he is called to make his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:33398:74"/>
               <hi>He is Charged to have Treated with the
Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>about the Betraying of</hi> Bourg <hi>and
other places, and adviſing him to attempt againſt
the Kings Army and his own Perſon, diſcovering to
him many things of Importance, and offering him
his Service and Aſſiſtance againſt all Men, in hope
of Marrying his Daughter: That he would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
the King to appear before St.</hi> Katherines
<hi>Fort, on purpoſe that he might be Slain, and had
writ to the Governor how he ſhould diſtinguiſh His
Majeſty from others.</hi> Theſe and ſeveral Articles
more were alledged againſt him, but the Duke
denied all, and renounced the Confeſſion he had
made at his firſt Examination, alledging, That
<hi>La Fin</hi> had bewitched him, that he bit him by
the Ear, and made him drink Inchanted Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
calling him his King, his Prince, his Lord;
that he ſhewed him an Image of Wax which
ſpake theſe Words, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye Witched King,</hi>
and if he had ſuch power over a ſenſeleſs Image,
what might he not do upon him whom he had
wholly bewitched to do what he pleaſed? He
made a bold and reſolute Defence, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it in theſe words: <hi>My fault is great, but it
was only in thought and conception, and not Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in deſire, but not in effect; great Offences
muſt have great Pardons. I am he alone in</hi> France
<hi>who feel the Rigor of Juſtice, and cannot hope for
the Merit of Mercy; whatever happens, I rely
more upon you, Gentlemen, then on the King, who
having formerly regarded me with an Eye of Love,
looks no more on me now but with Indignation,
and holds it a Virtue to be cruel to me, and a Vice
to ſhew any act of Clemency towards me, it had been
better for me if he had not pardoned me at firſt, then
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33398:74"/>
to give me Life and now to make me loſe it with
Shame and Diſhonour.</hi> His diſcourſe was ſo long,
that the Judges had not time to give their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
ſo he was remanded to the Baſtile full of
hopes of being diſcharged, boaſting to the
Captains of the Guard, that he had defended
himſelf ſo bravely and diſcreetly, as doubtleſs
he had fully ſatisfied them all; adding, That
if he were Dead, no Man was able to ſupply
his place; and ſaying, Is it poſſible that the
King ſhould be ſo vain as to think to frighten
me with the apprehenſion of Death, or that he
is able to terrify me with it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three days after the Judges met, and upon
Conſultation concluded him to be Guilty of
High Treaſon, and the Chancellor with the firſt
Preſident of Parliament, with ſome others, went
into the Baſtile to acquaint him with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Court: The Duke looking out of a
Window at that time, he heard a Womans cries
and lamentations, which he inſtantly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
were made upon his account, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
diſturbed him, but eſpying the Chancellor
coming towards him croſs the Court, he cried
out that he was Dead.</hi> You come, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
my Sentence, I am unjuſtly Condemned, tell
my Relations that I dye innocent; <hi>and coming
near, he ſaid,</hi> O my Lord Chancellor, is there no
Pardon? Is there no Mercy? <hi>The Chancellor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
him, and put on his Hat; the Duke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
bare, and having abandoned all the
Powers of his Soul to Grief and Paſſion, he
ſpoke all that a Mind over-whelmed with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
could utter, reproaching the Chancellor
that he was more deſirous to condemn than ſave
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33398:75"/>
him, and raved againſt the King in the moſt
horrid expreſſions imaginable; then ſhaking the
Chancellor by the Arm,</hi> You have Judged me, <hi>ſaid
he,</hi> but God will Abſolve me, he will lay open the
Iniquities of thoſe who have ſhut their Eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would not ſee mine Innocency. You, my
Lord, ſhall anſwer for this Injuſtice before him,
whither I do Summon you within a year and a day;
I go before by the Judgment of Men, but thoſe that
are the cauſe of my Death, ſhall come after by the
Judgment of God. <hi>All which was ſpoke with
the utmoſt fury and rage, with other terrible
Words, both againſt the King and Parliament;
but his appeal was not anſwered, for the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
lived many years after, And then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in his diſcourſe,</hi> I ſee very well that I am
not the moſt Wicked, but the moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate,
thoſe that have done worſe than I ever thought are
favoured, the Kings Clemency is dead towards me,
he doth not imitate the example of <hi>Caeſar</hi> nor <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>
or of other great Princes, who not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
thoſe that intended ill, but that acted it too;
they were over-ſparing of Blood, yea, of the meaneſt.
Wherein can the King ſhew himſelf greater than in
Pardoning? Mercy is a Princely Virtue, every one
can give Death, but it belongs only to Soveraigns to
give Life; and Cruel that he is, Does he not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that he hath already pardoned me, I had a bad
Deſign and he graciouſly forgave me, I demand it
again, and ſo you may inform him. The Queen of
<hi>England</hi> told me, that if the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> would
have humbled himſelf and asked her Pardon, ſhe
would have forgiven him, but he grew obdurate and
would never implore her Mercy, and thereby depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her of all means to ſhow the effects of her Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33398:75"/>
ſhe like a Generous Princeſs, deſired to pardon
him as ſhe hoped that God would pardon her. He
was Guilty, I am Innocent, he Sued for no Pardon
for his Offence, I deſire it for mine Innocence. Is
it poſſible he ſhould forget the Services I have done
him? Does he not remember the Conſpiracy at
<hi>Mantes,</hi> and his great danger if I had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it? There is no vein in my Body that hath
not bled for his Service; he ſhews that he never lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me any longer than he thought himſelf to have
need of me. Has he forgotten the Siege of <hi>Amiens,</hi>
where I was often ſeen covered with Fire and Bullets,
ready to give or receive Death? My Father expoſed
himſelf to a thouſand Dangers, and loſt his Life to
ſet the Crown upon his Head; I have received thirty
five Wounds in my Body to ſecure the Crown to him,
and for my Reward he takes my Head from my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Let him beware, leſt the Justice of God fall
upon him, he will find what profit my Death will
bring him, it will but impair the Reputation of his
Juſtice. He will loſe this day a good Servant, and the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> a great Enemy; I am not put to
Death becauſe I Treated with him; my Courage rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me up, and my Courage ruins me.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor deſired him not to torment
himſelf any more about his Sentence, ſince they
had done him that Juſtice which a Father is
bound to pronounce againſt his Son in ſuch a
caſe as his. At which word his rage increaſed;
<hi>What Juſtice,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I was never heard but
once, I could not deliver the fiftieth part of my
Juſtification? What Juſtice upon the Evidence of</hi>
La Fin, <hi>the moſt wretched and execrable Villain
in the World?</hi> The Chancellor to divert his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
told him that he had brought two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33398:76"/>
to comfort and prepare him for Death;
he replied, <hi>That he was already prepared, and had
his Soul in that Tranquillity, as the Night before he
had ſpoken with God, and that his Guards had
heard him laugh in his Sleep.</hi> He deſired the
Chancellor that he might have the laſt conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of dying men, that is, Liberty to make his
Will, which was granted, and he gave away
ſeveral things to his Servants, and the Guards
attending him. They then deſired him to kneel
and hear the Sentence read; <hi>Read it,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>and I will be as ſupple as a Glove,</hi> but when men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made that he had attempted againſt
the Kings perſon, he fell again into a Rage, ſo
that it was concluded he ſhould be bound and
delivered inſtantly into the hands of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.
He ſwore he would be drawn to
pieces with four Horſes, before he would be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to dye at the <hi>Greve,</hi> but was told, That the
King had done him the favour to be Executed
in the Baſtile. By the perſwaſion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
he began to examine his Conſcience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
therein about an hour, which ought to
have been done with an humble, penitent, and
contrite Mind, but he ſeemed more careful of
the affairs of his Family than of his Soul, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God not as a devout Chriſtian but like a
Souldier. His Confeſſion being ended he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about, often crying out of his Innocency, and
curſing <hi>La Fin,</hi> and asking if it were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for his Brethren to cauſe him to be Burnt.
He deſired to ſee ſome of his Relations and
Friends whom he Named, but was told, That
there were none of them in the City, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he mournfully ſaid, <hi>All the World hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33398:76"/>
me, in theſe Crimes Friendſhip is dangerous,
Friends fail, and the Diſeaſe is counted Infectious
to Acquaintance; he is Wiſeſt that knows no Man,
nor any Man him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Going out of the Chappel the Executioner
preſented himſelf to him; he asked <hi>Voiſon</hi> who
he was, <hi>It is,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Executioner of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
Be gone,</hi> ſaid the Duke, <hi>touch me not till
it be time;</hi> and doubting he ſhould be bound,
he added, <hi>I will go freely to Death, I have no
hands to defend my ſelf againſt it, but it ſhall never
be ſaid that I dye bound like a Thief or a Slave,</hi> and
turning towards the Hang-man, he ſwore if he
came near him he would pull out his Throat.
He at length came to the Scaffold, and kneeling
upon the firſt ſtep, made a ſhort Prayer, with
his eyes lift up to Heaven; when he came up,
he caſt a furious look upon the Executioner,
<hi>Voiſon</hi> perſwaded him it was not he, <hi>Nay,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>You think to deceive me, but I know him well
enough.</hi> The Executioner offered him a Cloth
to put before his Eyes, but he refuſed it, ſaying,
<hi>That if he touch'd him, except only to give him
the ſtroke of Death, he would ſtrangle him.</hi> He
open'd his Breaſt to the Guards, and ſaid he
ſhould be much obliged to them if they would
ſhoot him with a Musket. <hi>What pity is it,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>to dye ſo miſerably, and of ſo infamous a
ſtroke.</hi> He asked then, <hi>Is there no pardon? Well,
I have made my Soul ready to preſent it before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, but I pity the Kings Soul, who hath
put me to Death unjuſtly, for I dye abſolutely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and my Death is the Recompence he gives me
for all my Services.</hi> Theſe Words drew tears as
well from the Souldiers as the reſt of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33398:77"/>
Spectators; the Judges told him his Sentence
muſt be read once more, which he heard with
great impatience. After which, the Preachers
perſwaded him to call upon God, and abandon
the thoughts of all earthly things; he asks what
he muſt do, then takes his Handkerchief and
covers his Eyes, asking the Executioner where
he ſhould Seat himſelf, <hi>There, my Lord,</hi> quoth
the Hang-man: <hi>And where's that, thou ſeeſt I am
blindfold, and yet ſpeakeſt as if I ſaw?</hi> And then fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
pulls his Handkerchief from his Eyes,
then blinds himſelf again, commanding the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
to diſpatch him quickly. He deſired
to dye ſtanding, but the Hang-man told him he
muſt kneel, for he durſt not do any thing but
according to Order; at length he kneeled down,
and bid the Executioner make an end, but
ſtarting up ſuddenly again, <hi>What is there no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
then?</hi> ſays he, looking ſeverely upon the
Spectators and the Hang-man, and it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
he deſigned either to have taken his
Sword from him, and hewed his way through
the people, or that he did believe the King
would only affright him with the Terrors of
Death, and then ſend his Pardon. The Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
deſired leave to cut his Hair; at this
he grew into a rage, and ſwore if he touch'd
him he would Strangle him. <hi>Voiſon</hi> reproved
him; ſays he, <hi>He ſhall not meddle with me while
I am living, and if you put me into a paſſion, I
will Strangle half the company that is here, and
force the reſt to kill me. I will leap off the Scaffold
if you throw me into deſpair.</hi> The Preachers
came again upon the Stage, and endeavoured
to allay his fury; at length he grew calm, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33398:77"/>
out. <hi>My God, my God, take pity upon me.</hi> The
Preachers aſſure him that his Soul is ready to
ſee God, <hi>I,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Heaven is open for my Soul;</hi>
he then bowed his Head, ſaying to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
<hi>Strike, ſtrike, O ſtrike.</hi> The Hang-man
ſeeing he had roſe thrice before, and fearing he
would ſeize his Sword, reſolved to ſurprize him,
telling him he muſt ſay his laſt Prayer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
his Soul to God, which by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
intreaty he did, when the Hang-man gave
a ſign to his Man to reach his Sword, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he cut off his Head while he was ſpeaking.
The blow was ſo ſudden that few perceived it,
and the Head leaped from the Scaffold to the
ground, and even then his Countenance ſeemed
furious. This was the end of the paſſionate
Duke of <hi>Biron,</hi> whoſe Courage was Invincible
in War, and was never tired with Labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often fifteen days together on Horſeback,
but his Pride and Ambition clouded all his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which with his boiling Rage, and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Fury, were the great occaſion of his Ruin.
He was advanced from the meaneſt to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
degree of Honour, of a private Souldier he
became a Captain, then Collonel, afterwards
Admiral, great Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Kings Armies, and in his Heart aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
to be Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Son-in-Law to
the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Nephew to the King
of <hi>Spain.</hi> He was bred a Proteſtant, then
turned Papiſt, but was a Scoffer at all Religion.
It is reported, that being formerly in trouble for
the Murder of a Gentleman in a Duel, and for
which he afterward had a Pardon from the King,
he went diſguiſed like a Carrier to one <hi>La Broſſe,</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:33398:78"/>
a great Mathematician, to whom he ſhewed his
Nativity as one skilled therein, which he had
got to be taken by another, pretending it was
a Gentlemans whom he ſerved, that deſired to
know what end he ſhould have; <hi>La Broſſe</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conſider'd it, told him, <hi>That the Perſon was
of a good Houſe, and no older than himſelf, and
he ſuppoſed it his own: 'Tis no matter for that,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>but pray tell me what his Life, Eſtate,
and end ſhall be.</hi> The Old man replied, <hi>My
Son, I find that he whoſe Nativity this is, ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to great Honour by his Induſtry and great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and may be a King, but that there is a</hi> Caput
Argol <hi>will hinder it. And what is that,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron?
Do not ask me,</hi> quoth the Old man: <hi>Nay,
but I will know,</hi> ſays <hi>Biron.</hi> At length he told
him, <hi>That the Perſon would act thoſe things which
ſhould cauſe him to loſe his Head;</hi> whereupon
<hi>Biron</hi> beat him ſeverely, and leaving him half
Dead in the little Garret where they were, he
Lock'd it, and carried the Key with him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he boaſted afterward to his Companions.
It is likewiſe ſaid, that he had ſome diſcourſe
with a Magician in <hi>Paris,</hi> who told him, <hi>That
only one back blow of a</hi> Burgundian <hi>would hinder
him from being King.</hi> Which Prediction he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
in Priſon, and ſent one to inquire
what Country-man the Hang-man was, and
hearing he was a <hi>Burgundian,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Then am
I a Dead Man.</hi> It is alſo ſaid, that his Father
obſerving his Ambitious temper, ſaid thus to
him: Biron, <hi>I would adviſe thee when a Peace
ſhall be made, to go and live privately at thy own
Houſe, or elſe thou muſt leave thy Head upon a
Scaffold;</hi> which happened accordingly, as we

Earl of <hi>Holland, Zealand</hi> and <hi>Friezeland,</hi>
was a Valiant Prince, but gave himſelf up to
Incontinency, which was the occaſion of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
fall. His Father, <hi>William</hi> the Second,
was Elected King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and after
the Death of <hi>Conrade,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> was
declared to be his Succeſſor; and Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi>
by Letters, gave him advice thereof, deſiring
him to come to <hi>Rome</hi> and receive the Crown,
and all the other Enſigns of the Imperial Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
King <hi>William</hi> having no great confidence
in ſome of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
Travelled to <hi>Rome</hi> in the Habit of a Pilgrim,
accompanied with twelve of his Loyal Nobility,
and arriving in <hi>Italy,</hi> met with the Pope at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi>
by whom he was Honourably received,
and having conferr'd with him, he went from
thence, in the ſame Habit, through <hi>Lombardy</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> being owned and acknowledged
for their lawful Soveraign in all places where he
would diſcover himſelf, and conſulted with the
Nobility about the Affairs of the Empire.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was thus imployed, he had Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
that the <hi>Weſt Frizons</hi> were Revolted, and
as they formerly had done; Invaded the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Holland,</hi> from whence they daily carried
away great Booties, without oppoſition or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
he being ſo far diſtant from them. The

               <hi>Italy</hi> with a Royal Train and Army, to be

defer his Journey for ſome time, and to preſerve
his own Inheritance, and ſettle peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in his own Country, and among his own
Subjects, than to go ſo far off to purchaſe a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

and Prelates, ſome treacherous Villain
wounded him very dangerouſly on the Head
with a Stone, while he ſate at Table, and yet
none could perceive from whence it came. This
accident did extreamly diſturb the Prelates and
Lords who had invited him to the Feaſt: The
King taking up the Stone, ſaid, <hi>Do but obſerve
what malice and deſpight the people of</hi> Utrecht <hi>ſhew
toward me, to knock me on the Head with Stones,
though I never deſerved any evil at their Hands, but
have always aſſiſted them, and ſubdued their Enemies
at my own Charge; but by the living God, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
ſhall not go unpuniſhed, if I live but one year
longer.</hi> Having ſaid thus, he inſtantly took
Horſe, and rid away in great Indignation,
threatning the whole City with utter Ruin and
Devaſtation. The Magiſtrates and Burgeſſes of
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> were extreamly concerned at this wicked
and unfortunate accident, and having obtained a
Paſport, they ſend their Burgomaſters to his
Court at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to endeavour to pacifie his
Wrath and Indignation againſt them. The
King anſwered them in few words, <hi>That what
he had Sworn he would certainly perform, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
utterly to deſtroy their Town, unleſs they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into his Hands him that had thrown the Stone.</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:33398:79"/>
With this anſwer they returned, and having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
their Council, they made diligent ſearch
for the Delinquent but could not find him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King haſtened into

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> eſcaped the
terrible Vengeance he had deſigned to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

paſſage, and erected a Caſtle near <hi>Alkmer,</hi> which
he called <hi>Tornenburg,</hi> or, <hi>The Caſtle of his Wrath.</hi>
He then proceeded with all ſpeed in hope to
ſurprize the Rebels, for it being Winter, the
Lord of <hi>Brederode,</hi> who led one of the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
had incountred and vanquiſhed the
<hi>Drechters,</hi> and the King mounted upon a very
great Horſe, leading the other Battalion, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to find the ſhorteſt way to <hi>Hoockwind,</hi>
which he deſigned to burn, and marched alone
a great way before his Troops over the Ice, as
if it had been firm ground, but the Ice happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to break his Horſe fell in, and he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
drowned, he having none near to aſſiſt him.
The <hi>Frizons,</hi> who lay in Ambuſh in the Reeds
and Oſiers, ſeeing a Horſeman thus mired, they
ran thither and knock'd him on the Head with
Clubs and Staves, not knowing him to be the
King, but obſerving his Target they thought
him to be ſome Nobleman. Some <hi>Hollanders</hi> in
thoſe parts who were baniſhed thither for their
crimes, coming haſtily thither, diſcovered by his
Arms who he was, and told the <hi>Frizons</hi> that they
had done very ill to Murder the King their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Lord and Prince, which when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
both Man, Woman and Child, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
grieved and concerned, and conſulting
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33398:80"/>
together, reſolved to Bury him ſecretly in the
Village of <hi>Hoockwind.</hi> His Army hearing their
King was dead, were ſo aſtoniſhed that they
Disbanded and returned home; and this was the
miſerable end of this great Prince, after he had
Governed his Inheritance twenty years, and the
Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> ſeven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Floris</hi> the Fifth, his Son, ſucceeded him at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
years of Age, and Levied a powerful
Army to Revenge his Fathers Death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the <hi>Weſt Frizons</hi> to his Obedience, and to
bring away his Fathers Bones and Bury them in
<hi>Zealand.</hi> The <hi>Frizons</hi> hearing of his approach,
met and incountred him at <hi>Verone</hi> near <hi>Alkmar,</hi>
in which skirmiſh five hundred <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and
ſome of Quality, were ſlain, who thereupon
retired and Incamped in the open Field, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received a Reinforcement went to attack
the <hi>Frizons,</hi> who being proud of their former
Succeſs came on boldly, but the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
routed them, and killed eight hundred upon the
place. Soon after <hi>Floris</hi> again defeated them in
another Battel, and at length wholly ſubdued
them, building ſeveral Caſtles to ſecure them in
their Obedience for the future, and thereby
ſettled all his Dominions in Peace.</p>
            <p>There was in the Court of <hi>Floris</hi> a Valiant
Nobleman, called <hi>Gerard Van Velſon,</hi> whom the
Prince had kept Priſoner a whole year, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Beheaded his Brother unjuſtly for ſeveral
crimes charged upon him by thoſe that hated
him; <hi>Floris,</hi> after his Death, being informed of
the Truth, ſet his Brother <hi>Gerard</hi> at Liberty, and
endeavoured by all means to repair the wrong
he had done, by honouring and advancing his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33398:80"/>
Brother, and to make him the more affectionate
to his Service, the Earl thinking very much to
oblige him, offered <hi>Gerard</hi> his Miſtriſs, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,
in Marriage; <hi>Gerard</hi> ſcorned and decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the motion, but being ſtill importuned by
<hi>Floris,</hi> told him plainly, <hi>Sir, I am not of ſo mean
and baſe a Spirit as to put my Feet in your old
Shooes;</hi> which is a <hi>Dutch</hi> Proverb, intimating,
That he would not Marry his leavings, or his
caſt Wench. The Earl diſpleaſed, replied, <hi>Yes,
I am reſolved thou ſhalt have my leavings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gerard</hi> goes from the Court in diſcontent, not
regarding the Counts words, and a while after
Marries the Daughter of <hi>Herman</hi> Lord of <hi>Woer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and Niece to <hi>Gisbert</hi> of <hi>Amſtel.</hi> Count
<hi>Floris</hi> having notice that <hi>Gerard</hi> was Married,
and that he came no more to Court, by the
perſwaſion of his Miſtriſs he ſent for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come he gave him Commiſſion to diſpatch
ſome Affairs a great way in the Country, that
were of much importance, which <hi>Gerard</hi> thought
to be a great favour from his Prince; during
his abſence, the Earl, with a few Attendants,
went to the Caſtle of <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> where <hi>Gerard</hi>
uſually reſided, pretending to refreſh himſelf
there; <hi>Gerards</hi> Lady received him with great
Reſpect and Honour, as being her Lord and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.
The Count pretended he had ſome
matters to tell her which required ſecrecy, and
deſired her to ſhew him ſome private Room,
the innocent Lady ſuſpecting nothing, carried
him into her own Bed-Chamber, the Earl ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faſtned the Door, began to Court her very
earneſtly to yield to his unlawful deſires, which
ſhe refuſing with abhorrence, he took his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:33398:81"/>
in that ſecret place, where her cries could
not be heard, to offer violence to her, and a
length, being ſtronger than ſhe, he Raviſhed her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and then in all haſte departed. The abuſed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
gave her ſelf up to Sorrow and Dſepair, for
the wrong that had been offered her by her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Prince, who above all things ought to hav<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

protected and defended the Chaſtity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Ladies, eſpecially perſons of her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and throwing off her rich Attire and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
ſhe put her ſelf in deep Mourning till her
Lords return, who coming back from perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Commiſſion, gave an account thereof to
the Earl, and then going to his own Houſe, was
much ſurprized to find his Lady in that diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
poſture, and underſtanding the occaſion
of it, he comforted her in the beſt manner he
could, and appeared to the World as one wholly
ignorant of the matter, ſending his Wife to the
Houſe of the Lord of <hi>Woerden</hi> her Father, with
a command to give him an account of the whole
Fact, which ſhe did accordingly, adding, <hi>That
ſhe hoped her Father would not be angry with her for
the diſhonour that had happened to his Family, ſince
it was acted forcibly and violently, under the pretence
of Kindneſs and Hoſpitality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gerard</hi> conſulted with his Father-in-Law what
ſhould be done, and how he were beſt to govern
himſelf in this affair, ſwearing and proteſting
upon his Honour, that he would never ſuffer ſo
horrid an abuſe to paſs unrevenged; after which
he never came to Court, but ſtudied continually
how to execute his intended Vengeance. The
Lord of <hi>Woerden</hi> was likewiſe very ſenſibly
touched for the diſhonour of his Daughter and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33398:81"/>
Family, and from that time became a Mortal
Enemy to Count <hi>Floris:</hi> Theſe two drew
<hi>Gisbert</hi> of <hi>Amſtel,</hi> their Kinſman, into a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
againſt the Earl, and by the Advice of theſe
two Lords, <hi>Gerard</hi> ſecretly ſent for the Biſhop of
<hi>Duras,</hi> for the King of <hi>England,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Cuyck,</hi> in the Name of the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and
two Councellors for the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who
being met at <hi>Cambray, Gerard</hi> declared the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
Treachery of <hi>Floris</hi> with all the rage and
aggravations that could be invented, which ſo
incenſed them, that, after mature deliberation,
they concluded to attempt all means to ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earls Perſon, and to ſend him to the King
of <hi>England,</hi> there to end his days in Priſon;
and in the mean time, to ſend for <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
Son-in-Law to <hi>Floris,</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi>

            <p>Count <hi>Floris</hi> wholly ignorant of this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy

a difference between the Lord of <hi>Zulyn</hi> and ſome
of his Councellors, two of whom were the Lords
<hi>Amſtel</hi> and <hi>Woerden;</hi> the Earl going to Church
with his Guards and Houſhold Servants, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
delivered him a ſmall Paper, containing
theſe Verſes of the Pſalm:
<q>
                  <l>My deareſt Friend, whom I did truſt,</l>
                  <l>With me did uſe Deceit,</l>
                  <l>And thoſe who daily eat my Bread,</l>
                  <l>Did for my Soul lay wait.</l>
               </q>

            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:33398:82"/>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>conſider well, and remember
this complaint of King</hi> David. The Earl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
this advertiſement, and went to Dine
with the Noblemen and Prelates of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi>
where he was very merry; after Dinner he laid
himſelf down to ſleep awhile, deſigning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the day for Sport and Pleaſure, when
the Lord of <hi>Amſtel</hi> waking him, invited him to
ride abroad with his Hawks, ſaying, They had
found a brave flight of Herns, and other Wild
Fowl. The Count, who much delighted in
Hawking, inſtantly mounted his Horſe, with a
Hawk on his Fiſt, and a very ſmall Attendance:
When he had rid about half a mile from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi>
he was led into the midſt of the Ambuſh of the
Conſpirators, who iſſuing out upon him, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
him on all ſides; <hi>Gerard Van Volſen,</hi> who
thought himſelf moſt wronged, was the firſt that
offered to lay hold on him, but the Couragious
Prince, caſting his Hawk from his Fiſt, drew
his Sword to defend himſelf, chooſing rather to
dye than to be taken, but being over-powred by
number, and unable to make any further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
they ſeized him, and deſigned to have
conveyed him privately that Night to the Caſtle
of <hi>Muyden,</hi> and from thence to ſend him into
<hi>England,</hi> down the River of <hi>Flye.</hi> The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Conſpirators was the Lords of <hi>Woerden, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel,
Velſon, Beuſchop, Cragenhorſt, Thelingen, Van
Zanthen,</hi> and divers others.</p>
            <p>The News of the ſurprizal of the Prince, ſoon
alarm'd the whole Country, ſo that the <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Waterlanders,</hi> and <hi>Weſt Frizons,</hi> inſtantly
Armed themſelves, going aboard their Boats and
Shallops to deliver their Lord; the Conſpirators
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33398:82"/>
having notice of their coming fled away, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the Earl through Marſhes and By-paths,
to prevent his being diſcovered, but the people
of <hi>Naerden,</hi> who firſt went in ſearch of them,
happened to meet them juſt in their paſſage, who
being much perplexed knew not which way to
make their eſcape. The Counts Horſe, to
which he was bound, being little and weak, and
unable to accompany them, fell into a Ditch
with him, they laboured to get him out, but not
daring to ſtay, becauſe they found themſelves
cloſely purſued, <hi>Gerard Van Velſon,</hi> full of Rage
and Revenge, fearing to loſe the Prize, ſeeing
there was a neceſſity to abandon him, the reſt
of his Companions being already fled, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to part with him without ſatisfaction for
his wrongs, and therefore deſperately fell upon
his Natural Soveraign, giving him one and
twenty Wounds with his Sword, moſt of which
were Mortal, and then mounting upon a ſwift
Horſe, he made his eſcape to his Caſtle of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburg.</hi>
The <hi>Kennemers</hi> arrive ſoon after, and
find the Earl almoſt Dead and Speechleſs in the
Ditch, being ſcarce able to draw his breath;
ſome of the Servants of the Murderers were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and cut in pieces before the Earls face,
and having drawn him out of the Ditch they
carried him to Mount <hi>Muyden,</hi> where he in a
ſhort time expired, after having Governed <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Friezland,</hi> forty two years.
He was a Generous Prince, of a comely Stature
and Preſence, Courteous and Elegant in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
a good Muſician, and very Charitable;
in ſhort, he had all that could be wiſh'd for in
a Prince, had not his Virtues been ſullied with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:33398:83"/>
the Vice of Incontinency, and this laſt Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Adultery. Count <hi>Floris</hi> had two Grey-hounds,
which always followed him when he
went abroad, theſe were found lying in the
Ditch by him where he was Wounded, and
when his Body was put into a Boat to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to <hi>Alkmer</hi> they leaped into it, and would
neither eat nor drink though it was offered them,
and would certainly have ſtarved themſelves, if
they had not by force been drawn away from
the Earls dead Body.</p>
            <p>Thus have we ſeen Revenge acted to the
height on one ſide, let us now obſerve how it
purſued the Actors of this Bloody Tragedy; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the Aſſiſtants to this Murder fled out of
the Country, the Lord of <hi>Woerden</hi> wandred
about like a Vagabond, and at length died miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
in a Forreign Land. The Lord of <hi>Amſtel,</hi>
who was a good Man, but drawn in by the reſt,
had all his Eſtate ſeized, and fled into <hi>Germany.</hi>
The common people were ſo inraged at this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Fact, that they vowed Revenge againſt the
chief Actors, and went to beſiege the Caſtle of
<hi>Cronenburg,</hi> thoſe within it continued quiet, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that neither <hi>Gerard</hi> nor his Accomplices
were there, though indeed they were. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this Murder was ſent to all the Friends
of Count <hi>Floris,</hi> particularly to the Earl of
<hi>Heynault,</hi> and to Count <hi>John</hi> his Son, who came
before the Caſtle and planted their Engines of
Battery againſt it: The Earl of <hi>Cuick</hi> (who was
preſent at the conſultation at <hi>Cambray,</hi> in the
Name of the Duke of <hi>Brabant)</hi> hearing that
<hi>Gerard</hi> was beſieged in his Caſtle, writ to the
Earl of <hi>Cleves,</hi> who was at the Siege, intreating
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:33398:83"/>
him to endeavour that the Beſieged might have
leave to depart with their Lives ſaved, which
the Earl conſented to, and got his Guards about
him to ſecure them in their going away.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> hearing of this agreement were
much diſcontented, and gave notice thereof to
the Lord of <hi>Loef,</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Cleves,</hi>
who coming thither, aſſured the Earl that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his agreement to ſave their Lives,
yet the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> would certainly
fall upon them and diſpatch them, which would
bring much Scandal and Reproach upon him and
his Family, that he endeavoured to ſave ſuch
Bloody Murderers, and therefore it were better
to let them alone to reduce the Caſtle, and retire
with his Forces. The Earl doubting it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon his Honour, reſolved to join with the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> in reducing it, and by Scaling Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and other Inſtruments of War, they at
length took it by Aſſault, and kept the Priſoners
in ſafe cuſtody.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kennemers</hi> having notice that the Earl of
<hi>Cleves</hi> would ſave the Lives of <hi>Gerard Van Velſen,</hi>
and the reſt, they preſently run to Arms, and
cried out, <hi>That if there were any who ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſave the Lives of the Murderers of their
Prince, they ſhould firſt dye themſelves by their hands;</hi>
whereupon the Earl was forced to deliver them
the Priſoners. The people of <hi>Dort</hi> had <hi>Hugh</hi> of
<hi>Baverland,</hi> the <hi>Kennemers</hi> had the Lord <hi>Thelingen,</hi>
thoſe of <hi>Haerlem Van Zanthem,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Dort</hi> the
Lord <hi>Beuſchop,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cleves</hi> had <hi>Gerard</hi> of
<hi>Craenhorſt,</hi> and four others, who were all broken
upon the Wheel with cruel Tortures, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Beheaded, and thoſe of <hi>Leyden</hi> had <hi>Gerard
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33398:84"/>
Van Velſon,</hi> the Author of this conſpiracy, and
the immediate Murderer of Count <hi>Floris,</hi> whom
they reſolved to puniſh with the moſt exquiſite
Torments; ſo they put him ſtark Naked into a
Barrel full of ſharp Nails, and then rolled him
up and down through all the Streets of <hi>Leyden.</hi>
After which cruel uſage they took him out,
broke him upon a Wheel, and then Beheaded
him; and all his Kindred, even to the ninth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that could be taken, were broken upon
Wheels. Many upon ſuſpicion only of being
willing to ſerve their Maſters upon this occaſion,
were baniſhed for ever out of <hi>Holland;</hi> ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
to fly into <hi>Denmark</hi> miſtaking their courſe,
were driven beyond the Streight of <hi>Weygate,</hi> not
knowing whither they went, and coaſted along
<hi>Tartary</hi> till they entred the River of <hi>Oby,</hi> from
whence they Sailed into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and by leave
from that King, Inhabited a Marſhy part of that
Country, and cultivated it after the manner of
<hi>Holland,</hi> where they have continued their ancient
Language, Labour, and courſe of Life, to this
time. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> raſed the Caſtle of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburg</hi>
to the ground; after which, the Nobility,
Towns, and Commons of <hi>Holland,</hi> agreed joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
together, to root out and deſtroy the Houſes
and Families of <hi>Amſtel, Woerden, Velſon,</hi> and all
their Kindred and Allies, which they confirmed
by ſolemn Oaths and Writings, drawn between
them upon Record, whereby many Innocents
were made Beggars and Vagabonds, ſo that not
one perſon of any of theſe Families durſt appear
publickly in <hi>Holland,</hi> but concealed themſelves,
or led Country Lives; neither did any Man
preſume ever ſince to bear the Coats of Arms of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33398:84"/>
any of theſe three Houſes. And thus was one
Revenge followed by another, to the Ruine and
deſtruction of ſo many people. <hi>Hiſtory of the</hi>

They reſted ſo ſecurely upon the faith thereof,

to the D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> on this ſide the Mountains, who
declared that it was both his own and his Maſters

in the Night, and had aſſured his Maſter of the
facility of the Enterprize, and having likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
with the Syndick, or Commander of

them; yet they took Courage, and leaving the
Main Body of their Army at <hi>Plein Palais,</hi> the moſt
reſolute of them, who had undertaken to Scale
the Walls, alighted from their Horſes, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Counterſcarp in the Ditch of <hi>Coraterie,</hi>
and were no ſooner there when a flight of Wild
Ducks aroſe and made them ſtart, fearing they
ſhould wake the Sentinels, and diſcover the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
At length, recovering themſelves, they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33398:86"/>
paſſed ſoftly over the Ditch upon Hurdles, to
prevent ſinking in the mud, and raiſed up three
Ladders againſt the Walls near the Watch Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
toward <hi>Monnoye,</hi> and as they after confeſſed,
threw ſeveral Stones againſt the Wall to try if
any one heard them; the Ladders were black,
not to be ſeen in the dark, jointed together to be
ſhortned and lengthned at pleaſure, and to be
carried on Horſeback, the Feet had ſharp Iron
Spikes to faſten them in the Ground, the top of
theſe Ladders, which were to touch the Wall,
had a Pulley, and were covered with thick
Cloth to ſlide the eaſier, and with leſs noiſe.
They had alſo Steel Hammers to cut the Chains
of the Draw-bridge, with the Locks and Bolts,
and Pinchers to pluck out Nails and Hinges from
Gates, and ſeveral Petards to burſt them open;
and being thus furniſhed they began to climb.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sonos,</hi> one of the forwardeſt, who reſolved to
Revenge the Death of his Father, who was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> began, by an ill Omen, to
bleed at Noſe, before he aſcended the Ladder,
and being got half way up, received ſuch a blow
by the fall of a Stone from the Wall, as almoſt
took away his ſences, and was forced to come
down. <hi>Albigny,</hi> who was moſt concerned in the
Succeſs of the buſineſs, ſtood at the Foot of the
Ladder, incouraging the Souldiers with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Booty they might expect if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.
Father <hi>Alexander,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Jeſuit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Exhortation he made them in <hi>Plein Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi>
Confeſſed them at the foot of the Ladder,
aſſuring them, <hi>That if they ſhould dye in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
the rounds of the Ladder would be as ſo many

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:33398:86"/>
poor Prieſt did not foreſee that they would leave
the World from off another kind of Ladder than
this. He likewiſe gave them little Bills, with
ſome paſſages of Scripture writ in them, and other
Papers, like Charms or Conjuration, which he
ſaid would preſerve thoſe that carried them from
ſudden Death. <hi>December 12.</hi> about One in the
Morning they began to mount, all things were
quiet and ſtill, ſo that <hi>Sonos, Attignae,</hi> and ſix
others, entred the City through a Gate that is
within, and is always left open, and walk'd
about the Streets in couples, to obſerve whether
the people were faſt aſleep, or that this great
Silence were not a Trick to intrap them; but
all were quiet, and the reſt climbed up in great
numbers.</p>
            <p>The Duke hearing that his moſt reſolute men
were entred without reſiſtance, ſent for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>

it to be confidently reported in <hi>Piedmont, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>
and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> that <hi>Geneva</hi> was taken, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he had cauſe to think ſo, ſince two hundred
of the ſtouteſt men in his Army were already got
in. Some lay flat on the ground under the Trees
of the Parapet, others ſtood up againſt the Houſes
in <hi>Corraterie,</hi> till they ſhould be ſtronger, for <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalciu,</hi>
and the other chief Managers, did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to appear till four a Clock in the Morning,
that their men might have the more time to climb
up, and that the Rere-Guard might approach
nearer, and likewiſe that they might have more
light to carry on this weighty affair; but about
Three in the morning, a Souldier who ſtood Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:33398:87"/>
in the Tower of <hi>Monnoye,</hi> hearing a noiſe in
the Ditch, called his Corporal to know what it
might be, the Corporal ſends a Souldier, with a
Lanthorn, who takes his Musket with him, and
gets upon the Parapet, where he perceives ſome
Armed Men coming toward him, to whom he
cry'd, <hi>Who comes there?</hi> and having no anſwer,
fired his Musket at them; they inſtantly fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and he crying out <hi>Arm, Arm,</hi> they knock'd
him down, which the Sentinel perceiving, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his Piece to give notice to the Main Guard,
who were only ſix Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bruneleiu,</hi> and the moſt reſolute among them,
perceiving they were diſcovered, and that it was
impoſſible to conceal themſelves any longer, and
ſuppoſing they were ſtrong enough to ſurprize
the City, reſolved to ſtand to it, and diſpoſed their
Men to the beſt advantage to attack their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in four ſeveral places, till they could bring
the Petards to force the New Gate, and let in their
Troops that lay at <hi>Plein Pallais,</hi> reſerving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
party to aſſiſt thoſe who were ſtill
climbing up.</p>
            <p>They then fiercely aſſaulted the New Gate, the
Guard being only thirteen men, ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the neighbouring Sentries. Moſt of
the Guard when they fired run away, and alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe that watch'd at the Town-Houſe, and
other places; they were purſued as far as the <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ille</hi>
Gate, which was ſpeedily clapt to; the Enemy
finding it ſhut, they made themſelves Maſters of
the New Gate. In the mean time, of the three
that remained of the Guard, two hid themſelves,
and the third got to the top of the Gate, and very
prudently let down the Port-cullice, ſo that they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33398:87"/>
were amazed to ſee themſelves prevented when
they came to apply the Petard to the Gate. A
Citizen, who was one of the firſt awakened at
the noiſe, came out of his Houſe with his Halbert
half undreſs'd, and diſcovering four or five Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
asked aloud where the Enemy was, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up to him, cried out. <hi>Peace, Slave, come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and be on our ſide: God bleſs the Duke of</hi> Savoy.
Upon which, perceiving they were Enemies, he
flies back and alarm'd the neighbouring Streets;
but the Enemy won the Gate of <hi>Tartaſs,</hi> and
keeping their ground, endeavoured to make good
the paſſage. The Citizens run thither to Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
the way to the Gate, ſome being perceived by
their Torches were killed by the Enemy, others
wounded; <hi>Canal,</hi> an Ancient Captain of great
Courage, going beyond the Chain, and not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Enemy ſo near, was ſlain, but perceiving
the Citizens to increaſe, they retired to their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
at the New Gate.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the City being throughly
alarm'd, ſome went to their uſual Rendevouz,
others ran directly upon the Enemy, who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
they had effected the buſineſs, ſhouted out
along the Streets, <hi>God bleſs the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>God
bleſs the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>the City is our own, kill, kill,
kill'um; down with 'um, down with 'um.</hi> The Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word
whereby they knew each other, was, when
they met, to croak like a Frog. When the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
demanded <hi>Who goes there,</hi> they anſwered
<hi>Friends;</hi> others to divide them cried out, <hi>Arm,
Arm, the Enemy is at the Gate of</hi> Rive. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
broke twice through the Guards at <hi>Monnoye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and forcing open the Doors, behind which the
Souldiers had Barricado'd themſelves, were ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33398:88"/>
into the City, but the Grand Rounds oppoſed
them with ſo much courage, that they left many
Dead upon the place. The Citizens likewiſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in, briskly charged them, and kill'd one on
the Bridge of <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> and another between the
Gate and the Port-cullice which was let down.
Being repulſed from thence, they endeavoured to
break through the Houſes into the chief Street of
the City, killing one Man, and applying the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
to a Stable Door.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this was doing, a Gunner having fired
a Cannon from the Bulwark of <hi>Oye,</hi> which lay
level with the Walls, he had the good hap to ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Ladders, and threw them all down; the
report of which being heard by the <hi>French</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without the Gate, they joyfully cry'd out,
<hi>March up, march up, the City is our own,</hi> thinking
the Petard had broken open the Gate with ſo
great a noiſe, and the Drums without further no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
began to beat, which ſet them all on running
to the New Gate to divide the Spoil, but were
much amazed to find it ſtill ſhut, ſo that going
into the Ditch near the Scaling Ladders, the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
having fired his Cannon a ſecond time char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with Small Shot, made a dreadful ſlaughter
among them. At the ſame time a party of coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Citizens, reſolving to Sacrifice their Lives
in defence of their Country, and recover the New
Gate, fell bravely upon the Enemies Guards, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
two of them, with <hi>Picot</hi> the Engineer, as
he was managing the Petard, and being aſſiſted
by others, they drove them from the Gate, and
made them retreat to their Fellows.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Savoyards</hi> aſtoniſhed to find themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
between the Walls and the Houſes, and not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:33398:88"/>
knowing how to eſcape, began to loſe their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
they offered to let <hi>Bruneleiu</hi> down from the
Wall with a Rope, but he choſe rather to dye than
to live with ſhame: The Shot flew about their
Ears like Hail from the Windows and tops of the
Houſes. One of the City Captains, half dreſs'd,
Signalized himſelf eminently. A Taylor with a
two handed Sword did Wonders. A Woman
throwing out on purpoſe an Iron Pot on the head
of the forwardeſt, broke his Skull. The courage
of the Citizens increaſing, and the <hi>Savoyards</hi> ſeeing
fifty of their Men lying on the ground, they fled
to the place where the Ladders ſtood, but finding
none, threw themſelves down the Wall, and one of
them falling upon Father <hi>Alexander,</hi> almoſt killed
this falſe Prophet. The Chevalier <hi>Dandelot</hi> ſliding
down broke his Noſe. Fifty four were killed, moſt
Officers and men of Quality, and thirteen taken
priſoners. The Cannon was brought on the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of <hi>Treille,</hi> and levelled againſt <hi>Plein Palais,</hi>
which inſtantly put the Horſe and Foot that lay
there to the Rout.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albigny</hi> amazed at the unſuccesfulneſs of the
undertaking, ſo well contrived and ſo ill perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and finding the Shopkeepers, (as he called them
in Scorn) had courage to defend themſelves, he
ſounded a Retreat, which was very welcome to
his diſperſed Troops, who were benummed with
fear and cold. They marched away in haſte, and
brought the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the News of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
ſucceſs which the Lord of <hi>Albigny</hi>'s
raſhneſs had produced. The Duke ſaid little, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſed his common expreſſion to him, <hi>You have
made a very fair flouriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day the thirteen priſoners were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33398:89"/>
to be hanged, the Magiſtrates alledging
for their ſeverity, <hi>That they did not conſider them
as Generous Enemies, but as Thieves that broke in in
the Night, and who had violated contrary to all Right, a
Peace ſo ſolemnly Sworn to.</hi> It is ſaid that <hi>Sonas</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to redeem his Life with his weight in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but yet was hanged, together with <hi>Chaffar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Attignac,</hi> and other perſons of Quality, being
accompanied by the Miniſters to the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
The Council of Sixty ordered that their
Heads, with thoſe that were killed between the
Walls, ſhould be cut off and ranged on the Wall
of the Bulwark, near the place where they Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and their Bodies to be thrown into the River.
They were found to be ſixty ſeven in all, and ſo
many years had the City thrown off the Romiſh
Yoak; but with thoſe in the Ditch, and that died
by the way, they were two hundred in the whole.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> ſide, only thirty were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſeventeen killed, who were Buried in the
chief Church, with an honourable Epitaph. It is
ſaid that the famous <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> who was then
alive in the City, and heard not the leaſt noiſe of
all this uproar and diſturbance, and was amazed
when he was led forth to ſee the ſlain who lay in
the Streets, though he had left off preaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very Ancient, yet he got up into the Pulpit,
and cauſed the 124 Pſalm to be Sung, <hi>Now may
Iſrael ſay, If the Lord had not been on our ſide when
men roſe up againſt us,</hi> &amp;c. Which Pſalm hath
been ever ſince Sung on that day, which is kept
as a publick Thankſgiving every year, and a
Latine Inſcription of the whole matter erected
in the Town-Houſe, for a perpetual remembrance
of this great Deliverance from Popery and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33398:89"/>
for the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> declaring, <hi>That the
principal Motive to this attempt was the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Catholick Religion among them, and for the
promoting ſo good a Work, he neither valued his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
his Treaſure, nor his Perſon.</hi> To which the
<hi>Genevoiſes</hi> replied, <hi>That he did not demonſtrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Zealous for Religion, when it appeared ſo plainly
how little he valued his Oath, and that doubtleſs God
would not ſuffer him to eſcape unpuniſhed, who had

            <p>OF all the Warlike Inventions that have ever been
contrived, Antiquity can produce none more
dreadful than what were uſed by the people of the
<hi>Netherlands</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and particularly
at the Siege of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which having been Beſieged
ſome time without Succeſs, by <hi>Alexander Farneſe</hi> Prince
of <hi>Parma,</hi> he at length reſolved to lay a Bridge over the
River <hi>Scheld,</hi> that runs by the ſide of this City; it was
2400 foot broad, and above 60 foot deep when the
Tyde is out: Yet the Prince, by indefatigable labour,
and driving Piles into the bottom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at length performed
this wonderful Enterprize, only in the midſt where
the ſtream was rapid and very deep, he was forced to
make a floating Bridge of Boats which joined the
whole together. He likewiſe built Forts or Caſtles at
each end, and Planked the Bridge on each ſide 5 foot
high, to ſecure it from the Enemies Cannon, and from
thence much annoyed the Town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Antwerpians</hi> finding how prejudicial this would
be to them, and that it might indanger the loſs of the
City, they conſulted many ways how to deſtroy it, but
none took effect. At length they met with one <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
Jambel</hi> an excellent Engineer, who coming out of
<hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> deſired to have acceſs to the King, to

               </gap>r him his ſervice in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> but being
ſlighted and neglected, he left the Court in a Rage,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33398:90"/>
threatning, <hi>That in a ſhort time the K. of</hi> Spain <hi>ſhould hear
of the Name of this deſpiſed perſon not without tears;</hi> and
coming to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> he had now a fit opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the malice and fury of his mind. He was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by the Beſieged, and aſſured them that he
would ruin this dangerous Bridge; to which purpoſe
he built four Ships, with flat bottoms and high ſides,
much thicker and ſtronger than ordinary.</p>
            <p>And thus he contrived to make Mines in the Waters: Firſt, In
the Keel of the Ship he made a ſtrong Brick Wall like a Floor, or
Ground-work, a foot high and 5 broad, through the whole length
of the Ship, then he built Walls on each ſide about the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
3 foot high and as many broad, and having filled the vacancy
with Gun-powder tempered with exquiſite Art, unknown to any
but himſelf, he covered it over with Grave-ſtones, Mill-ſtones, and
other huge Stones: Upon this covering he made another Story,
Vault-wiſe, of Mill-ſtones, and other vaſt Stones, which leaning on
each other, made a ridge like that of an Houſe, that ſo the ſlaughter
might not be only ſtrait forward, but on either ſide. In this upper
Vault he put Iron and Marble Balls, Chains, Blocks, Nails, Knives,
and whatever elſe his miſchievous Wit could ſuggeſt to him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
Mankind. Laſtly, All the ſpace that lay open between the
ſides of the Ship, and the Wall and Roof of the Mine, he filled up
with Stones cloſe joined together, and bound down with Beams
faſtned with Iron: He covered and ſecured all theſe things with
ſtrong Planks and a brick Floor, in the middle whereof he ſet fire
to a pile of Wood, that the Ships might ſeem to be ſet out in that
order to burn the Bridge, putting under the Wood Pitch and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
that could not be extinguiſhed before the Mine ſhould be fired
with the prepared Timber: He framed two ways to fire the Mine,
in ſome of the Ships he placed Matches beſmeared with Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which being laid through the Keel reached to the Mine, of that
length as he had experimented, they would continue light till the
Ships ſhould come to the Bridge. In other Ships he uſed Clocks to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
with a gentle motion, till they arrived at the Bridge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then
with a violent meeting of the Wheels againſt a Flint, ſhould ſtrike
ſome Sparks into the bruiſed Gun-powder there ſcattered, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
the Train, and thence convey the fire into the mouth of the
Mine. <hi>Jambel</hi> having finiſhed theſe four dreadful Engines, added
13 Jeſs, which had nothing hurtful but the Hatches covered with
huge Fires. Theſe preparations were obſerved by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
though ignorant of the Stratagem, imagining they were providing
a Fleet ready in the City to attack the Bridge on one ſide, while
the <hi>Zealand</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Squadrons did the like on the other;
therefore the Prince kept ſtrict Guard to prevent miſchief, which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33398:90"/>
was nearer to him than he imagined, when behold from the City
there appeared three Ships firſt, and after them ſeveral others,
brightly ſhining with Fire in the darkneſs of the Night, at which
the Camp was alarm'd, and cryed, <hi>Arm, Arm,</hi> and the Bridge
was filled with Souldiers. The Ships came down the River in good
order, two and three together, as if intended only for ſhew, having
the Mariners aboard them, and the flames were ſo clear, that they
ſeemed not to carry Fire but to be burning themſelves, and that
fire could Sail and be preſerved in the Waters; the whole made a
glorious ſhew, if the Hearts of the Spectators had not been filled
with terror, for the banks of the River, and the Caſtles placed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhone with continual Fires, which with the Armed Troops
along the ſhore, and on the Bridge, in bright Armor, with their
Swords drawn, and Colours diſplayed, with the Gallautry of their
Commanders, made a very agreeable ſight, and was heightned by
thoſe Fiery Ships in the midſt of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> which hitherto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hurt ſpit their flames as if in Sport.</p>
            <p>When theſe Ships were within two miles of the Bridge, the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
turned thoſe four that had the Mines with their Helms di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
down the midſt of the Channel againſt the Bridge, not valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſmall Veſſels, and ſetting fire to the Match, preſently leapt
into the Boats to obſerve the ſucceſs at a diſtance, but wanting their
Pilots they did not keep one courſe, moſt of the ſmall ones daſhed
themſelves againſt the Machines fenced with ſharp Pikes, or run
aground on the Banks, and of the four that carried Deſtruction in
their Bowels, one Leaking was ſwallowed up in the midſt of the
River, vomiting out only Smoak and Thunder; two others by the
force of the Wind were driven aſhore on <hi>Flanders</hi> ſide, and the laſt
had almoſt run the ſame fate, being violently driven near the
ſhore, which, with the ſight of the loſs of the reſt, made the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard's</hi>
Triumph and Scoff at the folly of their Enemies, but this
laſt Ship being ſtronger than the others, broke through all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
deſtroying all the Engines and Contrivances made to hinder
its progreſs and came on furiouſly againſt the Bridge At this ſight
the Souldiers ſhouted with terror and fear. The Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>
when he heard thoſe ſhouts came thither, and endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the danger from this Fireſhip by commanding ſome Mariners
aboard it, to diſperſe the Wood and quench the Fire, and others to
keep it off with large Poles and Pikes. He himſelf ſtood in the
wooden Caſtle on the Bridge, and with him ſeveral of the chief
Commanders, and the Guard of the place, and amongſt them a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Enſign, who either had ſome knowledge of ſuch Engines or knew
that <hi>Jambel</hi> was excellent in this Art, who came to the Prince and
earneſtly deſired him, <hi>That ſince he had now done all that was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
he would pleaſe to withdraw himſelf, and not venture his Life,
whereon every Souldiers Life, yea, the War it ſelf depended, in ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a place,</hi> but being rejected he ſtill inſiſted, and throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33398:91"/>
on his Knees before the Prince, ſaid, <hi>I moſt humbly beſeech and
intreat you, moſt illuſtrious Prince, as you value your Life, which I now
ſee expoſed to the utmoſt hazard, that you would pleaſe but this once
to take Advice from your Servant;</hi> and ſaying this, he modeſtly
plucked him by the Garment, and with a kind of commanding Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
intreated him to follow him, who Interpreting this unuſual
freedom of the Man to proceed from an higher Power, at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and with ſome others went away.</p>
            <p>The Prince had hardly entred St. <hi>Maries</hi> Fort, when the limited
Hour for the Match to fire the Mine was come, and all on a ſudden
this fatal Ship burſt aſunder, with ſuch a horrid noiſe as if the very
Skies, had rent aſunder, and Heaven and Earth had come together,
or the whole Body of the World had trembled, for the Storm of
Stones, Chains, and Bullets, being thrown out with Thunder and
Lightning, there followed ſuch a ſlaughter as cannot be imagined.
The Caſtle on which this Infernal Ship fell, the Bridge next to it,
with the Souldiers, Mariners, Commanders, and a great number of
Cannon, Armor and Arms, all theſe this furious Whirlwind ſwept
away together, toſſed in the Air, and diſperſed as the Wind doth
Leaves of Trees; the River <hi>Scheld</hi> prodigiouſly gaping was then firſt
ſeen to diſcover its bottom, and then ſwelling above the Banks,
over-flowed the adjacent Shores, the motion of the Earth was felt
nine miles off, and great Grave-ſtones were thrown a mile from the
River ſunk two foot into the ground: But the deſtruction of men
was very deplorable, ſome the Helliſh violence of the fires conſumed,
or carried into the Air, whence they fell bruiſed on the Earth, or into
the River, others were ſtifled with the poyſonous Smoak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others
