         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WEre not my text Scripture, I should apologize for
assuming such a sad subject, the sound of which
words must needes turne that strong current of
griefe upon your eares, which hath allreadie for
divérse weekes stream'd forth abundantlie from
your eyes. And though it be, were not this a weeke where in we're
every day obligd, as well by Christian dutie as command of the
Church, preaching or praying, mournfullie to commemorate the
sufferings of our Saviour, and, like loyal subjects; make some
sparkes of our old allegeance rise out of those ashes which we cast
on our heads upon the forowfull remembrance of so unjust a
judgement pronuunc'd and executed upon so just a King; I should
mine owne selfe checke my imprudence, and prevent your censure
of my importunitie in this choyce. But the whole Gospell for the
day (which I presume you observed) was no other then St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew's
long narrative of the Jewes malicious proceedings against
Christ, &amp; my text but a part of the same in St. John, with Pilates
expresse declaring him to be their King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57920:4"/>
Indeed the name of this day, which is Palme Sunday, speakes
songs &amp; prayses,<note place="margin">Tract. 49. in Ioann.</note> victories and trophies, <hi>Rami palmarum laudes sunt,
significantes victoriam,</hi> sayth St. Austin: But the service of the day
speakes sorowes and sufferings, betraying and murdering, Holie
Church not thinking worth her practical record their slight Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sannas,
their high way blessings upon the Sonne of David, who
within few dayes after could silentlie heare those <hi>Anathema ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha's,</hi>
those judicial blasphemies against the Sonne of God. Not
deigning to preserve, for sacred reliques, those cast rags, the
garments I meane the multitude this day spread in his way to the
Citie,<note place="margin">S. Matth. 21.</note> whose persons and lives ought in conscience &amp; dutie t' have
obstructed his Fridays passage to the crosse. The next Sunday, the
solemnitie for the Resurrection of Christ, it will be <hi>mors in victoria,
death swallow'd in victorie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 54.</note> but this day, the first of <hi>Hebdomada Magna,</hi>
the great weeke, appointed for us to meditate on his passion, it is
<hi>victoria in morte,</hi> the palme turn'd into cypresse, victorie drown'd in
a deluge of bloud, overwhelmed with the crueltie of death.</p>
            <p>It should seeme Pilate, whether upon some touch he had in his
conscience, with a partial illumination of Gods spirit; or upon the
circumstantial accomplishment of many know'n predictions of
the Prophets, or upon the grandure of our Saviours speach, &amp; more
then humane Majestie in his countenance; he collected that, which
St. Chrysostom calls <hi>megálen sypónoian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hom. in 18. &amp; 19.</note> a great suspicion of some
what more then ordinarie in his person;<note place="margin">Ioan. S. Matth. 27. 19.</note> Or whether scared by his
wifes dreame, and disswaded from the businesse by her counsel;
Or whether the principles of moral honestie prevailed with him to
resolve against the condemnation of innocencie, and instrumental
completing the malice of the Jewes; 'tis notoriouslie evident what
shifts he used, what pretenses he fram'd, either to retract them
from their madnesse, or withdrawe himselfe from any interest in
the murder.</p>
            <p>The first instance here of may be his transmitting the processe
from his owne Court to the Sanhedrim of the Jewes. <hi>Take ye him,
and judge him according to your Law. St. Iohn 18. 31. Quae non sunt verbae
concedentis,</hi>

               <hi>sed horrentis crimen,</hi> sayth Cajetan, which are not words of
concession, but detestation of the fact, <hi>aphosimenou</hi> sayth St. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom.
But this they put off with a <hi>non licet, It is not lawfull for us to put
any man to death,</hi> either because the Romans had forbid them the legal
cognizance of all capital causes, which Maldonat sayth is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the most: or as some lay to their charge, though they might
stone, or strangle, or burne, crucifie they could not, and none but
that would satiate their malice, because the most ignominious way
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57920:4"/>
of execution, and as good not all, as not wholelie to their purpose,
as they expresse it indefinitelie, with out any limitation. <hi>'Tis not
lawfull for us to put any man to death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Iohn 18. 39.</note> A second instance of Pilates aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
may be the advantage he toke of a custome they had to free a
malefactour at this time, and so none fitter then he, who, were his
person as bad as their malicious charges would make him, must be
least guiltie by his office or dignitie, in all reason and justice most
capable of their favour which made him use (at least in our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
storie) the Royal title in his quaestion, and say, <hi>Shall I release
unto you</hi> not Christ, or him who, you say, makes himselfe to be the
Sonne of God, but your Soveraigne? <hi>Iudaeorum Regem, tht King of the
Iewes, vers. the 39. of that chapter.</hi> And here their <hi>non licet</hi> could not
passe for an answer, for all though is was not indeed lawfull for them
to put at least this man to death; it was not onelie law, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and dutie, and allegeance, to save his life and restore him
to his libertie. But here comes in their clamour and crie, for feare
the Judge should be deafe at such a senselesse demand,<note place="margin">Vers. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Non hunc sed
Barabbam, they all cried, Not this man, but Barabbas.</hi> Theeves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
villaines and murderers, sett whom they will at libertie but
the King, <hi>Non hunc sed Barabbam, we will not save him but Barabbas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third and last experiment we have of Pilate, may be draw'n
out of the words of my text. <hi>Behold your King,</hi> this he thought might
move their compassion. <hi>Shall I crucifie your King?</hi> this he hop'd would
confound them with shame. But they have impatience where with
to turne off their pitie, they'll take no thought to what passe they
brought him. <hi>Away with him, away with him,</hi> and a false colour they
have readie at hand to cover their shame <hi>Habemus Caesarem, they</hi> good
men <hi>have Caesar for their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>My text divides it selfe into foure parts.</head>
               <p>I. First here's Pilate, a heathen Judges ingenuous profession
of Christs Regalitie, his Kinglie dominion over the people of the
Jewes, <hi>Ecce Rexvester, behold your King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Secondlie, Their impatient aversion from acknowledging
such his supremacie of power. <hi>Away with him, away with him, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Thirdlie Pilates profession resum'd, and fram'd into a
strong argument for the freedome and indemnitie of Christ. <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figam
Regem! Shall I crucifie your King?</hi> which quaestion, the knowe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57920:5"/>
implies a negation, and the enthymem's this. <hi>He is your King, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
non crucifigam, I must not crucifie him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Fourthlie, and lastlie. The chiefe Priests cunning eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and apologie for the Jewes rejection of Christ. Mistake not
us, nor the good people we countenance, whose thoughts are not
set upon murdering their King, <hi>Habemus Caesarem, We have Caesar,</hi>
who may be well assured of all fidelitie and loyaltie from us, we
must heare of no other, <hi>alium non habemus, we have no King but Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These be the parts. Before we enter upon the handling of which,
Let us pray for Christs Holie Catholique Church, &amp;c.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>And he sayth unto the Iewes,
Behold your King.</head>
               <p>THis <hi>He</hi> in my text is that Pilate you meet with every day in
your Creed, infamous there for the worst of his acts, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of Christ, recorded here for the best of his words,
his publike profession to the Jewes that he was their King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christi nomen &amp; regnum ubique porrigitur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Advers. Iud.</note> sayth Tertullian. As the
name, so the regalitie of Christ is held forth every where to the
world. In the Prophets predictions, such as that of <hi>Micah the 5. of

their crueltie by pointing at their Soveraigne. <hi>Ecce Rex, Behold your

Judgement Hall, so dissembled his inclination to beleeve, that
Origen puts to peradventure his quaestion, <hi>Art thou the King of the

upon our Saviours replie, <hi>Sayst thou this of thy selfe, or did others tell it
thee,</hi> so loth he seemd to be taken for a Christian, that he would not
owne <hi>the</hi> remote alliance of a Jew. But when he saw the malice of
the Priestes delude his cunning and assaile his conscience; when
the importunitie of the peoples clamours was likelie as well to
violate his fayth, as ravish his justice, then he doubted about nothing
but his honour, a Christian he was, <hi>pre conscientia Christianus Tertullian</hi>
calls him, but he would with all continue Praesident in Jurie,<note place="margin">Apol. c. 21. P. Gagn. Ambian.</note> God

               <p>But this <hi>Ecce</hi> here seemes not onelie to hold forth Pilates fayth,
but to guide the Jewes to a sad object, worth their commiseration
and pitie. <hi>At the 5. verse of this chapter,</hi> when, to avoyd greater
mischiefe, Pilate had taken Jesus, and scourg'd him; When with
platted thornes, and purple robe the souldiers had crowned Jesus,
and arrayd him; When with their <hi>Ave Rex, Haile ô King,</hi> they had

is <hi>bruised for your iniquities;</hi> Whether upon him be not <hi>the chastisement of
your peace,</hi> &amp; whether <hi>by these stripes ye may</hi> not <hi>be healed</hi> But when he
saw those sharpe thornes that pierc'd his head could not pricke
them at the heart; When he saw those stripes, which had ploughed
up and made long furrowes in his backe, could by no meanes breake
the drie barren ground in their breasts; When no argument draw'n
from such a spectacle of humane miserie could move them; He
becomes, as he thinkes; imperious in his Rhetoricke, hopes the
name of Majestie will awe them; that they, who would take no pitie
on him as man, will recollect themselves and reverence him as their
Soveraigne, <hi>Ecce Rex, Behold your King.</hi> But they, who once have
burst the chaines of humane Societie, will breake the bonds of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie
asunder, and cast away their cords from them; They,
who have forgoten to be men, to be mercifull one to another in

all to any one in dutie.</p>
               <p>When Seneca had defined crueltie to be a certaine fiercenesse of
the mind in exacting of punishment,<note place="margin">De Clem. l. 2. c. 4.</note> he discovered a generation of
bloudie men that could not be compriz'd in this definition, such as,
no fault nor injurie preceding, can be sayd neither to punish nor
revenge, but <hi>qui occidendi causa occidunt,</hi> kill merelie because they will
kill, <hi>nec interficere contenti saeviunt,</hi> nor are they content to kill onelie,
but torment too, and rage in the maner of their murder. And he
knowes not what to style these mens distemper but a brutish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagenesse,
a raving madnesse, both implying their incapacitie of
doing, or hearing any thing that is reason, so that <hi>Ecce homo</hi> and <hi>Ecce
Rex</hi> to tell them of man or King, to use any rational argument to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
them, is to take a lambe from a lions mouth, to divert an
evening wolfe from her prey, it heightens their rage, it inflames
their furie, impatient they are of hearing any thing that tends to
that purpose, nothing then but <hi>Tolle, Crucifige, Away with him; Away
with him, crucifie him.</hi> And this leades me to my second part, the Jewes
aversion from acknowledging Christ's supremacie of power, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
first by the violence of their passion, <hi>Clamabant, They cried.</hi>
Secondlie by their vehement iterated expression, <hi>Tolle, Tolle, Away
with him, Away with him.</hi> Thirdlie by the crueltie of their tumultuarie
condemnation, <hi>Crucifige, Crucifie him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aut ignorantia nos rerum aut insolentia iracundos facit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Senec. De Ira. l. 2. c 31.</note> sayd the Stoike.
'Tis either ignorance or insolence (which in his sense is somewhat
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57920:6"/>
hapening beyond expectation, or out of course) that is the cause of
our anger and furie. Either of which, though it can not fullie excuse
the excesse of our passion, may abate somewhat the delinquencie of
such acts as very naturallie issue from the extremitie of the same.
To pleade either in behalfe of the Jewes were to denie that their
fathers had a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night to conduct
them. <hi>Habent Mosen &amp; Prophetas; They have Moses and the Prophets, and they
shewed before of the coming of the just one,</hi> St. Steven tells them <hi>Act.</hi> 7. I shall
not stand to reproach them with those glorious beames of the sun of
righteousnesse, which will they, nill they,<note place="margin">St. Matt. 2. St. Luke 2. 49. 10. Baron. Apparat.</note> stroke themselves into
the eyes of the Jewes, to which the Wisemens starre in the East was
but a sparkle, &amp; the light that encircled the shepheards but a shadow.
The know'n accomplishment of the promise in Genesis, <hi>That when
the Scepter departed from Iudah should Shilo come,</hi> evidenc'd First in Herod
the Idumaean, who was no native, but a proselyte to the Jewes, who
transmitted the Scepter to his sonne Archilaus, and he to Antipas
who had a foreigner for his mother, giving them, that minded it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of the thing, might very well put them upon search after
the person, and if our Saviours promise were valide in the 7. <hi>of St.
Matthew, Seeke and ye shall finde,</hi> (which Tertullian sayth,<note place="margin">De Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. advers. haeret. c. 8. 24. 1 3.</note> with the
rest of that nature, was in this case directlie intended to the Jewes)
that search would have ended no otherwhere then in the cleare
discoverie of Christ. But they were <hi>Rebelles lumini,</hi> as <hi>Iob speakes, Rebells
against the light</hi> in a proper sense, for when this <hi>light,</hi> that was the
Sunne of righteousnesse, the King of the Jewes,<note place="margin">5. Iohn. 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>was come into the world,
they loved darkenesse rather then light.</hi> This darkenesse some of them
loved in Herod,<note place="margin">Tert. De Praeser. c. 15.</note> whom they would needes in flaterie make that
Anoynted of God, &amp; instead of Christians were called Herodians.
This darkenesse others of them loved in the Serpent whom they
commemorate as the founder of knowledge of good &amp; evill,<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 47.</note> whose
power and Majestie they say was lifted up in the brasen image by
Moses in the wildernesse, and in the sonne of man by that paterne,
as himselfe professeth in <hi>the 3. of St. Iohn,</hi> the likenesse whereof Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian
sayth, they us'd in their sacrilegious mysteries, preferring
the Devill himselfe before Christ, and from thence were called
Ophitae. Thus like sillie children, they chang'd <hi>the bread that came
downe from heaven for a stone, and the fish that their father gave them for a
Serpent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. Paul indeed in the 3. <hi>of the Acts notes that they and their rulers did
out of ignorance crucifie Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">St. Luke 23. 34.</note> And Christ on his crosse pray'd, <hi>Father
forgive them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> But it may be sayd, That
St. Pauls charitie might possiblie get the uper hand of his fayth, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57920:7"/>
yet our Saviours words were unquaestionable truth, relating to
their fatal imprecation,<note place="margin">S. Matth. 27. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Let his bioud be upon us and our children,</hi> made
when they litle thought how long that purple veine would be run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
how many generations of their children they plung'd into this
river of bloud. Their knowledge of this might else have amus'd
and startled them in the act. And in this sense perchance our Saviour
might speake it, <hi>Ignorant, They know not what they doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let their knowledge be what it will, I am sure it could not
be greater then their malice, which brake out into this extremitie,
of passion, that the Evangelist sayth not, <hi>'élegon</hi> they spake, but
<hi>'ecráugesan, they cried.</hi>
               </p>

shot that bloud to the heart which shame had flushed up in the face,
and shew'd her selfe in the image of death. Thus when joy had
painted out to the life the verdant spring in the countenance of

               <p>If you observe the historie of their actions, who are crying in my

               <p>But there remaines yet a third aggravation of their furie in my

are not satisfied with the nullitie of his power, the imprisonment
of his person, they must quench the thirst of their malice in his
bloud, not onelie <hi>Tolle,</hi> but <hi>Crucifige, Away with him, crucifie him.</hi>

                  <hi>Death and life are in the power of the tongue,</hi> sayth the Wiseman, <hi>Prov.</hi>
18. 21. Which power never playes the tyrant more, then when it

                  <hi>firebrands, arrowes, and death.</hi> St. Austin makes the mouthes of
the Jewes fiercer executioners then their hands, and their tongues
sharper instruments then the nailes that fastened our Saviours
bodie to the crosse. <hi>Vnde occidistis? gladio linguae. Et quando percussistis
nisi quando clamâtis crucifige?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, the two principles of popular furie are, for the most part,
ignorance and malice. By the one they are not able to judge of the
<hi>species,</hi> or kinde, much lesse the degree of that which they take to
be a crime, and, being jealous that what may be bad, is the worst,
they proportion revenge by their illimited sensitive appetite, never
weigh it in the ballance of reason. By the other they become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
inventours, and as curious about the circumstance or forme,
as violent about the substantial part or matter of their mischiefe.
Such is this jurie of raging Jewes in my text, who doe not onelie
outrun judgement in their hast, <hi>Away with him, away with him,</hi> nor
in their rage throw mercie out of the Court, by crying kill him,
or, put him to death but specificate execution at their pleasure, and
exercise the tyrannie thereof,<note place="margin">Paul. Apul.</note> as wel in the shame, as the torment, by
crying out for the worst of the kinde, <hi>Crucifige, crucifie him, 'apenéstaton

they toke by this unfortunate occasion, to quit Barabbas
of his double due, as he was a theefe and a murderer, and cast the

you to fixe them upon a serious object in my third generall, and
behold Pilate with amazement and horrour metamorpho'zd for a
time into a statue, till at length bloud melting in his veines, and just
wrath burning at his heart he speaketh with his mouth, yet hath
not patience to be explicite in a syllogisme, he presseth, I told you,
his argument in an enthymeme. <hi>He is your King, therefore, non crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gam,
I must not crucifie him,</hi> Nay he yet contracts that into a quaestion,
and when neither, humane miserie could move them to pitie nor

of their dutie he thinkes to shake their obstinacie in pieces, and strike

St. Cyrill of Alexandria sayth. That his first words. <hi>Ecce Rex, Behold
your King,</hi> might be spoken in compliance with the Jewes, whose
charge lay chieflie against him for accepting that title from the
multitude at his entrance this day into the cittie, and so, Behold I
deliver him up unto your pleasure whom some idle people among
you publikelie crie up for the King of the Jewes. And upon that
ground Euthymius makes an ironie of his quaestion, wherein, he
sayth, Pilate rather mockes at Christ, then reproacheth the Jewes:
<hi>What? shall I crucifie your King?</hi> The learned Grotius takes the clause
with the <hi>Ecce</hi> to be in reproach, but of what? not their malice, but
their follie. Which may seeme to be in favour of Theophylact,
who makes a longer speach for Pilate then in my text, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
allmost. <hi>You that charge this man to have taken upon him the authoritie

Throughout the whole historie of the Gospell you may easilie see

have authoritie to countenance, and subtile sophistrie to colour

that the Priests had here in the demagogie of the Jewes came from
the legal eminencie of their place, they sitting upon the highest
bench of their Magistracie, and the chiefe of them being adaequate
in power to their principal Judge or Justiciarie by his office. <hi>Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos

                  <hi>Desino, &amp; hoc infigo.</hi> Thus have I done with Pilate, the Jewes, and
the chiefe Priestes in the leter,<note place="margin">Epinan.</note> as they beare a part in the Historie
of the Gospell. Yet some others there are very nearlie concerned, if
not in the doctrine, I am sure in the use and due application of my
text <hi>deuteroi Iudâioi,</hi> such as deserve the name of second Jewes beter
then the Paulian heretikes that had it. And there is <hi>déuteros xritès,</hi> a
second Judge, I shall not doe him the honour to say a second Pilate,
he acted very litle of his part, not any that I know but passing <hi>an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57920:12"/>
uglie sentence</hi> upon his King. And there are <hi>déuteroi hiereis,</hi> second
Priestes, and those chiefe ones too, even they of the Assemblie and
Sanhedrin it selfe, who, as silent &amp; uninteressed as they seem'd when
that traytourous charge was brought into the Court, have, for above
7. yeares together, made the pulpits ring, and the presse groane
with the strength of their crie, and weight of their bookes, (I say
not of their arguments) to give notice to the world, that with out
covenanting (you know who sayd it) <hi>against reason,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">K. Ch. 1. Eix. Basil.</note> 
                  <hi>conscience, houour,
oath;</hi> reforming the reformation it selfe against Scripture and
Apostolicke institution, so many hundred yeares precedential prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
and undeniable Catholike profession, <hi>Non habebimus hunc,</hi> We
will not have CHARLES for our King. And there is <hi>déuterot Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos,</hi>
a second Christ, an anoynted of God, that came as neare as
ever King did to our Saviour in his life, and I dare say never any so
neare in the similitude of his death. And there is <hi>déuteros Ioúdas,</hi> a
second Judas, not as the first onelie with a band of men, and a few
pike-stav'd officers at his heeles; but not many yeares since in the
head of a cursed numerous armie, and cursed be the memorie of
that man unlesse bless'd with repentance before his death, that so
perfidiouslie sold and betray'd him. And here you have set in your
viewe persons enough for a second tragoedie. <hi>Quinto productior actu,</hi>
one that would admit of a sixt act, surpassing severall circumstances
of the other, if your griefe would give the patience to heare it or
had I just abilities to compose it. Instead whereof I shall crave your
favour to repeate my text with some short allusive paraphrase upon
the words. <hi>And he sayth unto the Iewes, Behold your King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which <hi>He</hi> in the moral is our mocke-Judge, but no rightfull
successour of that relenting Pilate in my text, because he went not
about to stop the peoples crie, by moving their pitie, reproaching
their insolence, saying, <hi>Ecce Rex, Behold your King,</hi> He expos'd him
to their crueltie and scorne, reviv'd their calling for <hi>Iustice, Iustice,</hi>
saying, like a miscreant as he was, <hi>Ecce carcer, Behold there the prisonor at
your barre.</hi> Never any President in the world tooke more paines then
Pilate did to deliver guiltlesse innocencie from death; Nor any
more then our unjust Judge imploy'd industrious malice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it. To that purpose, as in the 6. <hi>of Amos, Turning judgement into
gall, and the fruit of rihhteousnesse into hemlocke,</hi> that he might be sure to
give Majestie its bane. Lactantius and St. Chrysostom are of opinion
that Pilate did not positivelie passe sentence upon Christ, but gave
onelie permission to the Jewes to execute, as before he had to judge,
when he sayd. <hi>Take ye him, and judge him, according to your law.</hi> But ours
I beleeve durst not trust the people with the libertie of that power, I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57920:13"/>
rather thinke if his hand had been as strong as his heart cruel, he
would have sav'd the State the charges of a vizard, by becoming
the barefac'd executioner himselfe. Pilate much affected to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with our Saviour, propounds quaestions, is attentive to
answers, seemes very solicitous about his Kingdome and truth,
<hi>And thou a King then? and what is truth?</hi> both <hi>in the 18. Chapter of St. Iohn:</hi>
but our furious Rhadamanth breathes out nothing but brimstone
and fire, he takes the spunge himselfe and dips it in the sharpnesse of
his speach, stops the mouth of condemn'd Soveraigntie, indulgeth
not the libertie of a word. <hi>Will you heare me a word</hi> SIR? a strange
request to be made by a King to a rebell, a stranger to be denied by a
subject to his Soveraigne. We'll take Seneca's divination for the
reason,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. De Ira. c. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Timuit ne quam liberiorem vocem extremus dolor mitteret, ne quid quod
nollet audiret,</hi> afrayd he was he should heare what he litle desired, lest
the last breath of a dying man, an innocent King design'd for
murder, should cast a cloud of horrour on his soul.</p>
               <p>But to keep neare to the words of my text. Wherein our Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
faild of the parallel with Pilate, I beleeve the conscience of
every Jew did supplie. I beleeve it call'd upon him often enough,
saying, <hi>Ecce Rex, Behold my King.</hi> Behold that King who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with my wilfull and unreasonable demands, <hi>'exénosen heautòn,</hi>
as 'twas sayd of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Philip. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>hath evacuated himselfe,</hi> and is become
allmost aequal to his subjects; hath suffer'd a diminution of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
is devested of much of his just legal dignitie and power,
Customes, Courts, Monopolies, Taxes, Militia, Bishops, all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
grievances, I could make are either taken away, or limited
to my purpose. But then conscience layes the other <hi>Ecce</hi> at his
doores. <hi>Ecce Homo, Behold the man.</hi> Behold I am that man that set my
hand to that rebellious remonstrance, and my heart to have it
throw'n into his coach. I that man who by seditious tumults af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
him and his from their palace; I that persecuted him in
my purse or my person, and hunted him like a partridge in the
wildernesse. I that at such or such a battel levell'd many a piece at
his quarter sent many a curse to his Royal Person with the shot; I
that bid faire to corrupt his governer and lay him in his garrison;
I that, when the bargaine would not hold, inveigled him out in a
strange disguise by many specious promises to protect him. I that
when I had him in my hands Judas like kiss'd him and betray'd him
into his prison. And then, as in the 34. <hi>of Iob, There is no darknesse nor
shadow of death where these workers of iniquitie may hide themselves.</hi> Their
owne guilt is a perpetual thunderclap in their eares, and a fixed
flash of lightning in their faces. No promise of mercie can cleare
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57920:13"/>
their jealousie, No act of oblivion setle their feare; Despaire turnes
<hi>Regnare nolumus</hi> to <hi>Nolumus vivere,</hi> They that cried before, <hi>We will
not have this man to reigne,</hi> crie ten times lowder, <hi>We will not, We dare
not suffer this man to live.</hi> And what then remaines, but <hi>Tolle crucifige,
Away with him, Away with him, crucifie him. And Pilate sayth unto them,
Shall I crucifie your King?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I must againe tell the, our Judge is nothing like that
Pilate in my text, because he did not put it to the quaestion, saying,
<hi>Shall I crucifie?</hi> but, when he entred first into the Judgement Hall
gave good assurance to his clamorous Jewes, saying in effect, <hi>Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gam,
I will crucifie your King.</hi> You therefore that have got the best estates
by plunder and pillage, the highest places by supplanting, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questring,
the greatest names by rebelling and murdering. You
that have stucke malice at the point of your sword, and wreakt it in
the bowells, of your brother; You that have broke the barres of
Religion, run away with the reignes of government and law; You
that have <hi>draw'n all kind of iniquitie with cords, and all sinne as it were with a
cart-rope.</hi> You that, as it followes in the 5. <hi>of Esai,</hi> say, <hi>Let him make
speed and hasten his worke, that we may see it;</hi> Feare nothing, Have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
a while, I will but gull ignorance with a forme, take the
stoole of wikednesse, wherein to doe justice, imagine mischiefe
for law, and then your wish you shall have, for <hi>Crucifigam Regem, I will
crucifie your King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remaines in the words of my text. <hi>And the chiefe Priestes answered,
We have no King but Caesar</hi> But our Pilate, as I told you, not putting
it to the quaestion, Our Priestes have sav'd the labour of this answer,
which is not withstanding in part taken up by their forward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
who render this account of their 7. yeares instruction by
the new light, to have Monarchie crucified as well their King,
enacting, and boldlie proclaiming to the world, <hi>Habebimus nullum,
We will not have any one for our King.</hi> I could yet goe on in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel,
aggravate their malice and transcendent crueltie, as
otherwise, so from the place which they chose wherein to murder
their innocent King, which was <hi>no Golgotha, a sad place of dead mens
skulles,</hi> but a place for the living to rejoyce and <hi>banquet,</hi> as if Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal
like, they meant to feast on his flesh, and carowse it in the
cup of <hi>deadlie wine</hi> (for so I beleeve they and their posteritie will
finde it) <hi>the bloud of their Soveraigne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall onelie take notice of Pilates last courtesie to Christ, who,
when he could not prevaile for his life, set a crowne upon his head
at his death for such,<note place="margin">Tom. 7. Hom. 84.</note> sayth Origen, was that title he writ, <hi>Iesus of
Nazareth, the King of the Iewet.</hi> St. Chrysostom sayth he erected it for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57920:14"/>
a trophie, <hi>hosper 'epì tropaíou tinos, houto tà grámmata etheke, lampràn
'aphiénta phonen, kaì tèn níken deloûnta, kaì tèn basileian 'anakerytonta.</hi> But
our Judge and his Jewes in stead of giving crownes pull downe
Kigdomes, hide them as deep in oblivion as they can, that they
may lay the firmer foundation for their new modell'd government
in a state.<note place="margin">St. Matth. 7. 26.</note> But if <hi>he that built his house upon sand</hi> was likelie to finde
such an uncertaine foundation, how sliperie will his be who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to erect a republike on bloud? If there be a <hi>woe for him that
buildeth his house by unrighteousnesse, and his chambers by wrong,</hi> (and there
is that woe <hi>Ieremie</hi> 22.) what is there for him, that frameth his new
fabrike by murder? <hi>The stone shall crie out of the wall, and the beame out of
the timber shall answer.</hi> And what this crie and answer shall be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Habakuk</hi> tells you the <hi>second of his Prophecie 12. Vaeilli. Woe unto
him that buildeth a towne by bloud, and stablisheth a citie by iniquitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to conclude all. Maugre the wicked policie of our Jewes,
in racing his name, altering his stampe, burning his papers (and
leprous may that arme be that brings such pretious fuell to the fire)
I say for all this their politike malice, our Royal martyr hath not
onelie (no thankes to his Judge) the crowne and trophie of a title,
but the everlasting stupendious monument of a booke, rais'd higher
then the Pyramids of Aegypt in the strength of language,<note place="margin">Eikòn Bá<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silic.</note> and well
proportion'd spiring expression, built with out an hyperbole to
heaven in divine meditations, and raptures, to which the Babel of
other mens thoughts fall downe, and lies like an heape of confus'd
uselesse rubbish upon the earth.</p>
               <p>It is recorded of St. Paul; That when his head was stroke off,
there issued no bloud, but pure milke out of every orifice of his
veines.<note place="margin">Serm. 68.</note> 
                  <hi>Nec mirum</hi> sayth St. Ambrose, <hi>Abundâsse lacte nutricium Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae.</hi>
And no wonder is it that abundance of milke should come from
the nurse of the Church. Never Church had such a Kinglie nursing
father as this in his life, and never Saint gave better milke at his
death. So sweet is the relish of his words, such a miraculous meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in his speach, as if he had as well been fed with his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
food in the infancie of his life, as he tasted the bitter
cup of passion at his death. Of whom you know it was Prophesied
of old. <hi>Buter and honey shall he eate, that he may know to refuse the evil, and
chuse the good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And may our hopefull Jonathan, our gracious Sovgraigne, with
his fathers blessing not Sauls curse, breake his fast every day in this
honey, and thereby let his eyes be enlightned as Jonathans were,
1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. That he may every day more and more see and avovd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57920:14"/>
the enemies of his peace. Let him every day take one drop at least
thereof upon the top of his rod. Let that sweeten his rod of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
to him. And let his other rod, his rod of revenge, dipt in
this honey, chastise gentlie his enemies for him. And may he grow
up in the strength of this food to all the moral vertues fortitude,
temperance, magnanimitie, and the rest; to all the divine graces
of his father, till having reignd with as much righteousnesse, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and much more peace after him here, he may, by no other
then the hand of heav'n be translated, in the fulnesse of time, to
reigne with him in glorie hereafter. Amen, Amen.</p>
               <closer>Glorie be to God.</closer>
