            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In all which they muſt not be hindred, 1. with the <hi>loſs of life,</hi> for, ſays he, <hi>v.</hi> 25. the words before the Text, <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it,</hi> &amp;c. nor 2. ſhould they be hindred with the <hi>loſs of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> for, ſays he, <hi>v.</hi> 27. the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31347:3"/>
following the text, <hi>The Son of man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, and reward every man according to his works;</hi> and then there ſhall be a reſurrection of their names, as well as of their perſons. Nor 3. ſhould the <hi>loſs of the world</hi> hinder them, for ſays he in the words of the text it ſelf, <hi>What is a man profited though he ſhould gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> The queſtion is put ſo as to include a ſtrong denyal: <hi>What is a man profited?</hi> That is, he is not <hi>profited at all.</hi> And again, <hi>what ſhall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> that is, <hi>there is nothing that he can give in exchange for it.</hi> And therefore our Saviour is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if he had ſaid, They that will diſobey me, may 'tis true be <hi>gainers in the world</hi> for a while, but if they ſhould be <hi>gainers of the whole world,</hi> their gains would not be ſo great as their loſs, the incomparable, invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, irrecoverable loſs of their precious Souls <hi>Job</hi> 27. 8. <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained:</hi> (though he hath gained never ſo much) <hi>when God taketh away his Soul?</hi> For as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 6, 8, 17. <hi>He that truſted and boaſted in his wealth here, when he dieth, he ſhall carry nothing away, his glory ſhall not deſcend after him.</hi> Or if it might, it would not buy his pardon, or be a ſufficient

ranſome to God. <hi>For the redemption of the Soul is precious,</hi> and (therefore thus) <hi>ceaſeth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence we may obſerve, as the ſubject of the following diſcourſe, <hi>That each ones Soul is to them, more worth then the World.</hi> Or, <hi>that they will be exceeding great loſers that loſe their own Souls, though it ſhould be by the gaining of the whole World.</hi> And this may be made out, by conſidering firſt, what it is to gain the World; and the worhtleſneſs thereof though gained; and next, by ſhewing what it is to loſe the Soul; and the preciouſneſs of that if loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore as to the <hi>gaining of the world,</hi> we are to remember that</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the world, as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John</hi> 1. 10. is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meant, the <hi>whole viſible fabrick</hi> of the heavens we breath in, and the earth we tread upon; and thus the Text muſt be underſtood only by way of ſuppoſition; for otherwiſe neither <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> nor <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor any the greateſt Conqueror ever gained ſo much, as to become abſolute Maſter of the whole earthly Globe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the world may ſometimes, as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John.</hi> 15. 19. be meant the <hi>wicked of the world.</hi> And ſo, but too many think they have gained what they moſt deſire, if they may but enjoy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31347:4"/>
the frequent Society of the moſt lewd and wicked people; concerning whom ſays <hi>Saint Hieron: Diſcamus Sanctam ſuperbiam, &amp; ſcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus nos eſſe illis meliores.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Let us Chriſtians learn an holy pride, and (as it may be without any Phariſee-like boaſting) let us know our ſelves <hi>too good</hi> for the Company of ſuch infectious lepers of the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the world may here be Chiefly meant the <hi>things of the world,</hi> worldly profits, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and pleaſures; As 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>The luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, the pride of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo with ſome to <hi>gain the world,</hi> is by men-pleaſing or time ſerving, by flatteries or briberies to get <hi>honours and preferment</hi> in the world. Not a few being willing to give away the world in this ſenſe, to gain it in another.</p>
            <p>Again with others, to <hi>gain the world,</hi> is by immodeſt apparelling, or inticing behaviour, or by the frequent uſe of unſeaſonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate recreation, or by luxurious and riotous living to get the <hi>ſinful ſenſual pleaſures of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further with the moſt, to <hi>gain the world,</hi> is to get the <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>profits</hi> thereof, by covetouſneſs, or by oppreſſion &amp; extortion, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31347:4"/>
by fraudulent unrighteous dealing, or by abuſing a lawful calling; or uſing that which is unlawful, ſo as to live much upon the ſins of others, in furthering their pride, or idleneſs, or prodigality, or quarrelſomneſs, or wanton lewdneſs, or beaſtly drunkenneſs or the like.</p>
            <p>In a word, to <hi>gain the world</hi> in this ſenſe, is by <hi>any undue means</hi> to get whatſoever in the world the heart of carnal wretches can moſt deſire, and which is <hi>as a world</hi> to them. Between whom and ſincere Chriſtians there is always this vaſt difference; Good and faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſeek the favour and fruition of God in Chriſt, and their own Souls ſalvation, as their <hi>main end;</hi> and in order thereunto, make <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion their buſineſs;</hi> and all worldly things, even which may be innocently uſed, with them come in <hi>but on the by;</hi> ſo as, if it ſhall ſeem good to God, they can either <hi>have them,</hi> or be <hi>without them.</hi> Whereas to carnal people that loſe their Souls in the purſuit of the world, their <hi>main end is,</hi> the pleaſing of the fleſh thereby ſome way or other, which their ſex, age, education, conſtitution of body, or condition of life moſt tempts and leads them to. And with them, <hi>Religion, that comes in but on the by;</hi> and if they need it not for a pretence, they can moſt eaſily be without it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:31347:5"/>
Yet after all, when ſuch people have, with the contempt of Gods ſervice, the wounding of their conſciences, and the abuſe of their pretious Souls, gotten the moſt they can of the world; at the laſt they are forced by their own ſad Experience to confeſs the <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>worthleſneſs</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis true theſe outward worldly things, as they <hi>proceed from God,</hi> and may <hi>lead to him;</hi> as they may fit men for great offices, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imployments; as they may be uſed for our own and others wellfare, and as they are a means to ſuſtain us in this life, while we are ſeeking after eternal life, ſo they are the good bleſſings of God, which we may labour after, and ought to be thankful for. But as they are <hi>abſtracted from God,</hi> and inordinately loved, ſought, and truſted in, ſo they have this <hi>five-fold vanity,</hi> which is but too eaſily diſcovered in them, namely, their unſatisfactorineſs, their commoneſs, their deceitfulneſs, their unſuitableneſs, and unprofitableneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which ſpeaks the little worth, but great vanity of worldly things, is their <hi>unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorineſs. Ahab</hi> had the poſſeſſion of a wealthy Kingdome, and yet for want of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> vineyard only, how was he heart-ſick,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31347:5"/>
ſo as to take no content in all his other enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 4. In like manner, to what a wonderful height of dignity and earthly happineſs was <hi>Human</hi> advanced, and yet how did ſo inconſiderable a thing, as the want of poor <hi>Mordecaie</hi>'s <hi>knee,</hi> damp all the delights of his proud heart? <hi>Eſther</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Knock at the door of the Choiceſt earthly poſſeſſions, and they will tell you one by one, <hi>ſufficiency is not in me.</hi> The creature if parted from God, is empty, and the Soul too; and what fulneſs can be had by adding one empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to another? Many a poor man hath thought; <hi>if I had but enough to ſupply ſuch neceſſaries, and diſcharge ſuch debts, how chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully would I ſerve the Lord without diſtraction, and not care ſo much for the world any more?</hi> But when theſe deſires have been granted, they have found themſelvs ſtill unſatisfied; being ready now to thirſt as much after <hi>fulneſs,</hi> as before after <hi>neceſſaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is God only who is <hi>All-ſufficient,</hi> both as to his <hi>own happineſs,</hi> and <hi>our ſatisfaction, Gen.</hi> 17. 1. It is Chriſt the uncreated Wiſdome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>Who fills the treaſures of thoſe that love him, and cauſeth them to inherit ſubſtance.</hi> And if he do not make God ours, as well as the creature, our condition will be but like
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31347:6"/>
theirs mentioned <hi>Haggai</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Ye have ſown much, and bring in little: Ye eat, but ye have not enough: Ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink: ye clothe you, but there is none warm: and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. Solomon</hi> that was <hi>ſo rich</hi> to compaſs all worldly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, and <hi>ſo wiſe</hi> to find out what was beſt in them to be enjoyed; after a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, tells us, that if they lead not to God, they will be but <hi>vanity and vexation of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How doth the <hi>Commonneſs</hi> of theſe worldly things abate the value of them? <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 1, 2. <hi>They come alike to all,</hi> and none can certainly know by them either <hi>love or hatred;</hi> whether they be the friends or enemies of God. You cannot ſay, <hi>God gives me poverty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hates me; or he gives me riches, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he loves me;</hi> ſuch concluſions are weak and deceitful. For the <hi>good</hi> may be afflicted as well as the <hi>bad,</hi> and ſometimes undergoe the heavieſt burden of earthly trouble. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. And on the other hand, the <hi>wicked</hi> may flouriſh for a while as well as the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and ſometimes enjoy the greateſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of worldly proſperity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Renewing grace is a <hi>certain ſign</hi> of Gods
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31347:6"/>
favour, and a <hi>ſpecial diſtinguiſhing mercy,</hi> and therefore highly to be eſteemed, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſought after; but outward comforts, common natural gifts, and acquired abilities, as a fair eſtate, an healthful body, a faithful memory, a quick underſtanding, a ready utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or the like; theſe, though bleſſings in themſelves, yet are but <hi>bleſſings of the left hand,</hi> ſuch as are given to the <hi>heathen Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Chriſtian Worſhipper, to the clean and unclean,</hi> to him that ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and him that ſacrificeth not. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this their commonneſs ſhews much of their vanity and worthleſneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How is there in worldly things a vanity of <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> which alſo ſpeaks them leſs valuable? How many people come to the world as to a lottery, looking for a prize, but go away cheated with a blank? How often doth the world by <hi>promiſing much,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming little,</hi> firſt abuſe our Judgements, and then fruſtrate our hopes and expectations?</p>
            <p>Have you not ſometimes found creature-confidences, like the truſting in the <hi>Staff of a brokenreed, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce it? Iſa.</hi> 36. 6. Have you not ſometimes enjoyed the pleaſures of ſin <hi>for a ſeaſon,</hi> and flattered your ſelf with the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31347:7"/>
               <hi>long continuance</hi> of them? Whereas that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is gone, and never returns again. Can you not remember what happineſs you may have promiſed your ſelf in ſuch a friend, ſuch a purchaſe, ſuch a preferment, but ſome <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected diſappointment</hi> or other, ſome Croſſe or other, hath much imbittered them unto you, and leſſened your comfort in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment?</p>
            <p>The <hi>mutability</hi> of the world is the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of it; which that we may avoid, let us duly conſider what the Apoſtle hath written, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19. And again 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, 30, 31. Oh let us not ſuffer our ſelves to be impoſed upon, counting that to <hi>continue long,</hi> which he, according to the experience of all, tells us ſhall abide but a <hi>ſhort while</hi> and <hi>then paſſe away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh let us not think with them <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 12. what carnal delights we will have <hi>this day,</hi> and <hi>to morrow much more abundant.</hi> Oh let us not ſay with him <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Luke</hi> 12. 19, 20. <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, eat drink, be merry, thou haſt much goods layd up for many years.</hi> Leaſt we be awakened with that terrible voice of God, ſaying, as unto him; <hi>Thou fool this night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee; then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provided?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:31347:7"/>
Why ſhould we inordinately ſet our hearts and affections on that which <hi>is not?</hi> for as <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Riches</hi> (honours, pleaſures) <hi>make themſelves wings and fly away.</hi> When we think our ſelves <hi>moſt ſure</hi> of them, when we truſt moſt in them, when by the abuſe of them, we are become moſt proud, ſtomackful, ſecure and negligent of Gods ſervice, then are we moſt <hi>ſadly deceived,</hi> then the wing of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, of oppreſſion, of caſualty ſweeps them from us; or elſe the wing of death carries us away from them in a moment.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the world to <hi>perform more</hi> then it <hi>promiſeth,</hi> and that we could be ſure of it for a very conſiderable while; yet have we not immortal Souls to provide for? Have we not matters of <hi>life</hi> or <hi>death</hi> to look after? And what can all the world be to <hi>this?</hi> Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how nearly doth it concern us to <hi>lay up in ſtore for our ſelves a ſure foundation for the time to come;</hi> to anchor our Souls upon Chriſt the <hi>rock of ages</hi> who will never deceive us; and not to hazard them for any thing, in this worthleſs, becauſe deceitful and changeable, world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That which further ſhews the worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of the things of the world, is their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>unſutableneſs</hi> in reſpect of the precious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31347:8"/>
Soul. Thoſe are <hi>corporeal</hi> and <hi>fading,</hi> this is <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>immortal.</hi> Thoſe are limited and finite beings, this a ſubſtance of unbounded deſires, and can be <hi>fully ſatisfied</hi> with nothing but communion with the Father, and the Son through the Spirit; with nothing but a ſtate of grace and ſalvation, and the fruition of God.</p>
            <p>All that worth which ſilver and gold, and ſuch worldly things have, is not ſo much in their <hi>own nature,</hi> as from <hi>our eſteem,</hi> or from ſome outward <hi>humane appointment;</hi> but we can never thus make them equally excellent with our ſelves.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, by a wilful ſlavery to ſin, we may (as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6. 30.) <hi>turn our ſelves into braſſe, and iron, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſilver;</hi> we may unman and unchriſtian our ſelves; we may undervalue and debaſe our Souls, blotting out the image of God, and writing upon them the ſuperſcription of earth and the world; Thus indeed, the <hi>Epicure</hi> may greatly delight in ſenſual pleaſures, and the <hi>ambitious mind</hi> in flattering titles, and the <hi>frothy wit</hi> in abuſive lightneſs; Thus, 'tis true, carnal and worldly things, to carnal, and worldly hearts may become but too ſutable, dear, and precious. But the deſires of a gracious heart
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31347:8"/>
are after <hi>higher and better things.</hi> For every faithful Chriſtian conſiders that God hath made even our bodies upright, and our faces lifted from the earth; that we might conceive how far from it, our <hi>heaven-born Spirits</hi> ſhould be elevated towards himſelf, and Chriſt, and heavenly Glory, which are therefore <hi>moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,</hi> becauſe <hi>moſt proportionable</hi> and <hi>ſutable</hi> to our Souls, in their utmoſt capacities.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, the worthleſneſs of the world appears by its <hi>unprofitableneſs.</hi> As <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> ſaid to the people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 20, 21. <hi>Turn ye not aſide from ſerving and following the Lord; for then ſhould ye go after vain things, which cannot profit, becauſe they are vain.</hi> Too many indeed are ready to think the profits of the world worth their gaining, even by the loſs of their conſciences, of heaven, and God himſelf. And as for thoſe who make conſcience of their waies, and endevour to walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, cloſely, and humbly with God; who ſcrupulouſly forbear <hi>prophane raſh oaths</hi> and idle diſcourſe, who are ſenſible of the leaſt <hi>ſecret ſin,</hi> who avoid what they can all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and <hi>appearances of evil,</hi> who withſtand the corruptions of the <hi>times</hi> and <hi>places</hi> they live in, though they gain leſs in the world; theſe are often accounted, ſuch as know not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31347:9"/>
what is beſt for themſelves. But <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> aſſures us, that ſuch <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is the trueſt gain;</hi> whereas the world, when you have ſpent all your thoughts, and the labour of your lives upon it; though it may further you in ſome <hi>leſſer reſpects,</hi> yet it cannot profit you in the <hi>main thing neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot procure us the favour of God, who <hi>regardeth not the rich man more then the poor, for they are all alike the work of his hands.</hi> He accounts of all, not according to their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or greatneſs, but according to their real piety and goodneſs; <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 1. <hi>Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, then he that is perverſe in his lips, and is a fool. Prov.</hi> 28. 6. <hi>Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightneſs, then he that is perverſe in his ways, though he be rich.</hi> Obſerve, They are the poor that walk in their integrity, that know, love, and ſerve God; not that kind of poor who are <hi>groſſely ignorant</hi> and <hi>neglectful</hi> of God, and who lead ſenſual, ſloathful, and heatheniſh lives; though they <hi>above others,</hi> might be moſt eaſily convinced of the <hi>emptineſs</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs</hi> of the world, and ſo have <hi>greater care</hi> of their <hi>Souls ſalvation,</hi> ſeeking out after God in Chriſt to ſupply their Spiritual neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that it may be better with them in the life to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:31347:9"/>
Again, the world cannot eaſe the pain of an <hi>afflicted conſcience;</hi> nor can it give us the grace we want. Ordinarily 'tis ſo abuſed, that it makes people not more <hi>thankful,</hi> but more <hi>forgetful</hi> of God; nor doth it (as it ought) draw their hearts nearer to God, but ſets them at a further diſtance from him; nor doth it make them <hi>more humble,</hi> but <hi>more haughty;</hi> nor more conſtant and ſincere in duties, but more unfit for any good word or work.</p>
            <p>Nor can the world <hi>profit</hi> us in the <hi>day of wrath.</hi> When the ſinful pleaſures of youth are ended by ſickneſs, age, or death, what can be left, but the <hi>worm of conſcience</hi> bred out of them to torment the Soul for ever?</p>
            <p>Have you not ſometimes conſidered with your ſelf, how ſoon the world and its pleaſures will turn you off? How can you but now and then take notice of your <hi>own frailties</hi> which tell you, how <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>ſhortly</hi> you muſt lie down in the duſt? Do you not ſometimes go to the houſe of mourning, or ſtand by <hi>dying people,</hi> confeſſing the world to be nothing worth, and complaining of the loſſe of their time and ſtrength ſpent upon it? And do you not ſee how <hi>little</hi> it doth for them in their <hi>greateſt need?</hi> Oh therefore let this prevail with us to prize our Souls above the world; let
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31347:10"/>
this (with what hath been conſidered in the foregoing particulars) make us ſet as <hi>light by it,</hi> as it doth, or will do <hi>by us.</hi> Let us henceforth make Chriſt our <hi>treaſure,</hi> and count it our happineſs to honour and worſhip him as we ought to do. Let us make God <hi>our portion,</hi> and ſit down content with him alone, and let them who can get no better, take the world and the pleaſures of it.</p>
            <p>Having now ſeen, what it is to gain the world, and the <hi>worthleſneſs</hi> thereof though <hi>gained,</hi> we are in the next place to conſider, what it is to <hi>loſe the Soul,</hi> and the <hi>preciouſneſs</hi> of that if loſt.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>loſing of the Soul,</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here rendred, <hi>to loſe,</hi> ſignifies to have a mulct or puniſhment inflicted, and ſo may import, not only the fatal final loſſe or damnation of the Soul, but alſo any loſſe or damage that belongs to it, here or hereafter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore to <hi>loſe the Soul</hi> is <hi>to loſe ones ſelf.</hi> A mans Soul is the principal part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo it is in <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Luke ch.</hi> 9. 25. <hi>What is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and loſe himſelf</hi> (Soul and body too) <hi>and be caſt away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>loſe the Soul</hi> implies a being <hi>deprived</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:31347:10"/>
of all further <hi>opportunities</hi> and <hi>ſeaſons of grace,</hi> of all <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>gracious endowments,</hi> which are as the <hi>life</hi> of the Soul. When Chriſt calls by death or Judgement; they that like the fooliſh virgins, have not <hi>oyl in their lamps,</hi> and <hi>their lamps trimmed,</hi> that have not their Souls adorned with the ſaving graces of his Spirit; they ſhall not enter with him. Having waited ſo long already, and all in vain, he will now ſtay no longer, <hi>till they go</hi> and <hi>buy for themſelves,</hi> but will ſhut the door of mercy againſt them for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>loſing of the Soul</hi> implyes the <hi>loſſe</hi> of all ſuch <hi>earthly enjoyments,</hi> as ſenſual hearts love and prize above their Souls, and for which they undoe themſelves for ever. Oh who can expreſs the wretchedneſs of ſuch people, when they ſhall ſtand before the Judgment ſeat of God, to receive their juſt doom, in the moſt <hi>forlorn</hi> and <hi>deſolate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> ſtript and forſaken of all carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, friends, poſſeſſions, and outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations whatſoever; which to the hazard of their Souls, they have graſped at, and uſed in a <hi>ſinful way;</hi> and therefore muſt now loſe both the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>them too</hi> eternally.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>loſing of the Soul</hi> implyes the <hi>loſing of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>bleſſed Viſion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31347:11"/>
of God for ever.</hi> And this indeed is the <hi>loſs of loſſes,</hi> ſuch as there was never the like before, nor ever can be again after it. The fore-mentioned might be born, but hardly; but this is intollerable. This worſt effect of ſin, <hi>Depart from me,</hi> or <hi>go away from me,</hi> is as terrible a word, as <hi>everlaſting fire.</hi> For alaſs! Whither ſhall they go, that go from God, when he alone hath the power of eternal life. Ten thouſand words cannot ſpeak a Soul more unhappy, then thoſe two words, <hi>without God, Eph.</hi> 2. 12. Thou mayſt be without riches, without friends, without health, without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, nay, without all outward bleſſings, and yet be bleſſed; but if <hi>without God,</hi> thou art <hi>curſed</hi> with a <hi>curſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The hypocrites hell which is the hotteſt of all other, is ſet out by this, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 16. <hi>The hypocrite ſhall not come before God.</hi> When God would moſt powerfully <hi>perſwade</hi> to dutie, this is his motive, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Obey my voice, and I will be your God.</hi> When he would moſt effectually <hi>diſswade</hi> from ſin, this is his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Be inſtructed, O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, leaſt my Soul depart from you.</hi> And again <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Wo unto them, when I depart from them.</hi> How ſad a ſaying is that of <hi>Sauls,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 15. <hi>I am ſore diſtreſſed, for the Philiſtins
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31347:11"/>
are upon me, and God is departed from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How mournfully doth <hi>Micah</hi> bemoan the loſs even of his helpleſs idols, <hi>Judges</hi> 18. 24. <hi>Ye have taken away my Gods, and what have I more, and what is this ye ſay unto me, what aileth thee?</hi> How ſadly is holy <hi>David</hi> and our Bleſſed Saviour afflicted at Gods abſence in part, and for a while? <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> ſays the one. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſays the other <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 14, 15.) <hi>why caſteſt thou off my Soul? Why hideſt thou thy face from me? I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and ready to dye, while I ſuffer thy terrours, I am diſtracted.</hi> Do theſe ſo complain of Gods abſence in part, and for a while? how bitterly then will the loſt Soul complain when forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God utterly and eternally!</p>
            <p>Some are ready to ſay to God, as <hi>Job</hi> 21. 24. <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy ways.</hi> They think him ſometimes <hi>too near</hi> them in a Sermon, in a private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, in a motion of his Spirit, or in a conviction of conſcience; and could wiſh him, with his holy Laws <hi>farther off,</hi> that they might ſin more ſecurely; but let ſuch beware, leaſt he take them at their word, and give them their wiſh to their woe, in baniſhing them ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly from his comfortable preſence. Oh with what <hi>tormenting grief</hi> will they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31347:12"/>
thoſe Soul-raviſhing delights, which the righteous have in the preſence of God, the fountain of all good; whilſt they are ſentenced to an <hi>eternal ſeparation</hi> from him! How ſad and deformed a ſpectacle is the <hi>body</hi> from which the <hi>Soul</hi> is parted; oh how ſad then ſhall the condition of that Soul be from which God is <hi>parted</hi> for ever? This though very grievous, yet is not all, for 5. and laſtly, the <hi>loſing of the Soul</hi> implies further its being brought to the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of ſin, and conſequently to ſuch a <hi>fulneſs of ſorrow,</hi> and ſuch a weight of Gods burning eternal wrath, as no heart can conceive, or tongue expreſs. They that would chooſe ſin, to ſave themſelves from a little trouble or affliction, will find, that now <hi>what they feared, and ten thouſand times</hi> more is come upon them.</p>
            <p>The wicked could now wiſh their Souls were <hi>ſo loſt</hi> as to <hi>ceaſe to be,</hi> that they might <hi>ceaſe</hi> to be tormented; but God by his infinite power will both uphold them in their <hi>being,</hi> and make them more ſenſible of pain then ever, that they may be the ſubjects of greater puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And now the Conſcience of a loſt Soul gnaws to think, <hi>ſo many nights I went to bed prayerleſs; ſo many times I ſwallowed down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31347:12"/>
gain; ſo many hours I ſpent in revelling, fooliſh ſporting, or idle unprofitable talking; ſo many opportunities of receiving good at the Lords-ſupper and other ordinances, I have loſt, becauſe I would not prepare for them, nor ſo much as defile my foot, or endure a little cold or trouble, to be preſent at them. Oh that I had been more diligent in the practice of religion and holineſs; oh that I had kept the Lords-day better, and been more innocent in my walking all the week after, though a leſs gainer in the world; Oh that I had never known ſuch or ſuch a ſin, which I loved, lived in, plotted and contrived, and by which I have now wrought my own eternal ruine; Oh that I had ſpent but half my mis-ſpent time in praying, and ſtudying Gods Word, in doing good, and watching over my ways, then had I been yonder in Heaven, but now I muſt be for ever tormented in theſe flames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou mayſt now ſo <hi>under value</hi> thy Soul, as to ſpend much more time upon thy beaſts then upon it; though <hi>Truth it ſelf</hi> tells us in the Text, that it is <hi>more worth then a world.</hi> But that which is now deſpiſed, in hell will be eſteemed; and the damned ſhall fully know the price of this <hi>Pearl,</hi> whether they will or no. But it is far better to know and believe it now, that we may be more careful of its preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:31347:13"/>
Conſider therefore, I beſeech you, in the next place, the <hi>preciouſneſs</hi> of the Soul in theſe ſeveral reſpects. 1. As to <hi>God our maker,</hi> for did not he at firſt make it in innocency, after his own glorious image in <hi>knowledge, righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>holineſs, Gen.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. And ever ſince, how is it the body of the Child only, the frailer and viler part, which is from the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Parents? (as it was at firſt <hi>formed of the duſt of the ground Gen.</hi> 2. 7.) whereas the <hi>precious Soul,</hi> which is of a Spiritual nature, and ſhall never die, hath its immediate <hi>being</hi> and original from God the <hi>Father of Spirits, Heb.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Infundendo creatur, &amp; creando infunditur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is it God only, from whom it is, who can effectually <hi>command the Soul</hi> to ſubjection? (while the Magiſtrate can but force the outward man) And God only who can <hi>puniſh it?</hi> (while man can but kill the body, <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Mat.</hi> 10. 28.)</p>
            <p>Still even under the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>corruption,</hi> how is it the Candle of the Lord, and the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of his creation, ſhewing the dignity of its nature by its various and noble operations? He that by theſe knows not what the <hi>Soul is,</hi> knows not what a <hi>man is.</hi> For what is it but the Soul which thus diſtinguiſheth us from brute beaſts? What is it but the Soul, by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31347:13"/>
which you are thinking, reading, or asking, <hi>what a Soul is?</hi> What is it but the Soul which is the fountain of <hi>precious life,</hi> and therefore much more precious in it ſelf? <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 26. <hi>The adultereſs will hunt for the precious life.</hi> The words are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>the precious Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the Soul but the <hi>rational nature</hi> containing the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>vegetative; The Principle</hi> or <hi>firſt Act</hi> by which we <hi>move, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, underſtand</hi> and <hi>freely will?</hi> And how do theſe <hi>acts</hi> ſpeak the excellency of the <hi>Powers</hi> from whence they flow! and how do thoſe Powers ſhew the worth of the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider its <hi>Excellency</hi> in relation to <hi>Chriſt our Redeemer.</hi> What can more clearly demonſtrate the preciouſneſs of it, then the greatneſs of that price which he payd for it? Being willing to lay down his life to deliver the Soul from eternal miſery. 1 <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. The Apoſtle ſays <hi>we are not redeemed with gold or ſilver, or any ſuch corruptible things; but with the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more noble the <hi>perſon</hi> taken captive, the <hi>larger</hi> is the <hi>ſumme</hi> required for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Our Saviour in all likelihood would not have done what he did, to keep the whole frame of heaven and earth from being diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but to ſave thoſe <hi>precious immortal Souls</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:31347:14"/>
from periſhing, which were capable of enjoying ſo much good from God, and bringing ſo much glory to him; he was ready, to take our nature, to ſuffer his Fathers wrath, to live a painful life, and dye an accurſed death, by <hi>all which</hi> we may read in moſt fair and large Characters the worth of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider its excellency in relation to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt our Sanctifier.</hi> Oh how precious muſt that needs be, which is cleanſed, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and beautified with <hi>precious faith,</hi> as 'tis called, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. And ſo we may ſay with precious hope and charity, with precious wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, meekneſs, temperance, patience. Oh the Excellent <hi>ſupernatural operations</hi> of ſuch a Soul! The <hi>mind</hi> is buſie to know God in Chriſt, and to underſtand his will revealed in his word. The <hi>memory</hi> thinks of him, the <hi>conſcience</hi> ſtands in awe of him, the <hi>Will</hi> choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and embraceth him, the <hi>heart</hi> truſts in him and is ſet upon him; <hi>The affections</hi> are taken up in loving him, rejoycing in him, fearing to offend him, deſiring to pleaſe and enjoy him. Theſe are the <hi>truly noble,</hi> and worthy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Soul as redeemed and ſanctified, and renewed after the image of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider further its excellency with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>heavenly Angels.</hi> For why ſhould
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31347:14"/>
they attend us as <hi>miniſtring ſpirits,</hi> if our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were not of an excellent angelical nature, and <hi>fit</hi> to <hi>miniſter unto God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay 5. may not the <hi>faln accurſed angels,</hi> and <hi>Satan himſelf</hi> tell us the <hi>worth</hi> of a Soul, by his being ſo much the enemy of its Salvation, when he <hi>compaſſeth the earth, Job</hi> 1. 7. and <hi>goeth about night and day to devour</hi> and deceive them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Why ſhould God, if it were not for our <hi>precious immortal Souls,</hi> give us the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and an <hi>excellent religion</hi> to ſhew us the way to happineſs? Or why ſhould he in the Scriptures dignifie us with ſuch honourable titles, as to be called his <hi>Friends,</hi> his <hi>Children,</hi> to be called the <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> and the <hi>members</hi> of Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Why too ſhould <hi>Miniſters be appointed by him,</hi> to preach, and pray, and labour for us, if we had not ſuch precious Souls to <hi>ſave or loſe? Hebr.</hi> 13. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, for they watch for your Souls.</hi> Why ſhould they preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, and be ſo reviled, and ſuffer ſo much to perform their work, but that they know <hi>That he that winneth Souls is wiſe, Prov.</hi> 11. 30. And that <hi>he which converteth a ſinner from the errour of his ways, ſhall ſave a Soul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:31347:15"/>
8. Moreover, why ſhould ſuch ſtore of <hi>other mercies</hi> be provided for us? Why ſhould a <hi>world of creatures</hi> (whoſe corporeal ſubſtance ſeems as excellent as ours) attend and <hi>ſerve us,</hi> if we were but an ingenious ſort of brutes, and had not reaſonable immortal Souls more worth then the world? Other Creatures are made for man, and man for God, to glorifie him <hi>by them,</hi> and <hi>for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely they have a right eſtimate of the <hi>Souls worth,</hi> who meaſure by <hi>it</hi> the <hi>worth</hi> of all <hi>worldly things;</hi> who reckon of their in-comes, their friends, eſtates, preferments according as they help or hinder them in the ſervice of God; counting them <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs excellent,</hi> as they are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs ſubſervient</hi> to his honour, and their own or others Souls everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Conſider the precious Soul in its <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> which is to an <hi>eternal enjoyment of God,</hi> an infinite good; and that, as fully as humane nature is capable of, and that in a ſtate of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection. <hi>Intellectus quaerit Deum.</hi> The Soul reacheth after God, and this ſpeaks its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that he alone can ſatisfie it. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſays <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auguſtin) thou haſt made us for thy ſelf, and our heart is unquiet till it comes unto thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, <hi>O Chriſtian,</hi> thy weakneſſes are thy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31347:15"/>
grief, and thy afflictions or meanneſs may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee deſpicable in the eyes of the world, but being <hi>ſincerely converted,</hi> thy Soul is in a <hi>tendency</hi> to that happineſs, where it ſhall be enlarged, and perfected to partake the more of God. Where its <hi>beſt faculties</hi> ſhall be united to the <hi>beſt object,</hi> in the beſt and <hi>fulleſt manner</hi> to eternal ages. If ſincerely converted to God, thy Soul is in a tendency to that illuſtrious heavenly glory, which is only ſutable to it, and which will render far more precious and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, both <hi>it,</hi> and thy <hi>body</hi> too, after the reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Hence we adde one conſideration more of the Souls excellency, and that is, in reſpect of the <hi>body here. David</hi> ſpeaking of the body, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 139. 14, 15. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works, and that my Soul knoweth right well. My ſubſtance was not hid from thee, when I was made in ſecret; and curiouſly wrought</hi> (or imbroydered) <hi>in the loweſt parts of the earth. Galen</hi> more atheiſtical before, when he came to ſee the anatomy of mans body, and conſidered the excellent frame thereof, <hi>Now</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I adore the God of nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet we know the <hi>body</hi> is but the caſe or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:31347:16"/>
of the <hi>Soul,</hi> which ſo far exceeds it, that in many things, with God, the <hi>willingneſs</hi> and <hi>pure intention</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> is chiefly lookt at, without which bodily exerciſe profiteth little. <hi>Though a man give his body to be burnt,</hi> if there be wanting the <hi>charity</hi> of the <hi>Soul, it availeth nothing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
            <p>Nay there are ſeveral actions of the Soul which are beyond that which concerns the body at all; as the knowing of God, and the life to come, and many notions in <hi>mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and other ſciences which are abſtracted from bodily ſubſtances.</p>
            <p>In <hi>adverſity,</hi> there may be ſolid joys in the mind; as there may be real torments upon a mans ſpirit, which the Primitive Chriſtians and Martyrs being freed from, made little reckoning of their <hi>outward ſufferings,</hi> but endured them (as <hi>Sozomen</hi> ſays) as if <hi>their bodies</hi> had been <hi>other folks,</hi> and <hi>not their own.</hi> In <hi>proſperity</hi> too there may be a power in mans Soul to <hi>curb</hi> the body in that which is moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and pleaſing, which a beaſt cannot do. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>I keep under my body</hi> and <hi>bring it into ſubjection, St Mat.</hi> 18. 8, 9. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 1, 2. <hi>When thou ſitteſt to eat with a ruler, conſider diligently what is before thee. And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:31347:16"/>
Again, when the body <hi>faints</hi> with age or ſickneſs, the Soul may have <hi>ſtrong deſires</hi> after God and eternity. And when the body <hi>returns to the duſt,</hi> the immortal <hi>ſpirit goes to him that gave it</hi> to be judged to weal or woe. <hi>I deſire</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>to be diſſolved, and be with Chriſt. Father</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>into thy hands I commend my ſpirit, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Luke</hi> 23. 43. and 46. to the penitent thief, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>body,</hi> you ſee then, though curiouſly wrought or imbroydered, is but the <hi>cabinet</hi> of a more precious Soul, which as was ſaid, is chiefly the man. Oh therefore let us not live as if we were <hi>all of a piece,</hi> and the body was the <hi>man;</hi> as if <hi>that</hi> only was to be adorned, pampered, and provided for. God having given us Souls capable of all thoſe excellencies which he is pleaſed to impart to the beſt of his Creatures, let us count them richly worth the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> of an holy <hi>Chriſtian life.</hi> Far be it from us, to be willing of ſo much pains for the world, and to call <hi>farleſs</hi> for the Soul <hi>too much ado.</hi> Far be it from us, to think our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls, no more worth then honour, wealth, or fooliſh mirth. Oh, far be it from us, to count them ſo worthleſs, as to be abuſed to the baſeſt drudgery, to be poyſoned with ſin
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31347:17"/>
and ſenſuality, or to be <hi>ventured</hi> for a thing of nought.</p>
            <p>But thus you have ſeen, both what it is to <hi>gain the world,</hi> and what to <hi>loſe the Soul;</hi> as alſo the <hi>worthleſneſs of the one though gained,</hi> and the <hi>preciouſneſs of the other if loſt;</hi> which if you compare, and duely conſider; you will acknowledge, as our Saviour here hath taught us, <hi>That each ones Soul is of ſuch worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that they muſt needs be exceeding great loſers who loſe their Souls, though it could be by the gaining of the whole world.</hi> As for the more full and <hi>particular improvement</hi> of this weighty truth, which ſo nearly concerns every one of us, you may take it in the following <hi>inferences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Is the Soul of any man or woman whatſoever more worth then a world. Hence then, <hi>O Chriſtian, learn to entertain right thoughts concerning the dignity of thy nature,</hi> and let this 1. make thee hate to diſhonour thy ſelf, by thinking, ſpeaking, or doing any thing <hi>unworthy</hi> of a <hi>rational Soul,</hi> much more of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Let this make thee afraid to live and dye ſo vilely, as at laſt with the wicked to wiſh thou hadſt been made a toad or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or that thou hadſt never been born.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Rather let this conſideration make thee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31347:17"/>
careful to live holily to Gods glory; and ſo to <hi>praiſe him</hi> for thy <hi>Soul,</hi> made capable of ſo excellent a work, as to love, ſerve, and honour him here; and of ſo glorious a reward, as to enjoy him hereafter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let the ſame conſideration move thee to <hi>praiſe God alſo for Chriſt, the Lover of Souls,</hi> who hath done and ſuffered ſo much for their eternal welfare; and <hi>in him,</hi> to praiſe the Lord, eſpecially for all other Soul mercies and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Though he ſhould be pleaſed to keep thee ſhort of other things, ſay with a thankful heart, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt. Gaius</hi> had a Sickly body, but was happy in the proſperous ſtate of his Soul. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi> (ſays <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John Epiſtle</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2.) <hi>I wiſh that thou mayſt proſper, and be in health, even as thy Soul proſpereth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let this <hi>dignity</hi> of thy <hi>humane nature</hi> help thee to ſee the <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>thy holy religion.</hi> And remember, though every thing elſe be mean about thee, yet thy <hi>ſincere religiouſneſs</hi> relating to the precious Soul, is no mean, but an excellent thing; which as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>makes the righteous more excellent then his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:31347:18"/>
5. Let this further make thee to carry they ſelf alwaies <hi>humbly</hi> and <hi>courteouſly</hi> towards the meaneſt people thou canſt meet with; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that though thou mayſt differ from them in ſome outward reſpects, yet they have Souls, which in their own nature, are as precious as thine own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Is the Soul more worth then a world? and ſhall they be ſuch exceeding great loſers that loſe their Souls, though by the gaining of the whole world? See then <hi>a great help Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have to beat back Satans temptations,</hi> when <hi>tempted to evil,</hi> as <hi>Eve</hi> and our <hi>Saviour, by any thing in the world.</hi> Should a Chapman bid thee for any part of thy goods, not ſo many pence as they are worth pounds; wouldſt thou not turn away with ſcorn from one that offered thee ſo much to thy loſs? Or if but for <hi>thy life,</hi> thou couldſt have an <hi>earthly crown,</hi> or the whole world layd in thy hand; wouldſt thou not utterly refuſe it, knowing it could do thee no good at all when thy life was gone? Wilt thou then exchange thy ſo <hi>precious Soul</hi> to its eternal undoing, when offered for it but a <hi>morſel</hi> of <hi>baſe gain,</hi> or a cup of <hi>ſtoln pleaſure</hi> which will vaniſh in a moment? Therefore</p>
            <p n="1">1. When about to <hi>lye, diſſemble, curſe</hi> or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31347:18"/>
               <hi>ſwear blaſphemouſly,</hi> if the next abuſe of thy tongue would coſt thee the certain loſs of that <hi>unruly member,</hi> would not <hi>ſelf-love</hi> make thee refrain from ſuch evil? and wilt thou not do ſo much more for the <hi>love</hi> of God, and to prevent the loſs of thy precious Soul.
<q>
                  <l>Take not his name, who made thy mouth, in vain:</l>
                  <l>It gets thee nothing, and hath no excuſe:</l>
                  <l>Luſt and wine plead a pleaſure, avarice gain:</l>
                  <l>But the Cheap ſwearer through his open ſluce</l>
                  <l>Lets his Soul runne for nought, as little fearing:</l>
                  <l>Were I an Epicure; I could bate ſwearing.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Again 2. when tempted to <hi>drink more then will do thee good,</hi> if one ſhould aſſure thee that the next needleſs cup was mixed with deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, thou wouldeſt certainly refuſe it; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>thy life</hi> more <hi>precious</hi> then to be ſo vilely caſt away; ſhouldſt thou not then much rather, reſolutely and conſtantly avoid ſuch beaſtly drunkenneſs; as manifeſtly endangers the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of thy far more <hi>precious Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. So when tempted next to <hi>Ale-houſe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> and <hi>ſtage-plays,</hi> in hopes of a little ſordid gain or pleaſures; mayſt thou not remember how deeply thou makeſt thy own and others Souls guilty of <hi>abundance</hi> of <hi>ſin, vanity,</hi> and <hi>prophaneneſs;</hi> and then think how dear bought thy mirth would be, if that nights laughter
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31347:19"/>
ſhould (as it may for any thing thou knoweſt) end in <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth?</hi> As alſo how little gainer thou wilt be, when thou haſt ſtaked and loſt, if not the maintenance of thy family; yet, thy time, reputation, and the credit of religion, and therewith the favour of God, the peace of thy conſcience, and the happineſs of thy Soul.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Moreover how powerfully ſhould the ſame conſideration perſwade each one <hi>to abſtain from fleſhly luſts which war againſt the ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. As alſo 5. not to covet to be <hi>rich</hi> in a <hi>ſinful way,</hi> becauſe they that do ſo, <hi>fall into temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts which drown men in deſtruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while ſome have coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9, 10. And again, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>As the Partridge ſitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not: ſo he that getteth riches and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his days, and at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next temptation that comes to draw thee, like <hi>Eſau, Judas, Ahab,</hi> or <hi>Achan,</hi> to gain ſome little trifle, or to get ſome ſwiniſh pleaſure, Thy <hi>conſcience</hi> may <hi>tell thee,</hi> that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31347:19"/>
if thou doſt deliberately commit ſuch a ſin; thou doſt at the ſame time, wilfully in a manner, ſell or pawn thy Soul which is of ſo great value; or at the beſt, doſt for a ſmall matter moſt ſadly venture the loſs of it. For thou knowſt, that the <hi>ſin is damning</hi> in its own nature; and thou canſt not tell but thou mayſt <hi>dye</hi> with the guilt of it upon thy conſcience; being thou canſt not tell, whether God will give thee time, or an heart to repent of it or no.</p>
            <p>Which of us ſhould not be afraid to conſent to any <hi>wilful ſin,</hi> if we verily thought we ſhould <hi>dye preſently</hi> upon the <hi>doing</hi> of it? Should the Tempter offer us all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world, as a reward of our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſurely we ſhould ſee ſufficient reaſon, like our Saviour, to refuſe to fall down and worſhip him, or any ways to yield unto him; conſidering that by <hi>dying inſtantly</hi> upon the <hi>deed done,</hi> we might loſe a Soul, as our Saviour tells us, more precious then the world. Or as in an <hi>ancient inſcription</hi> upon a certain monument in this Land:
<q>
                  <l>Who ſo him bethoft,</l>
                  <l>Inwardly and oft,</l>
                  <l>How hard it were to flit,</l>
                  <l>From bed unto the pit,</l>
                  <l>From pit into pain,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:31347:20"/>
That nere ſhall ceaſe again,</l>
                  <l>He would not do one ſin,</l>
                  <l>All the world to win.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore tempted to any of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned evils, or any other, think ſeriouſly with thy ſelf, <hi>would I now do this</hi> if I were to leave this world <hi>preſently,</hi> and my Soul call'd to an account as ſoon as it is done? And then <hi>think further</hi> with thy ſelf, that thus it may be for ought thou knoweſt; for thus in Gods juſt judgment it hath been with many a one. Many like <hi>Belſhazzar, Elah,</hi> or <hi>Amnon</hi> have dyed in the midſt of their <hi>drunken Cups, Dan.</hi> 5. 6. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. 9, 10. 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 13. 26. More like <hi>Corah</hi> and his company have been ſwept away in their rebellious courſes either againſt <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi> Others like <hi>Zimri</hi> or <hi>Cozbi</hi> have been ſmitten with death in the <hi>act</hi> of their <hi>uncleanneſs.</hi> Not a few have begun <hi>fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous</hi> and <hi>malicious law-ſuits,</hi> and dyed in the proſecution of them. In ſome peoples mouths, a <hi>lye,</hi> a <hi>curſe,</hi> or a <hi>raſh oath</hi> have been their <hi>laſt words.</hi> In other peoples lives, a <hi>fraud</hi> or <hi>oppreſſion</hi> have been their very <hi>laſt actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> ſurely this ſhould lay a conſtant reſtraint upon thee, and make thee watchful againſt all vicious practices; leaſt thou be tempted, ſo to ſin againſt thy own Soul
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31347:20"/>
at <hi>any time,</hi> that on the morrow it will be <hi>too late</hi> to repent thee of it; leaſt on any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly account, for a thing of nought, thou hazard thy Soul more worth then a thouſand worlds. Oh reſolve henceforth ſtedfaſtly with thy ſelf, however tempted to any deſtructive <hi>wickedneſs of life,</hi> by Gods aſſiſtance, to keep thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul <hi>ſafe</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> whatever thou <hi>getteſt,</hi> or whatever thou <hi>loſeſt,</hi> in this worthleſs and periſhing world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Is the Soul ſo precious, and the loſs of it ſo dreadful? Let this then be further improved to make every <hi>faithful Chriſtian watchful againſt errour in Judgment,</hi> as well as againſt wickedneſs of life and converſation. Hereſies are reckoned by the Apoſtle among the <hi>works of the fleſh, Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20. And ſome are ſaid to be <hi>damnable,</hi> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved. For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie. That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Uſe</hi> much concerns thee, if thou liveſt <hi>near</hi> or <hi>among Seducers,</hi> who by their often gainſaying in private what thou heareſt in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31347:21"/>
publick; by their intereſt and familiarity with thee; by their ſeeming piety and ſheeps-cloathing; by their confident aſſertions and proud phariſaical boaſtings; by their cunning reaſonings, their fair flattering words, or their terrible threats, would bear thee down from truth and unity. But to keep ſafe thy Soul be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to theſe few things. 1. Forget not how <hi>errour</hi> leads to <hi>ſchiſm and ſeparation,</hi> which is full of <hi>horrible impiety.</hi> For is not <hi>ſchiſm</hi> or <hi>cauſleſs dividing</hi> from the congregations of Chriſtian people; <hi>a breach of peace;</hi> and ſo a violation of the very Teſtament of our Lord? <hi>St John</hi> 14. 27. As alſo of <hi>love,</hi> and ſo a diſowning the Chief badge whereby Chriſts diſciples are known from the infidel world, <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John</hi> 13. 35.</p>
            <p>Is not ſchiſm further a <hi>ſubdividing</hi> of the Church into <hi>factions</hi> and <hi>parties,</hi> who expoſe and diſcover each others infirmities to the <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>to the common adverſary?</hi> ſo that they are ſcandalized, and entertain hard thoughts of religion, and of God the Authour of it, and are prejudiced againſt all the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Goſpel though deſigned for their own good. Oh how <hi>heavy an account</hi> will ſuch diſcredit of religion, ſuch dishonour of God, ſuch fruſtrating of Chriſts Goſpel-deſigns, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31347:21"/>
the miſcarriage of ſuch a multitude of Souls <hi>amount to!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, is it not ſchiſm and diviſion that leſſens the <hi>Common ſtrength</hi> by diſperſing it into many ſmaller ſocieties? Did thoſe who withdraw from us, joyn with us, and ſtrengthen our hands, (as they may do, and be never the leſſe holy, but the more) we might hinder more evil, and more convince the ungodly, and do much more good. But now <hi>ſeparating from us, and ſpeaking all the evil they can againſt us, and againſt what we do, they hinder much the work of Chriſt in our hands, and muſt ſadly anſwer for it.</hi>

            <p>Moreover, do not they who run into ways of ſchiſm hinder diſcipline, and bring contempt upon authority, and weaken it, and ſo make <hi>great liberty</hi> for all the <hi>vices</hi> and <hi>ſcandals</hi> of wicked men, by a conſequent impunitie? And thus are they not guilty of increaſing <hi>thoſe ſins</hi> in <hi>others,</hi> which they <hi>themſelves complain</hi> of, becauſe they diſreſpect and weaken that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whether of Magiſtrates or Miniſters, which might otherwiſe reſtrain or reform them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, are not all diviſions, hatreds, animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and ſuch like <hi>filthineſſes of the ſpirit,</hi> which are to the tearing and rending of the

That <hi>one ſpirit</hi> of his inclines them to <hi>unity,</hi> and makes them fear <hi>diviſions,</hi> as a man fears the miſchief of dividing and wounding his own body. By <hi>this</hi> they feel ſuch inſufficiency and ignorance in themſelves, that they rather think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exceedingly <hi>beholden</hi> to Miniſters that will teach them, then <hi>grudge</hi> or <hi>ſcorn</hi> to be taught. And by the <hi>ſame ſpirit</hi> they have that ſenſe of their own unworthineſs, that humility, and that charity to others, that they are far readier to ſay, <hi>we are not worthy to joyn with the Church;</hi> then to ſay, <hi>The Church is not worthy to joyn with us.</hi> Now that thy Soul may not be ſubverted with <hi>errour,</hi> remember this in the firſt place, the great <hi>impiety of ſeparation</hi> which <hi>it</hi> leads to.</p>

And they ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall be turned unto fables.</hi> We read alſo of following after <hi>another Goſpel, Gal.</hi> 1. 6. But repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſincere holy obedience, is that <hi>Good old way</hi> which we, with other Chriſtians, muſt walk in to heavenly glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Take heed of pride, conceitedneſs,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> in thine <hi>own judgement</hi> or <hi>underſtanding.

            <p n="4">4. That thy <hi>Soul</hi> may not be <hi>ſubverted</hi> with errour, <hi>labour to be well grounded in the foundation-truths of the Chriſtian religion, and to turn thy knowledge into practice.</hi> And to this end, be intreated to make good uſe of the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Book,</hi> and eſpecially, ſtudy the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures with humility,</hi> and be much in <hi>prayer,</hi> that God would guide thee by his <hi>holy Spirit</hi> into all ſaving truth, and keep thee from falling into errour. And remember, <hi>That what has
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31347:23"/>
been commonly received by the people of God, and embraced and practiſed by the Saints in all ages, is not lightly to be rejected and deſerted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We agree with the firſt and beſt Chriſtians. <hi>We have the ſame God, the ſame Chriſt, the ſame Holy Ghoſt.

man imagine, that, till of late years, God would leave the <hi>generality of his people</hi> to errour and ſeduction of mind. And then conſider with thy ſelf, whether it be not <hi>ſafer</hi> to follow the <hi>foot-ſteps</hi> of the <hi>flock of Chriſt,</hi> then to be led away by <hi>pretenders to any new light</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p>Goſpel-truth is the treaſure of the Soul; wilt thou then ſo <hi>tamely</hi> and <hi>eaſily</hi> part with it, or ſuffer thoſe crafty perſons that are now abroad to rob thee of it, without ſo much as repairing to thoſe, who would help thee in the defence of it? If thou feareſt the loſſe of any part of thy <hi>eſtate</hi> thou takeſt the <hi>Lawyers</hi> advice; If but thy <hi>beaſt</hi> be ill thou wilt <hi>ask of others;</hi> and if they direct thee to a cure in writing, which thou canſt not read thy ſelf; wilt thou not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31347:24"/>
diligently get others to read it to thee again and again, till thou knowſt what it is, and how to uſe it. Much more, if thy own, or thy childs bodily health be in danger, thou carefully conſulteſt the <hi>Phyſician;</hi> why then art thou not willing, when thy own or thy Relations Soul is much more in danger, to go to them for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whom God hath made by their office <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Guides</hi> in the waies of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>holineſs;</hi> being ready to learn and practice the directions which they ſhall give thee?</p>
            <p>Oh what a wretched thing is it, that people ſhould ſo <hi>contemn</hi> their <hi>own Souls,</hi> as to part with their religion before they have <hi>throughly underſtood</hi> it; or before they have <hi>ſincerely</hi> and <hi>humbly</hi> tried and practiſed it; or when they have only heard what is cunningly ſaid <hi>againſt</hi> it, and not what may be truly and rationally <hi>ſaid for it!</hi> Oh that any ſhould be ſo unjuſt and cruel to their precious Souls, as prodigally to caſt them away, and not take the pains to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>read</hi> that, whereby they might come <hi>rightly</hi> to know the things which concern their everlaſting peace!</p>
            <p n="6">6. That which I would chiefly, and in the laſt place intreat for thy <hi>Souls ſafety</hi> is this; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not thy ſelf to the temptations of Seducers.</hi> The Soul is more precious then to be hazzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31347:24"/>
upon the miſtaken ſenſe of the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 21. To <hi>trie all things</hi> thou needſt not be of <hi>all religions</hi> how falſe or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſoever. Among ſeveral poyſons thou wouldſt not trie any of them, whether it would kill thee or no. Therefore the meaning of this place muſt be, that we are to <hi>examine</hi> the Doctrines that are delivered unto us, <hi>by the Scripture,</hi> whether they are built thereon or no. Like the <hi>Bareans</hi> commended, Acts 17. 11. <hi>who ſearched the Scriptures whether thoſe things were ſo,</hi> that were delivered to them <hi>for the truths of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. be conſidered by <hi>all ſuch</hi> as are not throughly grounded in the Principles of Chriſtianity. <hi>Him that is weak in the faith, receive, but not to doubtful diſputations.</hi> Every private Chriſtian is not fit to cope with hereticks, and <hi>ſuch</hi> as are <hi>skilful to deſtroy the faith of others.</hi> You would not allow a man to come and <hi>undermine</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of your houſe; <hi>This</hi> do they, and <hi>worſe,</hi> that go about to <hi>undermine your Faith,</hi> and labour to <hi>ſhake</hi> and <hi>unſettle you</hi> in the <hi>grand truths</hi> of the Goſpel. Therefore I ſay again, Expoſe thy Soul as little as may be to the temptations of ſeducers. 'Tis in vain for any to pray to God to keep them from the <hi>infection
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31347:25"/>
of errour,</hi> if they wilfully (againſt the expreſs word of God) and without any juſt warrant and call, run into the <hi>company</hi> of Seducers and <hi>read their Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve well, how God in the Scripture bids us, <hi>To beware of them, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Mat.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>not to go after them, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Luke</hi> 21. 8. <hi>To avoid them, Rom.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>To turn away from them,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>If they come to us, not to receive them, or bid them God ſpeed,</hi> or encourage them, 2 <hi>Ep.

Cor. 11. 3. <hi>But I fear leſt by any means, as the ſerpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty, your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which is in Chriſt. v.</hi> 4. <hi>For if he that cometh, preacheth another Jeſus whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another ſpirit, which ye have not received, or another Goſpel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. v.</hi> 13. <hi>For ſuch are falſe Prophets, deceitful workers, transforming themſelves into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of Chriſt. v.</hi> 14. <hi>And no marvel, for Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of

light. v.</hi> 15. <hi>Therefore it is no great thing if his Miniſters alſo be transformed as the Miniſters of righteouſneſs, whoſe end ſhall be according to their works.</hi> And to this we may adde but two Scriptures more and ſo finiſh this uſe.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Is the <hi>loſſe</hi> of the <hi>precious Soul</hi> ſo exceeding great and dreadful? <hi>How very careful then, ſo far as concern'd, ſhould we be of the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and ſalvation of the Souls of others?</hi> And how fearful ſhould we be to have any hand in their utter undoing? If thy friend, after thou haſt warned him, will take ſuch ways, as but to <hi>ruine his eſtate,</hi> doſt thou not think it well, when thou canſt ſay; <hi>praiſed be God, in that I am not guilty of it.</hi> Much more, if any of thy relations, neighbours, or acquaintance,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31347:26"/>
after thou haſt endeavoured thy duty towards them, will follow ſuch courſes, as to <hi>ruine</hi> their <hi>Precious Souls,</hi> is it not a great mercy, when thou canſt ſay; <hi>bleſſed be the Lord, in that I have had no hand in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Country, a Pariſh, a neighbour-hood, a family, by <hi>ſetting a good example,</hi> and ſo <hi>furthering</hi> the <hi>work of Chriſt</hi> in the hands of his Miniſters; thou mayſt not only benefit <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> but be always doing good <hi>to others,</hi> as long as thou liveſt; and the Souls of thoſe, whom, time after time, thou haſt encouraged in the ways of holineſs, may come to bleſs God for thee, and with thee for ever.</p>
            <p>Whereas by ſhewing a <hi>bad exampl,</hi> thou <hi>hindereſt</hi> the <hi>meſſengers</hi> of Chriſt in his work and ſervice, and art continually doing miſchief to thy <hi>ſelf,</hi> and <hi>others about thee,</hi> all thy life long. And the periſhing Souls which thou haſt any way drawn to ſin and ruine, may curſe thee eternally, as a <hi>wretched miſcreant</hi> doing more hurt, then if thou hadſt ruined a whole Kingdome, as to the outward eſtate of it. Oh therefore if thou haſt inticed any to ſin, and they be yet a live, ſeek to do their Souls as <hi>much good,</hi> as thou haſt been a <hi>cauſe of evil.</hi> But if they be dead, and ſwallowed up in the torments of Hell, think what a caſe thou art
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31347:26"/>
in, and how juſtly thou mayſt fear to follow them, if a <hi>great repentanee</hi> prevent it not.</p>
            <p>But this chiefly concerns thoſe who in a more ſpecial manner are entruſted with the Souls of others, whether <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Family governours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As for every <hi>faithful Miniſter</hi> of Chriſt, how exceeding careful ſhould they be for the Souls committed to their charge? How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding careful ſhould they be <hi>to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thoſe that hear them?</hi> And to <hi>keep themſelves</hi> (as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> ſays he did) <hi>pure from the blood of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true God hath made our <hi>Calling</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and honourable; but people would ſee little cauſe to envy us that <hi>double honour</hi> of <hi>reſpect</hi> and <hi>maintenance</hi> which the Apoſtle would have given 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. did they rightly conſider, how weighty our charge is, how dangerous our condition, how many and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult our duties, and how troubleſome our <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>cares</hi> touching the eſtate of their Souls.</p>
            <p>I know ſome may think, we take more care <hi>then needs;</hi> wiſhing we would meddle leſs with them in their ignorant, careleſs, and ſecure ways; which we could <hi>wiſh too,</hi> if it would conſiſt with Gods honour, the credit of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31347:27"/>
religion, and their and our own ſafely. But, I beſech you, conſider, if any of you was intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a <hi>Jewel</hi> of five or ten thouſand pound price, would you not ſee it needful to watch <hi>all ways</hi> and by <hi>all means</hi> to keep it ſafe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure? and if you had <hi>many ſuch</hi> in your cuſtody, would you not be the more ſollicitous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you ſaw they were in <hi>continual danger;</hi> and if further, you knew that if any of them ſhould be loſt by your default, you ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly loſe your life for it? But now, which is much more, we are entruſted with many, very many <hi>precious Souls,</hi> each of them more worth then a world; and they are, we ſee, in great and <hi>apparent danger</hi> to be ruined for ever, by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold errour and wickedneſs, and by innumerable temptations of the fleſh, the devil, and the world; and we know moreover, that if any of them periſh through <hi>our neglect,</hi> our <hi>own Souls</hi> may come to periſh with them, and for them; as was ſaid to him who had one to keep, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 39, 42. <hi>If thou let this man go, or be miſſing, thy life ſhall go for his life.</hi> Have we not then need to be watchful to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our power, and to be carefull all the ways we can, for their <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>preſervation?</hi> Conſider well <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27.<hi>—Ye know after what manner I have been
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31347:27"/>
with you at all ſeaſons, ſerving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations which befell me.—And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have ſhewed you, and have taught you, publickly and from houſe to houſe; Teſtifying both to the Jews and alſo to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſell of God:</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19, 20. 21. as alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 2, to 9. <hi>O ſon of man, I have ſet thee a watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael: therefore thou ſhalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I ſay unto the wicked, O wicked man thou ſhalt ſurely dye: If thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity: but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheleſs, if thou warn the wicked of his way, to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he ſhall die in his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; but thou haſt delivered thy Soul.</hi> If we be faithful, as every honeſt man ſhould be in his truſt, we may (you ſee) <hi>deliver our own Souls;</hi> but if we be negligent watchmen, there are theſe things (among many others) which will ſadly aggravate our condemnation.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:31347:28"/>
1. When admitted to <hi>places of imployment,</hi> we take upon us the <hi>cure of Souls</hi> for their edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we may attend this care the better, we <hi>receive a benefit piouſly given</hi> to free us from all <hi>other cares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In order to this (I mean, the care of Souls for their edification and Salvation) our Maſters and Tutors inſtructed us; and our parents <hi>devoted us</hi> to the ſervice of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To this too, we <hi>devoted</hi> and gave up our ſelves, profeſſing or hoping, that we were thereunto <hi>inwardly called</hi> and <hi>moved</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For this end we have alſo been <hi>outwardly called,</hi> or ſet apart by the Church for the <hi>work of the Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Moreover when ordained we did ſolemnly promiſe and engage this way to bend our ſtudies, and to uſe both <hi>publick and private monitions and exhortations,</hi> as well to the <hi>ſick,</hi> as to the <hi>whole</hi> within our <hi>cures,</hi> as need ſhould require and occaſion be given.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And which we may adde in the laſt place, we were then by the <hi>Biſhop ordaning,</hi> moſt gravely charged, and exhorted, in theſe words: <hi>Brethren, we exhort you in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you have in remembrance, in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31347:28"/>
how high a dignity, and to how weighty an office and charge ye are called: That is to ſay, to be meſſengers, watchmen, and ſtewards of the Lord; to teach and to premoniſh, to feed and to provide for the Lords family; to ſeek for Chriſts ſheep that are diſpreſed abroad, and for his Children who are in the midſt of this naughty world, that they may be ſaved through Chriſt for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Have alwaies therefore printed in your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance how great a treaſure is committed to your charge. For they are the ſheep of Chriſt, which he bought with his death, and for whom he ſhed his blood. The Church and Congregation whom you muſt ſerve, is his Spouſe and his Body. And if it ſhall happen, the ſame Church, or any member thereof, to take any hurt or hindrance by reaſon of your negligence, ye know the greatneſs of the fault, and alſo the horrible puniſhment that will enſue. Wherefore conſider with your ſelves the end of your Miniſtry towards the Children of God, towards the ſpouſe and body of Chriſt; and ſee that you never ceaſe your labour, your care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, untill you have done all that lieth in you, according to your bounden dutie, to bring all ſuch as are or ſhall be committed to your charge, unto that agreement in the faith and knowledge of God, and to that ripeneſs and perfectneſs of age in Chriſt, that there be no place left among you,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31347:29"/>
either for errour in religion, or viciouſneſs of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after all this, If we do <hi>our utmoſt</hi> for the Souls health of them committed to our charge; if we leave no good means thereof unattempted; If we ſhould labour for this <hi>night and day with tears,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays he did; If we ſhould never ſo often and earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to practice the fore going <hi>printed Directions</hi> put into your hands, and what ever Chriſtian duties our Saviour requires of us; If we ſhould follow you from the <hi>Church-houſe</hi> to your <hi>own houſes</hi> (if no better could be) with the moſt paſſionate intreaties, as for the life of our own Souls and yours; who could <hi>juſtly</hi> think us <hi>too importunate?</hi> who could <hi>reaſonably</hi> count us <hi>too earneſt</hi> or <hi>too buſie?</hi> who could <hi>juſtly blame</hi> us for making more a do then needs? for all this would be <hi>but enough</hi> as to ſome, and as to others it would be <hi>too little.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Parents and Family-governours,</hi> how carefully ſhould they look to it, leſt any <hi>under them</hi> ſhould periſh by <hi>their negligence</hi> or <hi>wickedneſs.</hi> Be aſſured Chriſt will erelong ſay to the, as <hi>Eliab to David, with whom haſt thou left thoſe few ſheep in the wilderneſs? what are become of thoſe precious Souls of thy Children or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31347:29"/>
Servants which I intruſted thee with?</hi> Nor will it be enough for thee only to anſwer, <hi>For my children, I brought them up without the charge of the Pariſh; I put them out to trades, or I left them competent eſtates or portions.

            <p>Oh the cry of a <hi>loſt Soul</hi> is a dreadful thing. Suppoſe any of <hi>thy Servants</hi> ſhould now be in hell <hi>curſing the time</hi> that ever they came into thy family, where they ſaw ſo much wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where there was no worſhiping of God, or means to come to the knowledge of him, whereupon they went on ſecurely in ſin, and are now ſwallowed up in the bottomleſs pit of deſtruction. Or ſuppoſe any of <hi>thy children</hi> following thy ſteps in wickedneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning Gods word and worſhip as they ſaw thee do, ſhould now be ſunk down to eternal miſery, there <hi>curſing the day</hi> that ever they were born of ſuch a Parent, or <hi>crying out againſt thee</hi> for neglecting them, for ſuffering them to ſwear, lye, and do evil without ſevere rebukes, for letting them prophane the Lords-day, for

neither inſtructing them thy ſelf, nor cauſing them to be inſtructed by others in the waies of God.</p>
            <p>Were this ſo, it might make the moſt <hi>flinty heart</hi> to <hi>ake</hi> and <hi>tremble.</hi> Therefore that it may never be ſo <hi>with thee,</hi> reſolve duly to promote godlineſs in thy family however thou ſtandeſt therein related. <hi>Dwell with thy wife as a man of knowledge, as heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindred,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7.

            <p>In all thy religious performances be very ſerious and ſincere, that they may ſee thou art in <hi>good earneſt</hi> about Soul-affairs, and matters of eternity. Oh be careful <hi>thus</hi> if it be poſſible, by thy <hi>pious exhortations,</hi> thy <hi>devout prayers,</hi> and <hi>thy exemplary behaviour</hi> to bring the Souls of all under thee, and near thee, unto Chriſt.

Is <hi>each ones</hi> Soul of ſo great worth, and the loſſe of it to <hi>them</hi> ſo dreadful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, as not to be recompenced with the gaining of the whole world? See then further how <hi>exceeding careful we ſhould every one of us be of our own Souls;</hi> and how we may not always count them the happieſt people, who have all worldly things here for a while that <hi>heart can

wiſh;</hi> but thoſe rather who are moſt careful of their precious Souls everlaſting happineſs in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Now if thou wouldſt underſtand, whether thou thy ſelf art herein <hi>rightly careful,</hi> or no; thou mayſt know it by looking to the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of thy <hi>converſion,</hi> or thy due care of <hi>believing ſuch truths, exerciſing ſuch graces, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſuch duties as God requires of all rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Chriſtians.</hi> And which thou mayſt find ſet down in the <hi>Directions, Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> of the foregoing Book, eſpecially from page 84 to page 93. As alſo in the <hi>prayers</hi> thereof, which teach us at once both <hi>what to ask,</hi> and <hi>what to do,</hi> and <hi>be,</hi> in order to the Souls eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare. For having ſuch prayers to uſe, we may ſtudy our petitions before, and ſo the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>our minds</hi> may keep pace with <hi>our words;</hi> and <hi>our affections</hi> go along with <hi>our ſenſe.</hi> Thus Gods Spirit aſſiſting, our devotion would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlivened; and our prayers become the <hi>rule</hi> of our <hi>converſation;</hi> &amp; when we ſwarve from them, they would make us bluſh into amendment.</p>
            <p>But more <hi>particularly,</hi> to know that thou art in <hi>good earneſt</hi> deſirous to ſave thy Soul.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Being Chriſt the Phyſician of Souls works not a cure upon <hi>one every whit whole,</hi> nor is prized by them that feel no need of him,

Haſt thou ſeen that this is not a ſtate to be reſted in, and therefore been ſolicitous after a better, carefully in effect asking like them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. <hi>what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>And again <hi>as thy Jeſus,</hi> doſt thou feel the <hi>power of his death killing ſin in thee?</hi> doth he by his bloodſhed not only <hi>pardon</hi> thy ſins, but alſo <hi>ſave</hi> and <hi>deliver thee</hi> from them? ſo that thou heartily ſtriveſt againſt all known ſin, and overcomeſt all groſſe ſins; and when fallen under any prevailing temptation, riſeſt again by repentance, begging forgiveneſs of God in his blood, and reſolving by his grace to watch and reſiſt more carefully for the time to come?

            <p>If <hi>this</hi> be <hi>thy condition</hi> thou <hi>rightly</hi> prizeſt thy Soul above the world, and provideſt for its welfare; but if it <hi>be not;</hi> oh how earneſtly ſhouldſt thou labour that it may <hi>ſpeedily be</hi> ſo!

            <p>Or may not the love of the world be <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier rooted</hi> hereafter, and the incumbrances of it <hi>hinder thee more,</hi> as it hath done too many before thee.

            <p>And if they live to be <hi>aged,</hi> though we would take never ſo much pains to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> them in the ways of Chriſt, they (ſome of them) think themſelves <hi>too old</hi> now to learn; and are too deep rooted in their own ſecure and ſenſual ways, to be drawn to forſake them, without little leſſe then a miracle.

            <p>Therefore, <hi>good Reader,</hi> be intreated not only to ſuffer others who are, or may be intruſted with the care of thy Soul, to be <hi>very ſolicitous</hi> for the welfare thereof; but be thou as careful too thy ſelf, reſolving as he did, who ſayd, <hi>volo ſervare animam meam, I will, O God, by all means ſave my Soul.</hi> Say with thy ſelf, and look up unto God for his grace and ſpirit to enable thee, to ſay it ſincerely; <hi>O Lord, I am ſenſible of the evil of my ways, and of my loſt condition without thee; and therefore with a penitent Soul I flee unto thee, truſting in thy mercy, and the merits of thy dear Son Jeſus Chriſt. I believe him making ſatisfaction to thy Juſtice for the ſins of the world, to be the only Saviour thereof; and thereupon, with the full conſent of my heart, I accept him for my Lord-Redeemer; to ſave me henceforth, as well from the power, as the guilt of my ſins. I am unfeignedly willing, that henceforth he ſhould rule in me, and reign over me by his word and ſpirit.

Thus, <hi>my beloved neighbours,</hi> you have ſeen the Souls <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>danger,</hi> and <hi>what care</hi> we ſhould have of its eternal ſalvation; to which end, you have nothing urged but ſuch ſolid and weighty <hi>truths</hi> and <hi>duties,</hi> as are <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally owned,</hi> and <hi>manifeſtly tend</hi> to make us <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>happy.</hi> And now, though I be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all troubleſome affairs, that I may thus <hi>wholly</hi> attend the <hi>welfare</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> of <hi>your Souls;</hi> and though my eternal life lies out, as indeed <hi>yours</hi> too, I can do no more then what I have been endeavouring, and am further, according to this printed gift, ready to do for you. The things herein contained, ſtill abide to be <hi>read</hi> and <hi>conſidered</hi> by you, as often as you pleaſe; but if any be <hi>unwilling</hi> thereunto, ſlighting and refuſing whatever may <hi>thus profit</hi> them, <hi>who can help it?</hi>

And now ſaith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his ſervant, to bring Jacob again to him.
