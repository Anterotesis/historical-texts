            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Author of this Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script too low to pass for an Evidence of the <hi>Facts</hi> mentioned by him. He knew nothing of the later part of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Choniates,</hi> relating to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </note>2. They pretend, and pretend with great Confidence, That nothing can justifie our Adherence to even unjustly deprived Bishops, if the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors be not Hereticks. That this is so, they appeal to an antient <hi>Greek</hi> MS. of Instances collected to their hands, before any prospect of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Case. They pretend from this Collection, that neither the Bishops <hi>themselves,</hi> who were unjustly deprived, made any <hi>Separation,</hi> nor any <hi>Subjects</hi> of such Bishops, on account of any obligation of <hi>Conscience</hi> to adhere to them. Hence they collect, that these things being the sense of the <hi>antient Church,</hi> as <hi>often</hi> as any such <hi>Instances</hi> appeared, ought also to be our sense who profess a Veneration for <hi>Antiquity.</hi> And were these things so as they pretend, they would perhaps be considerable to excuse the Practice of our present Adversaries: But all these things are justly questionable, and far from that <hi>Evidence</hi> which their <hi>Cause</hi> requires, and themselves pretend to: All they say is resolved into this MS. and this will do nothing for their purpose. The Author, whoever he was, is much too <hi>young,</hi> to be admitted as a <hi>Witness</hi> of most of the <hi>Facts</hi> enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by him; especially considering we have Authours of the earlier times to speak for themselves. Nay, he has not pretended to be a <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> on his <hi>own</hi> Credit: He has been particularly carefull to tell us his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49536:2"/>
Authors, most of which are extant to this very day. As therefore his Credit is nothing for things so much <hi>earlier</hi> than his own <hi>Age</hi>; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any need we should depend on his Credit, when we can have immediate recourse to his original Authors themselves. It is called an <hi>antient MS.</hi> and yet pretended no elder than the 13th Century. But sure the ingenious English Prefacer cannot think <hi>Antiquity</hi> of so <hi>low</hi> a date as that is, to be <hi>that Antiquity which</hi> we <hi>profess to imitate,</hi> or <hi>pretend to alleadge</hi>: Yet neither can he prove his Author a competent Witness even for that low Antiquity. All that appears from his quoting <hi>Nicetas Choniates,</hi> is onely this; That he could not be elder than that Century in which the Author lived who was quoted by him: But neither doth it thence follow, that he lived in the same Age; nor can it thence be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined how long he lived after him. This mention of <hi>Nicetas</hi> will bring him down below the Year 1205. where <hi>Nicetas</hi> ends his History. <hi>Nicetas</hi> himself lived some while after. But our Author refers to his History as an <hi>Authority,</hi> as being elder than the Traditions of the Age he lived in. He neither pretends to <hi>remember</hi> the things for which he quotes him, nor to have received any Informations concerning them from the relation of any <hi>old Men</hi> who could remember them. But where <hi>Nicetas</hi> fails him, he shews himself perfectly ignorant of the Affairs of that Age, which was concerned in the History written by <hi>Nicetas. Nicetas</hi> mentions no Successor in the See of <hi>Constantinople</hi> between <hi>Cosmas Atticus</hi> and <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius:</hi> Our Author therefore takes <hi>Theodosius</hi> for <hi>Cosmas</hi>'s immediate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor. <hi>Nicetas</hi> does not mention the <hi>Synods,</hi> nor the <hi>Abdications,</hi> that were in the Cases of the Patriarchs deposed in the time of <hi>Isaacius Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>; therefore our Author supposes there were none. <hi>Nicetas</hi> mentions the Opposition, but not the <hi>Schisms,</hi> that fell out in the two Settlements of <hi>Dositheus</hi>; therefore our Author takes it for granted that there were none, and reasons accordingly upon that Supposition. These things plainly shew, that our Author did not write within any near <hi>Memory</hi> of the History written by <hi>Nicetas</hi>; and therefore must be considerably later than the beginning even of the XIIIth Century.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will farther add to the Probability of this Observation, if it be considered, that our Author was a <hi>Constantinopolitane,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Which yet he must have known, as a publick Officer of the Church of <hi>Cp.</hi> if he had liv'd near him.</note> and in such a <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as that he could not have needed the Information of <hi>written Monuments</hi> for the Affairs of the Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> that had been within the reach of a <hi>near Tradition.</hi> This has already been observed by the <hi>English Prefacer,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and observed from hence, that our Author derives the <hi>Orders</hi> of the Church he was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for from former Bishops of <hi>Constantinople</hi>: But for this perhaps it might have been sufficient, that he had been of any part of the <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitane Jurisdiction,</hi> at least of a <hi>Church</hi> which owned the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for their more immediate <hi>Metropolitane</hi>; I therefore add another Argument that will not be so easily evaded. Our Author spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               </note> was made, as <hi>Anastasius Caesareensis</hi> assures us. And therefore there it was that it was ordered to be read every <hi>July</hi> annually. The <hi>Union</hi> it self particularly concerned breaches, which had been before between <hi>Constantinopolitane</hi> Patriarchs, and was therefore most proper to be read in the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Church. I add far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Author seems to have a constant fixed relation to that particular Church, as an <hi>Officer</hi> of it, and such and <hi>Officer</hi> as that it was his particular Duty to be conversant in the <hi>Histories</hi> belonging to it. The subject Matter of this Discourse is <hi>Historical:</hi> And the address of is not to <hi>Readers,</hi> but <hi>Auditors.</hi> This plainly shews that it was <hi>spoken</hi>: And of these <hi>spoken</hi> Historical Discourses we have many Instances in this very same <hi>Baroccian</hi> MS.

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49536:3"/>
whence he well infers, that those very Titles seem to have had some rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their very Faculty of being <hi>Historians.</hi> He observes farther, that there was a <hi>Rhetor</hi> appropriated to the service of <hi>particular Churches.</hi> Such was the <hi>Rhetor</hi> of <hi>Aenus,</hi> joyned with the <hi>Ecdicus</hi> or <hi>Defensor</hi> of the same Church. And it is indeed probable that all those <hi>Historians,</hi> who are called <hi>Rhetors</hi> and <hi>Sophists,</hi> were called so from their bearing that Office in some <hi>particular Church.</hi> He has observed farther, That in the Service of these Churches there were <hi>Bodies</hi> of these <hi>Rhetors,</hi> and among them <hi>one</hi> who <hi>presided</hi> over the rest, as <hi>Samuel</hi> over the <hi>Prophets,</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Magister,</hi> (as that Name was in those Ages applied to <hi>Presidents</hi> of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Offices also,) and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. These <hi>Ecclesiastical Rhetors</hi> seem to have been one part of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> that were maintained by the Revenues of the Foundation, mentioned frequently in the Imperial Constitutions, particularly designed for this purpose of studying <hi>Ecclesiastical History.</hi> The young Men therefore designed for this study, were obliged to be Auditors of the <hi>Principal Rhetor,</hi> who was a kind of a publick <hi>Professor</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical History.</hi> The use of this study for the Service of the Church, was to search into <hi>Precedents</hi> when any Act of publick Discipline required it, and very probably into <hi>Canons</hi> also, when the Case was resolvible by <hi>written Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</hi> Both are made use of in this Discourse, though the <hi>Editor</hi> has omitted all the <hi>Canons.</hi> Thus this <hi>Ecclesiastical History</hi> was consulted for both <hi>Laws,</hi> both the <hi>written</hi> ones and the <hi>unwritten</hi> ones, which were nothing else but <hi>allowed Practice.</hi> This Profession therefore being found so useful for the Service of the Church, care was taken that there might always be an Ecclesiastical <hi>Nursery,</hi> that might continually afford <hi>Candidates</hi> qualified to supply the <hi>Chair,</hi> as often as a vacancy should fall. That was by obliging the <hi>Master</hi> to a constant Duty in his Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for the Instruction of his young Students. And the Duty was either to take a received <hi>Historian,</hi> and to <hi>abbreviate</hi> him, or to collect a multitude of Instances in a particular <hi>Case</hi> when he was consulted, thereby to let the young Students understand the design of their Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Studies. But all was by word of <hi>Mouth</hi> and by way of <hi>Dictates,</hi> to be committed to writing by the Auditors themselves. This was the easiest way for multiplying Copies before Printing was invented: And withal it exercised the Abilities of the Writer, in teaching him to write truly. And indeed it seems to have been the general way of teaching. Thus the Authors taught in the ordinary Schools, are called <hi>Centum cirratorum dictata.</hi> And hence it is,<note place="margin">This Office very antient in the Church of <hi>Cp.</hi> perhaps from the first Foundation of it by <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Great.</note> that we have so many <hi>Homilies</hi> of the Fathers preserved in <hi>writing</hi> by their <hi>Pupils,</hi> when only <hi>spoken</hi> by themselves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <gap reason="foreign">

to the Persons of those whose <hi>Dictates</hi> we have in this same MS. <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> tells us himself, in his Preface to his <hi>History,</hi> That he had been bred up from a Boy in the Church of St. <hi>Sophia.</hi> This is the exact Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of those young Students, who were educated at the Charges of the Church for these Ecclesiastical Services, and who were withal the fairest Candidates for these <hi>Masterships,</hi> whenever they fell vacant, either by the Death, or the farther Promotion of those who possessed them. Then it was probably to be expected, that after many years Profession, they should draw up their Dictates into the form of a continued <hi>His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> as it is most likely all those <hi>Historians</hi> did, who are still known by the Names of <hi>Rhetors</hi> and <hi>Sophists.</hi> And it is very probable that <hi>Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s History was the last thing performed by him: He says himself he was in the 36<hi>th</hi> year of his Age when he began it, and yet that he was then but <hi>young,</hi> implying plainly, that he was <hi>old</hi> when he finished it, and wrote the Dedicatory Epistle to <hi>Andronicus.</hi> It is also probable that <hi>Photius,</hi> who was afterwards Patriarch, had been also his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor in this same Office, because his <hi>Excerpta</hi> out of <hi>Philostorgius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this same MS. are said also to have been <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That may, perhaps, give an account how these <hi>Excerpta</hi> of <hi>Photius</hi> came to be inserted among the Dictates of <hi>Nicephorus.</hi> It is not unlikely those larger <hi>Excerpta</hi> of <hi>Photius</hi> dictated from <hi>Philostorgius,</hi> had occasioned the loss of <hi>Philostorgius</hi> himself, and that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> was therefore necessitated to use those <hi>Excerpta</hi> for his own <hi>Text,</hi> which he was to dictate to his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils. The Office it self seems to have been far antienter than the time of <hi>Photius,</hi> as appears from the multitude of Rhetors and Sophists before him, that were Historians: For my part, I am apt to think it near as old as the Foundation of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great. Socrates</hi> the Historian himself has two Collections of Historical Precedents;<note place="margin">

This is the rather to be conjectured, because Digressions of that kind are not so usual in Histories antienter than this Custom. Withall <hi>Socrates</hi> assures us that <hi>Troilus</hi> had the Office of <hi>Rhetor,</hi> and that he was not the first,<note place="margin">

This was in the same Church we are mentioning, of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And <hi>Valesius</hi> has elsewhere observed the <hi>Habit</hi> proper to that <hi>Rhetor,</hi> answerable to those of our <hi>Academical Professors</hi>: See his Notes on <hi>Socr.</hi> L.VII. c. 12. It is

certain, long before that time there were <hi>Grammarians, Orators, Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Philosophers,</hi> maintained on the Publick for the use of <hi>Cities,</hi> and frequently mentioned in the Pandects, at least from the time of <hi>Marcus.</hi> Why should it therefore be thought strange, that even <hi>Constantine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self should make the like provision for Studies necessary for the Church, out of the <hi>Revenues</hi> himself was pleased to settle upon <hi>Churches?</hi> And the like provision we find in the Ecclesiastical Foundations. We have several Writers called <hi>Grammatici,</hi> no doubt because they were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structers of the Ecclesiastical Grammarians: Others we have, called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as presiding also over the Ecclesiastical Philosophers. It is perhaps a little more difficult to give an account of the use of this Phrase in this MS. upon occasion of producing a Passage of <hi>Hegesippus</hi> out of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> which is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But it is not probable that that Custome of the Ecclesiastical <hi>Rhetor</hi> was near so old as the time of <hi>Hegesippus.</hi> I am sure <hi>Eusebius,</hi> from whom <hi>Nicephorus</hi> took all he pretends concerning <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> gives him not the least occasion to think so. It is particularly certain, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> himself had that Passage, not from the <hi>Voice,</hi> but the <hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>Hegesippus.</hi> I therefore rather believe, that this Passage also of <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> was from the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> delivered by him in <hi>Dictates</hi> to his Pupils, as many other things in this same MS. are, out of <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s Ecclesiastical History; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perhaps there might be some particular occasion for <hi>dictating</hi> this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <hi>Hegesippus</hi> out of the ordinary course and method of his <hi>Readings.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. I am apt therefore to think, that the Author of this MS. was the <hi>Ecclesiastical Rhetor</hi> then in <hi>Office</hi> when the <hi>Schism</hi> happened that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it. Who that was, it is hard now to judge,<note place="margin">This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course seems to have been written by the <hi>Ecclesiastical Rhetor</hi> of the Church of <hi>Cp.</hi> then in <hi>Office</hi> when the Schism happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned it.</note> because we have no Catalogues extant of the <hi>Successors</hi> in that <hi>Office:</hi> And if we had any, it could hardly be guessed at till we can first gain some prospect of the <hi>time</hi> wherein it was written, which is the thing into which we are at present enquiring. And in order hereunto all that we can infer from this Office of the Author, is that he could not live within memory of the <hi>latter</hi> part of the History of <hi>Nicetas Choniates.</hi> I now add farther, that it seems also probable, that he did not live at any great distance from the memory of it. This I gather, because he ascribes the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Orders of his own Time to these five Successors in the time of <hi>Isaacius Angelus.</hi> He does not say so of the <hi>Ignatians</hi> and <hi>Photians,</hi> nor of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> and <hi>Euthymians,</hi> nor of any of those more <hi>distant</hi> Patriarchal Factions. That therefore he says it of these latest of his Examples, the Reason seems to be to let his <hi>Auditors</hi> thereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that he had now brought down his Succession of Precedents so near his <hi>own</hi> time, that the <hi>old</hi> Clergymen then living, though they could not remember those Patriarchs of the time of <hi>Isaacius</hi> themselves; yet they could at least remember, that the old Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves received their Orders, did <hi>remember</hi> them, and did withall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49536:5"/>
that they had received their <hi>Orders</hi> from them. This will bring our Author's time within a Century after those times of <hi>Isaacius Angelus.</hi> So the first remarkable <hi>Schism</hi> that fell within that distance, will most probably be the <hi>occasion</hi> of this Work, and the <hi>Ecclesiastical Rhetor</hi> then in <hi>Office</hi> the Author of it: But of this more hereafter.</p>

I confess, I was once of the mind that <hi>Nicephorus Callistus</hi> was the Author of it: My reason was, that which is mentioned by Mr. <hi>Hody,</hi> that his <hi>Name</hi> is made use of in most of the Works contained in this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, either in the <hi>Titles,</hi> or in the <hi>Tables</hi>; and that both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> this of which we are at present discoursing. This made me think, that the whole Volume was intended for a <hi>Collection</hi> of Pieces wherein he was some way concerned, and that his <hi>Name</hi> was <hi>intended</hi> for the <hi>Title</hi> here, if the Illuminator had performed his Office, in adding a Title to it: But upon more thorough consideration I have, I confess, altered my Opinion. I observe this Tract is in a hand extremely different from the other hands of the whole Volume: It is withall contrived within a quire proper to itself, and the latter end in a little smaller hand, that it might come within that compass. Thence it appears, that it was written <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly,</hi> not to be connected with a following Vacancy, where there might have been room for what remained; but to be bound up with other things already written. Accordingly what follows begins abruptly, as if the former quire had been purposely left out, to make room for this insertion: These are Tokens, that it was not at first designed as a part of this particular Collection. Then it begins so near the top of the Page, that one would suspect no <hi>Title</hi> was intended, but that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Name was purposely omitted. And indeed no Author's Name seems to have been mentioned in the Copies from whence <hi>Cotelerius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have published it.<note place="margin">Coteler. <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are also several other Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences: Our Author calls the first of the Patriarchs deposed by <hi>Anasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Dicorus Euthymius,</hi> and that as often as he mentions him, both in the <hi>Tract</hi> itself, and the <hi>Summary,</hi> as several others had done before him. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> calls him rightly <hi>Euphemius,</hi>

It must appear farther, secondly, That they thought him <hi>inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly</hi> deprived as well as <hi>unjustly</hi>: That they know very well is <hi>Our</hi> Sense of the present Case, on <hi>which</hi> we lay the Stress of our Cause; not onely that our Bishops are deprived for what our <hi>Laws,</hi> in the true sense of the <hi>Legislators,</hi> did never intend should be a <hi>Crime</hi>; but also that they are deprived by a <hi>Power</hi> that can no way pretend to a <hi>Right of Spiritual Deprivation</hi>; that is, purely by a <hi>Lay-power,</hi> without the least pretence of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Censures. This therefore they ought to prove, That, even in Case of a purely <hi>Lay-deprivation,</hi> those <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches did not think fit to assert their <hi>Spiritual Liberties,</hi> against the <hi>Encroachments</hi> of the <hi>Secular Magistrate.</hi> But that seems more than ever their <hi>Author</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, I believe than his Cause required.

We do no more say than he, that the <hi>Injustice</hi> of a Sentence does <hi>null</hi> or <hi>invalidate</hi> it, when otherwise the <hi>Authority</hi> by which it is pronounced is <hi>valid</hi> and <hi>obliging.</hi> Nor do we say, that <hi>Subjects</hi> are, even in <hi>Conscience,</hi> free to adhere to their <hi>Bishop,</hi> when the <hi>Authority</hi> by which he is deprived, has not onely a <hi>Right</hi> to conclude <hi>them,</hi> but to conclude <hi>him</hi> also: Yet all this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Liberty allowed by <hi>this Author,</hi> of withdrawing Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from an <hi>Heretick.</hi> The Reason is this, because even the Canons of the Church, to go no farther now, allow <hi>Subjects</hi> this Liberty to judge of

their Bishop's <hi>Faith,</hi> by a private Judgment of <hi>Discretion,</hi> and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their own particular Act of Communicating, as has been shewn by their own Author himself, in the latter part of his Tract, <hi>ommitted</hi> by Mr. <hi>Hody.</hi>

This is the actual Case of our present Bishops; and of this also their whole Collection does not afford one single Example: Yet this is the onely Case wherein her not adhering to him can, by any Art of equal Interpretation, be taken to signifie, that she did not think such Adherence his <hi>due,</hi> even in regard to <hi>Conscience</hi>; otherwise the <hi>Non-payment</hi> of Debts alone, does by no means imply a belief that they are not <hi>due.</hi> It is certain, the Person to whom they are <hi>due</hi> may remit them, if he please; and his <hi>not challenging</hi> them is often taken for an Argument, that he does <hi>remit</hi> them, at least that he does not challenge Payment <hi>now</hi>: It is therefore no more an Argument in such a Case, that the <hi>Church</hi> does not <hi>think</hi> such a <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Adherence</hi> to such a Bishop really due, than that the Bishop himself does not think it so: For it is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent in <hi>them,</hi> with an acknowledgment of <hi>Right,</hi> to defer the Payment till it be demanded, as it is consistent with the <hi>Bishop's</hi> owning it for his <hi>Right,</hi> that he does not as <hi>yet</hi> think fit to demand it. But our <hi>Author</hi> pretends, that by his Collection of Instances it appears, no <hi>Bishop</hi> ever <hi>challenged</hi> his <hi>Right,</hi> if the Person substituted in his own place were not an <hi>Heretick.</hi> So indeed he says; but thence it does by no means follow, that they <hi>had</hi> no <hi>Right,</hi> because they did not <hi>challenge</hi> it: Nor can it be thence gathered, but that it may be <hi>prudent,</hi> as well as <hi>just,</hi> for <hi>Successors</hi> to <hi>insist</hi> on their <hi>Right,</hi> though <hi>Predecessors,</hi> who thought it <hi>just,</hi> did yet not think it <hi>prudent</hi> to insist on theirs. The Change of Circumstances may make so great a Variety in the Case it self. If it be only a <hi>Personal Injury,</hi> the Mischief the <hi>Church</hi> may suffer by the Person's <hi>defending</hi> his <hi>Right,</hi> may be more than what she may suffer by permitting a <hi>single Act</hi> of <hi>Injustice</hi> to go unredressed: But in our Case, our Adversaries very well know the <hi>Injury</hi> is more than <hi>personal.</hi> They know the old Doctrines of our <hi>Church</hi> are involved in the <hi>Injustice</hi> that is offered them: They may also know, that this <hi>New Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Validity</hi> of <hi>Lay deprivations</hi> with regard to <hi>Spirituals,</hi> is of intolerable mischievous consequence, as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Laity <hi>Principles,</hi> by which they may ruine us when they please; and that this pernicious Doctrine cannot well be opposed in this Case, but by our Bishops <hi>insisting</hi> on their <hi>Rights.</hi> And they cannot shew but when Doctrines of such consequence were concerned, the <hi>Bishops</hi> not onely <hi>did,</hi> but were also <hi>commended</hi> for <hi>insisting</hi> on their <hi>Rights.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed where such <hi>Doctrines</hi> were concerned, the <hi>Antients</hi> would have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the Adversaries <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and in that case this <hi>Author himself</hi> allows, that <hi>Bishops</hi> may <hi>judge</hi> it to be for the <hi>publick</hi> Good of the <hi>Church,</hi> that they <hi>challenge</hi> their <hi>private Rights.</hi> Yet after all our <hi>Author's</hi> Pretensions in his <hi>Title,</hi> his Examples give a small account of the Sense of the injured Bishops <hi>themselves</hi> concerning their own Case, but principally pretend to tell us what <hi>others</hi> thought concerning it.

And it is certain, that in this <hi>lower</hi> Antiquity, wherein this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> principally deals, the <hi>Generality</hi> of Christians were both <hi>ignorant</hi> enough in true <hi>Originals</hi> of our Religion, to be <hi>mistaken</hi> concerning their Duty; and withal <hi>wicked</hi> enough to be <hi>seduced</hi> from the <hi>Practice</hi> of it, though they had never so throughly understood it. So easie it was for what was done, not to have been done by <hi>Principles,</hi> though it had been determined by the <hi>greater</hi> number of <hi>Suffrages.</hi> Who knows not that in great Bodies the <hi>ignorant</hi> and the <hi>wicked</hi> have generally the greatest <hi>number</hi> of Suffrages, who notwithstanding cannot be presumed to doe what they doe by any solid <hi>Principles</hi>? Yet who withall knows not how <hi>few</hi> are many times concerned in the Motions of whole <hi>Bodies</hi>; and how far what they do is, upon that account, from being imputable to a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority</hi> of <hi>Suffrages?</hi> I do not now insist on the greater Numbers, who are in <hi>Duty</hi> obliged rather to <hi>follow</hi> the Conduct of others, than to shew their Opinion distinct from that of their <hi>Conductors</hi>: Even Spiritual <hi>Guides,</hi> and those in Spiritual <hi>Authority,</hi> are not for the <hi>greatest</hi> part the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>wisest</hi>; and yet the Nature of Societies requires, that the <hi>fewest
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49536:7"/>
able</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Men should be determined by the <hi>Majority</hi>; that is, that they who are the most likely to <hi>know</hi> Principles, and to be <hi>influenced</hi> by them, should be concluded by those who are <hi>least skilfull</hi> in Principles, and are withall least presumable to <hi>act</hi> by Principles. And in that case who can presume, that the <hi>Actings</hi> of such <hi>Bodies</hi> are agreeable to the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of the <hi>Actors themselves?</hi> Especially who can presume it then, when the Cases of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Insincerity</hi> are most frequent, as they were most certainly in many of the Instances here amassed at a great <hi>distance</hi> from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and in great <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Originals</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>; and when withall <hi>worldly Prosperity</hi> had taken them off from <hi>regarding</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or being <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>suffer</hi> for them. The very least <hi>signification</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> where they are not <hi>expresly</hi> owned, is that good Men are <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> and <hi>satisfied</hi> with what they <hi>doe.</hi> But as this Reasoning does onely hold in Men who are otherwise known to be <hi>good,</hi> so from Matters of <hi>Fact</hi> alone none can gather, whether the <hi>Actors</hi> be secretly <hi>pleased</hi> with what they <hi>doe,</hi> or whether they be not really <hi>ashamed</hi> of it.</p>

In either Case it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to gather, that pure regard to <hi>Conscience</hi> was the true Reason of such <hi>Omissions:</hi> That is, that when any <hi>injured Bishops</hi> did not insist on their Rights, the Reason was, that they thought themselves <hi>obliged</hi> in <hi>Conscience not</hi> to insist on them, as being chargable with the <hi>Schism,</hi> which would follow from the Intruders maintaining their <hi>Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> against them. And that when Subjects did <hi>not</hi> second them in the Assertion of their own Rights, the true Reason was, that such Subjects also did not <hi>think</hi> themselves <hi>obliged</hi> to second them, even in <hi>Conscience.</hi> Many other Reasons might have been given in both Cases, besides this of <hi>Conscience,</hi> which our Adversaries are concerned that it should have been the only Reason: Many, which will by no means reach our present Case, to prove either that our <hi>present</hi> Bishops are <hi>obliged</hi> in <hi>Conscience</hi> by those <hi>Precedents not</hi> to <hi>challenge</hi> their Rights; or that we are <hi>not obliged,</hi> on their callenging them, to <hi>maintain</hi> them in them. One Reason might have been the <hi>

Novatian</hi> could never be a Bishop of that <hi>same District</hi> without the <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>Cession,</hi> or <hi>Deprivation</hi> of <hi>Cornelius</hi>; and that supposing him no Bishop of <hi>that place</hi> to which he was consecrated, he could be no <hi>Bishop</hi> at all.

Just as in ordinary <hi>Excommunications,</hi> they also always supposed, that he who was by any Act of <hi>obliging Authority</hi> deprived of his <hi>Right</hi> to his own <hi>particular Church,</hi> had also lost his <hi>Right</hi> thereby to all the <hi>particular</hi> Churches in the World. And they also supposed <hi>Novatian</hi> to have cast himself <hi>out</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> Body, by assuming to himself the name of a <hi>Head</hi> of that <hi>Body,</hi> which already had a <hi>Head,</hi> and could have no more than <hi>one.</hi> And these <hi>Notions,</hi> and this <hi>Language</hi> of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> were supposed and owned <hi>universally</hi> by the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Bishops</hi> of his Time, when they acted conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to them, and took them for the Measures, by which they either <hi>granted,</hi> or <hi>refused</hi> their <hi>own Communion.</hi> Nor is it to be thought strange, that these Notions should be <hi>received,</hi> and received <hi>universally,</hi> not as the <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> of <hi>private Persons,</hi> but as the <hi>publick Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Communion,</hi> as practiced, not only in <hi>that</hi> early Age of St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> but as derived from the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, and the very first <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi>: For these were not, as <hi>private Opinions</hi> usually were, only the result of <hi>private Reasonings</hi>; they were received as the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which were not as <hi>new Revelations</hi> generally were from the like Notions received among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and among them recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not as <hi>private Opinions,</hi> but as <hi>publick Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental</hi> to the then practised <hi>Sacrifical Communion</hi> of the then <hi>peculiar People,</hi> and only <hi>thence</hi> deduced (as other things also are, in the <hi>Reasonings</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi>) to the Case of the new <hi>Mystical Peculium,</hi> and their new <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Sacrifices.</hi> The Language of erecting <hi>Altar</hi> against <hi>Altar</hi> in St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> is derived from the like earlier Language received among the <hi>Jews,</hi> concerning the <hi>Samaritan Altar</hi> of <hi>Manasses,</hi> against the <hi>Jerusalem Altar</hi> of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> that is of a <hi>High Priest</hi> against a <hi>High Priest,</hi> when God had appointed but <hi>one</hi> High Priest in the whole World, and <hi>Him</hi> only at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And it is also plain, that the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> did look on such <hi>Schismatical High Priests,</hi> and all their <hi>Communicants,</hi> as cut off from

And when that Doctrine was thus condemned by the <hi>Church,</hi> and was notwithstanding maintained by the <hi>Donatists</hi> as a <hi>Principle</hi> on which they subsisted as an <hi>opposite Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> it then became a <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Party</hi> to maintain it, and from that time forward the <hi>Donatists</hi> were reckoned among <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as well as <hi>Schismaticks:</hi> For this was the true Notion of <hi>Heresie</hi> in those Ages, as contradistinct from <hi>Schism:</hi> Both of them supposed a <hi>Division of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>

I know very well, Men have hitherto considered the <hi>Church</hi> rather as a <hi>Sect,</hi> than as a <hi>Society</hi>; and have therefore usually had no regard to the <hi>Doctrines Fundamental</hi> to it as a <hi>Society,</hi> if they did not withal concern it as a <hi>Sect,</hi> and <hi>Antecedently</hi> to its being a <hi>Society.</hi> But there seems very little Reason for their doing so, if they will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed impartially to reflect on it. It is very true, its Notion as a <hi>Sect</hi> is <hi>antecedent</hi> to its being a <hi>Society,</hi> because it is a <hi>Society</hi> into which Men find themselves obliged to enter by the <hi>Doctrines</hi> they must be supposed to believe, if they own it as a <hi>Sect.</hi> But even thence it appears, that the <hi>Doctrines</hi> which concern it as a <hi>Sect,</hi> do withal make it <hi>necessary</hi> it should be a <hi>Society.</hi> These two Considerations therefore are by no means to be separated. Nay it hence appears, that the <hi>Doctrines</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting it as a <hi>Sect,</hi> do also by a near, and unavoidable, and evident <hi>Consequence,</hi> make it a <hi>Society.</hi> Thus therefore the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of its being a <hi>Society,</hi> will be included in that <hi>System</hi> of <hi>Doctrines</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it as a <hi>Sect.</hi> And then what Matter is it that <hi>one</hi> of these <hi>Notions</hi> is <hi>antecedent</hi> and the <hi>other consequent</hi>? Thus much at least will follow, that there is no <hi>subverting</hi> it as a <hi>Society,</hi> without <hi>subverting</hi> it also as a <hi>Sect</hi>; because those very <hi>Doctrines</hi> which make it a <hi>Sect,</hi> do also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently oblige it to be a <hi>Society.</hi> For my part I believe those <hi>Doctrines</hi>

The <hi>second Schism</hi> therefore is that which is to our purpose; and it was thus: <hi>Theodorus Lascaris</hi> had left a young Son behind him, called <hi>John:</hi> Of him, by that time he came to be <hi>ten</hi> Years of age, <hi>Michael</hi> began to be jealous, and to secure himself puts out his <hi>Eyes.</hi> This the then Patriarch, <hi>Arsenius</hi> was very much displeased at, and excommunicated him for it. The Emperour bore it for a <hi>while,</hi> and wore a <hi>penitential</hi> Habit, hoping within a while to be restored: But finding at length no hopes of it, this made a Grudge between him and the Patriarch; so that the Emperour was resolved to lay him by. What then? Does he deprive him by his secular Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? No such matter. <hi>Gregoras</hi> observes, that <note n="*" place="margin">

This obliged <hi>Joseph</hi> again to recede, both for Peace sake, and because indeed he was by this time superannuated for his Charge: Thus he left the two Parties engaged, and soon after dyes himself. The new Emperour <hi>Andronicus</hi> did not think fit to let the Throne lie vacant at so dangerous a time as the beginning of a new Reign; he therefore pitches on <hi>Georgius Cyprius,</hi> an eloquent and learned Man, and fit for the Place, and immediately invests him with what he could give him, the <hi>Crosier,</hi> or <hi>Pastoral Staff,</hi> according to the Custome then generally received for some Ages, both in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West.</hi> This enabled him to perform those Patriarchal Offices onely which required not <hi>Priesthood,</hi> as <hi>Gregoras</hi> expresly observes; so carefull they were then of avoiding these present Invasions on that sacred Function. The Reason he deferred his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration for a time, was purposely that he might get him consecrated by Persons no way concerned in the <hi>Schism</hi> between the <hi>Arsenians</hi> and <hi>Josephians,</hi> nor in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> attempted by his Father in the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> as wisely foreseeing that it would make the whole Consecration questionable, in a Time when that whole Design was so unpopular and abominated; and a short time afforded him Persons fit for his purpose. Within a while the Bishop of <hi>Mozula</hi> came on an Embassy from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Despote of <hi>Aetolia,</hi> and a little after him another Bishop of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi> in <hi>Macedon,</hi> upon another occasion. These, I suppose, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free from any Contagion of <hi>Latine</hi> Communion, or of the <hi>Schism,</hi> because they had not been liable to his Father's Jurisdiction: But he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather on the Bishop of <hi>Mozula,</hi> as being a Suffragan of <hi>Constantinople</hi>; for <hi>Mozula</hi> was subject to <hi>Naupactus, Naupactus</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Debra</hi> was under <hi>Justiniana prima,</hi> exempted by <hi>Justinian</hi>: Him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Andronicus</hi> prevails on, first to consecrate a Monk, called <hi>Germanus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Heraclia,</hi> whose antient Right it was to preside in the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the <hi>Patriarch</hi>; then with the Bishop of <hi>Debra</hi> to assist the so

consecrated Bishop of <hi>Heraclia</hi> in the following Office, when there should be need of them. This being done, they then proceed to the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Georgius</hi> or <hi>Gregorius,</hi> for the modern <hi>Greeks</hi> especially do often confound those two Names; and being onely a <hi>Reader</hi> before, they first <hi>ordain</hi> him <hi>Deacon,</hi> then <hi>Presbyter,</hi> before they all joined in making him <hi>Patriarch.</hi> Thus all the Caution was used that could be, to prevent the <hi>Schism</hi> that might follow, if his Consecration had been exceptionable in the Opinions then received; and all was no more than necessary, as did afterwards appear. This did not hinder but that his former Familiarity with <hi>Becus,</hi> and <hi>Metochita,</hi> and <hi>Meliteniota,</hi> was objected to him; and even that inferior Order of <hi>Reader,</hi> which he did not receive then, he was said to have received from <hi>Latinizers.</hi> How <hi>true</hi> these Objections were is not material to our present Design: This at least appears, how <hi>prone</hi> they were <hi>then</hi> to make them, and how little occasions served for those who were so predisposed to receive them. The Patriarch thus made, Endeavours then were used to reconcile the <hi>Arseniatae</hi> and the <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephiatae:</hi> Accordingly an Expedient was thought of suitable to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of the Age, and the Tales formerly invented by the Legenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. On the <hi>great Sabbath,</hi> that is the <hi>Saturday</hi> before <hi>Easter,</hi> two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels were received, each containing the Sense of the Party that deliver'd it; one of the <hi>Followers</hi> of <hi>Arsenius,</hi> the other of those of <hi>Joseph.</hi> These they cast into a Fire prepared for the purpose, expecting (according to the Fancies of our <hi>Saxon Ancestors</hi> concerning their <hi>fiery Ordeal</hi>) that the Libel which was more pleasing to God should escape untouch'd: But the <hi>Event</hi> was, that the <hi>Fire</hi> destroyed them both, and the Controversie still remained unresolved, whether was in the right. However it was thus interpreted, that the making Parties was generally displeasing. This sufficed at <hi>present</hi> to <hi>unite</hi> them among themselves, and with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Patriarch.</hi> And to sweeten the <hi>Arseniatae</hi> the more, it was granted them, that the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Arsenius</hi> should be honourably received into the City with a solemn Procession. The <hi>Easter</hi> that this <hi>

No doubt the <hi>Arsenians</hi> also had this Example before them, when they procured the Two <hi>Translations</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of their Patron; the first from the place where he dyed to the Monastery of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> in the City, in the beginning of this Reign of <hi>Andronicus</hi>; then from the Monastery to the Church of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> in the later Concordate made by the Patriarch <hi>Nipho</hi> of <hi>Cyzicus,</hi> in the year 1315.

               </note> The Heresie then in view, in the sense of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was no doubt the Doctrine of the <hi>Latines,</hi> which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Heresie,</hi> and with which they had been allarmed since the pretended <hi>

I cannot think these <hi>Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were made precariously, but in prospect of a Cause then in <hi>view,</hi> that might have suffered by the Consequence of this Concession, that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> at least would justifie Separation, if these Limitations had not been interposed: And I can think of no Cause so likely as that of <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who was now made <hi>Patriarch.</hi> We find by <hi>Gregoras,</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Care that was used that his Consecration might have no Ingredient of any Authority derived either from <hi>Latines,</hi> or <hi>Latinizing Greeks,</hi> yet he lay under some <hi>suspition</hi> of that very Charge, which was then so very odious.

to it; so far, that even after <hi>Arsenius</hi> was deposed, he never was at ease in his own <hi>Conscience,</hi> till he was <hi>absolved</hi> from those <hi>Censures</hi> by another Patriarch; that he scrupled the Validity of an Absolution from <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> because of his <hi>Translation</hi> from another See, and was thereupon very desirous underhand, as <hi>Pachymeres</hi> informs us, to oblige him to <hi>resign</hi>; that when that <hi>Resignation</hi> was made, he then rested not till he had the Absolution solemnly pronounced by the Patriarch <hi>Joseph,</hi> after a publick and solemn Acknowledgment of the <hi>Crimes</hi> by which he had incurred those <hi>Censures,</hi> in the Face of the Church.

So it appears from the Canons of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and of the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> here produced by him, which use this very Expression of <hi>Erecting Altar against Altar.</hi> And it is notorious, that all who have used this Phrase, have ever inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Case of setting up a <hi>Bishop</hi> against a <hi>Bishop</hi> within the <hi>same</hi> Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: The very first occasion of using it was taken from a Case ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly parallel among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that of setting up a <hi>High Priest</hi> against another <hi>High Priest,</hi> within the same <hi>Peculium.</hi> So also by the Doctrine of the same <hi>Canons</hi> produced here, it is <hi>schismatical</hi> to <hi>omit</hi> mentioning the Bishop's <hi>Name</hi> in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Diptychs:</hi> The Design of those <hi>Commemorations</hi> in the <hi>Diptychs,</hi> was plainly to own them as <hi>Bishops</hi> of those particular <hi>Districts.</hi> Thus <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> argues against <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> that the receiving St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s Name again into the <hi>Diptychs,</hi> would be an owning him a <hi>Bishop,</hi> who had been <hi>deprived</hi> of his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and consequently a <hi>reversing</hi> the Sentence of <hi>Deprivation</hi> that had been pronounced against him. Thus it appears, that it was the same thing to receive a Bishop's <hi>Name</hi> into the <hi>Diptychs</hi> of a particular <hi>Diocese,</hi> as to own him for a Bishop of that <hi>Diocese</hi>; and to leave his <hi>Name out</hi> of the <hi>Diptychs</hi> of a particular Diocese, was also the same thing as thence-forward to <hi>disown</hi> his <hi>Episcopal Relation</hi> to that particular Diocese. And accordingly with <hi>us,</hi> who have not <hi>now</hi> that Custome of Ecclesiastical Diptychs, owning Men for Bishops of such Dioceses, is the same thing as receiving their Names into the Diptychs, and <hi>disowning</hi> them for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of those Dioceses, will also be the same as <hi>excluding</hi> them out of the Diocesan Diptychs. Particularly the Case of those <hi>Clergy</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Dioceses will fall under the purview of that Canon, who omit the deprived Bishops, and mention the <hi>Intruders,</hi> in those <hi>Prayers</hi> where it is customary to mention their <hi>diocesane Ordinary.</hi> And now what can our <hi>Titulars</hi> say for themselves, upon the <hi>Principles</hi> of this their so cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Author? Do they <hi>own</hi> the deprived Bishops to have still a <hi>Title</hi> in <hi>Conscience</hi> to their Dioceses?

               </gap>, the <hi>Ratification</hi> of what is to be done in such Assemblies, to be the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>Metropolitane</hi>; yet this they <hi>did,</hi> before they could pretend so much as a <hi>Lay</hi>-Deprivation. They have since proceeded farther, and made new <hi>schismatical Bishops,</hi> not onely without his <hi>Leave,</hi> but against his <hi>Will</hi>: This is also expresly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon, which allows not even a <hi>Majority</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod to doe it, without the <hi>Metropolitane</hi>'s Consent for one,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49536:22"/>
though the Bishop so made had <hi>not</hi> been <hi>schismatical.</hi> Yet they have not stopped here; they have presumed to set up his own <hi>Dean</hi> against him, <hi>they</hi> who have sacredly promised Subjection to him as his <hi>Suffragans; him</hi> who was under the same <hi>canonical Obligations</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> too, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Member of his Diocese. And I need not tell him how scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous this Case of breaking <hi>Faith</hi> was in the antient Cases of <hi>Arsacius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Flavianus</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> not onely to discredit their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> but to justifie a <hi>Separation</hi> from them; though I do not think that Case alone sufficient to justifie it where the <hi>Scandal</hi> was not injurious to a better <hi>Right,</hi> than that of him who was in possession: But in the Case before us I cannot imagine what they can pretend to avoid this Canon. I do not urge these Canons, as <hi>Laws particularly</hi> obliging <hi>us,</hi> by whom they were never <hi>particularly</hi> and <hi>explicitly</hi> received: Yet if I did urge them as <hi>obliging</hi> without <hi>explicite</hi> Reception, perhaps the particular <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness</hi> of the Canons themselves would bear me out in it. The <hi>Law of Nations</hi> obliges all particular <hi>civil Nations,</hi> though it be not taken into their Codes of <hi>written Laws,</hi> and therefore not ratified by <hi>express</hi> Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of the <hi>Things</hi> themselves, and their <hi>Necessity</hi> for Maintaining Correspondence, are alone sufficient to oblige all <hi>Nations</hi> who will correspond with others, and correspond <hi>justly.</hi> So the Case is here: The securing Subordinations already received and settled, are so much the Interests of <hi>all</hi> Churches, and these <hi>Expedients</hi> are so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly necessary for maintaining those Subordinations, that they do as little need <hi>explicite reception</hi> to make them obligatory in <hi>particular Churches,</hi> as the <hi>Laws of Nations</hi> do to make them also obligatory to <hi>particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> For my present Design it's sufficient that these Canons do at least express the Sense of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church, and of this Collector, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces and owns them as Authorities. Hence at least it follows, that <hi>that</hi> Church and <hi>this</hi> Collector owned no <hi>Validity</hi> in Deprivations of Bishops that were not <hi>synodical,</hi> when without this they account all refusals of Duty <hi>schismatical,</hi> whatever <hi>other</hi> Deprivations could be pretended in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of such Refusals. How was it then possible for this <hi>Collector</hi> to plead <hi>Precedents</hi> for even <hi>excusing</hi> Duty on such <hi>Deprivations,</hi> which he did not think <hi>sufficient</hi> to excuse them? How could he call <hi>Facts</hi> of this kind <hi>Precedents,</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> from them to a <hi>Church</hi> which had by her Rules and Canons so expresly <hi>condemned them</hi>?</p>
            <p n="10">10. But Mr. <hi>Hody</hi> did not think this <hi>latter</hi> part,<note place="margin">This unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd <hi>Appendiz</hi> asserted to the Author.</note> where the Canons are, to belong to the Discourse published by him: Nor will I charge him with any <hi>designed</hi> Disingenuity in suppressing them, though they make so manifestly against the <hi>Cause</hi> espoused by him. I onely desire that his Omission may not prejudice them who shall be pleased again to consult the MS. The Thing it self gives no occasion that I can see for suspecting it to belong to any other Author.

different from those which are either before or after: It follows also without any new Title, without any <hi>Footsteps</hi> of any that had once been legible, but now defaced, and grown illegible; without any the least convenient <hi>distance</hi> left for a <hi>Title,</hi> if the Author had intended one. But these things are not unusual with the unskilfull Librarians, where notwithstanding the Works themselves so injudicially connected are very different. I grant it, nor would I insist on these things, if there were any great Evidence in the <hi>Matter</hi> itself to the contrary; but unless we will allow our selves a liberty of breaking off arbitrarily and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, and leaving out whatever displeases us in Manuscripts, we must at least allow these things to pass for <hi>Presumptions,</hi> where there is no <hi>contrary</hi> Evidence: And that is all that need be granted us in this matter. The subject <hi>Matter</hi> of this <hi>Appendix</hi> is so far from affording Arguments for suspecting it as part of <hi>another</hi> Work, that it adds rather farther <hi>Evidence,</hi> that it was really from the same <hi>Author,</hi> and with the same <hi>Design.</hi> The <hi>Canons</hi> are to the same purpose of opposing the <hi>Schisms</hi> now mentioned, as well as the <hi>Historical Precedents</hi>: Both of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do clear the sense of the <hi>Church,</hi> as well from her <hi>written</hi> Laws in <hi>Words,</hi> as from her <hi>unwritten</hi> ones of <hi>Custome</hi> and matter of <hi>Fact.</hi> And what could be more proper than to join these two together? Indeed the <hi>Facts</hi> alone would not be so argumentative, without the <hi>Canons</hi>; for they are not <hi>bare</hi> Facts, but <hi>approved</hi> Facts, that are fit to be admitted as <hi>Precedents.</hi> And what <hi>Facts</hi> are <hi>approved</hi> by the Church, we can most securely judge by their conformity to her <hi>written Laws.</hi> Besides, this was the Custome of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Rhetors,</hi> to give in their Evidences of both kinds concerning the Questions wherein they were consulted: So <hi>Troilus</hi> the <hi>Sophist</hi> mentions a <hi>Canon</hi> as well as <hi>Examples,</hi> relating to the Case of <hi>Translations,</hi> if he were the Author of that <hi>Collection,</hi> made use of by his Disciple <hi>Socrates,</hi> as I believe he was. So here in the same MS. in the <hi>Collection</hi> fitted to the Case of <hi>Germanus</hi> of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> intruded into the Throne of <hi>Arsenius,</hi> besides the Collection of <hi>Troilus,</hi> there are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many more Instances, and express Testimonies, out of the <hi>Decretals</hi> of the Popes, <hi>Callistus</hi> and <hi>Anteros,</hi> which in the Discipline of that Age were equivalent to Canons. It should seem that, during the time the <hi>Latines</hi> possessed <hi>Constantinople,</hi> some <hi>Latinizing Greek</hi> translated <hi>Isidore Mercator</hi>'s Forgeries, which from that time were taken for <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> as they had formerly been in the <hi>Latine.</hi> This is, I think, the first time we find them mentioned by the <hi>Greeks</hi>: We do not find that their Canonists, who wrote a little before, ever take any notice of them; not <hi>Zonaras,</hi> nor <hi>Alexius Aristenus,</hi> nor <hi>Balsamon</hi>; yet <hi>Balsamon</hi> does mention the Donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> which I believe was translated from the same Collection of <hi>Isidore</hi>'s Forgeries, a sign that even <hi>then</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> began to look into them. But methinks the <hi>latter end</hi> of the Canons of our <hi>Appendix</hi> should put this Matter out of doubt: There it is explained
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49536:23"/>
and <hi>limited</hi> what had been so often inculcated in the former Discourse, concerning the Liberty which had been allowed of <hi>Separating</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Case of <hi>Heresie.</hi> Our Author here produced his <hi>Authority</hi> for what he had said as to that Case, that his Auditors might understand, that (in a Case of so great importance) he did not presume to give them any <hi>singular</hi> Opinions of his own, but that he instructed them in the received and allowed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to which they were all related. Withall he thereby warned them of the <hi>Cautions</hi> necessary in the <hi>Practice</hi> of that Doctrine, that they might not break the Peace of their <hi>Church</hi> in the Case then proposed. Who sees not how naturally this coheres with the <hi>former part</hi> of his Discourse? It is indeed so <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> that I once thought them to be the Author's own Words, till I was convinced of my Mistake, by comparing them with the Canon itself, from whence he took them. But it was somewhat better for his purpose, that he should express his Sense in this matter rather in his Church's Words than his own. And it must have been a wonderfull <hi>chance,</hi> if any Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of a Librarian could have light on so fit a place, and so apposite to the precedent design of another Author, who thought not of them. He that can believe it, may next believe the <hi>Epicuraean Hypothests,</hi> That the <hi>World</hi> was made by such a <hi>casual</hi> Concurrence of undesigning <hi>Atoms.</hi> All that is pretended to the contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is only that this Collection of Canons follows the <hi>Summary</hi> subjoined to the former Collection. But this is too conjectural a Proof to be opposed to the Evidences now mentioned: yet How do they know but that this very <hi>Summary</hi> is the Author's own?

                  </gap>es,</hi> in this same MS. where it was added by the <hi>Librarian</hi>: And it is not unusual for Authors to add Arguments and Abstracts of their own Works; so did <hi>Pliny</hi> to his <hi>Natural History</hi>; so did <hi>Gellius</hi> to his <hi>Noctes Attioae</hi>; so has the Anonymous Chronologer under <hi>Alexander Severus</hi>; so has <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Nennius</hi> in the later and more barbarous Ages; and What should make the <hi>Librarian</hi> think that <hi>fit</hi> to be done in another Man's Work, that might not also make the Author <hi>himself</hi> think so too? But for our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I am not concerned, whether this <hi>Summary</hi> was drawn up by the Author, or the Librarian; if the Librarian thought fit to insert it into the <hi>Text,</hi> (as plainly he has done,) this was the properest Place for it,<note place="margin">This Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore can be no <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> for our Adversaries, neither as to the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> nor of the <hi>Church</hi> he was concerned for.</note> before any other part of the Discourse intervened that was upon another Argument, not of <hi>Facts</hi> but <hi>Canons.</hi>

            <p n="11">11. Thus I have shewn that our Author was neither <hi>obliged</hi> by the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi>

of the <hi>Facts</hi> produced by him, which our Adversaries are pleased to call <hi>Precedents:</hi> For what if in the History of so many <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies</hi> as are here accounted for, there might be found some <hi>Instances</hi> wherein Christian <hi>Emperours</hi> were partial in favour to themselves, and chalenged more <hi>Power</hi> than did really belong to them? And what if Christian <hi>Bishops</hi> for <hi>Peace</hi> sake submitted, not waving the <hi>Right,</hi> but bearing the <hi>Injury?</hi> What and if the Clergy and Laity did sometimes, as they do now, fail in their <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>adhering</hi> to them? It is yet suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our present purpose, that this was no design'd Collection of such pretended <hi>Precedents</hi>; that therefore if any of these <hi>Facts</hi> should prove so, that was beside the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Author; that his <hi>Authority</hi> ought not to be concerned for them; that neither his <hi>Judgment,</hi> nor the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, can ever recommend such <hi>Facts</hi> for <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> which were so disagreeable to their Rules and Canons. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Adversaries will make <hi>Precedents</hi> of those <hi>Facts</hi> which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by this Author, by the Doctrine of those very Churches where they were committed, this is plainly reasoning otherwise than they can justifie by any <hi>Authority:</hi> For what <hi>Authority</hi> can it be that they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on for making such <hi>Facts</hi> pass for <hi>Precedents?</hi> Is it that of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church? But her Doctrine will not allow our Adversaries to <hi>disown</hi> our <hi>deprived Bishops,</hi> or to set up <hi>Antibishops</hi> against them, on account of such <hi>Lay</hi>-Deprivations. Is it the Authority of this <hi>Collector?</hi> But he owns <hi>these</hi> Doctrines for the Doctrines of his <hi>own</hi> Church, which are so <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> with our Adversaries Practices. Or, Is it, lastly, the Authority of the <hi>Princes</hi> themselves, who were <hi>concerned</hi> in the <hi>Facts</hi> here enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? But it is certain <hi>Princes</hi> doe many things which they never do so much as <hi>pretend</hi> to <hi>justifie</hi> by <hi>Principles:</hi> And yet it is withall certain, that no <hi>other Facts</hi> but such <hi>avowed</hi> ones ought in reason to pass for <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>; and for knowing what they do <hi>avowedly</hi> justifie, no better Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient can be found, than to <hi>appeal</hi> to the Doctrine of the Church that was <hi>owned</hi> and <hi>protected</hi> by them, which they took for the <hi>Guide</hi> of their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</hi> Thus it will come to pass, that if any of the <hi>Facts</hi> here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned should prove for our Adversaries purpose, yet seeing they could not be <hi>well</hi> done, as to the Consciences of the <hi>Persons</hi> concerned, our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries must not <hi>presume</hi> them well done, but <hi>prove</hi> them so independently on the <hi>Persons,</hi> before they can make <hi>Precedents</hi> of them, and reason from them as Authorities; and then what will they gain by this <hi>celebrated</hi> Collection, when it will leave them to the Tryal of the <hi>Merit</hi> of their Cause as much as ever?</p>

That he dyed of <hi>Kicks</hi> the <hi>Synodicon</hi> owns; and that he dyed in their Hands by whom he should have been carried into <hi>Exile,</hi> we have the Testimony of <hi>Prosper,</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Age; so that he could not <hi>reach</hi> the place of his Banishment, as some other less considerable Authors conceive: And very probably those Violences to <hi>Flavianus</hi>'s Person, and to the other Bishops also, to oblige them to subscribe his Condemnation and Deprivation, were the <hi>Reasons</hi> that made <hi>Hilarus</hi> fly from <hi>Ephesus</hi>: So the <hi>Violences</hi> must, in all likelihood, have been offered <hi>before</hi> he left the place; and he might bring <hi>News,</hi> if not of his <hi>Death,</hi> yet that his <hi>Bruises</hi> were such as would in all probability prove <hi>mortal.</hi> This might be the <hi>Reason</hi> why, among the Letters of this latest date there are none to <hi>Flavianus</hi> himself. <hi>Leo</hi> might not think it fit to write Letters that were not likely to reach him <hi>alive,</hi> but would be exposed to the danger of falling into the hands of <hi>Enemies.</hi> This I think is the <hi>latest</hi> date of any Epistle written by <hi>Leo</hi> that mentions <hi>Flavianus</hi> as yet alive. And very probably the News of his imminent Death stopped him from proceeding any farther: So <hi>Nicephorus</hi> xiv.40. Thus it appears that the <hi>last</hi> mention of <hi>Flavianus</hi> supposes that he had, as yet, no <hi>Rival</hi> set up against him. Plain it is, that they did not set up <hi>Anatolius</hi> at the same time that they deposed <hi>Flavianus</hi>; and it is not likely that there was any <hi>long</hi> respite between his <hi>Deposition</hi> and his <hi>Death.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49536:27"/>
Flavianus</hi> certainly was murthered before the breaking up of the <hi>Synod,</hi> whilst <hi>Dioscorus</hi> had yet his Guards about him: And it seems to be the <hi>dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Synod</hi> that breaks off the course of <hi>Leo</hi>'s Letters, till the following Year. As for <hi>Anatolius</hi> himself, we have no Actions of his that give us any reason to suspect that he was in <hi>Office</hi> before the Year assigned by <hi>Victor.</hi> The first thing it concerned him to take care of for settling his Communion with the <hi>West,</hi> was to put out a Confession of his Faith, according to the Custome of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ge: The rather, because of the late suspicion on account of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who had lately been cleared by <hi>Anatolius</hi>'s Friends. This he indeed delayed; possibly to see what effect the Letters of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Placidia</hi> would have with his Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Theodosius.</hi> Nor did <hi>Leo</hi> receive his Confession till about <hi>Easter,</hi> of the year 451. Before that time it is probable <hi>Theodosius</hi> had put <hi>Chrysa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius</hi> to death, which obliged <hi>Anatolius</hi> to take this course when he found the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Interest declining, and that it would be no <hi>longer</hi> able to support him. Yet the first Complaint against him for not doing it is in an Epistle of <hi>Leo</hi> to <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> bearing date <hi>July</hi> 20. 450. We should in all likelihood have had earlier ones, if <hi>Anatolius</hi> had succeeded, as our Author fancies, whilst <hi>Flavianus</hi> was yet living, in the year 449. The best Testimony we have that assures us that <hi>Anatolius</hi> was preferred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Consuls of the year 449. is a Fragment of <hi>Theodorus Lector,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the 2d <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, which <hi>Baronius</hi> did not think of. And particularly it is observed by <hi>Zonaras,</hi> that <hi>Dioscorus</hi> concerned himself in that which did not belong to him, the making of a Bishop of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople:</hi> But the Reason <hi>Zonaras</hi> gives why he did so, and why he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his own <hi>Apocrisiarius</hi> to the place, shews that it must have been <hi>after</hi> the Death of <hi>Flavianus.</hi> That Author tells us, that it was the Fear <hi>Dioscorus</hi> was in that put him upon it: He therefore suggests to <hi>Chrysa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius,</hi> the Author of all these Mischiefs, that he would persuade the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to name <hi>Anatolius</hi> to the Throne of <hi>Flavianus</hi> hoping thereby to gain two Points, (as the same Author observes,) very necessary to his ill Designs: One was, that <hi>Eutyches</hi> might be continued in the <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane</hi> Communion, to which he had been restored; another was, that he might thereby prevent any <hi>accurate Enquiry</hi> into the Matter of <hi>Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus.</hi> Plainly it appears by this Account of the Affair, that the Fear <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorus</hi> was in was that of being called to Account for this <hi>Murther</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being the <hi>Cause,</hi> must therefore be <hi>antecedent</hi> to his Interposition for a <hi>Successor.</hi> This is certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was not proper to interpose for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Successor,</hi> till they had first deprived <hi>Flavianus</hi>: And those <hi>Bruises</hi> being given him at the very time of his <hi>Appeal,</hi> which was immediately upon his <hi>Deprivation,</hi> it thence appears, that there were onely three days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite between his <hi>deprivation</hi> and his <hi>death</hi>; which is by much too short a time to write from <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to receive a Return; so impossible it is that <hi>Anatolius</hi> could have been set up <hi>before</hi> the <hi>death</hi> of

               <hi>Flavianus,</hi> or that he could have made any Cession to <hi>Anatolius,</hi> as our Collectour fansies. He did not withall consider how unlikely it was that <hi>Flavianus</hi> should pay any Deference to <hi>Anatolius</hi> at <hi>that time</hi>

All the ground he has to think <hi>Flavianus</hi> was then <hi>alive</hi> when <hi>Anatolius</hi> was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of his Throne, is onely <hi>Guess,</hi> not any competent <hi>historical</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. He refers us, in the end, after this manner, to the <hi>Acts</hi> of that second <hi>Ephesine</hi> Synod; I suppose as we find them still extant in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> But there we find nothing concerning the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration</hi> of <hi>Anatolius</hi>; not so much as whether <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and the <hi>Synod</hi> were any ways concerned in it, or whether it was done before the <hi>Synod</hi> was dissolved: So far we are from learning <hi>thence</hi> that he was set up <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Flavianus.</hi> He might think it more to his purpose what he has observed out of the Epistle of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Marcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> where that Pope pretends, that it was the <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> of <hi>Anatolius,</hi> (no doubt as signified by his <hi>Confession</hi> of Faith, which he had at length received from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) that hindred him from <hi>enquiring</hi> too scrupulously into his <hi>Ordination:</hi> But the <hi>delays</hi> he used before he sent that <hi>Confession,</hi> made him justly liable to <hi>Suspicion</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with his Personal <hi>Interest</hi> in the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> though he had otherwise received no Consecration from them. And the uttermost that can be conjectured from hence was, that he had received his <hi>Orders</hi> from their hands, not that he received them whilst <hi>Flavianus</hi> was yet alive, much less that <hi>Flavianus</hi> himself had made any Cession to him on account of his <hi>Orthodoxy.</hi> Thus the Case had not been like <hi>ours,</hi> of a <hi>schismatical</hi> Invasion of a <hi>Right,</hi> to which another had a <hi>better Title,</hi> but of a Title <hi>defective</hi> indeed, (in regard of the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from whence it had been derived,) but not <hi>injurious</hi>: That is, it had been a Case like that of <hi>Meletius,</hi> and <hi>Catholicks</hi> would have been <hi>here</hi> as much as <hi>there</hi> divided in their <hi>Opinions</hi> concerning it.

In the Case of <hi>Macedonius</hi> the Emperour's Rage did somewhat precipitate him; he had him forcibly seized, and sent immediately into <hi>Banishment,</hi> without so much as the Formality of a <hi>Tryal:</hi> The rather so, because he feared the <hi>People</hi> would not endure it, such a Zeal they had for <hi>Macedonius,</hi> and the Cause defended by him.

the Case of <hi>Macedonius.</hi> In this case, certainly it neither could have been <hi>true,</hi> nor could he have any good <hi>Testimony</hi> for him to believe it so. When the Bishops came to <hi>notifie</hi> the <hi>Sentence</hi> to him <hi>Macedonius,</hi>

to his <hi>Henoticon</hi> in the 8th Year of the same Emperor <hi>Anastasius,</hi> that was about the Year 499.

But very little of this story is true, even as to matter of <hi>Fact</hi>; and yet if it had been all so, it is nothing to our Adversaries <hi>purpose.</hi> Very little of it is true, as to <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact.</hi> First, at the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Tyre,</hi> it is certain <hi>Athanasius</hi> did not fly to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49536:32"/>
               <hi>Constantinople</hi> to make his Case known to the Emperor himself. It had been at that time in vain to have had recourse to <hi>Maximus,</hi> who in that very Synod of <hi>Tyre</hi> had given his <hi>Suffrage</hi> against him. He did indeed see his Error <hi>afterwards,</hi> but it was many years <hi>first: Athanasius</hi> was condemned in the Synod of <hi>Tyre,</hi> in the year 335. But the time when <hi>Maximus</hi> convened his Synod, and declared for <hi>Athanasius,</hi> was in the year 350. when at the Interposition of the Emperor <hi>Constans, Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> was released from his Banishment. Then <hi>Maximus</hi> did indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for him, and that <hi>Synodically.</hi> But all that we can find <hi>Acacius</hi> did against him, was to <hi>upbraid</hi> him with his <hi>inconsistency,</hi> and by his <hi>contrary Vote</hi> in the Synod of <hi>Tyre.

               <hi>Theodoret</hi> is very express in making <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi>'s Succession after the death of <hi>Maximus</hi>: so also is St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who lived nearer the remembrance of that <hi>Fact</hi> than <hi>Socrates</hi> himself. He tells us, That before the <hi>Arians</hi> would admit <hi>Cyril</hi> to the place, they obliged him first to renounce his Orders of Presbyter, which he had received from <hi>Maximus</hi>; and that, when he was in, <hi>Heraclius</hi> also, who had been taken by <hi>Maximus</hi> himself for his Successor, was by <hi>Cyril</hi> also obliged to degrade himself to the Order of Presbyter. We have in the same See of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> a very ancient instance of a Bishop who brought in his Successor. So <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us, <hi>Narcissus</hi> did <hi>Alexander,</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Cappadocia</hi>; — who also adds, that that Election was ratified by a <hi>Divine</hi> Testimony. But who can believe that <hi>Maximus</hi> would have brought in a <hi>Successor,</hi> if himself had been <hi>deposed</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed</hi>? Who can think he would have <hi>actually</hi> have made him <hi>Bishop,</hi> if himself had <hi>not</hi> been so <hi>actually</hi>? The whole occasion of the mistake seems to have been, not that <hi>Maximus</hi> himself was removed to make way for <hi>Cyril,</hi> but rather <hi>Heraclius</hi> who had been substituted by <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> For this was indeed a case sometimes questioned in the Discipline of the Church, whether a Bishop might be allowed to <hi>Substitute</hi> his own <hi>Successor:</hi> The Records of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> are in these times very intricate and difficult. When <hi>Cyril</hi> himself was banished by the <hi>Arians,</hi> we have the Names of three persons who filled his See in the interval before he was restored. Among them there is one <hi>Heraclius,</hi> possibly this very person who took the advantage of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Deprivation for recovering his <hi>Right</hi> which was conferred on him by <hi>Maximus.</hi> And as to the dispute concerning the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of their Sees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who gives us the most distinct account of this matter, tells us it was started in the time of <hi>Cyril,</hi> who was deprived after by <hi>Acacius,</hi> among other causes, for this also of maintaining the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of his own See. It is very true, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> though it had the <hi>Title</hi> of a Patriarchal See, yet had no <hi>Patriarchal Jurisdiction</hi> till the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> but was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49536:32"/>
subject to the <hi>Metropolitane</hi> of <hi>Caesarea.</hi> Even the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> which owned it for Patriarchal, did notwithstanding reserve to <hi>Caesarea</hi> the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of being the <hi>Metrapolitane.</hi> But the Honour of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>'s <hi>Age,</hi> and of his having been a <hi>Confessor</hi> in the Persecution (which in that Age was very great) made no doubt the Adversaries of his <hi>Cause</hi> have notwithstanding a great veneration for his <hi>Person.</hi> These reasons ceased in <hi>Cyril,</hi> who was at first set up by <hi>Arian</hi> Interest, and with <hi>him</hi> his Competitors of the same Faction did therefore think they might be more bold. Accordingly <hi>then</hi> it was that those Controversies fell among the <hi>Arians</hi> concerning <gap reason="foreign">

In that dispute <hi>Cyril</hi> was so far from acknowledging any Superiority in the Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> that it seems he challenged a Right of filling the See himself, and contested it with that <hi>Eutychius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Elutheropolis</hi>: But that seems to have been after the time of <hi>Acacius,</hi> after his second Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.

In the Appendix to the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition we have two Lives of that Great Man, one by <hi>Metaphrastes,</hi> the other by an <hi>unknown</hi> Author, elder per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps than <hi>Metaphrastes:</hi> Both of them own this Tale, that <hi>Maximus</hi> was deposed by <hi>Acacius.</hi> If either of them was the Life read by <hi>Photius,</hi> that of the <hi>Anonymous</hi> Author was the more likely of the two. <hi>Metaphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi> was manfestly too <hi>late</hi> for him; otherwise the <hi>Excerpta</hi> of <hi>Photius</hi> do better agree with <hi>Metaphrastes. Photius</hi> takes no notice of the Notes of Time which are frequent in the <hi>Anonymous</hi> Life, though he otherwise uses to take particular notice of such things in the Authors on which he makes his Observations. But in making two <hi>Tyrian</hi> Synods, wherein the Cause of <hi>Athanasius</hi> was debated, he better agrees with <hi>Metaphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</hi> Perhaps therefore there was a <hi>third</hi> Life seen by <hi>Photius,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpolated, after his manner, by <hi>Metaphrastes,</hi> which perished after the interpolation, which also mentioned this pretended Deprivation of <hi>Maximus</hi> by <hi>Acacius.</hi> Yet even that <hi>Elder</hi> Life also, by the account of it in <hi>Photius,</hi> seems to have been such a Life of <hi>Athanasius</hi> as <hi>Hierome Savier's</hi> Gospel was of our <hi>Saviour</hi>: The several Forgeries and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of his <hi>Predecessors</hi> are taken in, and his <hi>own</hi> added to them. Here we are told of <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s acting the part of <hi>Bishop</hi> while he was a <hi>Boy,</hi> and that <hi>Alexander</hi> the then Bishop ratified what he did in that <hi>sportive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonation,</hi> though he would have it believed that the Children were <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> in what they did. But how could they be Serious in taking upon them Exercises of an Authority that did not belong to them? This in all likelihood he had from the <hi>Greek</hi> Translation of <hi>Ruffinus</hi>'s Addition to <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s History, by which <hi>Socrates</hi> confesses he had been seduced in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things concerning <hi>Athanasius,</hi> before he consulted the Works of <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself. Here we also read the Tale of <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s abscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for several years with a young and beautiful Virgin: This seems also to have been taken from the truly Monkish <hi>Historia Lausiaca</hi> of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius.</hi> Here we find also the <hi>two</hi> Councils of <hi>Tyre</hi> against <hi>Athanasius</hi>; one the <hi>true</hi> one, on the <hi>Tricennalia</hi> of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great; the other in the time of <hi>Constantius,</hi> where the Case of <hi>Arsenius</hi> was debated, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49536:33"/>
we are certain could be no other than fictitious from the certain accounts <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself has preserved us of the whole affair: But perhaps it was thought more convenient for connecting the actions of <hi>Maximus,</hi> for which this Author would suppose him deprived by <hi>Acacius.</hi> Many other instances might, no doubt, have been observed, if we had leisure to compare this <hi>Legend</hi> with the undoubted Monuments of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his coaeval Authors. <hi>Photius</hi> himself who saw and read that Life, gives but a <hi>mean</hi> account of it. I mention not his Censures of the <hi>Style</hi> of it; that we are less concerned for at present. He says, there were also several things <hi>new</hi> in the <hi>Historical</hi> inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmations of it. And <hi>new</hi> indeed they must be which had no <hi>antient</hi> Historical Monuments to be vouched for them. So little reason there is to believe the matters of <hi>Fact</hi> true from whence our Author reasons in this case: For it is manifest that <hi>eldest</hi> Life mentioned by <hi>Photius,</hi> must have been the Original of this other Life, whatever it was that was mentioned by our Collector. Yet had they all been a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> true as they <hi>wish</hi> they were, our Adversaries would gain nothing by them: Here are <hi>Synods</hi> concerned in all the particulars of this account, the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Tyre</hi> for depriving <hi>Athanasius,</hi> the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for restoring him and a <hi>supposed Synod</hi> also for the <hi>supposed deprivation</hi> of <hi>Maximus,</hi> accordingly taken in by the modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> with several other fabulous <hi>Synods,</hi> into their <hi>Synodicon,</hi> first published by <hi>Pappus</hi> and <hi>Justellus,</hi> then taken by <hi>Labbee</hi> into his volumes of Councils.

Would he not endure one in <hi>Possession,</hi> whom he <hi>found</hi> so, that would not gratifie him in his new opinion? And could he <hi>admit</hi> another into possession that would not doe it? If therefore <hi>John,</hi> his Successor, complied with the Emperor, (as there is very little reason to doubt but that he did,) this instance can by no means be serviceable to our Author's design: He ought not then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that <hi>Eutychius</hi> did communicate with his Successor, if he will not (as certainly in <hi>Charity</hi> he ought not) presume any thing concerning him but what <hi>became</hi> him: Or if the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> appeared true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Presumption,</hi> he ought not to <hi>argue</hi> from it as a <hi>Precedent.</hi> The case of <hi>Communicating</hi> with <hi>Hereticks</hi> is not <hi>commendable,</hi> nay, is expresly <hi>excepted</hi> by our Author himself from the <hi>Rule</hi> wherein he thinks it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to continue <hi>Communion</hi>; and therefore (with him at least) can never make a <hi>Precedent.</hi>

Accordingly they were condemned for it in a <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Abbats,</hi> when they made their second separation from <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> and driven from their Monasteries and the City, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> tells us, though our Author mention nothing it. The <hi>Bishops</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forced them to recant all the <hi>Invectives</hi> they had used against the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> not that they thereby intended to defend <hi>Joseph,</hi> but to assert their own <hi>Authority,</hi> as the only competent one in Affairs relating to <hi>Communion,</hi> against these <hi>Monastical</hi> Invasions. St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> told the Great <hi>Theodosius,</hi> that his <hi>Purple</hi> did not entitle him to the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> which yet was not more true of the <hi>Purple</hi> than of the <hi>Cowl.</hi> Thither there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore relates what our Author observes from the Patriarch <hi>Methodius,</hi> that if <hi>Theodorus</hi> had not recanted, he had not been received to <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> He observes farther, from the <hi>Testament</hi> of the same <hi>Methodius,</hi> (probably in imitation of the <hi>Testament</hi> of <hi>Nazianzene,</hi>) that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, that whenever the <hi>Studites</hi> were received as <hi>Penitents,</hi> they should only be received to <hi>Communion,</hi> not to their <hi>Sacerdotal Dignity.</hi> So in the <hi>Synodicon</hi> drawn upon the occasion of these <hi>Schisms,</hi> and ordered (as our Author observes) thenceforward to be <hi>read</hi> in Churches, those <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives</hi> against the Patriarchs are not only <hi>recanted,</hi> but <hi>anathematized.</hi> Nay, <hi>Theodorus</hi> was therein declared not to have done <hi>well</hi> in his Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that the <hi>Schism</hi> was on his part, whatever was the occasion

to aspire farther to give <hi>Laws</hi> even to the <hi>Senators</hi> themselves.

cannot be difficult to determine where the <hi>Duty</hi> is still rather <hi>obliging,</hi> that the <hi>indirect</hi> charge of <hi>Schism</hi> lies against the <hi>Intruders</hi> for erecting <hi>Altars</hi> against <hi>Altars</hi> already <hi>possessed</hi>; not against the <hi>Possessors,</hi> who were put in <hi>vacuam possessionem</hi> (as the <hi>Law</hi> calls it) by an unquestionable law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Authority.</hi> Will they therefore pretend the <hi>greater obligation</hi> lying on them to own the <hi>Episcopal College,</hi> than to own any <hi>particular Bishop?</hi> This they might have pretended, if any <hi>Synodical</hi> Deprivation of persons <hi>Authorized</hi> to <hi>Act</hi> in <hi>Synods</hi> had gone before: That might indeed have cut <hi>off</hi> the <hi>Incumbents</hi> from their <hi>

               </note>32. The Friends of <hi>Photius</hi> discovered their Consciousness of his <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Right</hi>; First, by the <hi>violence</hi> used to the person of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to force him to <hi>surrender</hi>; then by <hi>diligence</hi> used by them, when they found their endeavours with <hi>Ignatius</hi> unsuccessfull, to get a <hi>Synod</hi> that might <hi>deprive</hi> him of his <hi>Right,</hi> whether he would or no: Yet the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and delays they met with in procuring a <hi>Synod,</hi> and corrupting the Suffrages of it, are also arguments of the opposition they met with in their main Cause, even in the <hi>East,</hi> even among the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves, where the Authority of <hi>Bardas</hi> was most significant; for it was some years before chey could effect their purposes that way, not till the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the year 860.

And the two <hi>Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of that same <hi>Synod</hi> in <hi>different</hi> places, as it gave occasion for them to give the Title of <hi>A B</hi> to their <hi>Synod</hi> it self; so it also seems to have been the occasion why this injudicious Collector of the <hi>Synodicon</hi> should make two <hi>Synods</hi> of it. The <hi>latter</hi> of the two was that wherein the Pope's Legates were either <hi>forced</hi> or <hi>bribed</hi> to sign the Condemnation of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> I am apt to think that the true occasion of convening a second time the same Bishops before they were departed to their several Homes, was the unexpected arrival of the Legates, that they also might <hi>conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly</hi> confirm what had been done in the <hi>Council</hi> before their arrival. If I guess right, their <hi>former</hi> sitting must have been <hi>immediately</hi> before the arrival of the Legates: and indeed it seems to have been so. The Pope was <hi>surprized</hi> at the proceeding against <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and charges

               <hi>Photius</hi> with breach of promise, in medling farther in that matter than he had pretended he would do. And he says, he sent his Legates not to <hi>determine</hi> any thing concerning the Cause of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but only to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> into it, and to make <hi>report</hi> to him of the success of their enquiry: And if we may believe his Adversaries account of this Affair, <hi>Photius</hi> had pretended that <hi>Ignatius</hi> had resigned, and this, it should seem, they reckoned on; which could not have been, if this decision of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Case had been long before: Even that <hi>pretence</hi> argued his <hi>Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> that what had been done before against <hi>Ignatius,</hi> would never be thought sufficient to <hi>deprive</hi> him of his Right in <hi>Conscience,</hi> as soon as the <hi>falshood</hi> of this <hi>pretence</hi> should be discovered. This therefore put him upon a <hi>Conciliary</hi> Trial of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in that former meeting wherein <hi>Ignatius</hi> was <hi>personly</hi> present: But <hi>Ignatius</hi> pleaded what Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> also pleaded in his behalf, that he ought to be <hi>restored</hi> to his <hi>Possession,</hi> before they could, by the <hi>Canons,</hi> bring him to a <hi>Trial.</hi> This <hi>Photius</hi>'s <hi>Council</hi> would by no means admit of, but proceeded their own way, pretending to give him a fair thorough <hi>hearing,</hi> and <hi>deprived</hi> him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, knowing that his Plea was indeed allowable by the <hi>Canons,</hi> they thought their Cause would require all the <hi>confirmation</hi> that could be got by the Legates, and the reputation they would gain by having the <hi>Western</hi> Communion on their side. If this therefore were so, the <hi>time</hi> of these <hi>Synods,</hi> or <hi>Meetings</hi> rather of the <hi>same Synod,</hi> will best appear from the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>arrival</hi> of the Popes Legates.

the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches: And so it descended down to the times of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Photius,</hi> of which we are discoursing.

This seems therefore to have been the state of that Dispute, if <hi>Nicholas</hi> proceeded by way of <hi>proper Jurisdiction</hi>; if he had proceeded on the Principles of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> on the supposition of <hi>Equality,</hi> then he could no otherwise have obliged the <hi>Eastern Bishops,</hi> than as the <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Provinces</hi> that sided with him were more <hi>numerous</hi> than those that were against them: For this is all that had been reasonable in that case, that where <hi>Peace</hi> was absolutely necessary, and yet could not be had without <hi>Cession</hi> on <hi>one</hi> part, there it was also necessary that the <hi>smaller</hi> part should rather <hi>yield</hi> to the <hi>greatest.</hi> But whether Empire had more <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Provinces</hi> is needless now to determine: The rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it does not seem to have been thought on, or insisted on, in the Disputes of that Age. It is sufficient for our purposes, that, in the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Eastern Bishops,</hi> and by the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Eastern Discipline,</hi> (which <hi>Ignatius</hi> was to stand by,) this <hi>Roman Synod</hi> was no competent <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and therefore left both <hi>him</hi> and <hi>Photius</hi> in the same condition wherein it found them.

This could hardly have been made a <hi>Precedent</hi> by him, if he himself had not been under a <hi>present</hi> and a <hi>great</hi> Resentment, if he had not followed them in their <hi>Passion,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Fact</hi> that proceeded from it. It becomes us rather to put the best Interpretation we can on the <hi>Facts</hi> of those who are <hi>deceased,</hi> whose <hi>Lives</hi> did otherwise not make them obnoxious to have the <hi>worst</hi> things <hi>presumed</hi> concerning them. The rather in this case, because there was another Reason as consistent with the Design of <hi>Basilius,</hi> and much more agreeable with his Honour: <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> when he was before the Synod of <hi>Photius</hi> pleaded, that he ought to be restored to his <hi>Possession,</hi> before he could be obliged to answer to a <hi>synodical</hi> Judgment: This Plea therefore being <hi>canonical,</hi> ought to have been admitted by the Synod that <hi>deprived</hi> him; the putting him therefore into a present <hi>Possession,</hi> even before a new <hi>synodical</hi> Tryall, was no more than what ought to have been done by the <hi>Synod</hi> itself; and their proceeding <hi>irregularly</hi> could not therefore <hi>prejudge</hi> against the <hi>Canons</hi> that required it, nor hinder the putting it in <hi>practice</hi> as soon as the <hi>violence</hi> was over that occasioned the <hi>Violation</hi> of those <hi>Canons.</hi> Yet it was so to be understood, as not to prejudge any thing concerning the <hi>Merit</hi> of the <hi>Cause.</hi> Otherwise, instead of doing <hi>Ignatius</hi> a <hi>Kindness,</hi> it had done him a <hi>Prejudice</hi> by the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Discipline</hi> then received in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church; he had thereby made himself really obnoxious to the <hi>Apostolical Canon,</hi> which <hi>Photius</hi> had no colour to charge him with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:<note place="margin">

So far that <hi>Eastern</hi> Church, whose <hi>sense</hi> our Adversaries pretend to gather from these instances, was from acknowledging the lawfulness of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops obtruded by the <hi>Secular</hi> Power, that with them it rather <hi>prejudiced</hi> a good, that <hi>advantaged</hi> a suspicious Title. This, by the way, it were well our Adversaries would think of, how it affects the Case of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>intruders</hi>: The rather, because it does not only deprive them of the benefit of this argument from these <hi>Eastern Precedents,</hi> but may also be urged against them wherever these <hi>Canons</hi> have been received, as these first <hi>fifty</hi> have been generally in most, even of our <hi>Western</hi> Collections. However, that the Emperor did not look upon his <hi>own</hi> actings as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive in this Case, appears from hence, that he ordered both Parties to send their Legates to the Pope, to inform him throughly of the matter of <hi>Fact</hi>; and that withall he convened a pretended <hi>General Council</hi> for a final decision of the Dispute. I rather suspect that he ascribed more to the determination of Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> than either the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of his own <hi>Church,</hi> or his own <hi>Preingagements,</hi> would fairly allow of, and that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49536:41"/>
he might therefore look on his own putting <hi>Ignatius</hi> in <hi>Possession,</hi> as an executing the Decree of the <hi>Roman Council.</hi> Plainly he did more herein than several of his own Party did <hi>like</hi>: First, he preferred the Judgment of a foreign <hi>Italian</hi> before that of a <hi>Domestick</hi> Council. This was what was opposed, not only by his Predecessor <hi>Michael,</hi> but also by his Successors in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church to this very day; nay, what himself after repealed in the Synod of <hi>Photius</hi> in the year 879. Then he preferred that <hi>elder</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the year 863. before the <hi>later</hi> Synod of <hi>Photius,</hi> (that <hi>third</hi> of his against Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> and his Synod, as the <hi>two</hi> former had been against <hi>Ignatius,</hi>) which had been celebrated in the very year wherein himself succeeded; that is, in the year 867. between the 26th of <hi>May,</hi> whereon <hi>Basile</hi> was made <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Septemb.</hi> the 24th, whereon <hi>Michael</hi> was murdered. He seemed to obviate this by calling this <hi>other</hi> Synod, which now passes for the Eighth <hi>General Council</hi> with the <hi>Latines,</hi> as if it had been to repeal that later <hi>Constantinopolitane</hi> Council Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. This was in the year 869. but no liberty was reserved for a fair hearing of things in this Council. <hi>Ignatius</hi> had before that, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his return into his place, done all that ought to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the Synod, if any fair dealing had been intended; he had <hi>deposed</hi> and <hi>excommunicated</hi> his Rival: Not only so, but he had <hi>nulled</hi> the <hi>Orders</hi> of those who had been ordained by him, and <hi>excommunicated</hi> those who had <hi>communicated</hi> with him. Nay, the <hi>Bishops</hi> were all obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>before hand</hi> to stand to the decisions of the Pope's Council, which it appears in the very beginning of this, they neither thought consistent with the Honour of their <hi>own</hi> Church, nor were they willing to be concluded by, if the Emperor would give them liberty. And <hi>Photius</hi> was immediately, before any <hi>Conciliary</hi> hearing, condemned and anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metized, and <hi>Ignatius</hi> owned before any <hi>Repeal</hi> of the <hi>later</hi> Council of <hi>Photius.</hi> Thus this unfair way of promoting even a good Title, did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther injure than advantage it: The rather, because <hi>Basile</hi> had, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, obliged himself but a little before to maintain that Synod of <hi>Photius. Photius</hi> pretended <hi>Basil</hi>'s Subscription to his <hi>own</hi> Synod; and his Adversaries themselves <hi>confess</hi> he did so, and do not <hi>disprove</hi> what he pretended: And we know it was generally received in those times, that what was subscribed by the <hi>Augusti,</hi> was subscribed by the <hi>Caesars</hi> also. Here therefore, I doubt, we can hardly be able to excuse this Prince from a transport of resentment, perhaps not even <hi>Ignatius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that made them do things so little for the Honour of their <hi>own</hi> Church, and in Favour of a foreign Power, rather than fail of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing their ends. I doubt it was their consciousness of their weakness at <hi>home,</hi> that put them upon these straits: The Cause was within a little while after carried against them by the <hi>Photians,</hi> and so continues to this very day. This Council was repealed in the time of this very Emperor. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Creed</hi> of <hi>Photius</hi> concerning the <hi>Procession</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49536:42"/>
of the Holy Ghost from the Father <hi>alone,</hi> was also restored. And this advanced the Dispute from a charge of <hi>Schism</hi> alone, to a charge of <hi>Heresie</hi> also, in the opinion of this <hi>Author</hi>: Those <hi>servile</hi> notions also of allowing even pretended <hi>General Councils</hi> a Power only of <hi>ratifying,</hi> not of <hi>debating</hi> the Predecisions of the Pope, have been generally <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned,</hi> and looked upon as very <hi>odious</hi> in all the Emperors who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to restore them. This the two <hi>Palaeologi, Michael</hi> and <hi>John</hi> found to their cost; the one in the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> in the year 1275. the other in the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> in the year 1437. nor do the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of those who are mentioned in this <hi>Latinizing</hi> Synod, either of those who had still sided with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or of those who were here <hi>received</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their revolting from <hi>Photius,</hi> seem sufficient to have carried the Cause on that side by equal management; especially considering that the <hi>later</hi> would, in that Case, have given their Suffrages against them. And who could look upon this as a fair Decision, with regard to <hi>Conscience,</hi> that was so manifestly contrary to the sense of the <hi>greater</hi> numbers of their <hi>own</hi> Church, which ought alone to have been owned for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge in Causes between her <hi>own</hi> Members?</p>

               </note>35 Here therefore <hi>Ignatius</hi> injured his good Cause by this way of defending it, and gave <hi>Photius</hi> new advantages against him: However he found no farther opposition from him, during his <hi>own Life.

Probably the Emperor himself, when his <hi>Passion</hi> was over, might think himself obliged in <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> to make him this honourable <hi>Amends</hi> for his past irregular and unequal proceedings against him; though I know <hi>Nicetas,</hi> who was an <hi>Ignatian,</hi> pretends other Arts whereby he regained the Emperor's favour: And indeed we have <hi>Photius</hi>'s Cause conveyed to us with no small disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: His Adversaries at that very time suppressed his principal Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings on that Subject; they seized and burnt his <hi>Original</hi> Papers, before any <hi>Copies</hi> could be transcribed; they have afterwards had it in their Power to suppress many of his other Works, whilst the Empire of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> was in the hands of <hi>Latines</hi> or <hi>Latinizing Greeks</hi>; and they have since had it in their Power to hinder the Printing of as many of them as have not fallen into the hands of <hi>Protestants.</hi> This, no doubt, must needs have proved very prejudicial to a right understanding of his Cause, that we have very few assistances for understanding it, but from his professed and very inveterate <hi>Enemies.</hi> However it was, <hi>Photius,</hi> on this restitution, had now no longer any <hi>Rival</hi> that could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a better <hi>Title</hi>: So that <hi>now</hi> they had nothing plausible to pretend for themselves that they would not own him.

These are the principal particulars here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, as appears from the fragments of this Council first published by Dr. <hi>Beveridge</hi> from <hi>Oxford MSS.</hi> most of them from <hi>Beccus,</hi> a zealous <hi>Latinizer,</hi> though <hi>Baronius</hi> is willing to call them in question, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mentioned by <hi>later</hi> Men than <hi>Beccus.</hi> And the Pope's Legates assent to all, and as to that particular of obliging all to submit to <hi>Photius,</hi> the Pope had given them particular and express Orders, in his Letters and Instructions still extant: So that now the <hi>Ignatians</hi> could no longer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any Patronage of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to countenance them in their <hi>Schism</hi> And to sweeten them the more, it was also here expresly stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that there should be no indecent reflections on the <hi>Memory</hi> of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> The Pope was gained by his finding the Emperor bent on it, and by the beneficial <hi>agreements</hi> made with <hi>Photius</hi> in order to it: He obliged <hi>Photius</hi> to quit his Right in the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> a grant which his <hi>Predecessor</hi> could not gain even from <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who had been so much obliged by him. He obliged him also to quit the <hi>Communion</hi> of some of his own <hi>Excommunicates</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as himself also disowned the <hi>Schismaticks</hi> from <hi>Photius.</hi> And this probably went far towards the uniting the <hi>Ignatians,</hi> when the exasperating <hi>severities</hi> were laid aside, and there was now no <hi>Rival,</hi> nor considerable <hi>Authority</hi> to head them. And this, in all likelihood, was the reason, why, notwithstanding their former heats, they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless <hi>both</hi> of them mentioned honourably in the <hi>Synodicon.</hi> It was in course to be expected concerning <hi>Photius,</hi> because he was the last in Possession, and because his <hi>Disputes</hi> with the <hi>Latines</hi> started on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, obtained afterwards so Universally, that his <hi>sense</hi> is the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> to this very day. And though <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s sense be now as generally deserted, yet the union of the <hi>Ignatians</hi> did necessarily require a decent behaviour to his <hi>Memory,</hi> which was now no longer dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be granted, when he was now no longer capable of being a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.</hi> Thence forward therefore <hi>Photius</hi> seemed to have enjoyed more quietness till the year 886. and the Succession of <hi>Leo Sapiens,</hi> which is the last time we find him mentioned in <hi>History.</hi>

But long before, the most Holy and Blessed Pope</hi> Nicholas, <hi>having fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himself concerning the Case of</hi> Ignatius, <hi>had decreed Synodically, that the Right of his own Throne should be restored to him, and with the whole</hi> Roman <hi>Church had anathematised all such as should resist that Decree and Sentence. Here therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before informed of these things, and dreading the Judgment of the promulgated Anathema, we thought it necessary to obey this Synodical Judgment of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and for this cause we restored him to the Possession of his own Throne.</hi> So far were even <hi>Princes,</hi> in that Age, from pretending any Right to intermeddle in such matters without the <hi>Leave,</hi> nay without the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to warrant them in it: and so little were they then ashamed to own themselves <hi>Executioners</hi> of the <hi>Church's Canons</hi> in Affairs properly relating to the <hi>Church's</hi> Right.

               </hi> he might incur if he did not do so. <hi>Photius</hi> had now no <hi>Rival</hi> who could pretend a better Tittle, in favour of whom those <hi>Synodical</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations had been made: And he had since been <hi>restored</hi> in a <hi>General Synod, later</hi> than that which had <hi>deprived</hi> him, and wherein all the defects were supplied which had been objected formerly. Here he had the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Patriarchs: Not only so, but even of the <hi>Papal</hi> See it self, which had before been most implacable against him. I know <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> fancies that there was <hi>afterwards</hi> a breach between Pope <hi>John</hi> and <hi>him</hi>: Nor is it unlikely, that <hi>John</hi> did indeed resent the retaining <hi>Bulgaria</hi> from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the recovering of which was the principal inducement which had brought him to that condescendence. This I take to have been the <hi>reserved</hi> Case, when he afterwards disowns his <hi>confirming</hi> what his Legates had done, if they had in any thing gone beyond the Orders he had given them. Nor is it unlikely also but that, on occasion of that resentment, he might use some <hi>threats</hi> and hard expressions, that might have been so interpreted by the Authors that gave <hi>Baronius</hi> occasion for this conjecture: But there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood at all that those resentments ever proceeded so far as an <hi>open rupture</hi>; otherwise we should certainly have had some mention of it in so many following <hi>Epistles</hi> written by <hi>John</hi> himself afterwards. Whatever he <hi>thought,</hi> he seems, at that time, to have <hi>thought</hi> it seasonable to <hi>suppress</hi> his resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as finding himself opposed by a greater interest than that of <hi>Photius. Photius</hi> therefore does not indeed seem to have been <hi>deprived Synodically</hi>; the reason given for it is, That <hi>Leo</hi> resented what <hi>Santabarenus</hi> had done against him in his Father's time, in making a difference between them, and thought <hi>Photius</hi> the principal hindrance that kept him from his designs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Santabarenus.</hi> This was a reason in <hi>State</hi> likely enough to have been the occasion why <hi>Leo</hi> would endeavour to get <hi>Photius</hi> deprived: But it was not a reason likely to have been owned <hi>openly,</hi> and to have been produced before a <hi>Judicatory.</hi> He could hardly for shame have owned a resentment for things so long <hi>past</hi>; much less could he have charged <hi>Photius</hi> with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>Santabarenus,</hi> when <hi>Santabarenus</hi> himself had not yet received an <hi>open</hi> Trial. However, it is certain that the Emperor himself was the cause that the place was vacated; and in this <hi>Historians</hi> agree: only they do not tells, whether it were with his own <hi>consent,</hi> though forced to it by the Emperor, or whether the Emperor pretended to do it by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

By that <hi>Letter</hi> it appears, that the Emperor did not so much as <hi>pretend</hi> Force on his own part, but a voluntary <hi>Resignation</hi> on the part of <hi>Photius</hi>: So that as yet we have not one instance, that ever any <hi>Lay</hi>-Power did ever pretend to a Power of <hi>depriving Bishops</hi> as to their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Authority, though we could not have known it in this case, had it not been for this <hi>occasional</hi> mention of it by Pope <hi>Stephen.</hi> The Case may therefore have probably been the same in other examples, where we read of <hi>Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> by Emperors, where we are not so happy to light on a <hi>particular</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. Here there are other circumstances that make it probable that this <hi>Cession</hi> was <hi>voluntary: Photius</hi> was treated very <hi>respectfully</hi> even <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> his Deprivation, as appears in the Trial of <hi>Santabarenus,</hi> which would not have been, if he had stood out to the utmost; so it was this <hi>willingness</hi> of his <hi>Cession</hi> that hindered Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> also from proceeding to his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed</hi> severities against him: Besides, <hi>Stephanus</hi> his Successor had been his Pupil, and Educated under him, and therefore unlikely to have <hi>accepted</hi> of his Office without his <hi>leave</hi>; nor do we find that he ever afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured again to get into it, though <hi>Stephanus</hi> did not long enjoy it: And therefore going off <hi>willingly,</hi> he had thence-forward no pretence to disturb his Successors; the <hi>Schism</hi> had been his, not theirs, if he had gone back from his own <hi>agreement,</hi> and either <hi>resumed</hi> his Throne, or <hi>withdrawn</hi> the Peoples <hi>Duty,</hi> which had been already <hi>quitted</hi> by him.</p>

Nay, so, that when he was <hi>restored</hi> to his Throne by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Brother of <hi>Leo,</hi> he did not so much as <hi>question</hi> the <hi>Orders</hi> given by <hi>Euthymius,</hi> because the persons ordained were <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and the person who Ordained them was himself also <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox.</hi> So our Author. The time of this Ejection of <hi>Nicholas</hi> is somewhat intricate: It could hardly have been where <hi>Baronius</hi> places it, in the year 901. The surest grounds we have for discovering it, is from the Age of <hi>Constantine Porphyrogennetus</hi>: It is certain he was born before his Mothers Marriage, which made immediately the <hi>breach</hi> between his Father and the Patriarch. Not only so, <hi>Nicholas</hi> also <hi>Christened</hi> him; so that as yet he was in Possession of the Patriarchal Throne. This it seems he condescended to, on <hi>condition</hi> the <hi>Marriage</hi> should not go on: However, within three days after, <hi>Thomas</hi> a <hi>Presbyter</hi> performed the <hi>Solemnity,</hi> and was thereupon <hi>Excommunicated</hi> by the Patriarch. <hi>Constantine</hi> was <hi>Christened</hi> on the <gap reason="foreign">

Nicholas</hi> himself owns the concurrence of Pope <hi>Sergius</hi>'s Legates against him, who were for <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spencing</hi> with the <hi>Marriage.</hi> It seems therefore that <hi>Leo</hi> had sent for them before the <hi>Marriage,</hi> and the <hi>breach</hi> occasioned by it; otherwise they could not have reached <hi>Constantinople</hi> before the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of <hi>Nicholas.</hi> Thus therefore it is certain, that at that time there were present the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of at least <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Sees. And why should we suspect but that, in a Controversy of so great importance, when he sent for the Legates of <hi>one</hi> of the Patriarchal Sees, he sent for <hi>all</hi> the <hi>rest?</hi> But so it was, those Legates could only undertake for the sense of those <hi>Patriarchal Jurisdictions</hi> that were represented by them. It is by no means likely that he would neglect the fifth <hi>Patriarchal Church</hi> to which himself was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly related. In all probability, the same <hi>time</hi> that he sent for the Legates of the <hi>Foreign Patriarchs,</hi> he ordered matters so, that upon their arrival they should be <hi>met</hi> by a <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> of his own <hi>Dominions,</hi> that so he might have the sense, if not of his <hi>own Patriarch,</hi> at least of his <hi>own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Church.</hi> This made an <hi>appearance</hi> of the <hi>Whole Church,</hi> and of a <hi>General Council,</hi> when he could pretend to the sense of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Patriarchates,</hi> and is withall certain that he endeavoured to draw the <hi>Bishops</hi> of his <hi>own Dominions</hi> to his Party, and that his endeavours were successfull with many of them: And this difference of <hi>Opinion</hi> that was between them, was that which occasioned the following <hi>Schism.</hi> Then withall we know that he charged the <hi>Patriarch</hi> with a <hi>Crime,</hi> as the <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>Deprivation</hi>; that was of <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Perjury.</hi> Probably in the <hi>agreements</hi> made between them before the <hi>breach,</hi> to which it is probable that the Parties concerned had <hi>Sworn,</hi> that the prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And why should we doubt but that as he made this <hi>Synod</hi> Judge of the <hi>Marriage</hi> it self; so that he also allowed them to pass their <hi>judgment</hi> on this <hi>Canonical Accusation</hi>?

This will conveniently enough suit with the Insertion at the end of that <hi>Tome,</hi> which the <hi>Editor</hi> has printed in a smaller Character, and called a <hi>Scholion,</hi> no doubt because he found some such note of Distinction in his <hi>MS.</hi> What follows from that place to the end, seems to have been added in that later Council, wherein this <hi>Tome</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> was decreed. The Author of that <hi>Scholion,</hi> as it is called, speaks plainly of those Times as if they were his <hi>own:</hi> In regard that the Words do very well fit the Persons of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> themselves: They there reckon from the first starting of the Controversie concerning <hi>fourth Marriages,</hi> to that part of the Reign of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> in which that <hi>Synod</hi> was held; that is, as I have shewn, to the year of the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Nicholas Chrysoberges,</hi> and the <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>Sisinni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> ninety years: This will sufficiently fix the <hi>Year</hi> of this second Council. The beginning of this Dispute was when <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Wise</hi> first designed his <hi>fourth Marriage,</hi> which must have been in the year 905. In the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year 906 the Nuptials were solemnized, and Matters were so far advanced, that the Patriarchal <hi>Legates</hi> were now at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and sided with the Emperour against the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> which could not have been, if the Matter had not been debated, and they sent for in the <hi>year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> Thus the 90 years will end exactly in the year 995. and the <hi>Death</hi> of this <hi>Nicholas</hi> is by <hi>Johannes Curopalates</hi> placed in the 8<hi>th Indiction,</hi> which

concurs with the <hi>former</hi> part of that year before <hi>September</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But however though the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> was perfected under <hi>Sisinnius,</hi> yet the <hi>Decree,</hi> as we have it now, was made before the death of <hi>Nicholas.</hi> That appears from the <hi>Acclamation</hi> there mentioned in the Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not in the form used by them to the <hi>deceased,</hi> but that which is there appropriated to the <hi>living.</hi> Their <hi>Acclamations</hi> to the <hi>dead</hi> are to wish their <hi>Memory everlasting</hi>: Their <hi>Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> to the <hi>living</hi> are to wish them many years. This was the old form first taken up in the times of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperors, and from thence dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the <hi>Christians</hi>; and in this form the <hi>Acclamations</hi> in this Council run to the <hi>living</hi> Emperors and Empresses, and the other Patriarchs of this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and so to our <hi>Nicholas</hi> among the Patriarchs. And to this <hi>later</hi> Synod belong all the <hi>Acclamations</hi> subjoyned to the <hi>Tomus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nionis</hi>: That is clear from hence, that even <hi>Nichlaus Mysticus,</hi> in whose time the former Synod was held, is here celebrated with the <hi>Acclamations</hi> of the <hi>dead</hi>; and not only he, but all his Successors between him and our present <hi>Nicholas Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berges.</hi> So little reason there is to think strange that the Predecessors of that elder <hi>Nicholaus Mysticus</hi> should be mentioned in the same form. Thus we see how little reason there is for this inference, that the heads of these dividing Parties must therefore, when <hi>living,</hi> have kept <hi>Communion</hi> with each other, because their differences were at length accommodated so long after their <hi>deaths,</hi> and because the Church which lived,<note place="margin">The Case of <hi>

               <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> has preserved and published the Synod it self, by which we know the year, and day of it.

               </gap>, as that signifies a <hi>Deprivation</hi> of an <hi>Ecclesiastical Dignity</hi>: And the <hi>Crimes</hi> he objects against them, were such as had been particularly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured in the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of that <hi>Age</hi>: They had provided against Bishops appearing frequently at <hi>Court,</hi> and against <hi>Partiality</hi> in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Judicatories.</hi> Thus he avoided their <hi>jurisdiction</hi> over himself as being themselves <hi>Criminals,</hi> and responsible for their breach of <hi>Canons</hi> antecedently to their sitting in that <hi>Synod</hi>: And he insisted on his <hi>own Right</hi> to put the <hi>Canons</hi> in execution on those who were Subjects of his own Jurisdiction. But our Author understands his Author <hi>Choniates</hi> so, as if <hi>Cosmas</hi>'s sealing up the Womb of the <hi>Augusta</hi> from having any <hi>Male</hi> Children, had been an argument that his resentment proceeded no <hi>farther</hi>; and that he otherwise <hi>owned</hi> their Authority, and <hi>submitted</hi> to the <hi>Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But the word which the Interpreter of <hi>Nicetas,</hi> and from him the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of our present Author, translates by <hi>execration,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter by <hi>denunciation,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

Here was plainly a <hi>Schism,</hi> not on the pretence of any objected <hi>Heresie,</hi> but on account of an <hi>original</hi> defect of <hi>Title.</hi> They reckoned the Emperor's <hi>Translation</hi> as nothing, and the <hi>Church's</hi> consent to it as nothing, because the Question had been proposed insidiously. All that <hi>Balsamon</hi> and the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> influenced by him had granted, was, that in <hi>general</hi> the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church aganst <hi>Translations</hi> were <hi>dispensible,</hi> where the Church was pleased with the <hi>Person,</hi> so far as to think that <hi>he</hi> particularly deserved a <hi>Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with her general <hi>Rules</hi>; only the <hi>Application</hi> of the <hi>Canon</hi> to <hi>Dositheus,</hi> was the Emperor's Act, which we see was not allowed him by them who made the <hi>Separation.</hi> Had the <hi>Translation</hi> been valid, and by a sufficiently obliging Power, their Duty had necessarily followed upon it, and they could not have been at liberty, even in <hi>Conscience,</hi> to dispute it, after a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> had consented to it, and after a <hi>Possession</hi> with two years settlement. But by the <hi>Schism</hi> we have reason to believe that the <hi>numbers</hi> of the <hi>Synod</hi> that consented, were <hi>less</hi> than of those who had <hi>never</hi> consented from the <hi>beginning</hi>; otherwise they had been concluded by the <hi>Synodical Act.</hi> Or else the only reason that could be for excepting against the <hi>Synodical</hi> Suffrages, must have been, that the Emperor's Authority was thought too influential on those publick Meetings. Every way it appears how little the <hi>Secular Power</hi> was regarded, even in those late times of <hi>Isaacius Angelus,</hi> when his Authority, tho' seconded by a <hi>Synod</hi> for applying the <hi>Dispensation</hi> to <hi>Dositheus,</hi> was not thought sufficient to <hi>oblige</hi> an <hi>absent</hi> Majority dissenting from them, even with regard to <hi>Conscience,</hi> when even in such a Case as this, the Cause was at last over-ruled by those that <hi>separated,</hi> and carried for them. This plainly shews how little these practices of <hi>Isaacius</hi> were approved of by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the best Judges of his <hi>own time,</hi> when they durst express their thoughts concerning them with any <hi>freedom.</hi> It was, in all likelihood, the <hi>unpopularness</hi> of these <hi>Invasions</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that gave his Brother <hi>Alexis</hi> a great advantage against him, which ended in his <hi>Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Even <note n="(a)" place="margin">
