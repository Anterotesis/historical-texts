            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O how blessed are we, if we shall care for our <hi>one necessary thing?</hi> It is worthy our thoughts, that an <hi>Angel</hi> (never created, as I conceive) standing in his own land; <hi>His right foot upon the Sea, and his left foot on the earth</hi>; hath determined by oath, a Controversie moved by scoffers, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Yea and with his hand lifted up to Heaven, sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and things that therein are; and the sea and things that are therein, that there should be time no longer,</hi> Rev. 10.5, 6. If Eternity be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded judicially by the Oath of <hi>God,</hi> as a thing near to us at the door, now about sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, it is high time to think of it: What we shall do when the Clay-house of this Tabernacle, which is but our summer-house that can have us but the fourth part of a year, shall be dissolved? <hi>Time</hi> is but a short Trance, we are carried quickly through it, our <hi>Rose</hi>

What a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse for the creature to cast in his little <hi>all</hi> in Christ his matchlesse <hi>Al-sufficiency</hi>? Could all the streams retire into the fountain and first Spring, they should be kept in a more sweet and firme possession of their being in the bosom of their first cause, then in their borrowed channels, that they now move in: Our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and retiring in to dwell, for ever and ever, in the Fountain-blessednesse, Jesus Christ, with our borrowed goodness, is the firme and solid fruition of our eternall happy being: Christ is the spheare, the connaturall first Spring, and element of borrowed drops, and small pieces of created Grace, the Rose is surest in being, in beauty on its own stalk and root; let life and sap be eternally in the stalk and root, and the Rose keep its first union with the root, and it shall never wither, never cast its blossome nor greennesse of beauty: its violence for a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spirit to be out of his stalk and root: union here, is life and happinesse, therefore the Churches last prayer in <hi>Canonick Scripture</hi> is for union, Revel. 22.20. <hi>Amen, Even so, Come Lord Iesus</hi>: It shall not be well while the Father, and Christ the prime Heire, and all the weeping children be under one roofe, in the Palace-Royall, it is a sort of mysticall lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

and that the head wanteth an Arme or a finger, and it is a violent and forced condit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Arme and finger to be separated from the head: The Saints are little pieces of mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Christ, sick of love for union, the wife of youth that wants her husband some years, and expects he shall return to her from over-sea lands, is often on the shoare, every ship com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near shoar, is her new joy, her heart loves the wind that shall bring him home, she askes at every passenger news: O saw you my husband? what is he doing? when shall he come?

               <pb facs="tcp:29630:5"/>The condition of the people of God in the three Kingdoms calleth for this, that we now wisely consider what the Lord is doing; there is a Language of the Lords <hi>fire in Zion,</hi> and <hi>His furnace in Jerusalem</hi>; If we could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the voice of the crying Rod: The Arrowes of God flee beyond us, and beside us, but wee see little of God in them. We Saile, but we see not shoar, we fight, but we have no Victory, the efficacy of second cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is the whole burden of the businesse, and this burden we lay upon creatures (and its more then they can bear) and not upon the Lord; God is crying lamenesse on creatures and multitude, that his eminency of working may be more seen. 2. Many are friends to the successe of Reformation, not to Reformation; Mens Faith go along with the promises, untill Providence seem to them to belie the promise: through light at a key-hole many see God in these confusions in the three Kingdoms, but they fall away, because their joyning with the Cause was violent kindenesse to Christ; it is not a friends visite to be driven to a friends house to be dry in a showre, and then occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally to visite wife and children; <hi>Christ</hi> hath too many occasionall friends, but the ground of all is this; I <hi>love Jesus Christ, but I have not the gift of burning-quick for Christ</hi>: O how securely should Faith land us, out of the Gun-shot of the prevailing power of a black
<pb facs="tcp:29630:6"/>
hour of darknesse? Faith can make us able to be willing for Christ to go thorow a quarter of Hells pain: Lord give us not leave to be mad with worldly wisedome: 3. When the Temptation sleepeth, the mad man is wise, the harlot is Chaste; But when the vessell is peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, out cometh that which is within, either Wine or Water. Yet if we should attentively lay our ears to hypocrites, wee should hear that their Lute-strings do miserably jar, for Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie is intelligible, and may bee found out. Would <hi>Parliaments</hi> begin at <hi>Christ,</hi> we should not fear, that which certainly we have cause to fear, <hi>One wo is past, and another wo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth</hi>; The <hi>Prophets</hi> in the three Kingdoms have not repented of the Superstition, will-worship, Idolatry, Persecution, Prophanity, Formality which made them <hi>vile before the people,</hi> and the Judges and Princes, who <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned judgement into gall and wormwood,</hi> are not humbled, because they were a <hi>snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor:</hi> No man repenteth, and <hi>turneth from his evil way,</hi> no <hi>man smitteth on his thigh, saying, what have I done</hi>? Its but black Popery (the name being changed, not the thing) to think the by-past sins of the Land are by-past; and a sort of Reformation for time to come is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to GOD, <hi>Ex opere operato, By the deed done</hi>; Yea, the divisions in the Church are a heavier plague then the raging sword:
<pb facs="tcp:29630:6"/>
These same sins against the first and second Table, the reconciling of us and <hi>Babylon,</hi> Pride, Bribing, Extortion, Filthiness, and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance unpunished, blood touching blood, and not revenged, vanity of apparell, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed way of salvation by all kinde of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatsoever, are now acted in another stage, by other persons, but they are these same sins;<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But of this Theame no more; <hi>Grace</hi> is the Proposition of this following Treatise; when either Grace is turned into painted, but rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten nature, as <hi>Arminians</hi> do, or into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, as others do: The error to me is of a far other and higher elevation, then opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching <hi>Church-Government</hi>: Tenacious adhering to <hi>Antinomian</hi> errors, with an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and finall persistance in them, both as touching Faith to, and suitable practise of them, I shall think cannot be fathered upon any of the regenerated: For it is an opinion not in the Margin and borders, but in the page and body, and too near the Center and vitall parts of the Gospel; if any offend, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to anger them with good-will to grace, I shall strive and study the revenge only of love, and compassion to their souls.</p>
            <p>If some of these Sermons came once to your Honors ears, and now to your eyes (it may be) with more English Language, I having stayed possibly till the last grapes were some riper, I hope it shall be pardoned that I am bold
<pb facs="tcp:29630:7"/>
to borrow your Name, which truly I should not have done, if I had not known of your practicall knowledge of this noble, and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Theame, the <hi>Free-grace of God</hi>: I could adde more of this, but I had rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Grace, then gracious persons: I know that <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who perfumeth and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Heaven, with his Royall presence, and streweth the <hi>Heaven of Heavens</hi> to its utmost borders with glory, is commended that hee was full of grace, a vessell filled to the lip, <hi>Ps.</hi> 45.2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.16. Yea, Grace hath bought both our person and our service, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.25. Even as he that buyeth a captive, gives money not only for his person, but for all the motion, toile, and labour of his body, legs and arms; and Redeeming Grace is so perfect, that <hi>Satan</hi> hath power possibly, <hi>to bid,</hi> but <hi>not to buy</hi> any of the Redeemed; no more then a merchant can buy another mans bought goods, without his consent: All our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that groweth here on the banks of time, is but thin sowen, as very <hi>Straw-berries</hi> on the Sea-sands, what good parts of nature we have without Grace, are like a fair Lilly, but there is a worm at the root of it, it withereth from the Root to the Top: Gifts wither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace without grace; Gifts neither break nor humble; Grace can do both. <hi>Grace</hi> is so much the more pretious and sweet, that though it be the result of sin in the Act of pardoning
<pb facs="tcp:29630:8"/>
and curing sinfull Lamenesse; yet it hath no spring but the bowels of God stirred and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led within him by onely spotlesse and holy goodnesse; <hi>Grace</hi> is of the Kings house from Heaven only, the matter, subject or person it dwelleth in, contributed nothing for the creation of so noble a branch. <hi>Christ</hi> for this cause especially, left the bosome of GOD, and was clothed with flesh and our nature, that he might be a Masse, a Sea, and boundlesse River of <hi>visible, living, and breathing Grace,</hi> swelling up to the highest banks of not only the habitable world; but the sides also of the <hi>Heaven of Heavens,</hi> to over-water <hi>Men and Angels.</hi> So as Christ was as it were <hi>Grace</hi> speaking. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Grace</hi> sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weeping, crying out of horrour, dying, withering for sinners, living again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32, 33.

For the subject, they are a History of a rare Miracle, wrought by <hi>Christ,</hi> in casting forth a Devil out of the Daughter of a <hi>Woman of Canaan</hi>; and for <hi>Christ</hi> to throw the Devill out of a Canaanite, was very like the white Banner of <hi>Christs</hi> Love displayed to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the <hi>Kings</hi> Royall Standard set up to gather in the Heathen under his colours. The parts of the Miracle are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The place where it was wrought, <hi>Math.</hi> 15.21.</p>

               </note> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being Gods fire, as every part of fire, is fire: so here every broken Parcell of Prayer, is Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; so the Forlorne son forgot the half of his Prayers, he resolved to say, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Make me as one of thy hired servants</hi>; but <hi>v.</hi> 21. He prayeth no such thing, <hi>and yet his Father fell on his neck and kissed him</hi>; a Plant is a tree in the potency, an infant man, seeds of saving grace, are saving grace; prayer is often in the bowels and womb of a sigh; though it come not out, yet God heareth it as a Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. <hi>And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29630:47"/>
he that scarcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the minde of the Spirit, because he maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for the Saints according to the will of God,</hi> Psal. 10.17. <hi>Lord thou hast heard the desire of the humble</hi>: Desires have no sound with men, so as they come to the ear, but with God they have a sound as Prayers have: Then when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cannot know what a groan meaneth, God knoweth what is under the lap of a sigh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Spirit made the sigh: he first made the Prayer as an intercessor, and then as God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it: he is within praying, and without hearing.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> The flesh may come in and joine in Prayer, and some things may be said in haste, not in Faith, as in that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Ps</hi>

I pray for a temporall favour; victory to Gods people in this battle, they lose the day: Yet I am heard and answered, because I prayed for that victory, not under the notion of victory, but as linked with mercy to the Church and the honour of Christ: So the <hi>formall object</hi> of my prayers was a spirituall mercy to the Church, and the honour of Jesus Christ. Now the Lord by the losse of the day, hath shewen mercy on his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in humbling them, and glorifieth his Son, in preserving a fallen people: So he heareth that which is spirituall in my prayers; he is not to hear the errors of them.

               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. These are no way contrary, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from both Principles are to walke in love and holinesse as Christ did; the Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting is not abolished by Grace, or by love to Christ, and this is no other then the reasoning of old <hi>Libertines; Paul</hi> said, Rom. 7.6. Now we are delivered from the Law. O then said <hi>Libertines; We may sin, and fleshly walking shall not prejudge salvation, nor condemn us,</hi> v. 7. <hi>What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? God forbid,</hi> and Rom. 5.20. <hi>Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</hi> Then said the <hi>Libertine,</hi> chap. 6.1. <hi>What shall we then say?

friends, speak with the same mouth, <hi>God forbid</hi> that we sin; we are not so freed from the commanding power of the Law, as that we sin not: when we do what is contrary to Gods law, we are so far under the Law, as not to sin, because the rule of Law is removed: nay, the <hi>Law</hi> backs a man while he come to Christ, and to glory; and Christ backs the Law, and saith, the <hi>Law forbiddeth you sin, I say Amen.</hi> Grace saith, <hi>sin not</hi>: and Christ also layeth new bands of love and obligation to thankfulnesse on us, not to sin, but removeth not the ancient bounds: Grace and condemnation are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site but not Grace and the commanding power of the Law.</p>

A childe is not born in one day; saving Grace is not Physick that worketh the cure while the sick man is sleeping: Christ casteth the mettall in the fire ere he form the Vessell of mercy; he must cast down old work, ere he lay the new foundation: 3.

What wouldst thou part with? What wouldst thou do or suffer for Christ?</hi> Now men cannot prize Christ, who have not found the terrors of the Law: So <hi>Paul</hi> finding himself the chief of sinners, and in that case saved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.

And therefore are none discouraged to come because of their wretched estate; that is to say, we cannot come, we have no money: But Christ inviteth these which have no money, &amp; though Christ seem to exclude the woman from mercy, yet Christ in wisdom holdeth forth the promise here in that latitude of Free-Grace; while as he saith, he came for the <hi>lost sheep</hi>; that there is room for the woman, and all believing Gentiles to come in, and lay hold on the Covenant; Sense of wretchednesse and unbelief representeth Christ

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:29630:95"/>
are chosen to life Eternal, &amp; it may be that I am one of those. 2. It is most untrue, that <hi>Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to siners as siners,</hi> for then Christ shuld belong to all unbelievers, how obstinate so ever, even to those that sin against the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Nay, Christ belongeth only to sinners elected to glory, as elected to glory in regard of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious purpose, and he belongeth only to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sinners as believing, in regard of actuall Union with Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 3.

This way of <hi>Libertines</hi> is a broad way for Sorcerers, Theeves, Murtherers, Paricides, Idolaters, remaining in that damnable state to believe; whereas sinners as such, sinners thus and thus qualified, are to believe; that is humbled, wearied, and self-condemned sinners only are to believe, and come to Christ. Its true, all sinners are obliged to believe; but to believe after the order of Free-Grace; that is, that they be first self-lost and sick, and then be saved by the Physitian.</p>

Consider how living a death it is to be killed doing a duty, and aiming to flee in to Christ; better die by Christs own hand (if so it must be) as by another: and better be buried, and lie dead at his feet, as to run away from him in a heavy desertion: if the believer must die, its better his grave to be made under the Throne, and under the feet of Jesus Christ, as to die in a state of strangenesse, and

If <hi>F. Spira</hi> go for a despairing Reprobate (which I dare not averre) yet when he said, he believed Christ was able to save him, but he doubted of his will; he must not be so understood, as if it were so indeed: Unbelievers know not all the mysterious turnings of lying &amp; self deceiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. Unbelief may lie to men of it self, when it dare belie the worth of that soul-redeeming ransome of <hi>Christs blood</hi>; if he that sinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> could believe the power of infinite mercy, he should also believe the will and inclination of infinite mercy, for the power of mercy is the very power of a mercifull will. I shall not then be afraid that soul is lost, which hath high and capacious apprehensions of the worth, value, dignity and power of that dear ransome, and of infinite mercy. Its faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this <hi>Gospel-truth,</hi> which is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>That
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:29630:107"/>
Christ is able to save to the utmost all those that come to him</hi>: if I believe soundly what free grace can do, I believe also soundly what free grace will do. Its true, Christ can save many, whom he never will save; but the faith of the power of mercie, and of his will to save, is of a far other consideration. 4. It must then be the prevailing of a temptation, not to dare to come to Christ, because I am a dog, and unworthy. 1. Because sin is no porter put to watch the door of Christs house of free-grace,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sin kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not the door of Christ to hold out sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>

That which maketh me unworthy, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and unfit to be saved, may make Christ worthy, and gracious to save; my sin may be Christs rich grace. Though sin maketh me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it maketh me a fit passive object for the Physitian Christ to work on; and maketh not Christ unworthy to save. If I feel sin, it then saith, Thou art the very person by name that Christ seeketh. Therefore is the sense of sin required as a condition in all that cometh to Christ, whether it be before conversion, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conversion, when acts of faith are renewed.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But we finde by experience, that true poverty of spirit,</hi>

by the word of truth. These may well consist together: 1. That felt and apprehended wretchednesse of a sinner, may stand with a sight of Christs riches of grace, is as evident, as the felt pain of the sting of the <hi>fiery Scorpion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Yea, the converted may well see grace and holinesse in himself, (else how shall he be thankfull to Christ the giver) and also see Christ, and beleeve his righteousnesse? for holy walking commeth under a threefold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration: 1. <hi>As a duty.</hi> 2. <hi>As a mean ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God that we should walk in,</hi> Eph. 2.10. 3. <hi>As a promise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Holy walking may bee felt by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in himself, and Christs excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy also.

               </note> 
               <hi>or a thing promised</hi> in the new Covenant: and in this threefold consideration, we may know how far we may build our peace upon any duties, as upon evidences of our state of grace; 1. as holy walking is a duty coming from us, its no ground of true peace, beleevers often seek in themselves what they should seek in Christ; this is naturall merit; often we argue from the measure of obedience to deny grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together; this is a false way, especially its a false way of logick, to argue Negatively, from want of such &amp; such a measure of obedience, to deny you are in Christ; how we may argue Affirmatively, we shall hear hereafter. 2. The dutie is Christs mean, not injoyned in a strict Law-way, but in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:29630:108"/>
a <hi>Gospel-way,</hi> as the commandement is oiled with a <hi>Gospel-spirit</hi> of love: Law and love are not contrary, as <hi>Antinomians</hi> do imagine; Christ has united, not only persons, but also graces and vertues. This way the duty is a mean, and a way, not to the right of salvation, but to the actuall possession of it; and as it is, or standeth stated before us in the letter of the Gospel, in a Morall commanding, or a Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or directing way, without the efficacy of grace, it can be nothing but a Doctrinall-mean, no more then the Law-way is; for all <hi>Gospel-precepts</hi> without grace, are as little available to us, as the Law: But in the third Notion, holy walking as performed by that efficacious grace promised in the Covenant of grace; is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument on which we may build our peace, not as a cause, or a merit-deserving peace, but as a grace threeded upon the free promise of God:<note place="margin">

                  </p>
               </note> so the Saints have builded upon their sincere walking, as on a fruit of the Covenant of Grace promised to us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. for so duties speak the mercies promised in the Covenant, 38. <hi>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever:</hi> See <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.27. <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.13. Upon this ground <hi>Ezekiah</hi> pleadeth with God, when he heard the sentence of death, Isa. 38.3. <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight:</hi> And <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:29630:108"/>
putteth his faith upon this, as a gracious fruit of grace promised in the Covenant of Grace: So <hi>David</hi> pleadeth, and in faith, Psal. 86.2. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve my soul</hi>; here is a prayer in faith, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon what ground, <hi>for I am holy.</hi> Now this would seem Pharisaicall, and merit-like, if holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse did not relate to the free promise of the Covenant of Grace, in which God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and tyed himself by Covenant, to make his own children holy; and also is resolved upon a proposition of the covenant of grace. God hath both promised to cause his covenanted ones walk before him in truth, as did <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> as we have it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. and he has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to save and deliver the upright in heart: as is clear, <hi>Ps.</hi> 50.23. <hi>Ps.</hi> 34.15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Ps.</hi> 145.18, 19. So all the peace we can collect, for our comfort, from holy walking is resolved on a promise of free-grace, and the duty as perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the grace of the covenant, may and doth lead us to the promise, &amp; so no wise from Christ but to Christ. Holy walking, is a faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and a true witnesse may lead any accused man to Law-right: holinesse may lead me to the promise, and that is good Law-right: if we cannot gather any assurance of our spirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state from holy duties in us, such as are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall obedience, sincerity in keeping closse to Christ, and love to the Saints, because they may deceive us, and may be in Hypocrites, as Doctor <hi>Crispe</hi> saith, then may faith also deceive us, for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29630:109"/>
there be as many kindes of false faiths, as there be of counterfeit loves to the Saints: and there is somewhat of Christ peculiar to the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their love, obedience, and sincerity, which they may discern to be a saving Character, and badge of Christ, no lesse then in faith: 2. But here's the mystery, neither faith, nor any thing inherent in us, can yeeld us certainty that we are in Christ, or any peace with God, in regard all grace, all evidences of our good estate is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us in Christ, inherent holinesse and duties are but fancies; When we then refuse the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of God, and Peace from holy walking, as its thred, and linked to the Promise, we refuse Christ; especially, under desertion, wee bid Christ look away from us; and there's a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of unbelieving sorrow, so that <hi>Rachel</hi> will not be comforted: But when we refuse Christs comforts, we refuse himself; she who refuseth to accept of a Bracelet, or of a Gold-ring from him who s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

pardoned, and he ought to have no act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse, nor reluctance of conscience, which is <hi>Gods Solicitour,</hi> before the committing of it: For how is it not equally an act of the flesh and unbeleef to fear sin to be committed as not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in Christ, as to fear sin already committed as not pardoned? 2.

But this is (I conceive) rare: and give me leave to say, Princes at their Coronation do some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary acts of <hi>Grace,</hi> by priviledge of the new Crown, that they may hansell the new Throne with acts of Mercy: Christ was now in an act of pure, unmixed <hi>Grace</hi> actually and formally redeeming the lost world, on the Crosse, and was now this day crowned by his Mother the <hi>Church,</hi> and installed <hi>King-Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> of Saints, and therefore would hansell Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise with a sinner, by a priviledge of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>Grace</hi>; there is but one example of it in all the Scripture.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Asser.</hi> 1. There is a double Notion of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as D. <hi>Abbot</hi> teacheth us: There is a universall, and prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>y so called, justification:
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29630:129"/>
There is a partiall and unproperly so called, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification: or give me leave to say: There is a justification of the person, of the estate; or a justification repeated, or rather a reiterated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: I doubt if it be called a justification.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>There is a twofold conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not two justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, far lesse are there not many.</hi>
               </note> The former justification doth include: 1. The Act of Atonement, made by Christ on the Crosse, for all the sins of all the Elect of God, past, present and to come: this Act is not tyed to believing, nor are we properly justified in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this Act. But, 2. There is a justification formall, of which <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and 4. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 4, and 5. Chapters, which goeth along in order of cause, time, and a required condition of apprehending Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and this justification of the person, while he believeth, is but once done, and that when the believer doth first lay hold on Christ and righteousnesse, imputed in his blood. There is, 3. A remission, and taking away of sin: Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these are we to consider of doing away sin, in a threefold Notion: for though justification essentially include remission and pardon of sin,<note place="margin">Ass. 2. <hi>Sins in three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> yet every remission doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude justification, properly so called.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Asser.</hi> 2. This threefold taking away of sins, I clear from the Scripture: 1. Christ taketh away our sins on the Crosse, <hi>causatively,</hi> and by way of merit, while as he suffereth for our sins on the Crosse: So, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world.</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:29630:130"/>
1 Cor. 5.21. <hi>He was made sin for us.</hi> Col. 2.14. <hi>Christ blotted out the hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that was against us, which was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the Crosse.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>Who, his own self bare our sins on the tree.</hi> Isa. 53.10. <hi>He made his soul an offering for sin.</hi> This Atonement of blood was typified in <hi>Aaaron,</hi> who <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.20, 21. was to lay both his hands on the head of the <hi>Live-goat,</hi> and to confesse the sins of the people, and did translate them off from the people; <hi>so as the Goat was to bear upon him all their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, unto a land not inhabited,</hi> v. 22. Now this was the paying of a ransome for us, and a legall translation of the eternall punishment of our sins; but it is not justification, nor ever called justification: there is a sort of imputation of sin to Christ here, and a summe paid for me: but, with leave,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christs satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on the Cross for sin, is not formall justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>no formall imputation,</hi> no forinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and no personall Law-reckoning to me, who am not yet born, far lesse cited before a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and absolved from sin: when Christ had compleatly paid this summe, Christ was justified Legally, as a publike person, and all his seed <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally, meritoriously, causatively,</hi> but not in their persons.</p>
            <p>There is a second removall of sin, and that is when the beleever is justified by faith: <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4.6. <hi>Even as David</hi> (saith he) <hi>also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth the blessednesse of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousnesse without works:</hi> 7.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:29630:130"/>
(saying) <hi>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered</hi>: 8. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no sin:</hi> This is the blessednesse of a man born, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, beleeving: Now we say unproperly, the heirs of a King not born are blessed; <hi>Non entis nulla sunt accidentia.</hi> So if Christs removall of sins on the Crosse, were justification, all Christs seed, and we believers of the Gentiles, who were not then born, when Christ died, should be blessed, and justified before we be born. Now in this which is formally the justification of the believing sinner, the believers person is accepted, reconciled, justified, and really translated by a Law-change, from one state to another.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>There is a change in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
               </note> I mean not, that there is a Physicall infusion of a new habit of sanctification, and an expulsion of an old habit, as <hi>Papists</hi> teach, confounding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or sanctification, with justification. But there is a reall change of the state of the person, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified</hi> &amp;c. then they were sometime not justified. 2. There is here a reall removall of all sins, and a pardon and relaxation from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall punishment of all sins; as well of sins to come, and not yet committed, as of sins past, present, and already committed; so as sins not yet committed, shall no more involve the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in the punishment of eternall wrath then sins past, or present.

though virtually pardoned,<note place="margin">

David,</hi> before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted this horrible guilt of murther and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, was <hi>a man according to Gods own heart,</hi> and so his person was justified; this way God daily taketh away sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>For therein is the righteousnesse of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, the just shall live by faith</hi>: Now the life of faith justifying, is not one single act of faith, such as is at ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:29630:131"/>
in faith. In this sense remission is a continued and one prorogated act of free grace, from our first moment of believing, to the day of putting the crown on our head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any object that I am contrary to my self, in that I sometimes did write, that justification is a plenary Pardon in one indivisible act of all sins, past, present, and to come, and therefore sin cannot be oftner then once Pardoned:</hi> If I should answer that the knowledge we have, especially in so supernaturall a mystery, is but the twilight or the day-Stars glimmering of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, it might suffice, but I judge that I speak nothing contrary to that.</p>

               <hi>Asser.</hi> 3. For two formall justifications of a Beleever I utterly deny,<note place="margin">Ass. 3. <hi>There is but one justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a believer.</hi>
               </note> which is that which <hi>Arminians</hi> presse not a little; yea, and the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of the person, and his acceptance in Gods favour is but one act: I never fall from that acceptance once being in Court and Grace.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:29630:132"/>
looked at him as a judge doth at a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whose person he absolveth from all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because his surety hath given a ransom for him, and he holdeth forth that ransom to the Judge, but the man in all his after faults is so far forth a sinner, as that which he hath done, though he be a justified <hi>David, displeaseth the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.27. And in so far is he pardoned; but God now looketh on him, as a Father on an offending Son; and this Son doth not hold forth a new ransome to God, but onely renew the former: nor doth it infer a new acceptance of his person, that he had not before: 3. Nor place in God any new love of free complacency and good will, but only a further manifestation thereof, and a greater measure of the love of benevolence: 4. It is the same Act of Free-Grace that God putteth forth in pardoning his son now fallen in sin, and in accepting his person at first. 2. Its the same ransome of Christs ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of his dear blood, that his Faith layeth hold on now, as before. 3. The pardon of this sin committed by a justified son, is not the freeing of him from the eternall punishment of this sin, as if he had been under eternall wrath for it before; for at his first beleeving, when his person was accepted, he was fully and freely pardoned and freed from all the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to eternall wrath, that all or any of his sins past, present, or to come might subject him unto, but it is the renewing of the certainty of the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency

of Christs ransom, as applyed to take away that sin in particular, and that by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Act of Faith; now the renewed appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the Grace of God in the same ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of blood for righteousnesse in Christ, as applied to this new guiltinesse, maketh not a new forinsecall and Law-act, but doth only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Lords first Act of Grace to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sin;<note place="margin">

And because he believeth not, he is lyable to the <hi>wrath of God</hi>; now he is not condemned, because he doth not to his own sense know, feel and apply the Remission of sins and satisfaction purchased in Christs blood for him, because then he should be condemned, because he doth not believe a lie, for there was never any such Remission pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for him; he is condemned, not for want of sense and actuall knowledge of any such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but for want of confiding on Christ, as on him who hath made a sufficient atonement for all that believeth, and so justifying Faith is some other thing then the sense of purchased Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sins.</p>

               </note> 2. There is the guilt of sin; that is somewhat which issueth from this blot and blacknesse of sin; according to which the person is liable and obnoxious to eternall punishment: this is the debt of sin, the Law-obligation to satisfaction passive for sin; just as there be two things in debt, so these two are in sin: for when a man borroweth money, and profusely and lavishly spendeth it, this is unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice against his brother, in matter of his goods, and a breach of the eighth Commandment: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this breach in relation to policie to the Magistrate, and the Law of the land, putteth this broken man under another relation, that he is formally a debter, and so it is just, that he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pay the money, or suffer for this act of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:29630:138"/>
and satisfie the Law of the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: which is, that he satisfie the Law, and the Magistrate, the publike Father, tutor of a wronged and oppressed brother. Now here be two things in debt:<note place="margin">2. <hi>things in debt, as in sin.</hi>
               </note> 1. An unjust thing; a hurting of our brother in his goods: this is a blot, and a thing privatively contrary to justice. 2. A just thing, a guilt, a just debt, according to which it is most just, that the broken man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pay or suffer: Now these two, as all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries do, <hi>Faciunt numerum,</hi> they make a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; as just and unjust must be two things, and two contrary things: I know there be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and subtilties of School-men, touching the blot, or <hi>Macula peccati,</hi> and <hi>Reatus,</hi> the guilt of sin; but this is the naked truth which I have declared. Some say <hi>the blot of sin is that uncleannesse of sin which is washed away by the blood of the Lord Jesus, and this is nothing but the very guilt of sin, which is wholly removed in Justification.</hi> But I easily answer: The blot of sin hath divers relations, and these contrary one to another: As, 1. There is the blot of sin in relation to the holy Law, as it is a privation of the rectitude and holinesse that the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law requireth; and it is formally sin, and not the guilt of sin; in which consideration, as nothing removeth blindnesse,<note place="margin">

As sin is contrary to the righteousnesse and holinesse of the Law, it is formally sin, and this essentiall form, and life of sin remaineth in us while we live sin being in an act of dying, or a passion rather to be crucified, and in the way to its grave and perfect destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which shall be, when Glory shall grow up out of the stalk of Grace, and sanctification shall be perfected; for Grace is the bud, Glory the fruit; Grace the Spring and Summer, Glory the Harvest. 2. As sin is a blacknesse contrary to the innocency that the Law requireth, and as it blotteth and defileth the soul, it is a <hi>Macula,</hi> a spot, a filthy and deformed thing, abasing the creature, making the creature black, crooked, defiled, like the skin of the Ethiopian, or spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like the Leopard, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. 3.

and unclean thing to <hi>God,</hi> and that two wayes: 1. As it is contrary to Gods holy Law, its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally sin, as is before said: 2.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, that which our blessed Surety took upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> him for our cause, without taking to him any thing which is essentiall in sin, such as is, to be a Sinner like us, to do violence, to be justly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of sin, that is different from sin: But Christ took on him the guilt of our sin; that is, the actuall obligation to be punished for sin, while <hi>as he bare our sins in his own body on the Tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>And was wounded for our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and bruised for our iniquities, and did bear on him the chastisement of our Peace,</hi> Isa. 53.5.

6.7.8. and 7.22. Now that in all his life and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings he did no violence, committed no sin, nor touched any contagion of sinne in his own person is evident, because he was <hi>holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is sure, for if Christ was so made sin, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for sin, and liable to suffer for sin, and yet had not any sinfull or blame-worthy, guilt on him, then that guilt of the person by which any is liable to punishment for sin, is some other thing then sin, and the blame-worthy guilt that is in sin; forasmuch, as they are really separated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one being in Christ and the other not being in him, nay nor could it be in him.</p>

The cause cannot be one &amp; the same with the effect, nor the subject and fundament one with the adjunct, and that which resulteth from the fundament. But sin is the cause, fundament and subject, from which, guilt or actuall obligation to punishment issueth, because therefore is the sinner under guilt-personall, and actuall obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to punishment, because he hath sinned, and is under the guilt of transgression, as he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Law and justice a guilt-debter to suffer evill of punishment, because against Law and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice he is a bad deserving sinner, in doing against, and so by a <hi>(reatus culpae)</hi> a sin-guilt, hath transgressed a Law; for all evill of punishment, is a daughter which lay in the womb of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of sin; and the guilt of the latter ill of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:29630:140"/>
must flow from the former; to wit, from the ill of sin; so, to be guilty, or obliged to eternall punishment, is a fruit, and result or consequent of the fundamentall and intrinsecall guilt of sin. 3. An unjust and sinfull deviation from the holy will of God revealed in his Law, and hatefull to, and punishable by God, cannot be one and the same thing with that which is just, and agreeable to the just and holy will of God; but sin it self, in its formall being, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the holy will of God revealed in his Law; sin being defined by <hi>John, A trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the Law,</hi> and is hatefull to, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by the Lord: But the guilt of sin, of which we now speak, is nothing but the deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and actuall obligation to eternall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is no unjust thing, no transgression of Gods will revealed in his Law: yea, the deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of sin is a most just thing, and the actuall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation to punishment is most just, and holy, and agreeable to <hi>Gods just will,</hi> and obligation to punishment can neither be punishable, nor hatefull to God; yea, it is just with God that the sinner be under Law-obligation, to eat the fruits of the tree of his own planting, to have his teeth set on edge with the sowre grapes that he eat himself. 4. He that borroweth money, and profusely and lavishly spendeth it, is in that a transgressor against the eighth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, he committeth an act of unjustice against his brother; now this act of unjustice cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally

or intrinsecally be the sin or sinfull guilt of the innocent surety; no Law of God, or man can make actions evill and sinfull, that are Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, inherently, intrinsecally, really the unjust actions of the doer, the formall sin, or intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and fundamentall sinfull guilt of another man, who in that action is innocent, and is not a member, an hand or a foot of the man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that fault, which I speak for; the sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who intrinsecally sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and by Gods Supream will were made a part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>: yet the surety is formally made a debter, and by Law obliged to pay the debt, and its an act of justice that he pay the debt, his promise to the creditour maketh him a debter, but his promise to the creditour putteth no act of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in lavishly spending his neighbours goods on him, for in that he is innocent, and cannot be charged morally, as a faulty and a broken bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, the fruit and effect of the broken mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice doth only lie upon him, in regard of his promise.

But though it be true in a legal sense, that the surety is the broken man; yet it is true, only in regard of the Law punishment, or <hi>Malum poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> the ill of punishment, that is laid upon him: For I take Dr <hi>Crisps</hi> words from his own pen; <hi>Suppose</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Malefactor should be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, Guilty, or not guilty?

He meaneth he hath not done the Fact that was laid to his charge:</hi> Then not to do the Fact of sin, to Dr. <hi>Crispe,</hi> is not to be guilty: Now I assume, But Jesus Christ did never any sinfull fact, as he also confesseth, then Christ was punished for sin, and yet was never guilty of sin, this must be the greatest unjustice in the world to punish a man for sin, altogether free of the guilt of sin; except <hi>Antinomians</hi> distinguish with us, between sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full guilt, and penall guilt, called <hi>Reatus culpae,</hi> and <hi>Reatus poenae,</hi> or <hi>Reatus personae, seu poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialis,</hi> and <hi>Reatus formalis, seu actualis,</hi> they shall never expede themselves.</p>

               </note> yet intrinsecally they are not one, the broken Debtor as such may be an unjust man, and the Surety a faithfull and just man; so that the surety, as a satisfying Surety, removeth only the punishment due to the Debtor for his unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; but he removeth not formally unjustice, except he be such a Surety as Christ, who can both pay the debt, &amp; so remove the ill of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and also infuse holinesse, and sanctifie and remove the evill of sin; hence in justification formally, Christ only taketh away the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of everlasting fire, and eternall condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion due to sin; but he removeth not sin it self; sin it self is removed in sanctification, and by degrees; justification taketh the sting out

of the Serpent, but doth not formally kill the Serpent; the Serpent is killed by another act of Grace, by infused and perfected sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; justification is a forinsecall and a Legall Act, and removeth the power of the Law, which involveth the sinner in a curse: Now the strength or the Legall <hi>sting of sin is the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56.

And the assurance that Christ hath pardoned sin, and hath removed the penall guilt, the punishment of Eternall condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from sin, but that the conscience should be quiet; that is, that it should not have also a care to believe that Christ wil sanctifie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perfect his good work in us, is most false; for though a soul be justified and freed from the guilt of Eternall punishment, and so the spirit is no more to be afraid and disquieted for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wrath and Hell, which should never have been feared as the greatest evill, in regard that sin as sin is more to be feared then Hell as Hell; yet there be two other acts of disquietnesse of spirit laudable and commendable, even in the Saints after they are justified; and the guilt of

               </note> 1. Many dare not question their state of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp; so are freed from the storms of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended wrath, arising from the guilt of sin: yet there is another storm, within the bowels of the Sea, arising from the indwelling of the body of guilt, the storm before justification is lesse free, lesse ingenuous, more servile, as looking to that Eternall wrath, hanging over the soul for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned sin: this is more free, and is a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, a gracious, and heavenly storm raised, not for sin unpardoned, &amp; the Eternal punishment thereof: but for sin as sin, as indwelling, not for the penall guilt and the sting of Hell in sin, but for the sinfull guilt and the wounding of Christ. 2. Its unpossible this latter storme can be in the soul, till the sentence of justification be pronounced; as none can have the moved bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of a son, for the offence of a Father, till he be a son.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another case is, that many have an absolute, loose, and laxe peace and calmnesse, great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of deliverance from Eternall wrath; and so of a supposed pardon, whose peace is convinced to be but a base outside, and meer paintry and fairding because there is in them no
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:29630:156"/>
storm for sin as sin, and for the over-motions of boiling lusts; no tendernesse to walk spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A Faith that eateth out the bottome and bowels of conscience, of declining sin and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God: is the justification of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians,</hi> of the old <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> of the naturall men: all our professors are cured, none or few are healed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Full assurance that Christ hath delivered <hi>Paul</hi> from condemnation: yea, so full and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as produceth thanksgiving and triumphing in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2. may, and doth consist with complaints and outcryes of a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched condition, for the indwelling of the body of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14, 15, 16.23, 24. Then the justified that are whole, not sick, not pained, are yet in their sins, and not justified, what ever <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> say on the contrary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The flesh in the justified cannot complain of indwelling sin; but the flesh mixt with some life of Christ, may raise a false Alaram of sins not pardoned, which are really pardoned; some false grief may and often hath its rise from a false and imaginary ground, as a sanctified soul may praise God through occasion of a lying report of the victory of the Church of God, when there is no such matter; a sanctified child may spiritually mourn for the supposed death of his Father, or that he hath offended his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the flesh, when his Father is neither dead, nor offended at all: So gracious
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:29630:156"/>
affections, as gracious, may work spiritually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on supposed and false grounds when there is no cause; as that the soul hath grieved his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and that he is displeased, when it is not so.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> Sin indwelling is a greater evill, then the feared evill of ten hells; and therefore there is more cause of sorrow for sin, confession, disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse of spirit, after justification then before; because sin the only true object of fear and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse of spirit, is both a ghuest dwelling in the soul, and is more really and distinctly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as a spirituall evil, after the light of faith hath shown us the sinfulnesse of sin, then ever it was discovered to be before.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I doubt, if justified souls are to be refuted in their complaints and fears for the indwelling of sin, providing, they fear not eternall wrath, which fear is contrary to faith; and so they fear not, and sorrow not, for that God hath changed the Court, and the wind of his love turned in the contrary air, and he hath forgotten to be mercifull.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Faith chargeth us to believe that <hi>Grace</hi> shall at length finally subdue sin, and as boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men labour with oars to promove their course in sailing, even when the wind, sails and tide are doing somewhat to promove the course; so doth faith, <hi>which purifieth the heart,</hi> set the soul on work to <hi>perfect holinesse in the fear of God,</hi> and believeth also, that God shall work both to will and to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:29630:157"/>Its not then good Physick for many exercised in conscience, especially after their first conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to apply only the honey and sweetnesse of consolations of the Gospel, as if there were not any need of humiliation and sorrow for sin: Yet it is to be cleared,<note place="margin">

               </note> that 1. Sorrow for sin is no satisfaction for sin; for the pride of merit is crafty, and can creep in at a smal hole.

They are tenderly to be bound up, and comforted, in whom sin riseth up with a witnesse. O what pity, and humble on-looking should be here?

So the Scripture speaketh, Jer. 2.22. <hi>For though thou wash thee with Nitre, and take thee much sope, yet thy iniquity is marked before me. Borith,</hi> is an hearb that Fullers use for washing and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, yet is sin such a Leopard-spot, that no Art,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:29630:158"/>
no industry of of the creature can remove it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. <hi>The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and the point of a diamond, it is graven upon the table of their heart, and the horns of your Altars.</hi> There is writ remaining after sin is acted. 2. Writ written with a pen of iron, and diamond, to endure for eternity. 3. Not written onely, but ingraved, and indented upon the conscience, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. When <hi>David</hi> rent the rob of <hi>Saul,</hi> his heart smote him, so that it left a hole, or the mark of the stripe behinde it; as when a burning iron is put on the face of an evill-doer, it leaveth behinde it a brand, or a stigma. 2. This is terrible, that this brand is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall; as the Prophet prayeth, Psal. 109.14. <hi>Let the iniquities of his fathers be remembred with the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be botted out.</hi> 15. <hi>Let them be before the Lord continually.</hi> O dreadfull! The sins of wicked men shal stand up in heaven before the justice of God, so long as God shal live, and that is for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever: So the Lord sweareth, <hi>By the excellency of Jacob</hi>; That is, by himself, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.7. <hi>Surely, I will never forget any of their works,</hi> Joh. 10.8. <hi>All that ever came before me, all that came not in by me,</hi> the Door, and the Way, <hi>they are <gap reason="foreign">

To be delivered from eternall debt, and intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an eternall Kingdom, is a life most desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, &amp; maketh the sinner to stand in the books of Christ, as the eternally ingaged debtor of Grace.

Faiths day-light should discover to you, that this finest part of that web of Creation, with which you desire to cloth your precious soul, is but base wool and rotten thred, and though beautifull and well dyed to the eye; yet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.26. <hi>The heavens, even all of them shall wax old like a garment</hi>: And the wisdome of Faith knoweth a shop where there's a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent suit of clothes for the soul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2.

            <p n="2">2. The creatures are below the affections of the believer, and his affections conquer them, as having the vantage of the mount above all the creatures.

The Martyrs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. had poor and weak thoughts of this life, and <hi>would not accept</hi> and welcome life and <hi>deliverance</hi> from death; but had strong acts of Faith and love toward <hi>a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter resurrection.</hi> Its a souls strong Faith that bringeth him to <hi>nil admirari</hi>; and to wonder at nothing.

Let your affections move toward the creature, without sound of feet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There must be self-forsaking in believing. 1. An affirming, and an (ay) to grace, is a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deniall to it self, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>I labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more abundantly then they all; Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me:</hi> To deny that you are Christs, or that you have any grace, (if Christ have any thing of his in you) is not self-deniall, but grace deniall, and God-deniall,

deny the work of the spirit, and deny himself. Its a saying of humility, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5. <hi>I am black,</hi> and of Faith, <hi>but comely as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</hi> And <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>I slept, but my heart waked.</hi> Its Faith to hold fast your state of adoption: <hi>Lord, I am thine.</hi> 2. When our self maketh a suit to self, and putteth in a bill to the flesh. <hi>O pitie thy self. Rejoice, O young man in thy youth.</hi> Its self-renouncing to deny this request to the flesh: And Faith only can give an answer to self-declining the crosse. <hi>He that denieth me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, him will I deny before my Father and his holy Angels</hi> (saith Christ.) And another answer Faith giveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. I am not debtor to thee, O flesh. I owe thee nothing. And its Faiths word of answer, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11.9. <hi>But know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee unto judgement.</hi> 3. Faith putteth the soul in that condition, that self may be plucked from self, without great violence, as an apple full of the tree, and of harvest-sap, is with a small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pluckt off the stalk, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.13. <hi>I am ready <gap reason="foreign">

Certainly Faith</hi> saw here more in Jesus of excellency and sweetnesse, then there could be of bitternes in bonds and death to self.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There's a deniall of the creature, and a bill of defiance sent to all the lovers of the world,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:29630:180"/>
when <hi>Ephraim</hi> is brought to this act of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.3. <hi>For in thee the Fatherlesse fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth mercy.</hi> Then its said, <hi>Ashur shall not save us: We will not ride upon horses.</hi> That crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that we trust on, we ride upon it, as <hi>Israel</hi> did upon the horses of <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But in this regard, Faith dismounteth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and abaseth him to walk on foot. All the creatures are ships to the believer without a bottome: They are empty and weak: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> forbiddeth us to ride on a Prince, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146.3, 4. For that horse shall faint, and fall to clay. God alloweth <hi>Scotland</hi> to help <hi>England,</hi> but will not have the souls of his children in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to ride upon an Army of another Nation, and to trust in them for salvation. To make fire, is not so proper to fire, To give light, not so kindly to the Sun, as salvation is <hi>Gods</hi> only due, and therefore let <hi>England</hi> in this walk on foot, and trust in the Lord.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth ingredient also in Faith, is, that its bottomed upon the sense and pain of a lost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Poverty is the nearest capacity of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. This is Faiths method, <hi>Be condemned,</hi> and be saved. <hi>Be hanged,</hi> and be pardoned. <hi>Be sick,</hi> and be healed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. Faith is a floor of Christs only planting, yet it groweth out of no soil, but out of the margin and bank of the lake of fire and brimstone, in regard there be none so fit for <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> as those who are self-sick,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:29630:181"/>
and self-condemned to <hi>Hell.</hi> This is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Christ, that because the man is broken, and has not bread; therefore he must be sold, and Christ must buy him, and take him home to his fireside, and clothe him, and feed him. The chased man, pursued upon death and life, who hath not a way for life, but one nick of a rock; if he misse that, he is a dead man, had he a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred lives. So is the believer pursued for blood, there is but one City of refuge in Heaven, or out of Heaven; this is only, only Jesus Christ the great rock. And it is true, its in a manner forced Faith, and forced love cast upon Christ upon a great venture; yet we may make ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity here the greatest vertue, or the highest grace, and that is to come to Christ. <hi>Satan</hi> doth but ride upon the weaknesse of many, proving, that they are not worthy of Christ, which is the way of a <hi>Sophist,</hi> to prove an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth that cannot be denied. But there's no greater vantage can be had against <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> then this; because I am unworthy of Christ, and out of measure sinfull, and I finde it is so, (<hi>Satan</hi> and conscience teaching me that truth, to bring me on a false conclusion) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought I, therefore must I come to Christ unworthy as I am. For free-grace is moved from within it self from Gods good will, only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any motion or action from sin, to put it self forth upon the sinner; to the end, that sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceeding sinfull, <hi>Grace</hi> may be abundantly
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:29630:181"/>
               <hi>Grace</hi>; and no thanks to <hi>Satan</hi> for suggesting a true principle (<hi>Thou art unworthy of Christ</hi>) to promove a false conclusion, (<hi>Therefore thou art not to come to Christ</hi>) for the contrary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing is, <hi>Gospel-logick. Satans</hi> reasoning should be good, if there were no way but the law to give life. But because there is a Saviour, a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and a new and living way to Heaven: The contrary arguing is, the sinners life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The sixt Ingredient in Faith is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Faith hath five notes of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in closing with the promise.</hi>
               </note> that the sinner can lay hold on the Promise. 1. Not simply, but with relation to the precept; for presumptuous souls plunge in their foul souls in fair and precious promises, and this is the Faith of <hi>Antinomians,</hi> for the promise is not holden forth to sinners as sinners, but as to such sinners, for we make Faith to be an act of a sinner hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, wearied, laden, poor, self-condemned; now these be not all sinners, but only some kinde of sinners. <hi>Antinomians</hi> make faith an act of a lofty Pharisee, of one vilde person, applying with an immediate touch, <hi>immediato contactu,</hi> his hot boiling, &amp; smoking lusts to Christs wounds, blood, merits, without any conscience of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Commandement, that the person thus beleeving, should be humbled, wearied, loaden, grieved for sin. I confess this is hasty hot work, and maketh Faith a stride, or one single step; but its a wanton, fleshly, and a presumptuous immediate work to lay hold on the promises of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:29630:182"/>
mercy and be saved: This is the absolute and loose Faith, that <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth our Doctrine withall, because we reject all foregoing merits, good works, congruous dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, preparations moving God to convert this man, because he hath such preparations; and to reject and to leave another man to his own hardnesse of heart, because he hath no such payment in hand, by which he may redeem and buy conversion, and the grace of Effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; especially, they building all upon a <hi>Babel</hi> of their own brick and clay, that free-will in all acts of obedience before or after conversion, is absolutely indifferent to do, or not do; to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, or not obey; to choose Heaven and life, hell or death, as it pleaseth, as being free and loosed from all Praedetermination, and fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motion, acting or bowing of the will, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming either from Gods naturall or his efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or supernaturall Providence. And so the <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> on the one extremity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throneth nature, and extolleth proud merit, and abaseth <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Free-grace:</hi> The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milist, Libertine,</hi> and <hi>Antinomian,</hi> on a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extremity and opposition, turn man into a block, and make him a meer patient in the way to Heaven; and under pretence of exalting <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Free-grace,</hi> set up the flesh, liberty, licence, loosenesse on the throne, and make the way to heaven on the other extremity as broad, as to comply with all presumptuous proud
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:29630:182"/>
fleshly men, walking after their lusts, and yet (as they dream) believing in Christ. 2. The soul seeth Christ in all his beauty, excellency, treasures of Free-grace lapped up with the curtain of many precious promises; now the naturall man knowing the literall meaning and sense of the promises, seeth in them but words of gold, and things a far off; and in truth, taketh heaven to be a beautifull and golden phancy; and the <hi>Gospel-promises,</hi> a shower of pretious <hi>Rubies, Saphirs, Diamonds,</hi> fallen out of the clouds only in a night dream; and therefore jeers and scoffs at the day of judgment and at heaven and hell, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. For can every capacity smell and taste the unsearchable riches of Christ, the fulnesse of God in the womb of the promises, by meditating on them, and sending them, in their sweetnesse and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly excellency, down to the affections to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them? No, it cannot be, that words and sounds, and syllables, can so work upon a natural spirit: If you show not to a buyer pretious and rare commodities, and bring them not before the sun, he shall never be taken so with things hidden in your coffers, as to be in love with them, and <hi>to sell all he hath</hi> and <hi>buy them</hi>; Preachers cannot, nay, its not in their power to make the natural spirit see the beauty of Christ; <hi>Paul</hi> Preacheth it, but the Gospel is hidden from the blinded man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. If I cannot Communicate light, far lesse can I infuse love in

the soul of a lost man. 3. Literall knowledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is not in the power of naturall men; but laying down this ground, that a <hi>Pharisee</hi> lend eyes and ears to Christ and his miracles;<note place="margin">

His light, which is but literall, is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to him, it but vexeth him to know <hi>Christ,</hi> and if a beam of light fall in on the apple of the eye of a natural conscience, its a throne between the bone and the flesh, the man shall not sleep, and yet he is not sick. I doubt if either <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> wakened with their light could sleep. 2. Though a promise should dispute and argue Christ in at the door of the natural mans soul, as the <hi>Gospel</hi> by way of arguing may doe much, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.28. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.37. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:29630:183"/>
they have both seen, and hated both me and my Father.</hi> Yet men may see the principles and the conclusion, and hate and practically suspend the assent from the conclusion. 3. Conversion is feared as a great danger by naturall men, lest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the promises put them on the pain and the main mill of godlinesse. For men do flee nothing but that which they apprehend as evil, dangerous, and so the true object of fear. Now when <hi>Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> were both upon the wheels, I cannot say that Conversion <hi>formally</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; yet <hi>materially</hi> it was, the one trembled, and so was afraid, and fled, and did put <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way till another time; then he saw the danger of Grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. <hi>vers.</hi> 25, 26.

to Glory: It being one of Gods secrets not revealed in the Word, but made manifest to me, <hi>After I beleeve, and am sealed unto the day of Redemption</hi>: and therefore in a humble resting on Christ, though the soul know not his Election, which is not revealed in the word in that condition there can be no Pride nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; for he is self wise, and presumptuous, who intrudeth <hi>into those things that he hath not seen, Col.</hi> 2.18. knoweth not that which <hi>God</hi> hath revealed, and so which he ought to know; now the believer ought not to know, that he is elected to glory; he yet being an unbeleever, so his knowledge cannot deviate from a rule which doth not oblige to conformity therewith as with a Rule; the Pourtract of <hi>Caesar</hi> doth not erre from the samplar, because it is not like a Bull or a Horse, because neither a Bull nor a Horse is the due samplar.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To warrant an unworthy humble sinner to beleeve there's no need of a positive War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or of a voice to say <hi>(thou art elected to glory, therefore believe) the word is near thee in thy mouth</hi>; yea there is a commandement laid upon the humbled sinner (<hi>Come O weary and loaden sinner to Christ, and be eased)</hi> Now when the wind bloweth sweetly and fair upon an humbled siner, who is elected to glory, there goeth the Spirit of the Gospel along with this Commandement; and the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and the spirit united in one, acteth

and worketh so upon the soul, that the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled sinner cannot be deluded and led on a rock of presumption; for this spirit joyneth and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with his spirit, and he as one of Christs sheep, knoweth this to be the voice of Christ. I grant when the same command of faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ears of a Reprobate, he may upon a false ground believe, or rather presume: he neither being rightly humbled, and fitted for Christ, nor can the Reprobate know and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the wind of the spirit, breathing with the command, and acting upon his spirit, because that winde neither can, nor doth breath upon any Reprobate, and there is no need of any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Warrant to ascertain a child of God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, beside the commandment of Faith in lived and quickned with the spirit going along with it, for that command so quickned doth put such a reall stamp of an evident testimony, that he hath claime to Christ, on whom the spirit and the command doth so act, that he seeketh no more any other evidence to prove his claim to Christ, then the Lamb needeth any evidence to prove, that of ten hundred sheep, this only that offereth to it her paps and milk must be its dam or mother, and none of the rest of the flock: But how do I know that it is the spirit that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth along with the Commandment of believing?

Gods order, to work upon the humbled &amp; self-dispairing sinner, who is willing to receive Christ upon his own condition, it is not like to a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding spirit; for if the word of commandment to believe, and the spirit agree in one, it cannot be a delusion, phancie leadeth no man to Faith. 2. When objects of life work upon life, they cannot deceive, especially all the senses, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Seeing, Tasting, Feeling, Smelling: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and sweetnesse of Christ, going along with the word, cannot be delusion; a man may imagine that he seeth and heareth, and yet his senses may be deceived: but that all the senses, especially all the spirituall senses, and that a man imagineth that he liveth a naturall life and is dead, is rare.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

breaketh with Christ first, before Christ break with the unbeliever; and the Elect of God findeth no more, nor any higher favour in the kinde of externall means, to open the Lambs Book of life, which is sealed and closed with Gods own hand, then the Commandement of believing. Now when our Lord maketh offer of the Kingdom of sons to slaves, and casteth his Jewell of Christ offered in the Gospel in the lap and bosome of a Bastard, what ever be the Lords secret Decree and purpose in so doing; The Bastard is to take God at his word, and to catch the opportunity of Gods love in so far, and if he do it not, the Gospel-offer to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate being a treaty of peace, then the treaty breaketh off first upon his side; for Christ co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth within a mile of mercy to meet the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the sinner cometh not the fourth part of a mile, yea, not half a step of love and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience to meet Christ, and so Christ kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the unbeliever with the sweetnesse of the preventing courtesie of offered mercy.</p>

For God cannot change Grace unto naturall debt, it remaining grace, for so it should be Grace &amp; no Grace, which is a contradiction: 2. The Lord hath reserved liberty to himself in this promise, that in this or this particular Act (the omission whereof may consist with perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Grace) he may contribute his influence of Grace, or not contribute it; so <hi>David</hi> hath not actuall Grace at his will and nod, to eschew adultery, and murther as he pleaseth:<note place="margin">

Christ and his members, are fruits of Royall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Free-Grace; who hath the key of the house of wine, to stay the soul with the Flaggons and Apples of love? Certainly, it is the King himself that taketh the Spouse into <hi>His banqueting House,</hi> Cant 2.4. And yet so as the omission of all supernaturall duties; yea, our lazinesse in the manner of doing, our fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and sins are imputed to our selves, and not to the not blowing of the wind of the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nor to the want of the efficacious motion of the spirit, as <hi>Libertines</hi> teach, with <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>; For we so sin through the want of the motions of efficacious Grace, as through the want of a Physicall, not of a morall cause, and so as we are most willing to want that influence, and so are guilty before the Lord: God hath reasons strong and convincing, why he worketh thus; 1. It setteth not <hi>Grace</hi> to work by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; the spirit of the living creatures is within every wheel of Christ, that it must move from an inward principle; the motion of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Grace,</hi> is <hi>Christs heart</hi> wheeled about by it self, and by no forraigne cause without it self: <hi>Love</hi> worketh as <hi>Love</hi> without bud or bribe from <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels. Grace</hi> is both wages and work, the race and the gold to it self. 2. God delights to have men and Angels his deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Grace holdeth an open and a free Inne, with all the dainties that <hi>Christ</hi> can make, to all comers and goers, for nothing but thanks
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29630:192"/>
and heartily welcome: <hi>Grace</hi> maketh no gain of my work. The sweating of Angels, and of the Thousand Thousands that sing up the glory of Christ before the high Throne, is no income to Christs Rent: <hi>Grace</hi> should not be <hi>Grace,</hi> if it could Traffique, or buy, or sell with a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Angels and men stand in the Books of Free-grace for Millions of borrowed summes. Christs blood and deep love may be praised, but never recompenced: Christs love hath filled this world and the new Paradice with debtors; and Angels can neither read, nor sum, nor cast up the Accompts of Free-grace.<note place="margin">3. <hi>Grace to the saints and on the saints but Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is on them, not to them.</hi>
               </note> 3. That we cannot be masters of one good act, without his preventing Grace evidenceth what nature is, and maketh Grace both my staffe and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey in at <hi>Heavens Gates; Nature</hi> and <hi>Free-will</hi> must stoop and do homage to CHRIST. There's a <hi>Glory</hi> active, and a <hi>Glory</hi> passive, as there's also <hi>Grace</hi> active and passive, Free-will is active under <hi>Grace,</hi> and passive also, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Grace and Mercy,</hi> is to the Saints, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints; Nature emptieth its lamp upon the golden pipe, the rich Grace of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and Free-will moveth and runneth, but not but as moved, driven, and breathed upon by Free-grace: But as concerning <hi>Glory,</hi> it hath a more eminent and noble relation; <hi>Glory</hi> shall be on the Saints as a garment, as a Crown, for they shall be glorified: But no <hi>Glory</hi> to the Saints, but only, only <hi>to the Lamb,</hi> to the flower
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:29630:193"/>
of the <hi>Glory of Glory, Jesus</hi> the Celebrious, Eminent, most high and adored <hi>Prince of the Kings of the earth</hi>; and therefore there's room and place left for sin and shame to Free-will in the busines of praedeterminating grace, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can but sigh and sin, and Grace sing and be spotlesse and innocent: Christ so draweth, as we sin in not being drawen; Christ so taketh and allureth, that it is our guilt that we are not taken and overcome with the <hi>smell of the Kings Oyntments</hi>: So is sin the field out of which springeth the Rose, the flower of free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hired Grace: sin must go with us, as near to heaven as to the threshold of the gates, that the sinner may halt and crook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his foot on the threshold stone of <hi>Glory</hi>; that so pardoning Grace may enter the new City with us. 4.

to the Mothers affection to work upon her, and cause her to love her Childe: love can hardly be hired, nature is stronger then rewards or any externals: Comforts are but the hire of serving of God, and the results of beleeving in a sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. There be some cautions here that are considerable. 1. God leadeth some strong ones to heaven, whose affections are soft as <hi>Davids</hi> were, <hi>Ps.</hi> 35.13. and 119.25.28.136.53. <hi>Ps.</hi> 6.6. And yet Faith is strong, <hi>Ps.</hi> 22.1. God possibly immediatly working upon the assenting, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving faculty, leaving the affections to their own native disposition. 2. God useth some privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged dispensations, so as a strong Believer shal doubt upon no good ground, <hi>Ps.</hi> 116.11. God so disposing, that grace may appear to be grace, and the man but flesh. 3. Softnesse of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and light of comfort, may by accident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with strong acts of beleeving: for with these, in many, there is little light, much Faith, and they should without these apples given to children, strongly beleeve, and God to confirm his own of meer indulgence sweetneth affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

Another living in sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse all his life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> died with comforts admirable. And 3. let this be put as a case of Conscience, why diverse believing and joying much in Gods Salvation all their life, yet die in great conflicts, and to beholders with little expression of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and feeling? As divers of the Saints die. Certainly, God 1. Walketh in liberty here. 2. He would not have us to limit the breathings of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to jump with our hour of dying. 3.

               </note> In the renewed: There's 1.

This doubting may, and doth in carnall men consist with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and a morall false perswasion that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men have all of them, while their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be wakened; that they shall be saved. <hi>Why?

There's an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall doubting that riseth by starts upon wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men out of an evill conscience of sin, but it vanisheth as a cloud: as in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> confession, <hi>I and my people have sinned.</hi> This argueth a law-spirit, rising and falling a sleep again. 3. There's a finall doubting of despair, like the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doom past on the condemned malefactor: as in <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.13.14. In <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15, 16. All these conclude men under the law, and the curse of it. But there's 4. A doubting in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which though a sin, yet (if I might have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> leave to borrow the expression) is a godly sin: Not because it is not a sin indeed,<note place="margin">

This doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing befalleth never any reprobate under the law or covenant of works, and so though it be an ill thing, yet its a good sign, as out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of boils in the body, are in themselves, diseases, infirmities, distempers and contrary to perfect health; yet they are often good signs and arguments of strength of life, and much vitall heat and healthinesse of constitution. That affections of the childe of God, under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest, murther, or other hainous sins be stirred, that sorrow be wakened and rise, when our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is offended, and when our Lord frowneth and standeth behind the wall, and goeth away, is lawfull; yea it speaketh tendernesse of love, softnesse of heart, but that they be so far wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as to doubt, and fear that the Lord be changed, that <hi>he hath forgotten to be mercifull,</hi> that is sinfull doubting, but doth no wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the person is under the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi>; but the contrary rather, that Grace sitteth and bordereth with this doubting. And so that the person is under Grace, not under the Law. Even where Faith is strong, it is not ever in the same temper. Health most vigorou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

life in it. Take the strong and experienced Christians life in its whole continued frame, and for the most part he hath the better of all temptations; but take him in a certain stage, or nick of providence when he is not himself, and he is below his ordinary strength, even in that wherein he excelleth. If a gracious temper of meeknesse like Christ was not the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant element of grace in <hi>Moses,</hi> yet it was in a great measure in him, he bearing the name with him, who best knoweth names, and things, of <hi>the meekest man in the earth</hi>: Yet in that which was his flour, he proved weaker then himself, and spake <hi>unadvisedly with his lips.</hi> Our highest Graces may meet with an ill hour. <hi>Job</hi> by the testimony of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job.</hi> And, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.

               </note> often strength of wind will blow the ship twenty miles backward. 2. The smallest measure of Faith. The <hi>minimum quod sic,</hi> is sincere adherence to Christ. Not that negative adherence simply,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to Christ not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to saving Faith.</hi>

Yet there's no saving faith in naturall spirits, but there's in the beleever some positive adherence under, or with the negative, by which there's a
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:29630:204"/>
power of love and kindnesse, making the soul to cleave to Christ: There may be great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with this, and great failings, and yet faith unfained. We have need of much charity to these that are weak in Faith. A reed, a broken reed may grow; and Christ will not break it. A buried believer is a believer; if Christ have a neer relation of blood to a peece of blew clay, and the dead corps of a believer; seeing in his flesh there's the seed and hope of a resurrection, as the seed and hope of harvest is in rotting, and dying grains of Wheat, sown in the cold earth, as is cleer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, 43, 44. Much more the relation of mercy remaineth in Christ, toward the wrestling, deserted, and self dead believer. Now this smallest measure of Faith, may consist, 1. With much ignorance of God, as it was with the believing Disciples, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with Christ in his temptations, confessed him, believed and adhered to him, when many went back, and departed from him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.28, 29. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16, 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66, 67, 68, 69. And yet were ignorant of great points of Faith, as of his death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.21.22. Of his resurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.9. 2. So there be great faintings and doubtings, when a storm ariseth, and the soul is a sinking, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26, 27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.3. Yet a little Faith is Faith. As touching a fainting Faith, its not alwayes a weak Faith that faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; strong and healthy bodies may have fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and deliquies. For the causes of fainting
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:29630:204"/>
are, 1. The want of the influence of mercy, and of stirring or exciting Grace causeth fainting, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>As we are mercied, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we faint not</hi>; we degenerate not. It is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of Christ, and lieth about the bowels of our <hi>mercifull high Priest</hi> that keepeth from fainting: If our Intercessor pray not, we faint, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>I have prayed that thy Faith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may not be ecclipsed.</hi> The moon is in a certain death, and soon in an ecclipse; So is Faith under fainting. 2. Fear of wrath may cause distraction and hanging of minde, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, where there is strong Faith, <hi>Ps.</hi> 88.14.15. Compared with <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. As apprehensions report of God, so are we affected in believing. Yet may it be collected from <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.19. <hi>In that hour it shall be given you,</hi> that Christ hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the head of a fainting believer. 3. The dependence of Faith will faint, when Christ withdraweth love, though he inflict no anger. The ingenuity of Grace gathereth fear from a cloud, though there be no storm. 3. A soul dead in himself, and that cannot put out Faith in acts, for want of light and comfort, is a weak Faith. A tree in winter is a living tree. There may be life where there's little stirring or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 4. That Faith that seemed smallest to the man himself, is sometime in it self greatest. 1. In sad desertions there's most of Faith, and least of sense of Faith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.1. 2. A suffering Faith may be small to the sufferer. Many of the

He saw hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

In his spirituall condition, in the duties of the first table; in all which capacities we are to walk by Faith. Yea to eat, drink, sleep, to laugh, to weep, as concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of all these Heaven-ward by Faith.

               </note> But ere I go from this point, I crave leave to adde somewhat of the least and smallest measure of Faith. 2. Of the condition of the childe of <hi>God</hi> under it. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former, I onely say, There is a degree of fire, and a coal so small, that lesse cannot be, the thing remaining, Fire having the nature, essence, and properties of fire. And when any is in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium or swoun, the man hath life, but it is kept in narrow bounds, there is breathing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 2. Some vitall heat. 3. Some internall motion in the heart and vitall and animall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but no more to prove life almost then the man is a dead corps, yet somewhat there is to difference him from dead clay: For friends will
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:29630:206"/>
not bury a sounding man willingly and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. So at the lowest condition of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Faith that the believer is in, some fire and coal of love and Faith there is, and some smoaking, though little fire, and possibly we cannot give it a name. Yet if <hi>the just live by Faith,</hi> there must be some measure of Faith. 2. Some smoaking of love to Christ. 3. Some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of an ill condition. No man on earth in a sleep hath a reflect act to know that he sleepeth, no dead corps knoweth it self to be dead. Never sleeping man could say, nay, not <hi>Adam</hi> in his first sleep, when <hi>God</hi> formed the woman out of a rib of his side: <hi>Now I am slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</hi> No man naturally dead can say, <hi>Now am I dead, and I lie amongst the worms and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Death</hi> maketh no report of death: but the believer can say at his lowest condition, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>I sleep but my heart waketh</hi>; and he who saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. <hi>Lord quicken me,</hi> must say, <hi>Lord, I am dead</hi>; yet to say, <hi>Lord quicken me,</hi> and to feel and know deadnesse, are acts of the life of Grace. A Saint in this condition may love Christ through half a dream, and half sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, half waking, retain honourable thoughts of Christ, <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. Some have said in hell they should love Christ. This truth is in it, that in such a pain and sad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of suffering as the damned are in, (sin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, or Gods hating of them excepted) Saints can believe and love Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.1. at least
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:29630:206"/>
desire to have leave to love Christ, for the evill of sinne may, the evill of punishment cannot quench the love of Christ, which is stronger then death, then hell, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 7. The soul at the lowest condition is like the man who hath ingaged his lands for so great a sum, as may be a Just price to buy the land, and so in effect he hath sold the land, but with a reversion, he keepeth the reversion, and so by Law within such a time he may redeem his morgaged inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. The weakest of believers at his lowest ebbe, keepeth the reversion of Christ: He may by some grievous sinne, be under such a terrible desertion, as to put the inheritance of Heaven to a too great hazard of being lost; and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and in his own sense, and in the sense of many, all is gone; yet then to say nothing of the invisible chain of Gods unchangeable decree of Election, which the strongest armes of Devils and Hell cannot break; there is fire under the embers,<note place="margin">

A love-sicknesse: hence it is evident in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and ebbest condition of a fainting faith, there is something answerable to this, and this is to love the smell of Christ that he hath left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, when he himself is gone; it is to desire to behold with love and longing the print of his feet, the chair of love that he sate in: hence though you feel no work of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his seat is kept by some spirituall meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as to consider, what a kinde of love it is, that Christ hath bestowed on sinners, for that he loved his own before he died for them, his love being the cause why he died for them; and still after, the purchased Redemption, he loveth them, and intercedeth for them up at the right hand of God; and this is as much as to say, Christ hath loved you, and repenteth not of his love: love made him die for you, and if it were to do again, he would die over again for you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And suppose we that there were need that CHRIST should die twice, or foure times, or an hundred or millions of times, and that he had ten thousand millions of lives, and that our sins should have required that he should first die for one believer,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:29630:207"/>
and then die again the second time for another, and then the third time for another: and so that hee must for every severall Elect person, have died a severall death; Love, love should have put him upon all these deaths willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and therefore if the beleever had ten loves, as many loves in one as there be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected men and Angels, all had been too little for Christ; and when the believer hath been serving and praising up in the highest Temple as many millions of ages of years, (or a tract of Eternity answerable to that duration of ages) as the number of the sand on all the coasts in earth, of all the stars in Heaven, of all the flowers, hearbs, plants, leaves of trees that hath been, or shall be from the Creation of God, to the taking down of the workmanship of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth; yet shal he be as much in Christs debt for this infinit love when that time is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as when he first opened his mouth in the first breathing out of praises in the state of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 2 He may turn over in his minde all the promises, and the literall revolution of them in the minde, though it be but a deed or act of the understanding and memory, may cast fire on the affections in which there resideth a habit of grace; though there be no fire in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, yet blowing with the bellows, may waken up and kindle fire in the hearth where there is little: The habit of grace is often as sparks of fire on the hearth under the ashes, and may be
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:29630:208"/>
kindled up and made a fire. 3. When Faith is weakest, and the soul under a winter and a dead eclipse; its fit to keep the heart in a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive frame of receiving of him again as to sorrow for sin, and to put to door unrepented sins; as when the King goeth abroad, sweep the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for his return. Missing of Christ, longing for his return, inquisition for him, <hi>Watchmen, saw ye him</hi>?

Answ.</hi> It were absurd I grant, if Gods hatred to the Elect as sinners, were any immanent affection in God opposite to his love, by which he should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to their persons. But Gods hatred to the Elect, because they are sinners, is nothing but his displicency against sin (not against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) so as he is to inflict satisfactory punishment on the surety Christ for their sin. A Father may so love his Prodigall Son, as to retain a purpose to make him Inheritor of a Kingdom (if he had a Crown for himself) and to pay his debts, and yet both hate and punish his profuse and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish wasting of his goods.</p>

               </note> and to the reprobate without exception of persons: but it cannot speak wrath to the believer though he be one that daily sins, and is under the Law: that is, under the rule of the Law: <hi>now to be under the Law</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6. and 7. is to be under the damnation of the Law: in which regard believers <hi>are not under the Law,</hi> but under the sweet reign of pardoning grace, yet are they <hi>under the Law</hi> as a Tutor, a guide, a rule: and that the rule and reign of the Law are different is evident, 1. because the ruling power of the Law is an essentiall ingredient of the Law, without the which the Law is not the Law: the reign or damnation of the Law agreeth to the Law by accident, in so far as man is a sinner, which is a state accidental to the law. 2. The Law is a rule, and hath a proper guidance and tutory over the confirmed Angels, and should have had over man if he had never sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the Law can have no reign to death
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:29630:217"/>
over the confirmed Angels, and man in that case, as the Iayler hath no power over the man, who was never an evil doer. 1. We are sinners in the judgement of Law, both sin dwelling in vs, and 2. the guilt of the Law lying on us to condemnation: But being once in Christ, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, we remain sinners, <hi>as touching the indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling blot,</hi> but we are not sinners, as we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in Christ, as touching the Law-obligation to eternall condemnation, from which we are fully freed. But the justified and redeemed of Christ remain as formally and inherently sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as Milk is formally white, a Raven black: Justification removeth not the indwelling of sin, and so in regard of sense, reason, and conscience, we are sinners to our dying day, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned sinners.

Ans.</hi> What Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Divines say in this, we acknowledge; but if we seek only a fuller certainty of forgivenesse in this Petition, and not also the application of the generall pardon, as appropriated to the sins we daily fall in; I see no other thing we seek,

but a greater measure of faith to lay hold on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: I should ask a warrant of Scripture to prove that forgiveness of sin signifieth assurance of the pardon of sin. 2.

Because <hi>we are justified from eternity, only we are said by</hi> Paul <hi>to be justified by faith, in that by faith we come to the knowledge and assurance of the state of election, and of justification, and Gods Act of not imputing sin to us, which Acts were possed upon us from eternity, and before the children had done good or evill,</hi> Rom. 9.13. And observe the words of Mr. <hi>Hen. Denne</hi> to this purpose: <hi>I do beleeve</hi> (saith he) <hi>sin to be of that hideous nature, and the justice of God so perfect, that be cannot but hate the person, unto whom be

imputeth, and upon whom be chargeth sin, if so be the person charged cannot give full, perfect, and present satisfaction; and yet will I not say, that the Son of God, upon whom all our iniquities were charged, was at any time,</hi> Filius Odii, <hi>a son of hatred (for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was eternally well-pleased with him) the reason is, that our sins were no sooner charged upon him, but that he had given full and perfect satisfaction, being the Lambe slain from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 13.8. <hi>Answ.</hi> If God cannot but hate the person upon whom he chargeth sin, either God never charged our sins upon Christ: contrary to Scripture, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23, 24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. or then he hated Christ, which no sound Divine dare say:<note place="margin">

               </note> The payment and satisfaction which Christ made, cannot hinder Christ to hate sin, &amp; so the person upon whom sin is (as <hi>Antinomians</hi> teach, while as they refuse this distinction) no more then the satisfaction that Christ made for sin, can hinder it self, or hinder Christ to die for sin; for if God should hate Christ, it should be satisfactory hatred, and penall. 2. I much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if God from eternity charged sin upon his Son Christ (for the place he citeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. and the judgement of <hi>Antinomians</hi> so expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, evinceth this to be his meaning) how Christ from eternity <hi>could give full, perfect, and present satisfaction</hi> to prevent the hatred of his Father, is not imaginable: indeed, when Christ gave satisfaction, I beleeve that it was <hi>full and perfect</hi>: but that Christ from eternity gave
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:29630:222"/>
               <hi>present satisfaction,</hi> and that to make us actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally justified from all Eternity, is a Point no head can conceive, except <hi>Herod, Pilate, Iews &amp; Gentiles,</hi> the Traitour <hi>Judas,</hi> and all who were wicked Actors in killing of Christ, be men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, who had existence and being, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from eternity; this lieth fairly for the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall world of <hi>Aristotle</hi>; then surely faith doth not bring us to the knowledge, only of our state of justification, as passed, and done from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as if election to glory, and the love of God therein, and justification, and that love, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested by faith, were two coeternal twins, both at once begotten from eternity. Sure I am, <hi>we are justified by faith</hi>; but sure I am, <hi>we are not elected and chosen to life eternall by faith</hi>: And if to be justified by faith, be as our Masters (though ignorantly) teach, nothing but this, that we come to the knowledge of our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith, as by a sign, even as the day-star maketh not the Sun to rise, it being only a signe that the Sun shall rise, and that justification is as old a childe of free-love as election to life. Then say I, <hi>Paul</hi> might have taken the like pains to prove these Propositions: <hi>We are chosen to glory before the world was, by faith, and not by the good works of the Law</hi>: and this <hi>(men are reprobated from eternity by finall unbeleef.)</hi> For sure it is, that we come to the knowledge of our election to glory by beleeving; not to say, that <hi>Pauls</hi> large dispute with justiciaries,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:29630:222"/>
was not whether we know, and apprehend our own justification by the works of the Law, or by faith in Christ. 3. If <hi>Antinomians</hi> say, That Christ was slain for our sins from eternity, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> actually, but only in Gods eternall purpose; and they must say, either he was the Lamb actually crucified for us from eternity (which is a new eternal world) &amp; we are actually justified from eternity, and our sins imputed to Christ, and actually translated off us, and laid on him, and so our sins are actually pardoned from eternity: Or, then they must say, Christ was the Lambe slain from eternity, not actually, not really, but only in the decree and gracious purpose of God; now that is (I grant, sound Divinity) Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not from eternity, but God only decreed and purposed that in the fulnesse of time, he should die; But then it must follow, that God did not actually charge sin on Christ from eternity, and that Christ did not actually from eternity ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the ungodly, but onely in his eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he did justifie the ungodly: Then the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are justified in time; and when is this time? I believe the word of God, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver while the poor soul believe; even as the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is condemned, and under wrath, but never while he mis-believe, and reject the Son of God. But 4. if the meaning (<hi>that Christ is the Lamb slain for our sins from eternity</hi>) be, that he is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> slain only in Gods purpose, then are we no more justified and pardoned from eternity, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:29630:223"/>
we beleeve, then the world was created from eternity. Now in the <hi>Antinomian</hi> sense, as we are justified by faith, that is, we come to know that we were in Gods minde actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified; Then it may be said, <hi>The world was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by faith:</hi> For Heb. 11.2. <hi>Through faith we understood that the world was created; and God laid our sins upon Christ by faith: and Christ died for us, and bare our sins, on his own body, on the tree, by faith</hi>: For, by faith, we come to know that God made the world; but because the knowledge and apprehension of the creation (may some say) is not a point serving for peace of conscience, and Christian consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which yet is false, (every point of saving faith is apt to breed peace and consolation) yet certainly we came to know and apprehend that God laid our sins upon <hi>Christ by faith,</hi> Isa. 53.6. and that <hi>Christ died for us, and bare our sins on his own body on the tree by faith, and by faith only,</hi> to our peace and consolation; and so, if justification by faith be nothing but the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of Gods love to us in imputing our sins to Christ, and have no subordinat organicall act in our justification, but we be justified before we believe, and that from eternity, upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same ground, God created the world by faith, Christ died for our sins by faith. 5. Yea, in this sense the world must be created from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and all things which fell out in time fell out in eternity, because as Christ was the Lamb
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:29630:223"/>
slain from eternity, in Gods eternall purpose, so were all things, and the world created from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in Gods purpose and decree, but things that only have being in the decree of God, are not simply, nor have they any being at all; and therefore our free justification from eternity had no being, but only was to be, and actually is, when God giveth us faith to lay hold on the remission of our sins.</p>
            <p>Nor is it enough to say, <hi>That faith is only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for our joy and consolation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Faith is not onely given for our joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, also for our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but in our own soul, and before God.</hi>

But 1. this is not the state of the question between <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Justicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>: For <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth strongly, we are really and indeed changed from a state of sin, unto a state of justification, even before <hi>God</hi>; not because by keeping the Law we know we are justified, but because all have sinned, and are come short of the glory of God, and so are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently wicked, abominable, doers of ill, and condemned therefore, before God, from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> testimony, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 53. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludeth reall and intrinsecall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>v.</hi> 19. not the knowledge of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the knowledge that we are not justified by the works of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that we are justified as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was: Now they are not said to be justified by faith, because they come by faith to the knowledge of their justification: for <hi>Abrahams</hi> righteousnesse, and the blessednesse of the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man opposed to the curse of the Law, from which we are freed in justification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12, 13. is the reall fruit of justification, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him that justifieth the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. But this blessednesse, and freedom from the curse of the Law, is not any fruit or effect, or consequent of our knowledge and apprehension of our justification in Christ: as if we were, before we believe, blessed and freed from the curse of the Law, because ever the Elect before they believe are under the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:29630:224"/>
curse, and are not blessed: 1. Because they are, before they believe, <hi>the children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.2. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are under the curse: 2. Because <hi>Paul</hi> and the Elect, before they be under grace and belief, were under the Law, and so under wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Wherefore my brethren, ye also are become dead to the Law, by the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another.</hi> 5. <hi>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the Law, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death:</hi> 6. <hi>But now we are delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held, we should serve in newnesse of spirit, and not in the oldnesse of the Letter:</hi> Hence it is clear that there was a time in which <hi>Paul</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect at <hi>Rome</hi> were servants of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.20, 21. Under the lusts and motions of sin, which work in their Members to bring forth fruit, that is sins to death eternall, <hi>Ro.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They were then under the curse of the Law, and so far from blessednesse, and the servants of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.20. and persons in the flesh: But the case is changed, they are now not the servants of sin, but servants of righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. Married to a new husband <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 7.4. Whence came this change of two contrary states; yea, and before God contrary?

other grace in us; at least there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of grace, by which the alteration from a cursed estate, to a blessed estate is made; then faith is not a naked manifestation of the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of justification, to the which we was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled before we believed, for before we believed, we was in a cursed estate: This also may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if Faith be but a Declaration or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation, that we are justified before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; <hi>Paul</hi> had no reason to deny that we are justified; that is, that we know to our comfort, by works of holinesse that we are justified, for works of sanctification are evident witnesses that we are in Christ, and are justified, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.24.25. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. 3.

Reconciliation turneth not the heart, but the hand of the Lord, upon the little ones, as he speaketh, so that he cannot deal with or punish his elect, as otherways he would do: The Lords justice may be satisfied, his love cannot be bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or hired, and the effect of justice, the infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of infinite wrath is diverted, as a River that runneth East hath been made to run West, and an issue of blood in one member of the body, hath been diverted to run at another channell: justice was to run through the Elect of God, in the due &amp; legal punishing of the sinner (which yet is extraneous to the just and eternall will of God) but infinite wise mercy, caused that River to run in another veine, through the soul of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>

these be sweet favours that come (as it were) hot and new, <hi>immediately from God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: See it in all the excellent things that God giveth us, especiall in these four. 1. In <hi>Christ:</hi> 2. <hi>Grace</hi>: 3. <hi>Glory</hi>: 4. <hi>Comfort.</hi> Christ is Gods highest love gift: Now Christ the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, was given without any <hi>Medium,</hi> or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening Mediatour. God out of the meer bottom of Free love giveth Christ: The Lord Christ was not given by so much as request, or counsell of Men or Angels: <hi>Christ,</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>by himself purged our sins,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. <hi>He gave himself a ransome for all</hi>; 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>Who his own self bare our sins, in his own body on the tree:</hi> he satisfied and payed in his own person: It was not a deputed work. God the Lord of life in proper person Redeemed us: Christs love to us was not deputy love, he loved us not by a Vicar: Christ is given freely, as a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is more essentially a gift of Free grace (to speak so) then the grace of faith which is given to those who hear &amp; are humbled for sin. And Christ given to die for sinners, is a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and pure gift of Grace then remission of sins and eternal life, which are given to us upon condition of Faith, whereas a Redeemer is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to die for us without any condition, thought, desire, any sweating or endeavour in man or Angel. 2. So is Grace given out of Grace, saving Grace is made out of nothing, not out of the potency of the matter. The new heart is a

creation, and as its Grace, is framed without tools, agents, art, or service; Grace issueth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately out of Christs heart, he hath no hire, no payment for it: non-payment, no money is Graces hire, 3.

yea, in a journey that the spirit is intent upon, but in trusting on God we interpose a folding and a ply of the creature between our soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and the Lord, just as a pillow is put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mans shoulder &amp; a pressing burden, for fear the burden crush a bone; we are afraid we give God too much to do, or more then he is able to bear: When we sail, we seem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust our selves to the Lord and the Sea; but the truth is, often we trust more to the strong Ship, then to the Sea or the Lord.
