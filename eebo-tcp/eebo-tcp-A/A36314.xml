            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Late Providence equally ſurprizing and ſad; a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which they muſt be great <hi>Strangers in this
our Jeruſalem,</hi> who have not heard of it; gave
birth to this following Diſcourſe. To perpetuate the Memory,
and aſſiſt my Neighbours in making an improvement of it, was
the deſign of its being firſt preacht, and now publiſht. I know
that a <hi>Critical Eye</hi> may obſerve ſome blemiſhes; and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelf an <hi>envious one</hi> will find more: But I am the
leſs ſolicitous, becauſe I hope, I rather deſigned to do good to
others, than gain applauſe to my ſelf. I would rather that
Men would praiſe God,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>(whoſe I am, and whom</hi> I deſire
to <hi>ſerve with my Spirit, in the Goſpel of his Son)</hi> than blow
the Trumpet at my door.</p>
            <p>Though this Diſcourſe hath the ill fate, to come forth in an
Age when the Love of many is waxed cold: Yet I hope ſome
will have that <hi>charity</hi> for it and the Author too, <hi>which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a multitude of faults.</hi> If ſome ſhall find fault with the
ſtile as not being acurate, and poliſht; let them know, it was
preacht to a Congregation in the Countrey, who mind more
that the <hi>form of Words delivered to them be wholeſom
and ſound,</hi> than <hi>gay and eloquent:</hi> And that ſo ſad and
awful a Providence called for ſomething more, than flouriſhes
of wit. Perhaps ſome that are got into the chair of the ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
will deride it;<note place="margin">Heb 5. 14</note> but I hope that they, <hi>who have their ſences
exerciſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 4</note>

               <hi>and that God brought it
to me.</hi> To juſtifie the making ſo plain a diſcourſe, thus publick;
<pb facs="tcp:93655:3"/>
I neither can, nor care, to uſe <hi>that Stale Complement;</hi>
of its being extorted from me, by the irreſiſtible importunity of
them that heard it: Neither will I ſtuff this Epiſtle with
thoſe trifling Apologies, which are as eaſily anſwered as they
are commonly uſed.<note place="margin">Matth. 25 5.</note> It is a time, when not only <hi>the fooliſh
Virgins;</hi> but <hi>the wiſe</hi> too <hi>ſlumber and ſleep.</hi> Oh what a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of ſlumber is faln upon moſt of the Proteſtant Churches, at
this day! And muſt none of the <hi>Watchmen of Iſrael</hi> ſound
the Trumpet, and give them an Alarum!</p>
            <p>If the abounding of Iniquity, and the frequent repetition of
the ſame ſins; and thoſe too, that are of a crimſon colour, and
ſcarlet dye: If the general declenſion of Faith, Love, Zeal, and
other Chriſtian Graces, which is too notoriouſly viſible among all
Parties; that profeſs the Proteſtant Religion; or which is all
one,<note place="margin">Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</note> the <hi>faith which was once delivered to the Saints:</hi> If
the ill ſymptoms which are upon us at home; and our Brethren
abroad: If former, and later warnings of Providence, be not
ſufficient to excuſe, nay, to juſtifie my calling men to repentance
and reformation; I muſt, ay, and I am willing for once, to
bear the blame, of having done an unneceſſary work.</p>
            <p>Theſe my <hi>firſt fruits,</hi> Sir, I offer to you; to whom I owe all
I can do of this kind. If they are not ſo fully ripe; yet becauſe
they bear <hi>that Character</hi> let them find acceptance with you. I
hope the diſcourſe, together with the occaſion of it, may do good:
And if it may contribute to the repentance and reformation of
the nation; or any particular Number of Sinners in it, my
great end is attained: That it may be accompany'd with that
divine, with that all-mighty power, which can ſhake, and open
the heart of the moſt obdurate ſinner; as well as that of the
earth, let your prayers meet mine at the throne of grace.</p>

               <q>Thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord of hoſts with Thunder,
and with Earthquake,—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THough almighty God hath been ſhooting one fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
arrow after another, againſt a ſinful and
provoking People; his quiver is ſtill full. Though
deſolating judgments (the meſſengers of divine anger) have
been like the waves of the Sea; which come rolling and
tumbling one upon the neck of another: The treaſuries
of Gods wrath are not yet emptied. When one fire is out,
how eaſily and ſuddenly may another be kindled? Every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93655:4"/>
Creature, from the higheſt Angel to the loweſt worm,
ſtands ready armed with a ſting to avenge its makers
quarrel. Not only Angels thoſe Courtiers of Heaven,
but all Creatures in this lower World are ready to do
the Pleaſure, and execute the Will of their great and
common Lord, They need not to be <hi>preſt,</hi> for they are
<hi>Volunteers</hi> in this Service. In every part of the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
World, an angry God can find inſtruments of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance;
the winds and waves, which <hi>no man hitherto
could tame;</hi> readily obey him. There is no Creature,
though at firſt made for the uſe and ſervice of innocent
<hi>Adam,</hi> but may be a rod and a ſword in the hand of an
offended God to laſh, wound, and kill his guilty children.
If God have a mind to drown the Old World: He can
gather the Waters together; and the continually weeping
clouds; ſhall turn the <hi>dry land into a ſea.</hi> If God have a
mind to burn <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> he can on a ſudden
rain ſhowers of fire and brimſtone from Heaven: Turn
thoſe Cities into aſhes and rubbiſh; and they ſhall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
a <hi>temporal,</hi> before they drop into an <hi>eternal</hi> Hell.
If God will fight againſt, the enemies of his Church: He
hath the whole Militia, and all the Artillery of Heaven
at his command; on a ſudden, in a moment unthought of,
he can diſcharge the Cannon of Heaven, ſcare them with
his Thunder, and ſcatter them with his Lightning. If
God will take a ſpeedy vengeance, on <hi>Corah</hi> and his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
accomplices; or on any other company of rebel crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
at his command the cloſely compacted earth, ſhall
open her mouth, ſwallow up, and bury them alive; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their coffin, and grave too. What God of this kind
can do, we may learn, from the mouth of two witneſſes,
<hi>viz.</hi> a late Providence, and the Text I have now read.
<hi>Thou ſhalt be viſited by the Lord of hoſts with thunder and
earthquake:</hi> In which words, we have theſe three things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93655:4"/>
1. The Viſitant, <hi>the Lord of hoſts,</hi> the Lord, that is
great in ſtrength and mighty in power. <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to
whom nothing is impoſſible or hard: The Lord of hoſts,
who is general of all the forces, in Heaven, Air, and
Earth, Lo! This is he who ſhall viſit. Sometimes, we
read of man's viſiting God: Sometimes of one man's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
another: hers, of God's viſiting man.</p>
            <p>2. The viſited, <hi>Thou.</hi> To whom is it, the Lord of hoſts
makes this viſit? To <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 1. <hi>called Ariel, the city
where David dwelt: Jeruſalem</hi> though the place, where
the Temple ſtood, and the Worſhip of God was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Metropolis, the head City of the
<hi>Jews</hi> muſt be viſited. Thou, even thou, O <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
the City of <hi>David,</hi> and the City of God too, ſhalt be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited.</p>
            <p>3. The viſitation it ſelf; <hi>with thunder and earthquake:</hi>
Sometimes, God viſits man in a way of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
when he comes to make a viſit, he bringeth many
preſents and love-tokens along with him: And oh! Bleſſed
are they, upon whom, the great God beſtoweth ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits
as theſe. Of ſuch viſits you read 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 21. Pſalm</hi>
65. 9. and the greateſt Mercy, God ever vouchſafed to
this wicked, and apoſtate World of ours is called by this
name, <hi>Luke 1. 68. Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he
hath viſited, and redeemed his people.</hi> Sometimes the Scene
is changed; and God viſits in a way of Judgment: Not
in Love, but in Wrath; not as a Friend, but as an Enemy,
not as an Indulgent Father, but as a Revenging Judge. In
theſe viſits, not Mercy, but Juſtice is his attendant, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
89. 32. <hi>Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and
their iniquity with ſtripes. Jer. 5. 9. Shall I not viſit for
theſe things? ſaith the Lord, and ſhall not my ſoul be avenged
on ſuch a nation as this? Hoſ. 9. 7. The days of viſitation
are come, the days of recompence are come, and Iſrael ſhall know
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93655:5"/>
it.</hi> And in this manner muſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the holy, and once
beloved City, be viſited by the Lord of hoſts. God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
them more generally, <hi>v. 1, 2. Wo to Ariel, to Ariel,
the city where David dwelt: Add ye year to year; let them
kill ſacrifices. Yet I will diſtreſs Ariel, and there ſhall be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs
and ſorrow, and it ſhall be to me as Ariel. q. d.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
your formal, cuſtomary worſhip (in which
you confide ſo much) both City and Temple ſhall be
brought into great ſtraits: Both City and Temple ſhall be
like the Altar, filled with the Bodies of dead men (inſtead
of ſlain beaſts) ſacrificed to my Juſtice, and the threatned
evil is more particularly expreſt in the Text; <hi>thunder and
earthquake.</hi> From the words, theſe three Doctrines may
be raiſed.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>Gods executing of Judgments on a ſinful people,
is his viſiting of them.</hi> A day of calamity is a day of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Great Perſons have their ſet times for viſiting:
And ſo hath the great God. Men have their time of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and the Lord of hoſts will have his time of viſiting,
<hi>Amos 3. 13, 14. Hear ye, and teſtifie in the houſe of Jacob;
ſaith the Lord God, the God of hoſts, that in the day that I
ſhall viſit the tranſgreſſion of Iſrael upon him, I will alſo viſit
the altars of Beth-el;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 48. 44.</note> the time of puniſhing <hi>Moab,</hi> is called
the <hi>year of viſitation.</hi> Men ſin boldly, and impudently
affront the Majeſty of Heaven and Earth: They provoke
him day,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 21.</note> after day, year, after year, and God ſeems to
take no notice: Nay, notwithſtanding the frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of their crimes; he gives them many bleſſings, but
a viſiting time will come.<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore now go lead the people,
unto the place of which I have ſpoken unto thee. Behold mine
angel, ſhall go before thee. Nevertheleſs in the day when I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,
I will viſit their ſin upon them.</hi> Poor Sinner, thou goeſt
on in thy Rebellions, addeſt new ſins to thy old ones,

that fear and worſhip God; in that City there is frequent

the Worſhip of God it is another <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And yet
<hi>London,</hi> (oh how impartial is the Judge of the whole
Earth!) hath had its years of viſitation; in the year 1665,
God viſited <hi>London</hi> with a devouring Plague, inſomuch
that that year was called the Viſitation, and a dreadful
year it was, for God, and Death viſited both at once:
The next year 66 God viſited <hi>London</hi> again, and when
God made this viſit, a fire went before him, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
flame followed after; he went through the City in
clouds of ſmoak. A little more than a Week ago, in the

earth ſhook, and trembled under him: And if two ſuch
Cities, as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>London</hi> have been thus viſited by
the Lord of hoſts; what number of Sinners can hope to
eſcape? In the Name of God, Sirs break off your Sins by
Repentance; or you ſhall be viſited too. If God doth not
viſit the whole Land, he may viſit a particular Town;
if not a whole Town, a particular Family; if not a
whole Family, a particular Perſon; God may viſit thee
with languiſhing Sickneſs, torturing Pains, with an haſty
Death, however ſooner, or later in this World, or in the
next, if thou remain impenitent, (as the Lord lives) thou
ſhalt be viſited. If God do not viſit thee on Earth, he will

            <p>Prop. 1. <hi>An Earthquake is taken either in a metaphorical,

Angel took the cenſer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and
caſt it into the earth: and there were voices and thundrings,
and lightnings, and an earthquake, Rev. 6. 12. And I beheld
when he had opened the ſixth ſeal, and lo, there was a great
earthquake, i. e.</hi> a great change in the State of Affairs, the
Publick Religion of the Empire being changed, from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm
to Chriſtianity by <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> The Kingdom of
God is from Everlaſting to Everlaſting, fixt and ſtable;
but the Kingdoms of this World are mutable, like the
Moon ſubject to many changes; they not only ſhake and
totter, but tumble too. The Body Politick, as well as
the Body Natural, may be afflicted with an Ague, and dye

with Convulſions. All things are turned upſide down as
they are in an Earthquake; and in this ſenſe there have
been many and great Earthquakes in the World; the four
Famous and Renowned Monarchies have felt them. But
an Earthquake is taken in the <hi>litteral and proper ſenſe,</hi>

the Bottles of Heaven, and locks up the Womb of the
Earth: If a Peſtilence kill at Noon-day, it is God that

and turn our houſes into aſhes, it is the breath of an angry
God that kindles, and blows up the flame, if the Earth
have its Convulſions, move, and ſhake, quake, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

us) that Air, Vapours, and Exhalations, ſhut up in the

            <p>Prop. III. <hi>An earthquake is uſually ſent by God in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <note place="margin">Am. 4. 1.</note> Though Thunder, Lightning, and Earthquake may
ſometimes come in the courſe of Nature, in the way of
a common and general Providence: Yet ſometimes we
may, and muſt look upon them as Meſſengers of Divine
anger, as notices of Gods diſpleaſure, againſt us for our
Sins. Men are wilfully blind, and won't ſee that God is
diſpleaſed; and the trembling and ſhaking Earth, with
<hi>open mouth,</hi> tells them he is ſo. Though Men who are
leaven'd with the Principles of Atheiſm, and whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
are ſtupified, to a wonder, with that benumming
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93655:8"/>
               <hi>opium,</hi> look upon ſuch things only as fortuitous events that
happen in this mutable State, as the product of a blind,
and fatal neceſſity: Yet <hi>Men that have their eyes open'd</hi>
will acknowledge they come from God as the efficient,
from Sin as the impulſive and deſerving cauſe, and that
the Errand they come upon is to correct and reform Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
And I think it is too evident, it is a Judgment,
when the Sins of a people have been many, and great,
numerous, and hainous, and when there are more than
uſual remarks of Terrour ſet on the Calamity: If a ſhort
fit of trembling, if one Minute or two's ſhivering, if the
ſhaking of the Earth in one particular place only, be not
an Argument of Gods Anger; yet when the Earth ſhall
open her Mouth, and become the Grave of living Men;
when the Earth ſhall ſhake for many Miles together, nay
in Countreys at a very great diſtance; when (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſaith) there are Earthquakes <hi>in divers places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 7.</note> I know

of the Nature of a Judgment in it.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>II. The Second thing propoſed, is to ſhew the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this viſit. To enquire what kind of viſit it is God
makes, when he viſiteth with an Earthquake. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
ſhall be diſpatcht in theſe ſix following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. When God viſiteth with an Earthquake, <hi>it is a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and ſurprizing viſit.</hi> Sometimes God is a long time in
preparing his Arrows, and bending his Bow; there is
ſome conſiderable ſpace of time, between the Sentence and
the Execution: But this Judgment of an Earthquake
comes ſuddenly, and in a moment. In many other judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
God ſends his Heralds to proclaim his coming; in
this he cometh upon a poor People, like a Thief in the
Night; ſuddenly and unexpectedly: Alas! They have no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93655:8"/>
warning till they find themſelves paſt help. An Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
is like an Arrow ſecretly ſhot; like an Arrow flying
in darkneſs, that wounds and kills before it is eſpyed.
God viſits before they have any notice he is ſo near at
hand: He enters into the City without ſo much as knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Gates. Oh! how ſudden and ſurprizing was
the late Earthquake! On Thurſday Morning the Citizens
of <hi>London</hi> little thought of ſuch a viſit in the Afternoon:
Even when ſome were trading in their Shops, others wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the Streets, ſome trafficking at the <hi>Exchange,</hi>
others ſitting at their Tables,<note place="margin">Pſ. 78. 30.</note> 
               <hi>even while the meat was in
their mouths;</hi> They were viſited by the Lord of hoſt with
an Earthquake: In the midſt of their worldly buſineſs,
and ſecular Affairs, the great God makes a viſit to them.
In a moment (oh what a ſurprizing viſit was this!) their
Houſes tottered, their Walls of Brick and Stone trembled,
and the foundations of their City were ſhaken.</p>
            <p>2. When God viſits with an Earthquake, <hi>it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and terrible viſit.</hi> In this, as well as in other Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
the ſuddenneſs adds a ſting to, and augments the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of it; The more ſurprizing any evil is, the more affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
and frightful to Nature it is. When an Evil cometh
ſlowly, ſtep by ſtep, we have ſome time to fortifie our
ſelves againſt, and prepare our ſelves to encounter it: But
when it comes unlookt for, it finds us unarmed and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and therefore ſtrikes with the greater dread and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
Is not this a terrible viſit? When the ſurface of the
Earth is rent and torne; and breaches made in the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
Walls: Is it not terrible, when Houſes tremble like
the leaves of a Tree, ſhaken with a mighty Wind; and
whole Towns, Villages and Cities are ſwallowed up at
once? Is it not a terrible viſit when frighted Creatures
can run no where for ſhelter, when they can take Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93655:9"/>
neither in their higheſt Turrets, nor in their loweſt
Cellars; when they can go no whither but they run to
meet Deſtruction and Death? Is it not a terrible viſit,
when Men, Women, and Children are buried in the belly
of the Earth, as <hi>Jonah</hi> was in the <hi>Whales,</hi> before they have
a time to dye? It is ſad, (and we can hardly behold it
without a floud of Tears, and volleys of Groans) to ſee the
Earth open her boſome, to receive the Bodies of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Relatives: But oh! How much more dreadful is
it to ſee the Earth open her Mouth wide, and ſwallow up
Thouſands, not of <hi>Dead,</hi> but <hi>Living</hi> Men and Women?
Oh! How terrible a viſit is this! When the Earth ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
her Mouth, and now ſends forth a flood of Waters
to drown, and anon vomiteth up flames of Fire to burn;
when the Loving Husband cannot help his diſtreſſed and
affrighted Wife, when neither Father nor Mother can
help their poor, ſcared, and crying Children, though wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to redeem the Lives of their dear Children, with the
loſs of their own: When all that the deareſt Friends can
do one for another, is to go down to the Pit together, and
accompany one another into Eternity. Good God!
What a terrible viſit is this! When here one may ſee a
Leg, and there an Arm, here a Head, and there a Trunk,
here ſome vomiting Blood, and yonder multitudes, with
their brains daſhed out. Here ſome dead, and yonder
ſome groaning forth this melancholly wiſh, Would God
I were dead; my Pains and Tortures are worſe and more
intolerable than the pangs of Death; would to God I
were dead: Here ſome poor Babes hanging on the breaſts
of their <hi>dead</hi> Mothers, and yonder many Infants fetching
their laſt Breath, and giving up the Ghoſt in the Arms of
their <hi>weeping</hi> Mothers; who with yearning Bowels cry
out; alas! For thee my poor Babe, alas! For thee my dear
Child! Theſe are ſad ſights, diſmal ſpectacles; when God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93655:9"/>
viſits with an Earthquake, he maketh a terrible viſit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
This is a terrible viſit, witneſs, what I have now
ſaid, and what your Ears have heard concerning the
Earthquake that happen'd in <hi>Jamaica:</hi> And though God
was more favourable when he thus viſited <hi>London,</hi> yet
they found it frightful and terrible enough; their running
out of their Houſes, their ſhutting up their Shops, their
tremblings, and fears, ſpoke how much dread and terrour
there is in ſuch a viſit.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>It is,</hi> (eſpecially as to us in theſe parts of the World)
<hi>a rare and unuſual viſit.</hi> Other Judgments are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
this more rare. <hi>Judgment is ſaid to be Gods ſtange
work:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſ. 28. 21.</note> And this whereof I am now ſpeaking, evidently
beareth that Character. In other Countreys Earthquakes
are more frequent; in ours more ſeldom: God hath not
viſited us in <hi>England,</hi> in this manner, ſo oft as he hath
others, and if there be not the ſame reaſon in Nature for
it here, as in other places; we ſhould take more notice of
it, acknowledge the finger of God in it, and think of it
with an awful trembling: Our Sins have been many and
great, our provocations high and daring, and the Lord of
hoſts might have viſited us year after year with an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake:
Though we are more ſecurely ſiituated than the
reſt of our Neighbours; yet that God, who is God of the
Hills, as well as of the Valleys, of the Plains as well as of
the Mountains, could have viſited us with Earthquakes,
as often as he hath viſited others. It hath not been an
every days, an every weeks, no, nor an every years vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit.
God hath viſited <hi>England</hi> with Mercy year after
year, but it hath been but now and then, he hath viſited
this Land of ours with an <hi>Earthquake.</hi> Our Mountain
hath ſtood ſtrong, while God hath touched others, and
made them ſhake and tremble: The Earth in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93655:10"/>
hath again and again opened her Mouth, and ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up her Inhabitants: But God hath been ſparing of
making ſuch viſits to us. In Hiſtory you may read of
ſome Earthquakes that have been in <hi>England;</hi> but the
<hi>Earth,</hi> for a long time <hi>hath had reſt</hi> from theſe inward
Convulſions and tremblings.</p>
            <p>4. When God viſiteth with an Earthquake, <hi>his viſit is
ſometime ſhort; and ſometimes of a longer continuance.</hi> Theſe
viſits are not alwaies of a length; as they differ in the
dread and terrour: So they do in the duration, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of them. Some of them may be but for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
or two, others may laſt longer; ſometimes the
Earth doth but ſhake and ſhiver, and at another time, it
is toſſed, like a Ball to and fro; and theſe inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions
in the Bowels of the Earth hold a long time. In
this reſpect it differs from many other Calamities. When
God viſits with a Famine, a Plague, or with a Sword,
<hi>there are none,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It may be a great while before the Earth yield her increaſe
again, and bring forth Herb, to be Meat for Man and
Beaſt; it may be many Moneths before a Plague be ſtopt,
the infected Air be purged, and Death give over follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its prey; it may be many years before the ſlaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Sword be ſheath'd, and Peace eſtabliſhed: It is with
People in theſe judgments, as with Perſons in Chronical
Diſtempers; it is a long time before they are recovered:
But this Judgment of an Earthquake is as ſharp, ſo uſually
but ſhort; like an acute Diſeaſe, from which the Patient
is ſoon recovered; or of which he quickly dies. The ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Earth, like the changing of thoſe who ſhall
be found alive at the laſt day, is done <hi>in a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye.</hi>

ſhort time.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>This viſit is ſometimes particular, ſometimes more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>
Sometimes God makes this viſit in one particular
Countrey, and in one part and corner of it only; he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits

               <hi>his
circuit</hi> like that of the Suns is from one end of the Earth to
the other. He viſits many People, and many Countreys,
and thoſe that are at a great diſtance at once.<note place="margin">Acts 16. 26.</note> The
Earthquake that happen'd when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were in
Priſon, was a particular one, reacht no farther than the
Confines of the Priſon. But the Earthquake that was
among the ſolemnities that attended the <hi>Crucifixion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marth. 27. 51.</note> and
<hi>Death</hi> of our Bleſſed Lord, was more general; ſome think
the whole Earth was then ſhaken, however it is agreed,
it reacht a long way. The Earth for a great way (as if it
were more ſenſible than thoſe Men that acted their part in
that bloody and unparallel'd Tragedy) trembled and
ſhook, the Sun bluſht and would not behold: The
Earth was filled with horrour at the vile indignities that
were done to the Son of God, and Saviour of the World.
And in this that lately happen'd, God viſited not only the
City, but the Suburbs, not only <hi>London,</hi> but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
not only one or two, but many did the Lord of hoſts
viſit with an Earthquake; not only <hi>England,</hi> but other
parts beyond the Seas: In this viſit God marcht from
City to Country, from Town to Town, nay, though the
Sea was in his way, he paſſed the mighty Ocean, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
them, that dwell on the other ſide of it too. This
Earthquake ſeemed to have the fame Command, <hi>Abraham</hi>
once had,<note place="margin">Gen 13. 17.</note> 
               <hi>to walk through the land in the length thereof, and
in the breadth thereof.</hi> Though it was not in all, yet it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93655:11"/>
was in many places, and thoſe very remote and diſtant
too. God held his viſitation in Countreys very diſtant,
and in many Countries at one and the ſame inſtant of
time. Oh how far can God go, when he hath a mind to
viſit!</p>
            <p>6. <hi>This is a warning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 21. 9, 11.</note> 
               <hi>and a preſaging viſit:</hi> And it ought
to be a ſtartling, and an alarmning one. This visiting with
an Earthquake is very often, (God help the drowſie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>England</hi> to conſider and lay it to heart) the
fore-runner of ſome dreadful calamity that is near at hand.
It hath been like a flaming Beacon ſet on Fire, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
an Enemy is approaching.<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 2, 7, 8.</note> Thus according to our
Saviours prediction, Earthquakes were among the fore-runners
of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> deſtruction; an Earthquake to them
was like the ſhooting off of a warning, before the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Peece is diſcharged. Some think it is among thoſe
things, that preſage the diſſolution of the World; and
ſhall uſher in the day of the great and final Judgment.</p>
            <p>Though the Book of Providence be very myſterious,
and dark, and cannot be unriddled, till time be the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter;
events are the beſt Comments on <hi>Providences,</hi> as
well as <hi>Propheſies:</hi> Though in theſe volumes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as well as in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </note> 
               <hi>There are ſome
things hard to be underſtood;</hi> yet a modeſt and humble
conjecture is not unlawful.  If God gives us Signs in the
Heavens, and Signs in the Earth too, if God put Nature
into a fright, we ought, it is our Duty and Wiſdom to
take the warning theſe things ſuggeſt. Perhaps the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
being over,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15 32.</note> Men are apt to ſay with <hi>Agag, ſurely
the bitterneſs of death is paſt,</hi> when theſe tremblings and
ſhakings of the Earth may be but the melancholy Preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of what is yet behind. When I conſider what Sins
and Impieties this Nation of ours hath been guilty of,
how we are rendred worſe rather than better by thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93655:11"/>
late ſignal Deliverances, which evidently carry the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of God upon them; I think it is not raſhneſs to
ſay, I am afraid God hath not yet done viſiting of <hi>England.</hi>
Earthquakes have been the fore-runners of heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and extraordinary Calamities, and inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,
I pray God this that hath lately happened, do
not bode ſome ill to us, and the Neighbour Nations.
Lord! grant it may not. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. The third and laſt thing I undertook, is to make
ſome practical Improvement both of the Text and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and that ſhall be done in ſpeaking to ſome Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
very eaſily deducible from both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inference</hi> 1. Doth the Lord of Hoſts ſometimes viſit with
an Earthquake, and hath he of late done ſo? <hi>Then with
what awful attention and heed ſhould we take Notice of ſuch a
viſit as this!</hi> All Gods viſits are worthy of our Notice,
and deſerve a particular remark: Divine Providences (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
thoſe that have more than ordinary Signatures
and Characters imprinted on them) ſhould be attended to,
and ſeriouſly conſidered by us. If God viſit us in Mercy,
we ſhould take notice of the Time, Manner, Frequency,
Seaſonableneſs, and other Circumſtances. If God viſit in
Anger, as he hath lately done, with an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> we
ſhould regard and conſider it;<note place="margin">Luke 2. 19.</note> with <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of
our Lord we ſhould <hi>keep all theſe things and ponder them in
our hearts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſ. 5. 11, 12.</note> An <hi>heavy wo</hi> is denounc'd againſt thoſe that
follow their Cups and carnal Mirth, <hi>but regard not the
works of the Lord, neither conſider the operation of his hands.</hi>
God a-while ago viſited <hi>Jamaica,</hi> with an Earthquake,
and a Terrible one too; we heard of it, we made it our
<hi>Coffee-Houſe Talk,</hi> we entertained our ſelves with it as we
do with a peice of Common News; but we did not, (ah
ſtupid ſinners that we are!) we did not take that awful
notice of it, as we ought to have done. We heard of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93655:12"/>
the Earth's opening her mouth, and ſwallowing up thoſe
poor ſinful wretches in great Numbers; but we did not
conſider it as the nature of the Calamity did require; and
when God had done viſiting of them, he came over, and
viſited us too; and what is the Language of ſuch a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
but this? <q>Drowfie <hi>England,</hi> ſleepy <hi>England,</hi>
takes no notice of what I have done, thus have I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
overturn'd this place, and <hi>London</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;
and though they think their Mountain ſtands
ſtrong, and are ready to ſay it ſhall not be moved, I
will go over and ſhake <hi>England,</hi> I will viſit with an
Earthquake their Me<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>opolis, their chief City, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
then they will conſider and take notice.</q> There
are three things we ſhould take notice of and remember,
and yet (the Lord pity us) we are apt to forget them all.
The firſt is our Sins, to keep us Humble: The ſecond,
Gods Mercies, to make us Thankful: The third is Gods
Judgments, or angry Viſits, that we may be in the fear of
the Lord,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 17.</note> not only <hi>all the day,</hi> but <hi>all our life long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, oh! this is a Viſit the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould not ſlightly paſs over, ſhould
not forget. The Eighth of <hi>September</hi> 1692. the day of
Gods Viſiting with an Earthquake, ſhould be remembred:
Write it not in your Note-books, but in your Memories;
Record it not only in your Memories, but engrave it, on
your very Hearts;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 3.</note> in thoſe <hi>fleſhly Tables,</hi> let this viſit of the
Lord of Hoſts be written.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>How great is the Miſery of wicked Men, who have their
portion in this World and no Treaſure but what is laid up upon
Earth!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ 17. 14.</note> Oh how uncertain, how unconſtant is their All!
A Treaſure laid up upon Earth!<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 19.</note> How uncertain? When

How uncertain and unconſtant!<note place="margin">Pſ. 22. 2.</note> when <hi>God hath founded
the earth upon the Seas, and eſtabliſhed it upon the Floods?</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93655:12"/>
If your portion ly in Silver and Gold, Oh! how ſoon can
your <hi>riches make themſelves Wings and fly away;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 5.</note> and you
be no more able to ſtop them than a Bird upon the Wing,
that is as free and unconfined as the Air it flies in? If your
portion lie in Houſes (though built with ſtone and brick)
how ſoon can a fire make them <hi>burn as an oven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 1.</note> and the
devouring flame feed upon them; how ſoon can God
with his breath, I mean ſome ſtormy Wind overturn them?
If your Eſtate ly in Land, and though then (ſilly men!)
you think it is ſecure, oh how ſoon can the Lord of Hoſts
deſtroy you and all your ſubſtance? If God doth viſit you
in Anger, ſend an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> of a few hours, Nay, of a
few Minutes long your Houſes Reel, Totter, and Tumble
about your ears! The Earth may open her Boſom, and
you and your Poſſeſſions may be buried and entombed
together. He that hath not one foot of Land, at ſuch a
time, hath as much benefit as he that hath many Acres, a
whole Mannour, and many Lordſhips; for both of them,
the <hi>rich Landlord,</hi> and the <hi>toiling Tenant,</hi> make their grave
together. The Earth is a firm and ſolid part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but God in a few Minutes can ſhake and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
it. Lord! what a ſlippery, uncertain and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd
Happineſs have the Men of this World!</p>
            <p>3. <hi>What, and how great, is the happineſs of holy Perſons;
and how comfortable may they be, even when God ſhakes the
Heavens, and the Earth too!</hi> An Earthquake, may make an
Heart-quake in every impenitent Sinner: (and what a
wonder is it it doth not) but the <hi>righteous</hi> may be <hi>bold as
a Lyon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28. 1.</note> and full of Comfort; when the World is in an
hurry without them, all may be quiet and peaceable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
When there is a threatning and terrifying ſtorm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
there may be a ſweet and bleſſed calm within. They
who can truly ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 46. 1.</note> 
               <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength, a very
preſent help in trouble;</hi> may boldly ſay, <hi>we will not fear,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93655:13"/>
though the earth be removed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note>

that they have ſomething more laſting and durable,<note place="margin">Joel. 3. 16.</note>
more conſtant and fix'd than Earth it ſelf; that they have
<hi>received,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 28.</note> and are Heirs of a <hi>Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken.</hi>
It is a Kingdom, men cannot ſhake, Devils cannot ſhake,
and God will not. This Earth of ours may be hurled hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and thither; but heaven (and that's the place where
the Believers Happineſs is <hi>laid up)</hi> is firm,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1. 5.</note> permanent, and
remains for ever unſhaken. The Walls of yonder City,
the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above cannot Totter, and the
Foundations ſhall never be torn up. Oh what Comfort,
amidſt all the Commotions and Concuſſions that are in this
lower World, may holy Souls derive from their Title to
that <hi>Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken;</hi> and at which in a
little time they ſhall arrive!</p>
            <p>4. <hi>How careful ſhould all that have either heard of, or felt
the late Earthquake be, to improve to Spiritual purpoſes this
viſit of the Lord of hoſts!</hi> It is an evil not to improve the
Viſits of our Fellow-Creatures, of thoſe wiſe, holy and
good Men we converſe withall; but it is doubly Criminal,
not to improve, and get advantage by God's Viſits. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
here you will ask me, How ſhould we improve
it? I Anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. Would you improve this late Viſit of the Lord of
Hoſts? <hi>Then let it confirm and ſtrengthen you in the belief of
his Power.</hi> In theſe Viſits, God gives evident proof of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93655:13"/>
his Almighty power. It was his hand that formed, and it
is his Arm that ſhakes the Earth; oh how great is his
power! and who hath an arm like God! when we ſee
the Earth trembling, and Rocks rending, and Mountains
ſhaking, it is very ſeaſonable to cry out with Admiration,
and holy Wonder, oh what a powerful God is this! Doth
God ſhake the earth, then what is it he cannot do? Doth
he turn the World upſide down, doth he turn the Earth
with his Finger, as a door is turned upon its Hinges, and
doth this great God, this mighty Lord, want power to
cruſh ſuch a worm, to deſtroy ſuch a peice of warm and
breathing clay as thou art? Oh thou impenitent Sinner,
how ſoon can this mighty Lord God of Hoſts, that ſhakes
the Earth, lay thee on a bed of ſickneſs, throw thee into
a cold, dark and frightful grave, and hurl thee into an
hot, flaming and eternal hell? Doſt thou diſ-believe the
power of God? Do you, even you, oh ye Worms of the
Earth think you are fit Match for God? Do you think
he is not able to deſtroy a whole World of ſuch weak
Creatures as you are? Oh think how Mountains ſhake,
the Earth trembles when he doth but look upon them;
and believe he can do this,<note place="margin">Pſ. 62. 11.</note> and more than this. You have
<hi>heard that power belongs to God;</hi> let this late Viſit perſwade
you to believe it, to give a more firm aſſent to the firſt
Article of your Creed, <hi>I believe in God the Father
Almighty—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Would you improve this Viſit? <hi>Then let it excite
and maintain in you an holy aw, and fear of God.</hi> This na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follows from what hath been ſaid of Gods power;
and from this very Topick our Saviour perſwadeth men to
fear God,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 28.</note> 
               <hi>fear him who is able to caſt both body, and ſoul into
Hell.</hi> And the obſervation and memory of Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhould cheriſh this fear:<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 120.</note> This made Holy <hi>David</hi>
cry out, <hi>my freſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93655:14"/>
of thy Judgments.</hi> Shall the Earth tremble, and ſhall not
Sinners much more? Such Viſits as theſe ſhould fill us with
a filial Fear, and an awful dread, of the great God. When
God ſhook the Earth, methinks, he ſaid as to them of old,
<hi>Fear ye not me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 5. 22.</note> 
               <hi>ſaith the Lord, will ye not tremble at my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</hi>
God ſhook the Foundations of <hi>London,</hi> and ſaid,
Will ye not fear me O ye Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> will ye not
tremble at my preſence? God hath viſited the World
with one Earthquake after another, and cry'd, O ye Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Men will ye not fear me? Such amazing and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Providences as theſe, ſhould excite and cheriſh a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Fear of God. Good God! how ſad is it, That the
Earth, Mountains, Hills and Rocks, and every thing elſe
ſhould tremble at the Preſence of the Lord, and Men ſhould
not! Oh Fear God and Sin, more than ever: Fear God,
for he is able to deſtroy; fear Sin, for that, and only that,
provokes him to do ſo.</p>
            <p>3. Would you improve this late Viſit of the Lord of
Hoſts?<note place="margin">La. 3. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Then viſit your ſelves, in order to your Repentance
and Amendment of Life.</hi> At ſuch a time we ſhould Viſit
our own Hearts, <hi>ſearch and try our ways;</hi> and this ſhould
be in order to our <hi>turning to God.</hi> The Repentance and
Reformation of a ſinful People, is God's deſign in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
this is his end in thus viſiting particular Perſons, or
whole Societies. What was the Language of the late
Earthquake but this? Repent, Repent, O <hi>England,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
Lord! give us Ears to hear, and Hearts to obey,
theſe loud, ſolemn, and repeated calls to Repentance.
Sin is a Burden, alas! it is a very heavy burden; God
himſelf is preſt with and weary to bear it: It maketh the
whole Creation groan; it hath lately made the Earth to
tremble, and won't you caſt it off? Do, for the Lords ſake
do, or this burden will ſink you, not only into the Belly
of the Earth, but into the Bowels of Hell too. The Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93655:14"/>
prepared the Gaoler for Converſion,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 26. ver. 30.</note> 
               <hi>it made him
come trembling to the Apoſtles, crying out, Sirs, What muſt I
Do to be Saved?</hi> Oh! that this late Earthquake, might put
you, and many more upon conſidering with your ſelves,
and enquiring of others what you muſt do to be ſaved;
and in order to this, let it put you upon a ſpeedy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
for God's viſit is not anſwered, without the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
amendment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> V. Doth the Lord of Hoſts ſometimes Viſit with an
Earthquake, and hath he of late done ſo? <hi>Then how hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
ſhould we bleſs God, he hath done ſo no oftner!</hi> Oh!
what thanks and praiſe is due to the God of Heaven, there
hath not been a more frequent repetition of this Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
We might have had one Earthquake upon the heels
of another, ſhake after ſhake, till God had ſhook us and
our dwellings too into the Duſt: But though God hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
<hi>England</hi> with an Earthquake, we are bound (and O
Sirs call up your Drowſie Souls, and awaken all within
you) to praiſe God, this Judgment hath been executed no
oftner.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Earthquake</hi> is a very grievous and ſore Evil; an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing
and amazing Calamity; an Evil againſt which
no Reſiſtance can be made. If a Fire take hold on our
Houſes, we may uſe means to quench the devouring
Flame: If a Peſtilence be among us, we may do ſomething
to prevent the Infection: But if an <hi>Earthquake</hi> come, we
wholly ly at the Mercy of it, and can do nothing to help
our ſelves. An <hi>Earthquake</hi> is a Judgment that carries all
the Enſigns of Horror, and beareth all the frightful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of dread and Terror. Oh what a Mercy is it they
have been ſo rare, and what a Tribute of Thanks is due
to Heaven? O <hi>England, England!</hi> What a Sacrifice of
Praiſe ſhouldſt thou lay on Gods Altar? How heartily
ſhould we bleſs God he hath not again and again, often
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93655:15"/>
and frequently viſited us with this Judgment, at the
thoughts of which we may juſtly tremble, as the Earth
did when God ſhook it!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> VI. <hi>How Affectionately ſhould we praiſe God, this late
Viſit of his was ſo favourable, and had ſuch a mixture of
Mercy in it!</hi> Though the Foundations of <hi>London</hi> ſhook,
they were not overturn'd; though the Earth quak'd and
trembled, ſhe did not open her Mouth to ſwallow up liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men and Women: Though the Houſes reeled, they
did not tumble; though the Walls parted and gaped, they
did not fall. Surely our God in the midſt of Judgment,
remembred mercy; and we in the midſt of our Fears, and
dangers ſhould not forget to give Thanks. In this late
Diſpenſation of Providence, you may ſee both the <hi>Severity</hi>
and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God. <hi>London</hi> quak'd and trembled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Severity, <hi>London</hi> was not ſwallowed up, behold
the Goodneſs of God. In this Angry and Terrible Viſit
God hath ſhewn much Mercy and Goodneſs, ay, the Riches
of his Goodneſs; and for this do you bleſs the Lord, and
<hi>let all breath praiſe his holy Name.</hi> Now to quicken you to,
and in this ſeaſonable Duty, I ſhall briefly ſuggeſt theſe
three Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>1. Conſider, <hi>What God had lately done in another place;
I mean in Jamaica.</hi> He Viſited them in a terrible manner
indeed. His Anger was hot, it burnt like Coals of Fire;
his Arm was ſtrong, and threw down all before him:
What Deſolations did the Earthquake there make! Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you could with ſafety have ſtood by, and ſeen the
Earth moving and ſhaking, the Houſes firſt reeling to and
fro and then ſinking: And the frighted Inhabitants almoſt
at their Wits end: The diſtracted Wife hanging about
the Neck of her dear Husband; the tender Infants hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Breaſts of their Mothers, and both ready to drop
into the Pit together. Had you ſeen poor ſcared Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93655:15"/>
running up and down, ſeeking their Parents, one
Friend with their laſt breath crying to another, help,
help, for the Lords ſake, help, and all at laſt; after many
fruitleſs attempts, and vain wiſhes, tumbling alive into
the common Grave. If you had heard their miſerable
Cries, their doleful groans, and piercing Shrieks, being
half buried, and half unburied, would you not have
thought <hi>Englands</hi> Mercy a very great Mercy? I am
perſwaded you would have returned with your Mouths
filled with Songs of Praiſe: Let a Melancholy Phanſie
repreſent ſome of the Terrours of that Viſitation; and
let a thought of this fill you with thankfulneſs, and give a
ſprightful accent to all your Hallelujahs. Oh how ſhould
a ſober thought of this cauſe your Sacrifices of Praiſe to
aſcend to Heaven in a purer, and brighter Flame!</p>
            <p>2. Conſider <hi>our ſins, have deſerved as great an overthrow
as theirs.</hi> When I conſider thoſe words of my Saviour,
being told by ſome of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe Blood <hi>Pilate</hi>
had mingled with their Sacrifices, <hi>Luke 13. 2. Suppoſe ye
that thoſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galileans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſuffered ſuch things?</hi> I can hardly perſwade my
ſelf, they of <hi>Jamaica</hi> were greater Sinners than we in
<hi>England,</hi> becauſe they drank deeper of the Cup of <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi>
than we did. If our Sins are not of the ſame kind, I
am ſure they admit of more aggravating Circumſtances
than theirs. <hi>Londons, Englands</hi> Sins are of a more Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
Colour, and Scarlet Die than <hi>Jamaica's:</hi> If ours
ſhould be laid in the ballance of the Sanctuary with theirs,
I am afraid the former would weigh down the latter: Oh
what a Mercy was it God ſhould ſhake ſuch a People,
and not deſtroy them! Oh what an inſtance of Divine
goodneſs was it, that the Earth ſhould tremble under a
Company of Atheiſts, and Scoffers at Religion; Men
that queſtion the very being, and deny the Providence of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93655:16"/>
God: Under a Company of Drunkards, and Swearers,
Adulterers, and filthy Harlots, Sabbath-breakers, and
Hypocritical Worſhippers, and not ſwallow them up!
Mercy that is ſo conſtant a Friend, to the miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
And ſo powerful an Advocate in Gods boſom, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated
the ſtroke; and therefore Mercy ought to have
the praiſe.</p>
            <p>3. Conſider <hi>the eaſineſs of a total deſtruction.</hi> All things
are alike eaſie to Almighty Power. What is it omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
cannot effect? This God can amaze the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
unhinge the World; ſhake the Heavens,
and rend the Rocks, put univerſal Nature into a
fright; with one turn of his hand, one word of his mouth,
one frown of his brow, one glance of his angry
Eye; yea, with the ſmalleſt breath of his Noſtrils; that
angry, that mighty God that ſhook, could with the
ſame touch have overturned the City: By what was done
God gave an evident proof of what he could further have
done. There is no Mountain ſtands ſo ſtrong; but God
can ſhake it: No Foundation fo firmly laid, but God can
tare it up; no City ſo well built, but God can, even with
the breath of his Noſtrils overturn it: It is not Brick and
Lime, Walls of Stone, no, nor of Braſs neither, can either
blunt, or turn back thoſe ſharp-pointed Arrows, God
ſhooteth againſt a ſinful people. With one ſhake God
could have levelled all with the Duſt. Could God eaſily
and ſuddenly have deſtroyed us, and did he not? Could he
have inlarged the Commiſſion granted to the Earthquake,
and did he not? Were we on the very brink of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and are we not deſtroyed? Were we intangled
in the Snare; and are we yet eſcaped, and ſhould
not a warm thought of this, ſhould not <hi>ſuch a deliverance
as this</hi> increaſe our thankfulneſs?<note place="margin">Ez. 9. 13.</note> Let all who have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93655:16"/>
this Viſitation bleſs the Lord; and may all praiſe
this good God, not only with their Lips, but in their
Lives!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> VII. Doth the Lord of hoſts ſometimes viſit with
an Earthquake; and hath he of late done ſo? <hi>Then how
loudly doth this viſit call upon men, upon the citizens of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
upon you and all the inhabitants of England, to be more
frequent in viſiting God!</hi> When God is viſiting us, it is
time, time alas! It is <hi>high time</hi> for us to viſit him. Had
the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> been
more frequent in viſiting God: They might not have had
ſuch a day of Viſitation as this was; my meaning is, had
they prayed more, they might have been puniſht leſs:
But (oh what a ſhame and reproach are we to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Name!) Prayer hath been caſt out of many of our
Families; and would to God there were not reaſon to ſay,
out of many of our Cloſets too: And this among other
things called upon God to viſit in that terrible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
of manner he hath lately done. And now when
God viſits us with afflictions, We ſhould viſit him with
Prayer, <hi>Iſa. 26. 16 Lord, in trouble have they viſited thee,
they poured out a prayer when thy chaſtning was upon them.</hi>
The Rod drove them to a Throne of Grace, and affliction
made them pray; ay, and it made them pray errneſtly too.
Afflictions, fears, and dangers drive many to the Gates of
Heaven, who would never come thither before; they are
like ſome moroſs and ill-natur'd People, who will never
viſit their friends, but when they ſtand in need of them.
I make no doubt, but during the time of Gods viſiting,
the terrours of the Earthquake forc't from many,
(and perhaps from ſuch as were wont to <hi>reſtrain Prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 15. 4.</note>)
that ſhort and uſual Petition; LORD HAVE MERCY
ON US: The ſhaking and trembling <hi>Earth</hi> cauſed many
to lift up their Eyes to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and implore the Mercy of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93655:17"/>
that God that dwelleth there. But now God hath done
viſiting <hi>them,</hi> I am afraid they have done viſiting <hi>him:</hi>
Now the Earth hath done trembling, they have done
praying,<note place="margin">Ja. 3. 10.</note> but <hi>my brethren theſe things ought not ſo to be:</hi>
Our viſits ſhould be frequent, and oft repeated. Three
things are very wonderful.</p>
            <p>1. It is very wonderful, <hi>That the great God will viſit us.</hi>
God is King of the Univerſe, ſways the Scepter in both
Worlds, and exerciſeth an unlimited, and uncontroulable
Authority, not only over the meaner works of his hands
below; but over all the bright and Coeleſtial Orders above
too. He ſits upon a Throne that is encircled with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads
of Holy,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 10</note> Mighty, and Glorious Angels, who <hi>miniſter
unto him, and ſtand before him</hi> in the quality and humility
of his Servants, ready to receive his Commands, and fly
upon Wings to execute them: And doth he viſit Man,
who is but breathing Duſt, a lump of Clay moiſtned and
coloured with Blood? Aſtoniſhing kindneſs!</p>
            <p>It is to be admired he will vouchſafe a look, a ſhort
glance of his Eye: But that he ſhould make ſtated viſits,
and ſo many of them accents the kindneſs, and increaſeth
the wonder. The Royal <hi>Pſalmiſt, David,</hi> though a King,
though he ſwayed a Scepter, managed a Kingdom, and
wore a Crown, could not think of Gods viſiting Man
without Extaſie and Rapture: Though he ſate <hi>among the
Gods upon earth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 82. 1.</note> yet he is ſwallowed up with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the thought of the condeſcenſion of the <hi>God of
Heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Lord!</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>When I conſider thy heavens,
the work of thy fingers, the moon and ſtars which thou haſt
ordained;</hi>

               <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him? and
the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him!</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> having
ſtudied the Heavens in which Volumes the Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Majeſty of God are written in Capital Letters,
and Golden Characters: Cryes out with admiration,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93655:17"/>
               <hi>Lord what is man that thou viſiteſt him!</hi> How fit are all
Gods viſits to be the ſubject of a devout, and ſilent admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration!
Doth God viſit this mean, this contemptible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Man? Wonderful Grace!</p>
            <p>2. It is wonderful <hi>that Men, ſinful Men, guilty Men may
viſit God:</hi> That we are allowed the liberty of making a
viſit to Heaven: God might ſcorn us, and our viſits too;
he might lock up himſelf in Heaven, and deny acceſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Preſence to ſuch undutiful, and diſloyal Creatures
as we have been. This great King, this mighty Lord
might not ſuffer ſuch <hi>dead dogs</hi> as we are to lie at his door.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 14.</note>
But (oh condeſcending goodneſs!) He invites us to give
him a viſit; and the oftner we viſit him, the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
are we: He blames us for our <hi>ſeldom,</hi> but he never
upbraids us with our <hi>often</hi> viſits. Oh who would not
viſit, and often viſit ſuch a God as this? May Men and
Sinners viſit the God of Heaven, the High, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
One: Do his Gates continually ſtand open, and may
Indigent Creatures come daily for an Alms? Invaluable
Mercy!</p>
            <p>3. It is wonderful, <hi>that Men ſhould be ſo backward to
viſit God.</hi> How neceſſary and excellent! How ſweet
and comfortable! How profitable and advantagious a
Duty is this! To viſit God is equally our Duty and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge;
while we do ſo we ſhare with Glorious Angels
in that which is the top of their Happineſs;<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 10.</note> 
               <hi>beholding the
face of our Father which is in heaven.</hi> Now, if ever, do
Holy and Devout Souls anticipate their future happineſs,<note place="margin">Pſ. 16. ult.</note>
in partaking of that <hi>fullneſs of joy</hi> which is in Gods <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi>
and in drinking large draughts of thoſe <hi>rivers of
pleaſure that are at his right hand for evermore.</hi> How oft
have Holy Men come from this <hi>Mount</hi> with their <hi>faces ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning!</hi>
How oft have they received ſupport under all their
burdens, encouragement againſt their fears, an anſwer to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93655:18"/>
their doubts, and a ſufficiency of ſtrength to encounter
difficulties, performe Duties, to endure <hi>the fiery tryal,</hi>
and quench <hi>the fiery darts of the evil one,</hi> to conflict with
their Corruptions, and overcome the World! How oft,
(even in the time of their viſiting) hath God wiped
Tears from their weeping Eyes, refreſht their drooping
and revived their fainting Spirits; cleared up their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
for Heaven, and inabled them to ſee their Names
written there, ſpoken comfortably to their hearts, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them of their Covenant Relation to him, and their
Intereſt in his ſpecial love and favour! Oh how oft have
they come away with their Pardon Sealed, their fears, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Conſciences pacified, and thoſe Clouds that darkned their

this, Men will not (oh! fatal degeneracy of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)

Among the vaſt multitudes of Men and Women that
croud and throng the World; there are ſome few, who
from a principle of a good Education, the <hi>Remains of
Natural Light,</hi> and the urgent calls of <hi>an awaken'd Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
do ſomething of this kind; but it is rather out of

O ye Heavens</hi> at this, <hi>and be ye horribly afraid.</hi> How

he did of old?<note place="margin">Jer. 2. 31.</note> 
               <hi>O generation, ſee ye the word of the Lord;

Wherefore ſay my people, we are lords, we will come no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Heaven; yet they ſeldom viſit God, ſtupendous folly!
This late Earthquake ſhould put Men upon viſiting God
oftner, and when you do, remember to make theſe two
following requeſts:</p>
            <p>1. Pray that God would <hi>viſit you, and all his people in
mercy,</hi> this was one notable Petition, Holy <hi>David,</hi> that
Man of Prayer put up to God,<note place="margin">Pſ. 106. 4.</note> 
               <hi>O viſit me with thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi>
Theſe viſits how welcom and bleſſed, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
and deſirable are they! Oh beg of God for more
of them! Go to God, and ſay, Lord, Thou haſt viſited
thy People, O viſit them ſtill with thy Salvation! Lord!
Let not theſe viſits of thine which are ſo much for thy
Glory, and the Creatures good; be rare and ſeldom, but
frequent and oft repeated.</p>
            <p>2. Pray that God would <hi>viſit no more in anger:</hi> And
methinks when there is ſo much dread, and terrour in
the viſits of an angry God, Men ſhould earneſtly depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
them. If God viſit with a Plague, Death becomes
triumphant,<note place="margin">Judg 15. 16.</note> and Men fall <hi>heaps upon heaps</hi> into the Grave.
If God viſit with a Famine, our beauty faileth, our
ſtrength conſumeth, and the Man becomes a <hi>walking
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93655:19"/>
Ghoſt</hi> before Death turns him into a <hi>Corps.</hi> If God viſit
with an Earthquake, Men are at their Wits-end, and this
beautiful World is turned into a confuſed Chaos. O beg
of God, <hi>England</hi> may have no more of theſe terrifying
and deſolating viſits. If you won't pray, the next ſhake
may be your overthrow. If you will not for all this viſit
God, the Lord of hoſts may viſit with an Earthquake a
ſecond time; and his ſecond viſit may carry more dread
and terrour with it than the firſt did. Turn the Text in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Prayer, and ſay, Oh that <hi>England,</hi> Oh that <hi>London</hi>
may no more be viſited of the Lord of hoſts with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Earthquake! Lord grant it may not, <hi>Amen.</hi>
