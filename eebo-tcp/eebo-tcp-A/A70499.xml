            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>OUr common Idea of Rhetorick
is this, That to ſpeak Eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it ſuffices to cram our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
with ſuch Precepts as are
preſcrib'd by it. In this opinion, ſeveral
People read with great eagerneſs thoſe
Books which are writ of that Subject; but
after all their pains and aſſiduity finding
their improvement but ſmall, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
little more Eloquent than before,
they impute it to the Author, as if he
had not diſcover'd the Myſtery of the
Art according to his pretence: So that
not receiving the benefit they expected,
their diſappointment turns into diſguſt, and
makes them deſpiſe all that he writes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50222:3"/>
I ſhould expect no better Fortune for
this Book, had not our Author avoided
a particular fault that renders moſt Books
of Rhetorick ineffectual. He does not
trouble the Reader with a throng and
huddle of Precepts, that ſerve only to load
and incumber the Mind. He endeavours
to lay open the bottom of the Art he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
and its natural Principles, which
being well underſtood, leaves us under no
neceſſity of multitude of Rules, that do but
crowd one another out of the Memory as
ſoon as they are entred.</p>
            <p>To make us comprehend the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Principles of Rhetorick, our
Author begins with an explication how
Speech is form'd: To ſhow from Nature
it ſelf after what manner words are to be
contriv'd for the Expreſſion of our Thoughts,
and the Motions of our Wills, he has ſuppos'd
a company of new Men met together, who
had never convers'd before, nor knew how
to ſpeak. He conſiders what theſe Men
would do; he makes it appear, they would
quickly find the benefit of Speech, and
frame a Language to themſelves. He
conſiders what form they would give it,
and in his reſearch diſcovers the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
<pb facs="tcp:50222:3"/>
of all Language, and gives his
Reaſons for all Rules preſcrib'd by the
Grammarians. It may be, his Diſquiſition
will appear inconſiderable to ſome, who
will be diſcourag'd from reading this Book,
when in the Front they find him ſpeaking
of <hi>Nouns Subſtantives, Adjectives,
Declenſions, Verbs, Conjugations,
&amp;c.</hi> But, beſides that the Conſequence
will eaſily evince, that it is uſeful for
teaching Languages with more readineſs,
and to make us ſpeak more exactly; Order
would not permit him to paſs over thoſe
little things, which if you will believe
<hi>Quintilian</hi> (as great a Maſter of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
as any has writ) make the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
part of the <hi>Art of Speaking;</hi>
and this he declares, by comparing them
to the Foundations of a Houſe, which
though laid low under ground, are yet as
neceſſary parts as any that appear.</p>
            <p>When his new Men have acted their
parts, our Author ſhows what is the true
Original of Language, and that 'tis not
bare accident that ſupplied us with Words.
Nevertheleſs he demonſtrates, that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
depends upon the Will and Conſent
of Men, and that Cuſtom, or common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb facs="tcp:50222:4"/>
exerciſes an abſolute dominion over
our Words, and therefore he gives us
Rules to know the Laws of Cuſtom, and
Directions how they are to be kept. And
all this in his firſt Book.</p>
            <p>In his ſecond Book he obſerves that the
plentifulleſt, and moſt copious Languages
cannot furniſh proper Terms for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of all our Idea's, and therefore
recourſe is to be had to Art, and we
muſt borrow the Terms of things that
bear reſemblance, or retain ſome refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or connexion with thoſe which we
would ſignifie other ways, had common
Cuſtom afforded us Natural Terms. Theſe
borrowed Expreſſions are called Tropes;
he ſpeaks of all ſorts of Tropes, and of
their Uſe. He obſerves likewiſe in the
ſame Book, That as Nature has diſpos'd
the Body of Man ſo, as to put it ſelf into
ſuch poſtures immediately as are beſt proper
for avoiding what is like to be hurtful,
and for receiving what is like to do good:
So Nature directs us to certain tricks and
artifices in ſpeaking, able to produce in
the Minds of our Hearers the Effects which
we deſire, whether it be anger, or mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or deteſtation, or love. Theſe ways
<pb facs="tcp:50222:4"/>
and artifices in ſpeaking, are called <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
of which our Author treats with
more than ordinary care, not contenting
himſelf with mentioning their Names,
and adding ſome few Examples (as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
done) but he diſcovers the Nature
of each Figure, and how it is to be uſed.</p>
            <p>The eaſineſs wherewith we ſpeak, and
the pleaſure we take to hear an harangue
well pronounc'd (as our Author has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
at the beginning of his Book) has
diſpos'd Mankind to make uſe of Words to
ſignifie his Thoughts, rather than of any
other ſign. In the ordering and ranging
of Words, great pains has been taken to
find out what it is that makes a Diſcourſe
go well off of the Tongue, and prove grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Hearers. We have at large in
his third Book, what we are to avoid,
what we are to obſerve, what we are to
do in the ranking our Words for better
pronunciation; and what we are to do to
make them acceptable to the Ear. In this
Book it is he diſcourſes of Periods, explains
the Art of Verſification; and after he has
taught what it is in the Sound of Words
that is pleaſant to the Ear, he ſhows
how the Rules preſcrib'd by other Maſters
<pb facs="tcp:50222:5"/>
for the Compoſition of Periods, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Verſe, are for no other end, but
to diſcover in Diſcourſe the conditions that
render pronunciation moſt agreeable and
eaſie.</p>
            <p>The laſt Book treats of Styles, or ways
of ſpeaking, which Men aſſume according
to their natural inclinations. He gives
direction for regulation of our Styles; and
that every Subject might be treated in a
convenient way, he ſhows how our Style
ought to be heightned or debaſed, as the
Matter of our Diſcourſe is conſiderable or
otherwiſe: He ſhows how the quality of
our Diſcourſe ought to expreſs the quality
of our Subject; how our Style ought to be
ſtrong or ſmooth, ſevere or florid, as the
Nature of the Subject requires. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
into the Style of an Orator, a Poet,
a Philoſopher, and Hiſtorian; and at the
end of his Diſcourſe, ſpeaking of Rhetorical
Ornaments, he demonſtrates that they are
produc'd by exact obſervation of the Rules
which he has preſcrib'd.</p>
            <p>Theſe Four Books of the <hi>Art of Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi>
are followed by a Diſcourſe in which
the Author gives us an Idea of the <hi>Art of
Perſwaſion.</hi> At the Entrance of his
<pb facs="tcp:50222:5"/>
Diſcourſe, he gives Reaſons why he has
ſeparated that <hi>Art</hi> from the <hi>Art of Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi>
which Reaſons are not neceſſary to
be inſerted in this place. Though his
Diſcourſe be ſhort, I am of opinion it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
a better Deſcription of the <hi>Art of
Perſwaſion,</hi> than great Volumes which
others have compos'd of that Subject. And
therefore our Author diſplaying the true
Fundamentals of the <hi>Arts of Speaking,</hi>
and <hi>Perſwading,</hi> (both which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in our Idea of Rhetorick) I do
not deſpair but thoſe who ſhall ſeriouſly
peruſe this Book, will receive ſuch benefit,
as is not to be found in the Writings of
the ancient Rhetoricians, who preſent us
only with Rules, without any Character
or Deſcription of their Principles.</p>
            <p>Though this new Rhetorick ſhould give
us nothing but ſpeculative Notions, that
contribute little to the making us. Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
yet the reading of it would not be
altogether uſeleſs, becauſe in his Diſcourſe
of the Nature of this Art, he makes
ſeveral important reflexions upon our Mind,
(whereof Diſcourſe is the Image) which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
conduce highly to the knowledge of
our ſelves, and by conſequence deſerve our
attention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50222:6"/>
Beſides this, I perſwade my ſelf, there
is no perſon of any moderate curioſity, but
will be glad to underſtand Reaſons for all
Rules preſcrib'd by the <hi>Art of Speaking.</hi>
When our Author tells us what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in Diſcourſe, he does not call it <hi>je ne
ſcay quoy</hi> without a Name; he names
it, and conducting us to the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from whence our Pleaſure ſprings, he
preſents to our view the Principles of thoſe
Rules that make them agreeable; which
muſt needs be more ſatisfactory, than the
Works of thoſe who pleaſe only by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the ſaid Rules: For the Pleaſures
of the Mind, are to be preferr'd before
the Pleaſures of the Senſe. It would be
abſurd and irregular (ſays St. <hi>Auſtin)</hi>
to prefer Pleaſure cauſed by the running
of a Verſe, before the Knowledge how to
compoſe them. <hi>Nonnulli perversè, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis
amant verſum, quàm artem ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam
qua conficitur verſus; quia plus
auribus quam intelligentiae ſeſe dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi>
Some are ſo idle as to fancy a
Verſe, more than the Art of compoſing
them, becauſe they are more devoted to
their Ear, than their Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50222:6"/>
But this Treatiſe will be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
uſeful to young Men, by reaſon our
Author treats of every thing in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Order; and conducts the Reader to
the underſtanding of what he teaches by
ſuch eaſie Reaſons, as are not deſcrib'd ſo
accurately and plainly in moſt other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
It has been a daily complaint, that
ſufficient care has not been taken to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and fortifie the Judgments of young
People, who have been hitherto taught
like young Parrots, only by words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regarding the improvement of their
Judgments by accuſtoming them to argue
and reaſon upon the ſmall things that they
are taught. Hence it is, that Sciences many
times do but trouble the Mind, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the Natural Judgment that is often
conſpicuous in ſome perſons who ſtudy but
little.</p>
            <p>Our Author thought not fit to ſwell up
his Book with multitude of Examples,
though perhaps they might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;
for there is no Maſter but may
ſupply this defect, by cauſing his Scholars
to mark ſuch places as are excellent in the
Works of ſuch as have tranſcended in the
Practice of this Art.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50222:7"/>
This Treatiſe is not intended for the
Orator alone, but in general for all that
either ſpeak or write; for Poets, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Philoſophers, Divines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
though it was compos'd in <hi>French,</hi> it may
ſerve for all Languages, becauſe it inquires
into the Fundamentals of Speech, and the
Rules preſcrib'd in it, are not peculiar to
any one Language.</p>

Speech is form'd.</head>
                  <p>WE may ſpeak with our
Eyes, and our Fingers,
and make uſe of the
motions of thoſe parts
to expreſs the Idea's which are preſent
to our Minds, and the Affections of our
Wills: But this way of Speaking is not
only imperfect, but troubleſom. We
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50222:9"/>
cannot without much labour expreſs by
our Eyes, or our Fingers, all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of things which occur to our
thought: We move our Tongue with
eaſe, and can readily diverſifie the ſound
of our Voice in different manners. For
this reaſon Nature has diſpoſed Man
to make uſe of the Organs of the Voice
to give ſenſible ſigns of what he wills
and conceives.</p>
                  <p>The diſpoſition of theſe Organs is
wonderful. We have a natural Organ,
of which the <hi>aſpera arteria</hi> or Wind-pipe
(proceeding from the Lungs to the
root of our Tongue) is the paſſage or
Canal. The Lungs are like Bellows,
drawing in the Air by their dilatation,
and expelling it by their contraction.
The part of the <hi>aſpera arteria</hi> next the
root of the Tongue is called the <hi>Larynx,</hi>
and is incompaſs'd with Cartilages and
Muſcles, by which it opens and ſhuts.
When the orifice of the <hi>Larynx</hi> is
ſtraight, the Air being violently forc'd
out, is daſh'd and broken, and receives
a motion which makes the ſound of the
Voice; but which is not yet articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
This Voice is received in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50222:9"/>
Mouth, where the Tongue modifies it,
and gives it different forms, according
to its propulſion againſt the Teeth or
the Palate; according as it is detain'd
or tranſmitted; or according as the
Mouth is more or leſs open.</p>
                  <p>This facility of expreſſing our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
by the Voice, has cauſed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to apply themſelves ſtudiouſly to
the conſideration of all the differences
which it receives from the ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Organs of Pronunciation;
and they have diſtinguiſhed every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
modification by a Letter: Theſe
Letters are the Elements of Speech, and
though their number be not great, yet
they are ſufficient for all the Words not
only of the preſent, but of all the paſt,
and future Languages in the World.
The conjunction of two or more Letters
makes a Syllable; one or more Syllables
makes a Word; ſo that we may ſay,
Speech is a compoſition of Sounds of
the Voice, by Men eſtabliſhed to be the
ſigns of their Thoughts, and having
the power to awaken the Idea's to
which they have annexed them. Their
Number is but 24, yet are they capable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50222:10"/>
of compoſing a prodigious multitude
of different Words. I have ſhown elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
that 24 ſeveral Letters may be
ſo variouſly tranſpoſed, as to make 576
ſeveral Words of two Letters. That
24 times as many Words may be form'd
of three ſeveral Letters, that is to ſay,
13824 Words. That 24 times as many
more may be made of four ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and ſo on proportionably: From
whence we may judge of the vaſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Words that might be made of
them all, and indeed they are little leſs
than infinite.</p>
                  <p>And here it is of importance to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the diſtinction betwixt the <hi>ſoul</hi> of
Words and the <hi>body;</hi> betwixt that in
them which is corporeal, and that in
them which is ſpiritual; betwixt that
which is common to us with Birds,
and that which is peculiar to our ſelves.
The Idea's preſent to our Mind (when
it commands the Organs of the Voice
to form ſuch Sounds as are the ſigns of
thoſe Idea's) are the Soul of our Words:
The Sounds form'd by the Organs of
our Voice (which, though of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
they have nothing reſembling
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50222:10"/>
thoſe Idea's, do notwithſtanding repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them) are the material part, and
may be called the Body of our Words.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Before we ſpeak, we ought to form a
Scheme in our Minds of what we
deſire to ſay.</head>
                  <p>A Painter will not lay on his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
'till he has formed in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
what he deſigns to draw.
Diſcourſe is the Picture of our thoughts;
the Tongue is the Pencil which draws
that Picture; and Words are the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
We ought therefore in the firſt
place to range our Thoughts, and put
ſuch things as we intend to repreſent
by our Words into natural order;
diſpoſing them ſo, that the knowledge
of ſome few of them, may render the
reſt more eaſie and intelligible to the
Reader.</p>
                  <p>The Natural Order to be obſerved
in the ranging of our thoughts, belongs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50222:11"/>
properly to thoſe that write of the Art
of Thinking. Every Art has its bounds,
which are not to be tranſgreſs'd. For
ſuch things as reiate to the Matter of
our Diſcourſe, my following Rules will
not be (I ſuppoſe) unworthy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
The firſt is, That we me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
upon our Subject, and make all
reflexion neceſſary for the diſcovery of
ſuch means as may direct us to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
end. We muſt forget nothing
that may make that Subject perſpicuous.
But it many times happens, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to clear and explain a thing,
we overcharge the attention of the
Reader, and render it more abſtruſe, by
our prolix explications. Abundance is
ſometimes the cauſe of ſterility: The
Husbandman fears the rankneſs of his
Corn, and feeds his Sheep with it to
prevent it. We cannot comprehend
any Argument or Science, unleſs our
meditation ſupply us with things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and retrench what is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;
which pains an Author is to
ſpare to ſuch perſons as he undertakes to
inſtruct. A Man that writes by halves,
gives an imperfect account; but a great
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50222:11"/>
book is a great evil; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
We wander in it, we loſe our
ſelves, and have ſcarce patience to turn
it over. When therefore we have made
an exact collection of all things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the matter of which we treat,
we muſt contract them, reduce them
to their juſt bounds, and making a
ſtrict choice and ſelection of what are
abſolutely neceſſary, reject the reſt as
ſuperfluous. We are to be continually
intent upon the end to which we would
arrive; we are to take the ſhorteſt cut
to it, and avoid all manner of devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Unleſs we ſlightly run over
things of ſmall importance, not at all
eſſential to our deſign, our Reader will
be weary, and his application diverted
from ſuch as are.</p>
                  <p>This Brevity, ſo neceſſary to make a
Book neat and compact, conſiſts not
only in the retrenchment of what is
unneceſſary, but requires that we inſert
ſuch circumſtances as may illuſtrate our
diſcourſe, and imply many things that
are not expreſſed. For this, we are to
imitate the addreſs of <hi>Timanthes,</hi> the
famous Painter, who being to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50222:12"/>
the prodigious ſtature of a Giant
in a ſmall picture, painted him lying
along in the midſt of a Troop of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
one of which was meaſuring the
Giants Thumb with his Thyrſe; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
by that ingenious invention,
how vaſt his Body muſt needs be, when
ſo ſmall a part of him was to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
with a Launce. Theſe Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

felicity in compriſing much in few

extravagant length of one of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
by ſaying, he had not time to
make it ſhorter.</p>

it would not be long before they would

                  <p>We cannot diſcover what form they

conſidering what we our ſelves ſhould
do in the ſame company. Diverſity of

Words then, being neceſſary, only in
reſpect of the different things which
paſs in our Mind, and we are inclin'd
to impart; we muſt obſerve exactly all
that ſo paſſes, that we may be enabled
thereby to find out what we are to do
to paint the different Features of our
Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>When our Organs of Senſe are free,
and undiſturbed, we perceive what it
is that ſtrikes them, and at the ſame
time we have the Idea's of ſuch things

theſe Idea's are not improperly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Objects of our Perceptions.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe Idea's which reſult from our

inherent in our Natures, and not falling

which repreſent to us Natural and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Truths, ſuch as theſe, <hi>That we
are to give every man his due; That it is
impoſſible for a thing to be and not to be at

                  <p>Doubtleſs if theſe new Men would
make it their buſineſs to find out Words
that might be ſigns of all theſe Idea's
which are the Objects of our perception
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50222:13"/>
(which, according to the Philoſophers,
is the firſt operation of the Mind) in
the infinite variety of Words, it would
not be difficult to find particular ſigns
to mark every Idea, and give it a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Name. In as much as we natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
make uſe of theſe primitive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we may believe, that if other
things ſhould preſent themſelves to their
Minds, bearing any reſemblance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to thoſe things which they had
denominated before, they would not take
the pains to invent new words, but (with
ſome little variation) make uſe of the
firſt Names to denote the difference of
the things to which they would apply
them. Experience perſwades me, that
where a proper Word does not occur
immediately to our Tongue, we ſhould
make uſe of the Name of ſome other
thing bearing ſome kind of reſemblance
to it. In all Languages, the Names of
things almoſt alike have very little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference:
From one ſingle Word many
other are derived, as is obvious in the
Dictionaries of ſuch Languages as we
know.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Word may be diverſified

ſeveral ways; by tranſpoſition, retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
addition of Vowels or Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
or by changing the Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So that it is no hard matter,
when we give the proper Name of a
particular thing, to ſeveral others that
are like it, to ſignifie by ſome little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation,
what ſuch things have in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar;
and in what they differ from the

                  <p>SUch Words as ſignifie the Object of
our Thoughts, (that is to ſay, Things)
are called Nouns. We conſider in every
thing, its being, and its manner of
being: The being of a thing, as for
example, the being of Wax, is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Wax. The roundneſs or
ſquareneſs of the figure (which may
be changed without prejudice to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50222:14"/>
Wax) are its manners of being. To
be ignorant, or knowing, are man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of our being. It is neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that among the Names of things,
ſome ſhould be appointed to ſignifie the
ſubſtance, and ſome the manner of their
being. Thoſe which deſcribe the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
being of a thing, are called Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantives.
Thoſe which deſcribe the
manner only, are called Adjectives,
becauſe having no natural ſubſiſtence
of their own, they ſubſiſt by nothing
but the Noun Subſtantive to which they
are joyned. In theſe two Words, <hi>Round
Earth,</hi> the laſt is the Subſtantive, and
the firſt ſignifies nothing but its manner
of being. Nouns Subſtantives do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Adjectives, or rather things of
abſolute exiſtence; and ſubſtances are
expreſſed by Nouns Adjectives, when
being applied to other things, they are
uſed to ſignifie their manner of being,
as in theſe Adjectives, <hi>Silvered, Tinned,
Leaded,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Nouns do commonly ſignifie things
in a general and unlimited way: Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
in Languages where they are
uſed, (as in <hi>Greek, Latin, French,</hi> &amp;c.)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50222:15"/>
do ſerve to reſtrain and determin the
ſignification of Nouns, and apply them
to a particular thing. If we ſay 'tis a
happineſs to be <hi>King,</hi> the expreſſion is
vagous, but if you add <hi>the</hi> to it, and
ſay it is a happineſs to be <hi>the King,</hi> it
determins the buſineſs, and cannot be
underſtood but of the King of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
People mentioned before. So
that Articles do contribute very much
to the clearneſs of Diſcourſe, and 'tis
not impoſſible but theſe new Men, in
the compoſure of their Language, would
make uſe of them; and the neceſſity of
determining the unfixed ſignification of
Words would aſſiſt to the finding them
out.</p>
                  <p>The different ways of termination;

find in all Languages that Nouns have
two ſeveral terminations. One im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
the thing mentioned to be of the
Singular Number, the other of the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
for which reaſon Nouns have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
two Numbers, the Singular and
the Plural. The word <hi>Homo,</hi> with the
termination of the Singular Number,
implies only a ſingle Perſon; but <hi>Homines,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50222:15"/>
in the termination of the Plural, implies

upon the time of their duration; upon
what they are; what they are not;
and upon their references and relations.
There is need of particular Terms to
expreſs theſe references, with the Series
and Connexion of all the Idea's that the
Conſideration of theſe things imprints
in our Minds. In ſome Languages the
different terminations of the ſame Noun
do create new differences, and ſupply
thoſe Words which are neceſſary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the reference of a thing. Theſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50222:16"/>
are commonly called <hi>Caſes,</hi> and are ſix
in each Number, both Singular and
Plural. <hi>The Nominative, the Genitive,
the Dative, the Accuſative, the Vocative,
and the Ablative.</hi> The ſame Noun (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the principal Idea of the thing
which it ſignifies) contains a particular
reference betwixt that thing and ſome
other, according as it is in the <hi>Genitive</hi> or
the <hi>Dative</hi> Caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Nominative,
ſignifies a thing ſimply and poſitively.
The Genitive, its reference with the
thing to which it relates, as <hi>Palatium
Regis.</hi> The Dative, its relation to the
thing as it tends to profit or prejudice,
as <hi>Utilis Reipublicae.</hi> The Accuſative,
its relation to a thing which acts upon
it, as <hi>Caeſar vicit Pompeium.</hi> The Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative,
is uſed when we addreſs our
diſcourſe to the perſon or thing ſignified
by the Noun. The Ablative, is uſed
in ſuch infinite caſes, that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to mark them all.</p>
                  <p>The Languages whoſe Nouns do not
admit of theſe different Caſes, do make
uſe of little words called Particles with
the ſame effect; as <hi>of, the, to, by, they,
&amp;c.</hi> Adverbs are uſed likewiſe with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50222:16"/>
little difference from the Declenſion of
Nouns, carrying with them ſometimes
the force of thoſe Particles, as this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
<hi>Wiſely</hi> imports as much as theſe
two Words together, <hi>With Wiſdom.</hi>
The different relations betwixt things,
in reſpect of their place, ſituation, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
repoſe, diſtance, oppoſition, and
compariſon, are infinite. We cannot
diſcourſe a moment, but ſomething will
ariſe to ſuggeſt them. We are not to
doubt then, but theſe men, whom we
ſuppoſe brought together from remote
parts, of no correſpondence, would
quickly find out ſome way or other to
ſignifie theſe references and relations,
either by Particles (as in the <hi>French,</hi>

<hi>Perception,</hi> by which we diſcern
the difference of things. <hi>Judgment,</hi> by
which we affirm of a thing, that it is,
or that it is not. And <hi>Ratiocination,</hi> by
which we draw conſequences to evince
the truth or fallacy of a Propoſition
conteſted, by comparing it with one
or more inconteſtable Propoſitions. If
we attend ſeriouſly to what paſſes in our
Mind, we ſhall find that we do rarely
conſider of things, without making
judgment of them. So that when theſe
new Men had furniſhed themſelves with
words to ſignifie the objects of their
Perceptions, they would doubtleſs ſeek
out for words to expreſs their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50222:17"/>
that is to ſay, <hi>the Action of the
mind, which affirms that a thing is ſo, or not ſo.</hi>
And the part in diſcourſe which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
our Judgment, is called a Propoſition,
which Propoſition does neceſſarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
two Terms, the <hi>Subject</hi> and the
<hi>Attribute:</hi> The <hi>Subject</hi> is <hi>That of which
we affirm:</hi> The <hi>Attribute</hi> is <hi>That which
is affirmed of the thing.</hi> As in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
<hi>God is juſt; God</hi> is the <hi>Subject;
Juſt</hi> is the <hi>Attribute,</hi> it being the thing
affirmed, or attributed to the <hi>Subject</hi>
of the Propoſition. Beſides theſe two,
there is in every Propoſition another
Term, which couples the <hi>Subject</hi> with
the <hi>Attribute,</hi> and ſignifies that Action
of the Mind by which we judge, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the <hi>Attribute</hi> of the <hi>Subject;</hi> and
the Terms which expreſs this Action,
are in all Languages called <hi>Verbs. Verbs,</hi>
as is obſerved by a judicious Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
are words which ſignifie affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
A ſingle word would ſuffice
to ſignifie all the like operations of our
judgment, as the Verb <hi>Eſſe,</hi> which is
the natural and ordinary ſign of affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
But if we judge of theſe new
Men, by thoſe who have lived in all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50222:18"/>
former Ages, the deſire of contracting
their diſcourſe, would prompt them to
make one word ſignifie both the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and attribute, according to the
practice in many Languages, where
infinite numbers of words doth denote
both the affirmation and the thing affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
For example, <hi>I read</hi> imports an
affirmation, and the action which I
perform when I read, at the ſame time.
Theſe words, as is ſaid before, are
called <hi>Verbs.</hi> And when, in ſome Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
they take from them the power
of ſignifying affirmation, they dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
into the nature of Nouns, and
are uſed accordingly, as when in <hi>French</hi>
we ſay, <hi>le boire, le manger.</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50222:18"/>
and we in the mean time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to ſpeak often of the ſame thing;
to rectifie that inconvenience, in all
Languages that are know to us, there
are certain words eſtabliſhed which are
called Pronouns, and their number is
three: The firſt implies the perſon ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
as <hi>I;</hi> the ſecond, the perſon to
whom we ſpeak, as <hi>You;</hi> the third, the
perſon or thing of which we ſpeak, as
<hi>He, That.</hi> Theſe Pronouns have two
Numbers, as the Nouns. The Pronoun
of the firſt Perſon, in the plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
implies the perſons ſpeaking, as
<hi>We;</hi> the Pronoun of the ſecond Perſon,
in the plural Number, implies the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to whom we ſpeak, as <hi>Ye;</hi> and
the Pronoun of the third Perſon, in the

things of which we ſpeak, as <hi>They,
Thoſe.</hi>

                  <p>Again, to avoid the inconvenient repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of theſe Pronouns, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> otherwiſe
would often occur; in the ancient Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
they added certain Terminations
to their <hi>Verbs,</hi> which ſupplied the place
of theſe Pronouns, by which means a
ſingle <hi>Verb</hi> became ſufficient to make
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50222:19"/>
an entire Propoſition; ſo this Verb
<hi>Verbero,</hi> comprehends the ſenſe of this
whole Propoſition, <hi>Ego ſum verberans:</hi>
And beſides that this Verb intimates
the affirmation, and the thing affirm'd,
it ſignifies alſo the perſon beating, who
is the perſon that ſpeaks of himſelf;
and the reaſon is, becauſe the Verb has
a Termination that ſupplies the place
of the Pronoun of the firſt Perſon.</p>

                  <p>VVHat is affirmed of the Subject
of a Propoſition, is either
paſt, preſent, or to come. The
different inflexions of Verbs, have
power to denote the circumſtance of
time belonging to the thing affirmed.
The circumſtances of time are very
numerous: We may conſider the time
paſt with reference to the preſent, as
when I ſay, <hi>I was reading when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into my Chamber.</hi> The act of my
reading is paſt, in regard of the time
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50222:19"/>
in which I ſpeak; but I ſignifie the time
preſent, in regard of the thing of
which I ſpeak, which is the entrance
of ſuch a man. We may alſo conſider
the time paſt, with reference to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time paſt, as <hi>I had ſupp'd when he
came in.</hi> Both which actions are paſt,
in reſpect of one another. We may
conſider the time paſt two ways, as
definite, or indefinite: We may ſpeak
preciſely, when an action was done; or
we may only ſay, it was done. We
conſider the Future Tenſe in the ſame
manner, uſing ſometimes a preciſe and
definite term, and ſometimes an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
without any limitation.</p>
                  <p>In this new Language that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
we cannot tell whether all the
different circumſtances of times would
be expreſs'd by ſo many different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions,
becauſe we do not find the
people have diſtinguiſhed with the ſame
exactneſs all the circumſtances of time.
The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verbs have only two Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the Preter Tenſe, and the Future
Tenſe: They have but two inflexions
to expreſs the diverſity of times. They
make uſe of the inflexion of the Future
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50222:20"/>
Tenſe, to ſignifie the Preſent Tenſe.
The <hi>Greeks</hi> are more exact, their Verbs
have all the Tenſes aforeſaid. Yet I
doubt not, but the Terms of this new
Language would bear at leaſt the ſigns
of ſome of theſe circumſtances, ſeeing
in every Propoſition the time of the
Attribute is to be determined; and the
deſire to abbreviate our diſcourſe, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to all men. When I ſay, <hi>I ſhall
love,</hi> the inflexion of the Future Tenſe
that I give to that Verb, eaſes me of
the trouble of this long Phraſe, <hi>It will
happen ſome time or other that I ſhall be
in love.</hi> When I ſay, <hi>I have loved,</hi> the
inflexion of the Preterperfect Tenſe
ſaves me ſeveral of theſe Words, <hi>There
was formerly a time when I was in love.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">By Verbs may be ſignified the divers
manners of affirming, and certain
circumſtances of the action which
they imply.</head>
                  <p>VErbs have their Moods, that is to
ſay, they ſignifie, beſides the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of time, the manner of
the affirmation. The firſt is the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative</hi>
Mood, which demonſtrates ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
what we affirm. The ſecond is the
<hi>Imperative,</hi> and implies a command to
ſuch a one to do ſuch a thing. The
third is the <hi>Optative,</hi> a Mood of great
uſe among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and intimating
an ardent deſire that ſuch a thing may
happen. The fourth is the <hi>Subjunctive,</hi>
ſo called, becauſe it has always ſome
condition annexed to what we affirm,
as <hi>I ſhould love him, if he did love me.</hi>
If that condition were not inſerted after
the Subjunctive, the ſenſe would be
doubtful. The fifth Mood is the <hi>Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50222:21"/>
a Verb in this Mood has a large
and undetermined ſignification, as <hi>To
drink, to eat, to be beloved, to be beaten,
&amp;c.</hi> We ſhall ſee hereafter that <hi>Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Verbs are uſed principally for the
coupling and connexion of two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.
A <hi>Participle</hi> may be ſaid to be
a ſixth Mood. A <hi>Verb</hi> in its <hi>Participle</hi>
ſignifies only the thing affirmed, and
not the affirmation; and therefore they
are called <hi>Participles,</hi> becauſe they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
both of the Verb and of the
Noun, ſignifying the thing affirmed
by the Verb, without any affirmation.
The Participle <hi>Beaten</hi> imports as much
as the Verb <hi>To beat,</hi> yet he who ſays
<hi>Beaten,</hi> affirms nothing, unleſs it be
added or underſtood <hi>He is,</hi> or <hi>He has been
beaten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Verbs (except <hi>Sum, Es, Eſt, Eſſe)</hi>
do comprehend two Idea's, the Idea of
affirmation, and the Idea of ſome action
affirmed. An action has commonly
two terms, the firſt <hi>à quo,</hi> the ſecond
<hi>ad quem.</hi> In an action we conſider the
Author that acts, and the Perſon upon
whom: The firſt is called the <hi>Agent,</hi>
the ſecond the <hi>Patient.</hi> It is neceſſary
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50222:21"/>
to determin the Term of the action of
which we ſpeak, whether it be the
Subject of the Propoſition, of which
we affirm the action, that is either
Agent or Patient; and therefore in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Languages, the Verbs have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
two Terminations, and different
inflexions, which diſcover whether the
Verb be taken actively or paſſively: As
<hi>Petrus amat,</hi> &amp; <hi>Petrus amatur; Peter
loves,</hi> and <hi>Peter is beloved.</hi> In the firſt
Propoſition, the Verb being active, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
that it is <hi>Peter</hi> that loves; in the
ſecond Propoſition, the ſame Verb,
with a paſſive inflexion, implies that
<hi>Peter</hi> is the Object of that love.</p>
                  <p>It is not impoſſible then, but the
Verbs of this new Language would
have two inflexions, one active,
the other paſſive. 'Tis poſſible they
would not comprehend in one ſingle
Verb all the various circumſtances of
an action; as whether it was done with
diligence, whether performed by the
Author himſelf, or whether by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument;
which among the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
was ſignified by the various inflexions
of their Verbs. There are a hundred
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50222:22"/>
ſeveral ways of a Man's expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that are not eſſential, but peculiar
to certain Languages. I cannot ſay
whether our new Society would omit
them, and ſtick only to thoſe which
were eſſential, and without which they
could not explain themſelves. But my
deſign being only to diſplay the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Rules of the Art of Speaking,
I hold my ſelf obliged to enlarge only
upon the laſt.</p>

                  <p>VVE have ſeen how the two firſt
Operations of the Mind are to
be expreſſed, that is to ſay, our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi>
and <hi>Judgment.</hi> We come now
to the third, which is our Reaſoning
or Argumentation. We argue, when
from one or two clear and evident Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
we conclude the truth or
falſity of a third Propoſition that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
and diſputable. As if to prove
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50222:22"/>
the innocence of <hi>Milo</hi> we ſhould ſay
thus: <hi>It is lawful to repel force by force,</hi>
Milo, <hi>in killing</hi> Clodius, <hi>did only repel
force by force;</hi> Ergo, Milo <hi>did lawfully
kill</hi> Clodius. Reaſoning is but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
of the ſecond Operation, and a
chaining of two or more Propoſitions.
It is evident we have need only of ſome
ſhort words to make this connexion,
as theſe Particles, <hi>then, at length, for,
for aſmuch, ſeeing that,</hi> &amp;c. Some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
will have a fourth Operation
of the Mind, and they call it <hi>Method,</hi>
by which they range and diſpoſe their
Arguments into order. This diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and order may be expreſſed by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Particles.</p>
                  <p>The other Actions of our Mind, by
which we diſtinguiſh, divide, compare,
connect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are reducible to one of
theſe four Operations, and are expreſſed
by certain Particles, which receive dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
denominations, according to the
difference of their office. Thoſe whoſe
office it is to unite, are called <hi>Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi>
as <hi>Et.</hi> Thoſe which divide, are
called <hi>Negatives,</hi> or <hi>Adverſatives,</hi> as

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50222:23"/>
                     <hi>If,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Particles do not ſignifie
the Objects of our Thoughts, but ſome
particular Action of the Mind, as we
have ſaid before. Diſcourſe is but a
connexion or continuation of ſeveral
Propoſitions; and therefore Men have
ſought out ways of ſignifying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion

                  <p>HAving found all the Terms of a
Language, the next thing to be
conſider'd is the array or diſpoſition of
thoſe Terms. If the words which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
a Propoſition, do not carry
marks and tokens to ſignifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
which they ought to have; and
if we perceive not their ſcope, the
diſcourſe produces no reaſonable ſenſe
in the Mind of the Auditor. Among
the Nouns, as we have ſaid before, ſome
ſignifie the things, and others the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of thoſe things. The firſt are called
<hi>Subſtantives,</hi> the ſecond are called <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectives.</hi>
In like manner, as the Modes
of Being, appertain to the Being it ſelf,
the Adjectives ought to depend upon
the Subſtantives, and carry the marks
of their dependance. In a Propoſition,
the Term that is the Attribute of it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50222:24"/>
refers to the Subject of it, and that
reference ought to be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>The Nouns of all known Languages
are diſtinguiſhed by different Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in two Genders: The firſt is
called the <hi>Maſculine,</hi> the ſecond the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine.</hi>
The inconſtancy of cuſtom is
very ſtrange in this diſtribution, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Gender has been determined
by the Sex, and the Names of Men,
and every thing belonging to them,
were of the Maſculine Gender. The
Names of Women, and all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to them, were of the Feminine,
with regard only to the ſignification:
And another time, without conſidering
either the ſignification or termination,
it has given to Nouns what Gender it
pleaſed. Nouns Adjectives, and other
words, which ſignifie rather the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of things, than the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
have uſually two terminations;
one Maſculine, the other Feminine:
The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verbs are capable of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Genders, as well as their Nouns.</p>
                  <p>The difference of Genders ſerves to
denote the connexion of the members
of Diſcourſe, and their dependance one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50222:24"/>
upon another. Adjectives have always
the ſame Gender with their Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
that is to ſay, if the Noun Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive
be Maſculine, the Adjective has
a Maſculine Termination; and it is that
Termination that ſhows to which it
belongs. When a Thing is multiplied,
its manners of being are multiplied
alſo; and therefore the Adjectives are
likewiſe to follow the Number of their
Subſtantives, whether Singular or Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
Verbs have two Numbers like
the Nouns: In the Singular, they imply
that the Subject of the Propoſition is
ſingle: In the Plural, they imply a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
in the Subject: And therefore
Verbs are to be put in the ſame Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
with the Noun that is the Subject
of the Propoſition, whether it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
or underſtood.</p>
                  <p>Men are ſometimes ſo intent upon
things, that they do not reflect upon
their Names, nor regard what is their
Gender, or what is their Number:
They regulate their diſcourſe by the
things: They place the Verb in the
Plural, though it agree with a Noun
of the Singular Number, becauſe they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50222:25"/>
look upon the Noun collectively, and
importing an Idea of Plurality; as in
<hi>Virgil, Pars Merſi tenuere ratem,</hi> for
<hi>Pars Merſa tenuit ratem;</hi> becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect to the word <hi>Pars,</hi> which is
of the Feminine Gender and Singular
Number, he ſpeaks of Men, which are
the Maſculine and Plural Number. So
in <hi>French</hi> at Six of the clock we ſay, <hi>Il
eſt ſix heures,</hi> conſidering the ſix hours
as a determined point of time. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we omit, or neglect a word, that
thoſe to whom we ſpeak may ſupply it,
as in <hi>Latin</hi> where it is ſaid <hi>Triſte Lupus
ſtabulis,</hi> the word <hi>negotium</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>Figures, are extraordinary ways of
ſpeaking. There are Figures of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
and Figures of Grammar: Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical
Figures expreſs the commotions
and violent agitations of the Mind, in
our paſſions; or form an agreeable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Figures Grammatical are uſed
in conſtruction when we digreſs from
ordinary Rules, as in this manner of
expreſſion we now mention, which by
the Grammarians is called <hi>Syllepſis,</hi> or
<hi>Conceptio,</hi> becauſe in that, we conceive
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50222:25"/>
the ſenſe otherwiſe than is imported by
the words, and ſo the conſtruction is
made accordingly. Sometimes we may
make uſe of different expreſſions which
give the ſame <hi>Idea,</hi> ſo that 'tis indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
which of them we uſe, as <hi>Dare
claſſibus auſtros,</hi> or <hi>Dare claſſes auſtris:</hi>
And when of theſe two ways of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
we make choice of that which
is leaſt uſed, we call it <hi>Hypallage,</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation.</hi>

                  <p>VVHen all the Images that are

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50222:26"/>
therefore, it is neceſſary that every one
of thoſe Idea's which we deſire to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
have ſome ſign or other to

muſt obſerve likewiſe, that there are
words which have the power of ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeveral things, and are able, beſides
their principal Idea's, to awaken many
others.</p>
                  <p>Nouns, in Languages that admit of
different Caſes, do ſignifie at the ſame
time both the things and their referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as is ſaid before. Verbs have a
power of ſignifying a whole Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
the Subject, Attribute, and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula.</hi>
When all our Idea's are expreſſed
with their connexion, 'tis not poſſible
to underſtand all that we think, unleſs
we give our thoughts ſuch ſigns as are
neceſſary: For which reaſon, they ſpeak
moſt clearly and intelligibly, who ſpeak
moſt ſimply, and moſt according to the
natural order and impreſſions upon their
Mind.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that Diſcourſe is tedious,
where we give to every thing that we
deſire to ſignifie, particular terms; 'tis
tyreſome to the hearer, if he has but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50222:26"/>
capacity. Beſides, our ardour
and impatience to communicate our
thoughts, will not endure ſo great a
number of words: When it is poſſible,
we chuſe rather to explain our ſelves
by a ſingle word, and do therefore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
ſuch terms as may excite ſeveral
Idea's, and by conſequence ſupply the
place of words; and we retrench ſuch,
as being omitted, cannot produce ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.
The Rule to be obſerved, is,
to have a particular regard to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the perſon to whom we ſpeak;
if his parts be but indifferent, we muſt
ſpeak every thing expreſly, and leave
nothing to his divination.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ellipſis</hi> or retrenchment of ſome
part of our Diſcourſe, is a Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Figure, as in this <hi>Latin</hi> Expreſſion,
<hi>Paucis te volo,</hi> in which theſe words,
<hi>verbis alloqui,</hi> are left out. This Figure
is very common in the Oriental Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages:
The People of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
being hot, and quick, their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and vehemence will not permit
them to ſpeak any thing <hi>in terminis</hi> that
may be as well underſtood. The <hi>French</hi>
Language uſes not this kind of Figure
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50222:27"/>
ſo frequently, nor indeed any other of
the Grammatical Figures: It affects
clearneſs and perſpicuity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as near as poſſible, expreſſes every
thing in the ſimpleſt and moſt natural
order.</p>
                  <p>When we ſpeak, we ought particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to conſider the principal things,
and make choice for them of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
as may make deepeſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the Mind of the Hearer, either
by the multitude of Idea's they contain,
or otherwiſe. A Painter draws the
principal Lines of his Picture groſs,
and then heightens it with his colours;
in the mean time ſweetning and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his other ſtrokes, that their ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and obſcurity may ſet off the luſtre
of the other. Trifling things, that
are not eſſential to Diſcourſe, ſhould be
mentioned by the By: 'Twould ſhow
great defect of judgment to dilate upon
them; it would divert the Reader, and
take off his Mind from that which is
more material. There are two ways
(and thoſe very different) of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in our choice of Expreſſions: The
one is, when we are too diffuſe and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50222:27"/>
prodigal; the other, when we are too
ſparing and dry. The laſt repreſents only
the carkaſs of things; and are like the
firſt Touches in a Picture, by which the
Painter marks only the places where
he deſigns the Eyes, Mouth, Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The firſt by its ſecundity and redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
perplexes as much on the other
ſide. A juſt temperament is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
therefore. When the Painter
has perfected his neceſſary ſtrokes, all
that he adds afterwards does but ſpoil
what he did before. Words that are
ſuperfluous, do but render the neceſſary
more obſcure, and hinder their impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
they tyre the Ear, and never reach
the Memory.</p>
                  <q>Omne ſupervacuum pleno de pectore manat.</q>
                  <p>Politeneſs conſiſts partly in a ſtrict
retrenchment of unneceſſary words,
which are as it were the Excrements
of Diſcourſe: A thing is poliſh'd, when
the little rugged particles are taken
away with the File, and the ſurface
made ſmooth and even. This repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of words, which ſerves only to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50222:28"/>
lengthen out diſcourſe, and tyre the
Reader, is called by the Grammarians
<hi>Tautology.</hi> When diſcourſe is fill'd up
with unneceſſary and ſuperfluous words,
it is called <hi>Periſſology.</hi> Nevertheleſs we
are not obliged to ſuch frugality, that
we ſhould be affraid to add one word
more than is neceſſary, as when in <hi>Latin</hi>
we ſay <hi>vivere vitam, auribus audire:</hi>
This is an Elegancy ſometimes, and

in the thing.</p>

                  <p>AS to the ordering of Words, and
the Rules to be obſerved in ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a Diſcourſe, Natural Light di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
us ſo clearly, that no Man can
be ignorant. We cannot conceive the
ſenſe of a diſcourſe, if we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the matter of it firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:50222:28"/>
Natural order requires therefore, that
in every Propoſition the Noun that
ſignifies the Subject of it, be placed firſt:
If it be accompanied with an Adjective,
that the Adjective be put after it:
That the Attribute be placed after the
Verb that couples the Subject with the
Attribute: That the Particles which
denote the reference betwixt one thing
and another be inſerted betwixt them:
That the Words which make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
may be found betwixt the two
Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>And this, as near as we can, is the
Natural Order to be commonly obſerv'd
in Diſcourſe. I ſay commonly, becauſe
in ſome caſes we may tranſgreſs with
advantage; and this tranſgreſſion is an
ornament among the Grammarians, and
a Figure called <hi>Hyperbaton:</hi> Of which
ſort <hi>Virgil</hi> has one in theſe Verſes:
<q>
                        <l>Furit immiſſis Vulcanus habenis</l>
                        <l>Tranſtra per &amp; Remos.</l>
                     </q>
The Prepoſition <hi>per</hi> being out of its
natural place.</p>
                  <p>When we reject a word to the end
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50222:29"/>
of a Propoſition, without which word
the ſenſe of the Propoſition is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
the interruption which the Reader
receives, makes him more attentive;
his deſire of underſtanding it grows
more vehement and ardent, and his
impatience makes his conception the
clearer. Beſides, this little tranſgreſſion
does many times make the Propoſition
ſtrong and intellible; for the Reader,
to underſtand the ſenſe of it, being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to meditate and conſider all the
parts together, that conſideration im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
him the more. For this reaſon
no doubt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> did
frequently put the Verb at the end of
the Propoſition, and having the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of cuſtom, it is not altogether
to be blamed: But he who intends to
write clearly and ſimply, muſt obſerve
Natural Order as much as in him lies:
I ſay as much as in him lies, becauſe
ſometimes we are obliged to tranſgreſs,
to avoid the concurrence of certain
rough words that will not admit of
conjunction.</p>
                  <p>This array and diſpoſition of words, is
well worth our ſerious application: And
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50222:29"/>
we may affirm, that it is by this Art
of well placing their words, that thoſe
excellent Orators have diſtinguiſhed
themſelves from the multitude. For
words being not made by the Orator,
but natural to every body, 'tis only
the faculty of ranging them well, and
inducing them properly, that belongs
to them, and pronounces them Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Dixeris egregiè, notum ſi callida verbum</l>
                     <l>Reddiderit junctura novum—</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>I ſpeak not here of that diſpoſition
of words, which renders a Diſcourſe
harmonious, but of that which renders
it clear. Clearneſs without doubt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
much upon Natural Order; and
whatever interrupts that Order, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexes
our Diſcourſe. But there are
many Errours oppoſed to this Natural
Order, and by conſequence to that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that ought to be obſerved. The
firſt is the <hi>Hyperbaton,</hi> or too bold and
frequent tranſpoſition of words. Our
Language is ſo great a Lover of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that it admits none of thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50222:30"/>
It would not be Elegant to
ſay, <hi>There is no man, who more than he,
may juſtly promiſe himſelf glory:</hi> We are
rather to ſay, <hi>There is no man, who more
juſtly than he, may promiſe himſelf glory.</hi>
A ſecond Vice conſiſts in the multitude
and huddle of words, when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
our thoughts by long and tedious
circumlocutions, or inſert words that
are altogether unneceſſary, as thus:
<hi>In this, many people do continually and
wonderfully abuſe their leiſure:</hi> This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is confuſed, and it would be
much better to cut off what is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
reducing it to theſe terms: <hi>In
this, many abuſe their leiſure.</hi> Another
defect is, when we do not exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Rules of <hi>Syntax</hi> or Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Other terms there are, whoſe
ſignification being vagous and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
cannot be determined but by their
relation to ſome other term. When
we make uſe of ſuch terms, and do not
ſignifie their reference, we make our
Propoſitions doubtful and equivocal.
As if I ſhould ſay, <hi>He always loved ſuch
a perſon in his affliction;</hi> it would be
equivocal, becauſe the Reader would
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50222:30"/>
not be able to determin to whom the
Pronoun <hi>his</hi> related, whether to the
perſon who loved, or the perſon in
affliction; which fault would be very
conſiderable. There is another thing
alſo, that is a great enemy to clearneſs,
and that is, when our Expreſſions ſeem
to look one way, and are intended ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as in this Anſwer of the Oracle:
<q>Aiote, Aeacida, Romanos vincere poſſe.</q>
                     <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeacus,</hi> to whom
this Anſwer was addreſſed, underſtood
it thus, <hi>O Son of</hi> Aeacus, <hi>I ſay you may
overcome the</hi> Romans: Whereas it was
meant, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him. This defect is called by the
<hi>Greeks, Amphibologia.</hi> Beſides theſe,
long <hi>Parentheſes,</hi> and too frequent, are
neither decent nor convenient, as may
be obſerved too often in ſeveral Authors.</p>

                  <head type="sub">How we may expreſs the Paſsions and
Motions of our Mind.</head>
                  <p>ALL that paſſes in our Minds, is
either action or paſſion. We have
ſeen already which way we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
our actions: Let us now ſee what
Nature dictates to ſignifie our paſſions,
that is, to ſignifie the eſteem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
love, or hatred we bear to
things, which ſhould be the objects of
our thoughts and our affections. Our
Diſcourſe is imperfect, unleſs it carry
with it the marks of the Motions of
our Will: It reſembles our Mind (whoſe
Image it ought to bear) no more
than a dead Carkaſs reſembles a living
Body. To reſolve therefore, what our
new Men would be obliged to do to
expreſs their paſſions, let us ſee what
we our ſelves ſhould do, had we the
ſame parts in that Comedy.</p>
                  <p>There are Names which have two
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50222:31"/>
Idea's: That which may be called the
principal Idea, repreſents the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.
The other (which may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the acceſſory) repreſents it as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
with ſuch and ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For example, the word <hi>Lyar</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a perſon reprehended for not
ſpeaking the truth; but it imports like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that the perſon reprehended is
eſteemed an ill perſon, one who has
cunningly or maliciouſly concealed the
truth, and therefore deſerves our hatred
and contempt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſecond Idea's, which we have
called acceſſories, are annexed to the
Names of things, and to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Idea's, in this manner: When cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
has obtained, that we ſpeak with
certain terms of what we eſteem, theſe
terms do inſtantly aſſume an Idea of
Grandeur: In ſo much that a perſon no
ſooner makes uſe of thoſe terms, but
we conceive he has an eſteem for thoſe
things of which he ſpeaks. When we
ſpeak in paſſion, the air of our looks,
the tone of our voice, and ſeveral other
circumſtances, are ſufficient to ſignifie
our commotion. And the very words,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50222:32"/>
of which we make uſe upon thoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
may afterwards of themſelves
renew the Idea of thoſe commotions:
As when we have often ſeen one of our
Friends in a certain habit, the ſame
ſort of habit is capable of reviving the
Idea of our Friend. All proper Names
of Natural things have their acceſſory
Idea's, but they are ſmutty and obſcene:
For looſe and debauched people ſpeaking
of theſe things in an unuſual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt
way, the foul images of their
thoughts, are annexed to the very
words; and therefore we may take up
the ſame complaint, that was long ſince
made by a wiſe Pagan, and ſay, <hi>Honeſta
nomina perdidimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, the words themſelves contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
acceſſory Idea's that repreſent the
things, and the manner in which thoſe
things are conceived, our new Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would have no trouble to invent
new words to ſignifie theſe acceſſory
Idea's. It would plainly appear, that
in their new Language there would be
terms ſufficient to expreſs the different
Motions, as the love, hatred, eſteem,
contempt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Speaker. And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50222:32"/>
moreover (as we ſhall demonſtrate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after)
our Paſſions do often deſcribe
themſelves in our Diſcourſe, and form
their own Characters without ſtudy or
Art.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen what Men are obliged
to do of neceſſity, to ſignifie their
thoughts; let us now ſee what depends
upon their choice. Having all of us
one and the ſame Nature, (be the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that we ſpeak what it will) we
follow all thoſe Rules which we have
ſhown to be Natural, and Eſſential to
the Art of Speaking. But it is yet in
our power to chuſe, among the infinite
variety of words, what we think good;
and this liberty is it that has changed
all the ancient Languages, and does
ſtill refine or impair them every day.</p>
                  <p>Diverſity of Languages is incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and a great impediment to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
and Trade. Some perſons have
anciently propoſed to make an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Language, which might be learnt
in a ſhort time, and be common to the
whole World. I conceive the great
Secret of thoſe Undertakers lay in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that Language to conſiſt of few
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50222:33"/>
words: They would have had every
thing expreſſed by one ſingle term, and
that term, with ſome little alteration,
ſhould have ſignified all other things
that had reference to it. They would
have made all their Nouns indeclinable,
denoting their different caſes by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and their three Genders by three
Terminations. They would have had
but two Conjugations, one to ſignifie
the active, and the other the paſſive:
Nor ſhould their Tenſes have had diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Terminations inſtead of Pronouns.
By which the whole Grammar of that
Language might have been quickly and
eaſily learned.</p>

to employ them only for the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification

were known before by the perſons

fixt already to the word <hi>Horſe,</hi> and the
latter to the word <hi>Dog,</hi> we cannot
tranſpoſe them, nor take the one for
the other, without an entire confuſion
to the Converſation of Mankind. It is
ridiculous fantaſticalneſs, not to follow
thoſe Modes which long Cuſtom has
eſtabliſhed: And it is little leſs than
ſtupidity, when we ſpeak, to leave
the ordinary Methods, and deliver our
thoughts in dark obſolete terms, when
we deſire to impart them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the ſame thing with us in reſpect
of Language, as in reſpect of Habit.
Some People puſh on the Modes to the

will not ſpeak a word now,
that was not in uſe two hundred years

When Cuſtom affords not terms proper

                  <p>VVHen we advance Cuſtom to
the Throne, and make it
Soveraign Arbiter of all Languages,
we do not intend to put the Scepter into
the hands of the Populace. There is
a good, and there is a bad Cuſtom:
And as good Men are the propereſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
to thoſe who deſire to live well;
ſo the practice of good Speakers is the
fitteſt Rule for thoſe who would ſpeak
well. <hi>Uſum, qui ſit Arbiter dicendi</hi> (ſays
<hi>Quintil.) vocamus conſenſum eruditorum,
ſicut vivendi, conſenſum bonorum.</hi> But it
is no hard matter to diſcern betwixt
the good and the bad; betwixt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
Language of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the noble and refin'd Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Gentry, whoſe condition
and merits have advanced them above
the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50222:35"/>
And to make this diſtinction, there
are three ways. The firſt is <hi>Experience:</hi>
We are to obſerve thoſe who ſpeak
well; we are to conſider the manner
of their expreſſions, what latitude they
give to their words, what it is that
they affect, and what it is they avoid: If
we cannot arrive at their converſation,
we have Books, where Men ſpeak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
with more exactneſs, having time
and leiſure to correct ſuch improprieties
as ſlip unavoidably in diſcourſe; for the
Memory being full of ill words conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
ſounded by the common people,
'tis very hard to be ſo conſtantly upon
our guard, as not to let ſome of them
fall from us in converſation before we
are aware. When we write, we review
what we have done, and expunge ſuch
expreſſions as we find unapt or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond way to diſcriminate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
good Cuſtoms and bad, is <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
All Languages have the ſame Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
which Men would eſtabliſh,
if by accident (like that we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
they were obliged to invent a
new Language. By the Notion we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50222:35"/>
have given of theſe Fundamentals, we
may make our ſelves Maſters and Judges
of any Language, and condemn the
Laws of Cuſtom where they are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the Laws of Nature and Reaſon.
Though we have no right to eſtabliſh
new words, we have liberty to reject
ſuch as are bad. Languages are never
refin'd, 'till Men begin to canvaſs and
examin them; 'till ſuch Expreſſions are
exploded, as corrupt Uſe has introduced;
but thoſe are not to be found out by
the ordinary people: It muſt be learned
and ſagacious Men, and Men that have
exact knowledge of this Art. When
juſt and proper Expreſſions are uſed,
a Language may be ſaid to refine, and
the diſcontinuance from ſpeaking ill
fixes the cuſtom of ſpeaking well.</p>
                  <p>Yet in the eſtabliſhment of Language,
Reaſon (as we have ſhown in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Chapters) preſcribes but very
few Laws; the reſt depend upon the
Will and conſent of Men. In ſpeaking,
the whole World propoſes but one end;
but becauſe we may arrive at that end
by different ways, the liberty of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them as we pleaſe, cauſes difference
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50222:36"/>
in the manner of expreſſion, even in
the ſame Language. Nevertheleſs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the liberty Authors have
taken in the formation of Language,
we may obſerve a certain uniformity,
and conſtant regularity running quite
thorough all our Expreſſions. Men do
commonly adhere to ſuch cuſtoms as
they have formerly embraced. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though words depend much upon
the fancy and capriccio of Men, yet,
as is ſaid before, we may diſcern a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
uniformity in Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>If we know then, that words of
ſuch a ſound, are of ſuch a Gender;
when we doubt of the Gender of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
word, we muſt compare it with
words of the ſame termination, whoſe
Gender is known: And ſo in Verbs,
if I would know (in the <hi>French</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
whether the third perſon of the
Preterperfect Tenſe of a propoſed Verb
be to end in <hi>a,</hi> I go no farther than to the
Infinitive, and if that ends in <hi>er,</hi> my
buſineſs is done; becauſe 'tis evident all
Verbs of that Language, ending in <hi>er</hi>
in the Infinitive, do end with <hi>a</hi> in the
Tenſe and perſon aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50222:36"/>
This way of underſtanding the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of a Language, by comparing its
expreſſions, and conſidering the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
which they bear one to the
other, is called <hi>Analogie,</hi> which is a
<hi>Greek</hi> word, and ſignifies proportion.
By means of their <hi>Analogie,</hi> it is that
Languages have been fix'd: By virtue
of <hi>Analogie</hi> Grammarians have found
out their Rules, and the good Cuſtoms
of a Language; have compos'd their
Grammars, which, if well made, are
very uſeful, as furniſhing us with Rules
in ſhort, which we ſhould be obliged to
find out by <hi>Analogie</hi> with infinite labour
and diligence.</p>
                  <p>Of all the three ways for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of good Cuſtom, Experience is
the beſt. Cuſtom is always Maſter:
Our choice muſt be of the moſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
expreſſions, and by that choice
Languages are purged of their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.
But when Cuſtom affords but
one ſingle word or phraſe, to expreſs
what we are obliged to ſay; Reaſon
permits that we give place to Cuſtom,
though it be contrary to Reaſon; nor
are we to be blam'd at all, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50222:37"/>
be bad. This was the occaſion
of that old and true Maxim among the
Lawyers, <hi>Communis error facit jus. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie</hi>
is not the Miſtreſs of Language;
ſhe is not come down from Heaven to
give Laws in that caſe; ſhe deſcribes
only the Laws of Cuſtom. <hi>Non eſt lex

                  <p>To perfectly underſtand the Cuſtoms

of a Language conſiſts in certain qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
which thoſe who ſpeak do affect
to give to their Stile. The Genius of
the <hi>French</hi> Language is perſpicuity and
livelineſs; in which they differ much
from the Eaſtern Nations, who do
rather prefer myſterious and enigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
expreſſions, that may find work
for the thought. Idioms diſtinguiſh
Languages one from the other, as well
as words. To ſpeak <hi>French,</hi> it is not
enough to make uſe of <hi>French</hi> words;
for if we jumble them together, or
diſpoſe them as a <hi>German</hi> would do the
words of his own Language, we ſhould
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50222:37"/>
rather ſpeak <hi>Dutch</hi> than <hi>French.</hi> We
call <hi>Hebraiſms,</hi> the Idioms of <hi>Hebrew;
Helleniſms,</hi> the Proprieties of <hi>Greek;</hi>
and ſo of the reſt. 'Tis an <hi>Hebraiſm</hi> to
ſay <hi>Vanity of Vanities,</hi> inſtead of <hi>The

diſtribution, by repetition of the

put into the Ark ſeven, and ſeven of all
Creatures,</hi> to ſignifie that <hi>Noah put into
the Ark ſeven pairs or couples of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
'Tis an <hi>Helleniſm</hi> to uſe the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive
inſtead of a Noun; and that
Idiom is frequent in our Language,
which has great affinity with the <hi>Greek.</hi>
Expreſſions obſolete, rejected by new
cuſtom, and to be found only in ancient

They accommodate their Matter to
their Phraſe, without conſidering in

was uſed by the Author. So that their

We know what the Poet intended,
but he was out in his Expreſſion. This
is rather our want of Judgment, than
ignorance of Language; ſo that to ſpeak
exactly, we muſt ſtudy as well to adapt
our Judgment as Tongue.</p>
                  <p>For the Order to be given to words,
when they are joyned together, our
Ears do inſtruct us ſo ſenſibly what
Rules are to be obſerved, that we have
no need to mention them here. Cuſtom
does not always obſerve Natural Order
in certain words. It requires that ſome
be placed firſt, and others follow at a
diſtance. The Ear being uſed to theſe
kinds of array, perceives the leaſt
tranſgreſſion, and is offended at it. We
are more diſturbed at a thing ungrateful
to our Senſes, than to our Reaſon:
Nonſenſe, or an Errour in arguing,
would be leſs abominable, than if a

ſay <hi>Head my,</hi> for <hi>my Head.</hi> And this is

approves, and reject what it condemns.
The Vices oppoſed to this Purity, are
<hi>Barbariſms,</hi> and <hi>Soleciſms.</hi> The Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians
do not agree about the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of theſe two Vices. Monſieur
<hi>de Vaugelas</hi> applies <hi>Barbariſm</hi> only to
Words, Phraſes, and Particles; and
<hi>Soleciſm</hi> to Declenſions, Conjugations,
and Conſtruction. We commit a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm</hi>

of their being Clear.</head>
                  <p>THe richneſs of a Language conſiſts
in its Tropes; and as the ill uſe
of a Man's Wealth, is the deſtruction
of his Eſtate; ſo the ill choice of
Tropes occaſions a multitude of faults
in Diſcourſe. 'Tis neceſſary therefore
that Rules be preſcribed: And firſt great
care is to be taken, that we uſe no
Tropes, but where we muſt expreſs
our ſelves imperfectly without them;
and when we are obliged to uſe them,
they muſt have two qualities; one is,
they muſt be clear, and contribute to
the underſtanding of what we intend,
ſeeing the only uſe of them is to make
us more intelligible; the other is, that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50222:49"/>
they hold proportion with the Idea we
deſign to delineate.</p>
                  <p>Three things hinder the perſpicuity
of a Trope: The firſt is when it is too
remote, and gives no preſent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the Hearer, to diſcover what it
is that the Speaker intends. As if we
ſhould call a ſcandalous Houſe, the
<hi>Syrtes of Youth.</hi> We ſhould not reach
the meaning of the Metaphor, 'till we
we had recollected, that the <hi>Syrtes</hi> were
certain Banks of Sand (upon the <hi>African</hi>
Coaſt) very dangerous. Whereas if we
ſhould ſay the ſame Houſe was a <hi>Rock
for Youth,</hi> what we intended to ſignifie
would be obvious enough. To avoid
this inconvenience, the beſt way will
be to take our Metaphors from ſenſible
things, and ſuch as are frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to our Eyes, whoſe Images
are eaſily apprehended without ſcrutiny
or trouble. If I would deſcribe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whoſe Name I had forgot, I ſhould
be ridiculous to do it by dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
ſigns, that gave no ready occaſion
to my Hearers to form an Idea of his
perſon: But this that is a fault ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and ſo much to be avoided in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50222:50"/>
converſation, is looked upon by ſome
Authors as an Elegance, and highly
affected. Some people delight to fetch
their Metaphors afar off, and to take
them from things unknown, to oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their Learning. If they ſpeak of
a Kingdom, they will be ſure to make
uſe of a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> and call it by ſome
part that no body knows: The neareſt
of their Tropes ſhall be fetcht out of
<hi>Aſia</hi> or <hi>Africk.</hi> And he who would
underſtand them, muſt inform himſelf
of all the Villages, Fountains, and Mole-hills
in thoſe Countries. They never
mention a Man, but by the Titles of
his Grand-father or Great Grand-father,
and all to make a Parade of their great
Skill in Antiquity. Whereas the Idea
of a Trope ought to have ſuch reference
and connexion with the proper word,
that one cannot be mentioned, without
exciting the Idea of the other: And
this fault in the connexion, is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thing that renders a Trope ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.
This connexion is either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or artificial. I call that natural,
when things ſignified by their proper,
and by their metaphorical Names, have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50222:50"/>
natural reſemblance, or dependance one
upon the other. As when we ſay a
Man has Arms of Braſs, to ſignifie the
ſtrength of his Arms, we may call this
reſemblance betwixt the Trope and the
proper Expreſſion, natural. The arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
connexion, is that which ariſes
from Cuſtom. 'Tis the cuſtom to call
a rough untractable Man an <hi>Arab;</hi>
'tis an uſual term, and the frequent
uſing it in that ſenſe, makes the Idea
of that word <hi>Arab</hi> awake the Idea of
an untractable Man. And therefore an
artificial connexion is more obvious,
than a natural, becauſe it is eſtabliſhed
by Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>The too frequent uſe of Tropes, is
the third thing that renders them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure:
The cleareſt and moſt perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Metaphors expreſs things but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly.
The natural Idea of what is
repreſented only by Metaphors, arrives
not at the Mind without pain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion,
and there are few but would
be willing to have that labour ſpared.
Yet when we condemn this frequency
of Tropes, we intend only thoſe which
are extraordinary. Some there are as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50222:51"/>
uſeful as natural Terms; and thoſe can
never perplex our Diſcourſe. When
we make uſe of Metaphorical Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
they muſt be of this latter ſort,
otherwiſe our Hearers muſt be prepared
to underſtand them. A Trope ought
to be preceded by ſomething that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
miſtake, and the ſequel of the
Diſcourſe ought to make it appear, that
we are not to ſtop at the natural Idea
repreſented by the Terms which we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy.</p>
                  <p>Unleſs we be very extravagant, and
delight in not being underſtood, we
will never continue a Book, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
from the beginning to the end
in perpetual Allegories. We cannot
diſcover a Man's meaning, but when
he gives us at leaſt ſome natural ſigns
of it, without fallacy or equivocation.
How can we tell when he is in jeſt,
and when in earneſt, unleſs we have
ſeen him ſerious before? How can we
diſtinguiſh a Mimick from a real Fool,
but by obſerving that the one is a Fool
only for a time, and the other as long
as he lives? When therefore we ſee an
Author expreſs himſelf wholly by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50222:51"/>
we may conclude him extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant;
unleſs there be ſome ſecret rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that makes him obſcure.</p>

                  <p>THe Uſe of Tropes is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
becauſe many times ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

Idea of threatning (which belongs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to people above us) would form
in my Mind an Idea of ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
height, as could not be expreſſed
without an Hyperbole. We ſay more
than we intend, for fear we ſhould ſay
leſs. But theſe kind of Expreſſions are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50222:52"/>
to be uſed with great caution and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:
We muſt have a care that there
be always a proportion betwixt the
natural Idea of the Trope, and the
thing we would explain; otherwiſe the
Hearer may miſunderſtand, and take
one thing for another. If ſpeaking of
an indifferent low Valley, I ſhould ſay,
<hi>It went as low as Hell;</hi> or of a Rock of
more than ordinary height, I ſhould
ſay, <hi>It touched the Skies;</hi> who would
not believe I was ſpeaking of a Rock
of an immenſe height, and of a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of a prodigious lowneſs? So that
we muſt have particular regard that
our Trope does not give a contrary or
extravagant Idea of the thing we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
leſt whilſt we pretend to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
we make our Auditors laugh, as
in this Expreſſion, <hi>Morte Catonis Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica
caſtrata eſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are thouſands of ways to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and temper theſe extravagant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
of which ſometimes we are
forced to make uſe. If our reputation
be in danger, we excuſe our ſelves, or
prepare the Reader by ſome previous
complement: For 'tis plain, an ill intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50222:52"/>
Trope, is a ſign of an irregular
Fancy: Theſe bold Expreſſions are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications
of our Judgment or Paſſion:
When an Object is rare, and we think
it ſo in our Minds, (whether it be for
its height or profundity) we preſently
are ſenſible in our ſelves of Motions ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Eſteem or Contempt, Hatred
or Love, which we expreſs by words
proportioned to our Judgment and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
If therefore the Judgment we
make of theſe Objects be raſh and teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious;
if our Sentiments be irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
our Diſcourſe betrays all, and
diſcovers our weakneſs. 'Tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
therefore, that our Tropes be
ſuited to our Idea's, but they muſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate
among themſelves. Men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
Lovers of great things; and
therefore Authors, who make the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

Scope of their Art, do affect great
Words, high Metaphors, and bold Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles,
that, to be examin'd, would
appear ridiculous, and even in thoſe
perſons who are delighted with them,
produce nothing but vain admiration.
A Man of Reaſon cannot endure that

of his Diſcourſe, the new and
ſudden way of expreſſing himſelf, (quite
contrary to his way when he was cool
and in peace) are certain characters of
agitation, and imply diſturbance in the
perſon who ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>Paſſion makes us conſider things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than we do when we are calm
and ſedate. It magnifies the Objects,
and fixes our thoughts upon them in
ſuch manner, that our thoughts are
wholly employed about them; the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
making as ſtrong an impreſſion
in us, as the things themſelves. Our
Paſſions do many times produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effects, tranſporting the Mind,
and in an inſtant carrying it through
ſeveral variations: They force our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
from one Object, and throw
it upon another: They precipitate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt,
and divert it: In a word, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in a Man's Heart, has the ſame
effect as the Wind in the Sea: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it forces the Waves upon the
ſhore, ſometimes it hurries them back
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50222:55"/>
into the deep; on a ſudden it mounts
them and daſhes them againſt the Sky,
and preſently tumbles them down to
the very Centre of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>So our words anſwer to our thoughts:
The Diſcourſe of a Man that is moved,
cannot be equal: Sometimes it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe,
and deſcribes exactly the thing
that is the Object of our Paſſion: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time it is ſhort; his expreſſion is
abrupt; twenty things ſaid at a time;
twenty Interrogations; twenty Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
twenty Digreſſions together;
he is alter'd by a hundred little particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and new ways of ſignifying his
mind, which ways are as different, and
diſtinguiſhable from his ordinary way,
as the Face of a Man is when he is
angry, from his Face when he is quiet
and ſerene.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ways of Speaking (which are
Characters drawn by our Paſſions in
our Diſcourſe) are the famous <hi>Figures</hi>
mentioned by Rhetoricians, and by
them defin'd, <hi>Manners of Speaking, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
and remote from the ways that are
ordinary and natural;</hi> that is to ſay, quite
other than what we uſe, when we
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50222:55"/>
ſpeak without paſſion. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
obſcure in this definition, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
explication, and therefore we
will go on to the Uſe and Neceſſity of
theſe Figures.</p>

                  <p>THree Reaſons oblige us particularly
to the Uſe of Figures. Firſt, when
we deſcribe a perſon under commotion,
if we would do it exactly, we muſt
repreſent his Diſcourſe with all its
proper Figures, turning and altering
them, as Men in paſſion do generally
turn and alter their Diſcourſe. A skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Painter, to expreſs (as much as in
him lyes) the thoughts and paſſions of
the perſon whom he draws, gives his

obſerves to be in the Face after extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
provocation; which ſtrokes,
are great indications of the temper of
the Mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:50222:56"/>
Our Paſſions (as I ſaid before) will
ſhow themſelves in our Eyes, our

of Anger and Mirth cannot be

are diſtinguiſhed among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>When a Diſcourſe has life in it, and
is animated with the Motions and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
and Paſſions of the perſon who
ſpeaks, it cauſes a ſecret pleaſure, and
is extreamly delightful. We cannot
read theſe following Verſes, without

<hi>Niſus</hi> in great conſternation, upon the

whom <hi>Volcens</hi> was advancing with his
Sword in his hand to revenge the death
of <hi>Tagus,</hi> who as he thought was ſlain
by <hi>Euryalus. Niſus</hi> diſcovers himſelf to

us to compaſſion, his Eyes muſt be
fix'd upon the ground, and his Cheeks
all dabbled with tears: For the ſame
reaſon, our Diſcourſe ought likewiſe
to bear the marks of the paſſion we
feel, and would communicate to our
Auditors. We judge of things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the zeal and fervor of the
Speaker. The moſt part of Men, and
of things, that have extraordinary
eſteem, are indebted for it, to thoſe
who never mention them but with
tranſports of admiration: Were they
mentioned with contempt, the World
would think contemptibly of them.

                  <p>Animals know how to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
to acquire what is uſeful, and
to keep it by force. Thoſe who have
fancied them but Machins, have ſhow'd
very ingeniouſly, their Bodies to be ſo
organiz'd, that they may perform thoſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50222:57"/>
actions without aſſiſtance from the
Soul. We find in our ſelves, that our
Members (without direction from our
Soul) diſpoſe themſelves into poſtures
to avoid injury. That the Body frames
it ſelf into a proper condition, either
to invade or defend. The Hands and
the Feet expoſe themſelves for the ſafety
of the Head. The Feet ſtand firm to
ſupport the Body, and put it into a
capacity of withſtanding the inſults of
the Enemy. The Arm ſtiffens, and liſts
it ſelf up to ſtrike with greater force.
The whole Body twiſts, and contracts,
and extends it ſelf, to avoid or invade
the Adverſary. And all this is done
naturally, without reflexion or debate.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not to be thought, that theſe
Figures are only Rhetorical Figments,
invented for ornament of diſcourſe:
God has not refus'd to the Soul, what
he has given to the Body. The Body
knows how to move, and diſpoſe it ſelf
dexterouſly, for the repelling of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries;
and the Soul may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> defend it ſelf
as well: Nature has not made her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
upon any inſult: The Figures
imploy'd by her in diſcourſe, do the

ſame, as Poſtures in defence of the
Body. If Poſtures be proper for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
in corporal invaſions; Figures
are as neceſſary, in ſpiritual attacks.
Words are the Arms of the Mind,
which ſhe uſes, to diſſwade or perſwade,

and force of theſe Figures, after
I have given a particular definition of
each of them. But it being impoſſible
to deſcribe all the Poſtures which our
Paſſions do dictate to our Bodies, ſo
'tis as impoſſible to enumerate all the
Figures wherewith our Paſſions do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

improperly to be plac'd in the Van

our Paſſions do firſt exert, and diſcover

is a violent extenſion of the Voice.
When the Soul comes to be diſturb'd,
and agitated with a furious impulſe,
the animal Spirits paſſing thorough all
the parts of the Body, and thronging
into the Muſcles that are about the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of the Voice, ſwell them up in
ſuch manner, that the paſſage being
ſtreight'ned, the Voice comes forth with
more impetuoſity, by reaſon of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

of the Soul is followed by an <hi>Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>

what they mean. When we are in
Combat with our Enemy, we think it
not enough to give him one wound and
no more; we multiply our blows, for
fear one ſhould not do the buſineſs: So
in Speaking, if we think our firſt words
not well underſtood, we repeat them,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50222:61"/>
or explain them another way. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
having got the Maſtery of us,
poſſeſſes it ſelf of our Minds, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints
ſtrongly in us thoſe things which
have cauſed it; of which the Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very full, no wonder if we ſpeak
with emotion. <hi>Repetition</hi> is made two
ways; when we repeat the ſame words,
or when we repeat the ſame thing in
different words. <hi>Cicero</hi> gives us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the former, in his firſt Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

in different manners he expreſſes this

words, there are ways of diſpoſing
them with ſuch art, that anſwering
one another, they make an excellent
Cadence, and are very pleaſing to the

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50222:64"/>
be in this, that a <hi>Compariſon</hi> is more

that he preferr'd the Law of God before
all things, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>The fineſt Gold near them looks wan and

                     </q>
                     <p>But there are two things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in Compariſons: The firſt is,
We are not to require an exact analogy
and proportion betwixt all the parts of
a Compariſon, and the Subject of which
we ſpeak. Certain things are inſerted
only to render the Compariſons more
lively, as in that which <hi>Virgil</hi> makes
of the young <hi>Ligurian</hi> vanquiſh'd by
<hi>Camillus,</hi> with a Pigeon in the Pounces
of an Hawk: After he had ſaid what
he thought fit of the principal, to which
the Compariſon related, he adds,
<q>Tum Cruor, &amp; Vulſae labuntur ab aethere
plumae.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:50222:64"/>
Which belongs not to the Compariſon,
but is brought in only to make a more
ſenſible deſcription of a Pigeon torn in
pieces by a Hawk. The ſecond thing
to be obſerved in favour of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Poet, I have thought good to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
to defend him from the Criticiſms
of thoſe who condemn his Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as too mean and low. But it is
with much Art that this Great Man,
in his <hi>Aeneids,</hi> makes his Compariſons
of mean things: He does it to eaſe and
relax the Mind of the Reader, whom
the Grandeur and Dignity of his Matter
had held in too ſtrong an intention;
and to diſcern that this was his deſign,
we need no more than to conſider the
Compariſons in his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> which
are lofty and ſtrong.</p>

the ſcarcity of Language obliges us
many times to make uſe of theſe Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical
Expreſſions, even when we are

commonly uſed when we are under a
Tranſport. 'Tis our Paſſion that makes
Objects appear to us extraordinary, and
by conſequence is the Cauſe that we
have not common Terms to repreſent
them either ſo big, or ſo little as they
appear. Beſides that I never pretended

require a large Volume to deſcribe the
Characters of our Paſſions in Diſcourſe,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50222:70"/>
as well as thoſe which the ſame Paſſions

and an Orator Speaking.</head>
                  <p>VVE have ſhown the Neceſſity
and Advantage of Figures
by three Reaſons, of which the two
firſt have been ſufficiently explain'd.
The third (that Figures are the Arms of
the Soul) is ſtill to be clear'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for better illuſtration, and to give
it the deeper Impreſſion upon our
Mind, I will in this place deſcribe a
Soldier fighting, his Sword in his hand;
and an Orator ſpeaking in a Cauſe, that
he has undertaken to defend. I ſhall
make a Parallel of theſe two ſorts of
Combats, and conſider a Soldier in
three Conditions: The firſt, when he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50222:71"/>
fights with equal force, and his Enemy
has no advantage over him. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
when he is inviron'd with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
And the third, when being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to yield to the power of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
he has no recourſe but to the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of the Victor. I ſhall carefully
obſerve the Poſtures which he uſes in
all theſe three Conditions, and ſhow,
that in Diſcourſe there are Figures cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding
to all theſe Poſtures, with
which they have a natural reſemblance.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Condition, the Soldiers
intention is applied to the finding out
ways of obtaining the Victory; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he is upon the offenſive, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
upon the defenſive part; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he advances, ſometimes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats;
he pretends to give ground, and
returns with greater impetuoſity; he
redoubles his blows, he threatens and
contemns the Efforts of his Adverſary.
Sometimes he puts himſelf forward,
and fights with more ardour and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence.
He conſiders the Deſigns of
his Enemy, and poſſeſſes himſelf of the
advantagious ground. In a word, he
is in perpetual motion, and always
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50222:71"/>
diſpos'd either for defence or inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>When the Mind is inflam'd, and
diſpos'd to combat by Words, the
Paſſions with which it is provok'd,
with no leſs heat excite it to find out
Reaſons and Arguments to evince the
Truths which it aſſerts. In the heat
and impatience that every man has to
defend himſelf, and make good what he
affirms, the ſame things are many times
repeated, and delivered in different
manners: Sometimes with <hi>Deſcriptions,
Hypotypoſes, Compariſons, Similitudes.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we prevent what the Adverſary
would ſay, and ſometimes we anſwer
it. Sometimes as a token of confidence
we grant all that is deſir'd, and pretend
not to make uſe of all the Reaſons that
the Juſtice of our Cauſe would ſuggeſt.</p>
                  <p>A Soldier keeps his Enemy in breath;
the ſtrokes that he makes at him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
the aſſaults that he makes at
him on all ſides, the different ways of
his attacks and retreats, keeps him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
waking. An Orator entertains
the Attention of his Auditors; when
their thoughts are ſtraggling, he reduces
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50222:72"/>
them by <hi>Apoſtrophes;</hi> and by <hi>Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi>
obliges them to whom they are
directed to give him an anſwer. He
awakens them, and recollects them by
frequent Exclamations, Reiterations,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having conſider'd this Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Soldier combating with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
let us next repreſent to your Eyes
the Image of another Soldier, inviron'd
with danger, without any hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
Sadneſs forces Tears from his
Eyes, and Sighs from his Breaſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
exaſperates him againſt the
Enemy, and Fear pulls him preſently
back. He ſtands immoveable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolv'd,
whilſt in the mean time his
deſire to eſcape the impending danger,
preſſes and inflames him. After this he
tryes all ſorts of ways; he excites, he
animates himſelf: His Paſſion renders
him dexterous and cunning, it furniſhes
him with Arms, and he makes uſe of
every thing he can reach for his defence.
Can we ſtifle the Sentiments of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
that we feel, and not teſtifie them
by Exclamations, by Complaints, by
Reproaches, when we perceive the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50222:72"/>
Truth (which we love ſo well) obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or obſcur'd? In theſe occaſions,
our great ardour and impatience to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it againſt the Clouds wherewith
it is obfuſcated, makes us accumulate
Arguments, and heap proof upon proof.
Sometimes we explain them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
having propos'd them only, we
leave them, to anſwer the Objections
of the Adverſary. Sometimes we are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
in great irreſolution about the
choice of our proofs. Sometimes we urge
a thing, and immediately find fault
with it, as a thing of no cogency or
conviction. When our proofs fail, or
are inſufficient, Nature her ſelf muſt
Apoſtrophize; we make the Stones
ſpeak, the Dead to come forth of their
Graves; the Heaven and Earth are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
to fortifie by their teſtimony the
Truth, for the eſtabliſhment of which
we ſpeak with ſo much heat.</p>

a Soldier Fighting, and an Orator
Pleading in defence of his Cauſe.</head>
                  <p>TO complete the Parallel that I have
begun, betwixt a Soldier and an
Orator, I conſider the Soldier in the
third Condition to which he is reduc'd,
when not being able longer to contend,
he is oblig'd to yield to his Enemy.
In that caſe, he throws away his Arms
as unuſeful; there is nothing of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or fury in his countenance. His
chief Weapon is his Tears; he humbles
himſelf more than his Enemy would
humble him; he proſtrates himſelf at
his Feet, and embraces his Knees: Man
is made, to obey thoſe upon whom he
depends, or by whom he is maintain'd;
and to command his Inferiours that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his Juriſdiction: He does
both the one and the other with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Two perſons are bound very
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50222:73"/>
ſtrictly together, when the one has
need of relief and deſires it, and the
other has power to relieve and applies
it. God having made Mankind to live
together, has formed them with theſe
Natural Inclinations: A perſon in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
betakes himſelf naturally to all
poſtures of Humility, that may make
him appear inferiour to the perſon of
whom he begs; and we cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſiſting the Sentiments of Nature,
refuſe to perſons ſo humbled, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
that they implore: We ſupply
them with a ſecret delight, which is
as it were our recompence and reward
(in ſome meaſure) for the Comforts we
beſtow. It is by this way of Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
that a Trade and Commerce is
maintain'd betwixt the poor and the
rich, betwixt the miſerable and the
happy.</p>
                  <p>In Diſcourſe there are Figures which
anſwer to theſe Poſtures of Affliction
and Humility, to which the Orators
have frequent recourſe. Men being
free, it is at their own choice whether
they will ſuffer themſelves to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded;
they can turn away their face,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50222:74"/>
and not ſee the Truth that is propos'd
to them; or they can diſſemble that
they know it. So an Orator is many
times in this third Condition, wherein
we conſider our Soldier. When he
finds he muſt yield, and his deſire to
preſerve himſelf obliges him to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that he may obtain that by Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
that he cannot hope to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
by force of Argument, his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is imploy'd to poſſeſs his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
of the unfortunate Condition
to which he is reduc'd; Prayers are
commonly full of deſcriptions of his
Miſery who makes them. <hi>Job</hi> expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating

but a leaf, with which the winds do ſport
themſelves; and as a dry ſtubble. Contra

                  <p>VVE cannot doubt of a known
Truth: We may queſtion it
with our Mouth, but our Heart muſt
be thoroughly convinc'd. To triumph
therefore upon the obſtinacy or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

to expoſe the light of it to their
Eyes, and to bring it ſo near, that the
ſtrength of its impreſſion may awaken
them, and oblige them to be attentive.
Figures do extreamly contribute to the
removing theſe two firſt obſtacles, that
hinder a Truth from being known,
and help its obſcurity, and the defect
of our attention. They are uſeful to
illuſtrate and explain it; they force the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50222:75"/>
Hearer to an attention; they awaken
him, and ſtrike him ſo lively, that they
do not ſuffer him to ſleep, nor keep the
Eyes of his Mind ſhut up to the Truths
that are propos'd.</p>
                  <p>My Deſign being in my Liſt of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
to inſert only thoſe which the
Rhetoricians do place frequently in that
number, I will not ſpeak of <hi>Syllogiſms,</hi>
of <hi>Enthimems,</hi> of <hi>Dilemma's,</hi> and other
kind of Arguments that are uſed in
Logick; and yet it is manifeſt they are
real Figures, being extraordinary ways
of reaſoning never uſed but in paſſion,
or ardent deſire to perſwade or diſſwade
thoſe to whom we ſpeak. Theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
or Figures are wonderfully
effectual in this, That joyning a clear
and inconteſtable Propoſition, with
another that is more doubtful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable,
the clearneſs of the one diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates
the obſcurity of the other, and
the two Propoſitions being ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
if the reaſoning be good, we
cannot grant the one to be true, but
we muſt confeſs the other to be ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſolid Argument ſuppreſſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms

the moſt obſtinate Adverſary: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Figures are not indeed of that
force and conviction, but yet they are
not unprofitable. <hi>Repetitions</hi> and <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma</hi>
do illuſtrate a Truth. If our firſt
Expreſſion be too weak, the ſecond
makes us intelligible. The <hi>Synonyma</hi>
when added, are ſo many new ſtrokes
of a Pencil, that make thoſe Lines
viſible, which before were incomplete.</p>
                  <p>When our impatience to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
gives us juſt occaſion to fear we
have not ſufficiently explain'd our
ſelves, we dilate upon things the more,
and are more copious in our Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
If our Hearers have not been
attentive, we repeat a ſecond time
what we have ſaid before. What
darkneſs can obfuſcate the verity of a
thing that an Eloquent Perſon explains?
of which, he makes <hi>Deſcriptions,</hi> and
<hi>Enumerations,</hi> (that lead us (if I may
ſo ſay) thorough all the corners and
receſſes of an Affair) and ſuch <hi>Hypoty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,</hi>
and <hi>Illuſtrations,</hi> as carry us tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
all difficulties, and by a pleaſant
Enchantment makes us believe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the things themſelves? An <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:50222:76"/>
is no idle ornament; oppoſition
of contrary things, contributes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
to the clearing of a Truth. Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
add much to the beauty of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                  <p>Our Minds are not equally open to
all kind of Truths. We comprehend
much more eaſily things that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
every day, and in common uſe
among Men; than thoſe which are rare,
and mention'd but ſeldom. For which
Reaſon, <hi>Compariſons</hi> and <hi>Similitudes,</hi>
drawn ordinarily from ſenſible things,
give us a more eaſie penetration into
the moſt abſtracted and abſtruſe Truths.
There is nothing ſo ſubtil and ſublime,
but may be made intelligible to the
weakeſt Underſtanding, if among the
things which they know, or are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of knowing, we can find out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
ſuch as have reſemblance or
ſimilitude with thoſe which we would
explain to them. We have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Example of this Addreſs, in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
that Monſieur <hi>Paſchal</hi> made to a
young Nobleman, to give him a true
Notion of his Condition. His <hi>Parabole</hi>
is thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:50222:76"/>
A certain Perſon is caſt by Tempeſt
into an unknown Iſland, whoſe Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
were in great pain to find out
their King who was loſt. The Perſon
having much reſemblance, both in
Body and Feature with the King, is
taken for him, and recognis'd in that
quality by the People. At firſt he was
ſurpris'd, and knew not how he was
to ſteer; but upon ſecond thoughts he
reſolved to follow his Fortune, receiv'd
all the reſpects that they paid him, and
ſuffer'd himſelf to be treated as their
King.</p>
                  <p>But being unable to forget his natural
condition, it ſtuck in his Mind at the
ſame time that he received their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities,
that he was not the King for
whom they ſought, and that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was not his. So that he had a
double care upon him; one, by which
he acted as King; the other, by which
he remembred his real condition, and
was aſſured, that it was only Chance
which had placed him where he was:
This laſt thought he conceal'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the other he diſcover'd: By the
firſt, he treated with the People; by the
laſt, he treated with himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:50222:77"/>
By this Example Monſieur <hi>Paſchal</hi>
ſignified to the young Lord, That it
was the Fortune of his Birth which had
made him Great; that it was only the
Fancy of the People, that had annexed
to the Quality of a Duke, an Idea of
Grandeur; and that in effect he is no
greater than other People. Inſtructing
him in that manner what Sentiments
he ought to have of his condition, and
making him underſtand Truths, which
would have been above the Capacity
of his Age, had he not (as I may ſay)
brought them down to the Intellect of
him whom he deſired to inſtruct.</p>
                  <p>Were Men Lovers of Truth, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it to them in a lively and ſenſible
way, would be ſufficient to perſwade
them: But they hate it, becauſe it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates
but ſeldom with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
and is ſeldom made out, but
to the diſcovery of their Crimes: In
ſo much that they are affraid of its
luſtre, and ſhut their Eyes that they
may not behold it. They ſtifle the
natural love that Men have for it, and
harden themſelves againſt the ſaluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
ſtrokes that ſhe ſtrikes upon the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50222:77"/>
Conſcience: They ſhut all the Ports of
their Senſes, that ſhe may not enter into
their Minds, where ſhe is receiv'd with
ſo much indifference, that ſhe is forgot
as ſoon as ſhe is receiv'd.</p>
                  <p>Eloquence therefore would have but
little authority over our Hearts, and
would indeed find ſtrong reſiſtance,
did ſhe not attack them with other
Arms beſides Truth. The Paſſions are
the Springs of the Soul: It is they
which cauſe it to act: It is either Love,
or Hatred, or Fear, or Hope, which
counſels and determins us. We purſue
what we love, we avoid what we hate.
He that holds the Spring of a Machin,
is not ſo much Maſter of all the Effects
of the Machin, as he is of a Perſon,
whoſe Inclination he knows, and is
able to inſpire with Hatred, or Love,
according as either is neceſſary to make
him advance, or to remove him from an
Object.</p>
                  <p>But the Paſſions are excited by the
preſence of their Object: Preſent Good
affects us with Love, and with Joy;
When we do not actually, but are in
poſſibility of poſſeſſing that Good, it
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50222:78"/>
inflames the Soul with deſires, whoſe
Flames are continued by Hope.</p>
                  <p>Preſent Evil is the Cauſe of Hatred
or Sadneſs: The Soul is tormented with
Fears and with Terrors, which turn
to Deſpair, when we find we have no
means left to avoid them: To kindle
therefore theſe Paſſions in the Heart
of a Man, we muſt preſent the Objects
before him; and to this purpoſe, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
do marvellouſly conduce.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen how Figures do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
ſtrongly; how they illuſtrate, and
how they explain: We muſt uſe them
in the ſame manner to diſcover the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Paſſion which we have a
mind to inſpire, and to make a lively
Picture that expreſſes all the Features
and Lineaments of the ſaid Object. If
we declame againſt a Malefactor, who
deſerves the hatred of the Judges, we
are not to be ſparing of words, nor
affraid of <hi>Repetitions, Synonyma,</hi> that
ſtrongly imprint upon the Mind the
Image of his Crimes. An <hi>Antitheſis</hi>
will be convenient, and make them
conceive the enormity of his Life, by
oppoſing the Innocence of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50222:78"/>
whom he has wrong'd: We may
compare him to the Malefactors of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages, and declare his Cruelty to
be greater than the Cruelty of the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres
and Lions. It is in the Deſcription
of Cruelty, and other ill qualities, that
Eloquence triumphs: It is particularly
the <hi>Hypotypoſes,</hi> or lively Deſcriptions,
which produce the Effect expected from
our Diſcourſe, and raiſe in the Mind
Floods of Paſſion, of which we make
uſe, to incline the Judges as we have
a mind to lead them. Frequent Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
do teſtifie our horrour at
the repreſentation of his abominable
Crimes; and makes the Standers-by
feel the ſame Sentiments of grief and
averſion. By <hi>Apoſtrophes</hi> and <hi>Proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia's</hi>

Characters of our Paſſions, when
thoſe Paſſions are irregular, Figures
ſerve only to deſcribe thoſe Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
They are Inſtruments uſed to
ſhake and agitate the Minds of thoſe to
whom we ſpeak: If theſe Inſtruments
be managed by an unjuſt Paſſion, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
in that Man's Mouth, are like a
Sword in the Hand of a Mad Man. It
is not lawful by falſe accuſation to
blacken every Man againſt whom we
ſpeak; nor to ſhow our Eloquence, is
it neceſſary to imploy againſt him, the
ſame Figures we would uſe to diſpoſe
a Judge to the Condemnation of a
wicked and abominable perſon. Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
with whom this fault is familiar,
do ſeldom deceive twice; their Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
are quickly underſtood, and it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50222:79"/>
happens to them, as to thoſe who have
uſed to counterfeit themſelves ſick;
when they are ſick indeed, no body
believes them:</p>
                  <q>Quaere Peregrinum, vicinia Rauca reclamat.</q>
                  <p>This fault in ſome perſons is a ſign
of cunning, in others 'tis a ſign of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and extravagance. When we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in combating the Truth; when
we deſire not to ſatisfie our Hearers, but
chuſe rather to trouble their Minds with
the Clouds of ſome unjuſt Paſſion, that
may intercept the ſight of the Truth;
the Figures imploy'd in that Caſe may
be call'd <hi>Figures of Craft.</hi> But Orators
are not always to be accus'd of this
cunning; ſometimes they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the impreſſions which their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
may make; their deſign not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much to perſwade, as to ſhow
their Eloquence; and to do that, they
will put themſelves into a heat, and
make uſe of the ſtrongeſt Figures in
Rhetorick, when perhaps they have no
Enemy to combat: Like a Mad Man,
who draws his Sword upon a Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50222:80"/>
that his own troubled Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has repreſented in the Air. Theſe
are Orators that fall many times into
Raptures and Enthuſiaſms, which take
away the uſe of their Reaſon, and make
them ſee things in a quite contrary
manner to what in reality they are.</p>
                  <q>Et ſolem geminum, &amp; duplices ſe oſtendere
Thebas.</q>
                  <p>This Fault is the Character of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
that is angry without a cauſe;
yet many Learned and Eminent Writers
are guilty of it, as believing they could
not paſs for Eloquent without theſe
kind of Figures. For this reaſon, they
will talk lowd upon all occaſions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave
their own Judgments, and look
upon every thing quite otherwiſe than
it is; whereas they ſhould rather
reflect ſoberly upon whatever is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and ſpeak only by Sentences.
But that which is moſt ridiculous is,
That theſe ill Orators endeavour only
to pleaſe and tickle their Auditory, not
concerning themſelves in the leaſt to
overcome or convince their Adverſary
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50222:80"/>
by the force of their words. Like a
diſtracted perſon, never regarding how
he ſtruck, or defended himſelf with
advantage againſt his Enemy, ſo he
drew the Eyes of the Spectators upon
him, and got the reputation of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
handſomly, and with a good grace.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>They affect to meaſure their words,
and to give them a juſt Cadence that
may flatter the Ear: They proportion
all their Expreſſions, and in a word,
they fill up their Diſcourſes with Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
but ſuch Figures as, in reſpect
of ſtrong and perſwaſive Figures, are
like the Poſtures in a Dance, in reſpect
of the Poſtures of a Combat.</p>
                  <p>The Study and Art that appear in a
compt and polite Diſcourſe, are not
the Character of a Mind lively touch'd
with the things of which he ſpeaks;
but rather of a Man unconcern'd, and
merry. So we call theſe Figures of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50222:81"/>
Meaſure, whoſe Cadence is agreeable
to the Ear, <hi>Theatrical Figures, Theatrales
Figurae.</hi> They are Arms only for ſhow,
not of a temper to fight with. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
proper to perſwade are not to be
ſought for: It is the heat wherewith
we are animated for the defence of the
Truth that produces them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
them in our Diſcourſe; ſo that
indeed Eloquence is nothing but the
Effect of our Zeal. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells
us the ſame, ſpeaking of the Eloquence
of the Stile of St. <hi>Paul: Quid ſic indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur
Apoſtolus in Epiſtolis ſuis, ſic cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripit,
ſic exprobrat, ſic increpat, ſic mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur?
Quid eſt quod animi ſui affectum
tam crebra &amp; tam aſpera vocis mutatione
teſtetur? Nullus dixerit, more Sophiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
pueriliter &amp; conſulto figuraſſe Oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
ſuam; tamen multis figuris diſtincta
eſt. Quapropter ſicut Apoſtolum praecepta
Eloquentiae non ſecutum eſſe dicemus; ita,
quod ejus ſapientiam ſecuta ſit Eloquentia,
non denegamus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is not only upon great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
that Figures are to be uſed: The
Paſſions have ſeveral degrees: All pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
are not equally alike; nor
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50222:81"/>
have all Figures the ſame efficacy and
force. There are <hi>Antitheſes</hi> for great,
and other Figures for leſſer Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
So that we ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
all ſorts of Figures in Diſcourſe,
upon a matter that affords not juſt and
reaſonable occaſion of emotion. The
impatience Men have to expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
well, and to make the things
they would inſinuate to be conceiv'd,
has its Figures as well as our other
Paſſions. In the mildeſt and moſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
converſation, though no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
be found in the Mind of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with whom we diſcourſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hinders but that for the better
explication we may repeat ſometimes
the ſame Words, and make uſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Expreſſions, to ſay the ſame
thing. It is permitted to make exact
Deſcriptions, to ſearch for Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Images of what we ſay, among
natural and ſenſible things. We may
demand the Judgment of our Auditors,
and interrogate them, to fix and retain
their Minds in more ſerious attention,
and make our reflexions upon what they
have ſaid. Thus has Converſation its
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50222:82"/>
Figures, as well as Speeches, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.</p>
                  <p>The Stile of an Orator, who makes
ill uſe of his Figures, is term'd a cold
Stile, becauſe whatever effort he makes
to animate his Auditors, they hearken
but coldly, and that coldneſs is ſo much
the greater, becauſe the Hearers are not
agitated by any of thoſe Emotions
which he deſir'd to excite.</p>

                  <p>THe Rules which we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
given, in relation to
the <hi>Art of Speaking,</hi> regard
only the manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
our Thoughts, which are the Soul
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50222:83"/>
of Diſcourſe. Letters that compoſe
the Words, by their reſemblance, are
the Body of Diſcourſe, as we have ſaid
before. We muſt take pains now to
form this Body, that is to ſay, to range
the Words in ſuch ſort, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of them may be eaſie and
agreeable at the ſame time. To treat
of this matter with entire exactneſs,
we ought ſeriouſly to conſider the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Movements of the Organs of
the Voice, to determin the formation
of every Sound that is made by every
Letter. But, beſides that this exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would be troubleſome, every Man
may apprehend theſe things without
the aſſiſtance of a Maſter, by obſerving
with little attention what is performed
by the Organs of which we make uſe
when we ſpeak. I ſhall therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
my ſelf upon theſe things only in
a general manner.</p>
                  <p>We know already how the Voice
is form'd. The Air which comes forth
of the Lungs, excites a Sound paſſing
with conſtraint through the <hi>Larynx,</hi> or
the opening of the Pipe of the <hi>Aſpera
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50222:83"/>
Arteria,</hi> which reaches to the Throat.
This opening is greater or leſſer by
means of Muſcles that inviron it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as there is occaſion for the
raiſing or letting fall of the Voice.
This Sound is receiv'd out of the Throat
into the Mouth; where it is modified
in different manners, by the different
diſpoſitions of the place which receives
it, and by the Motion of the Tongue
which beats it againſt ſeveral parts of
the Mouth. Every Sound has been
mark'd by a Letter: Letters compoſe
Words; in ſuch ſort, that it is poſſible
to make an Engin ſpeak, if having
obſerv'd the particular diſpoſition of the
Organs of the Voice (which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the formation of each Letter)
we ſhould make as many Pipes as there
are Letters, and give them the ſame
diſpoſitions. It is poſſible likewiſe to
make a dumb Man ſpeak, by repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to his Eyes the diſpoſitions and
poſtures which the Organs of the Voice
do aſſume for the ſounding of each Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of which at the ſame time they
are to ſhow them a Character, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50222:84"/>
reiterate the pronunciation, 'till he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the Motions of the Tongue, the
Opening of the Mouth, how the Sound
is cut by the Teeth, how the Lips beat
one againſt the other, and imitate them.
Commonly people are dumb only becauſe
they cannot hear, and therefore they
cannot learn to pronounce the Sound
of a Letter otherwiſe than by this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
which teaches them that by the
Eye, of which they are not capable
by the Ear. Monſieur <hi>de Monconys</hi>
reports, that in his Travels in <hi>England,</hi>
there was an Excellent Mathematician
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who made a dumb Man read
in his preſence; and that that dumb
Man was the ſecond which he had
taught to ſpeak by that Method. 'Tis
true, he only call'd over the Letters by
their Names, but knew not how to
make any conjunction of their Sounds.</p>
                  <p>The Letters are diſtinguiſh'd into
Vowels and Conſonants: Some have
obſerv'd, that Vowels are made only
by moving the root of the Tongue;
others will have their Sound form'd by
the different opening of the Mouth.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50222:84"/>
The Vowels are five, <hi>A, E, I, O, U.</hi>
In pronouncing them, we muſt ſtop
ſome time to make them ſound, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they will not be eaſily underſtood;
according to the meaſure or quantity
of time, they are ſaid to be long or
ſhort, or too long or too ſhort, and
receive different Names. It depends
upon him that ſpeaks to ſtop a longer
or ſhorter time upon the Vowels, and
ſo to make what difference betwixt
them he pleaſes, and therefore it is,
that their Number is not the ſame in
all Languages. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> have thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Vowels; the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſeven; the
<hi>French</hi> pronounce their Vowels in equal
time, ſo that they are not ſubject to
that difference which the different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of time may produce among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but they diſtinguiſh them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. When the Mouth is open'd
more than ordinarily, the Sound is
ſtronger, and more clear; when the
Mouth is not open'd ſo much, the Sound
is weaker, and leſs clear. Theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degrees of force, cauſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt an <hi>E</hi> Maſculine and an <hi>E</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:50222:85"/>
Feminine; betwixt an <hi>I</hi> and an <hi>U.</hi>
When we joyn the Sounds of two
Vowels, and a third Sound is produc'd,
that is it which we call a <hi>Dipthong,</hi>
which is as much as a Letter with two
Sounds.</p>
                  <p>Conſonants cannot be pronounced,
but by ſounding a Vowel, and from
thence they are called Conſonants.
Theſe Letters are formed by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Tongue beating the Voice
againſt the Throat, and from thence
againſt the Palat. As the Tongue
contracting it ſelf, ſtops the Air that
forms the Voice; or as it relaxes and
and ſuffers it to paſs, ſtriking upon
the Teeth; and the Lips beating one
upon another, it gives the Sounds of
different Conſonants. From whence,
among the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Grammarians, their
Conſonants are diſtinguiſh'd into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants
of the Lips, of the Teeth, of
the Throat, and of the Palat. The
ſimple Conſonants are twelve, <hi>B, C,
D, F, G, L, M, N, P, R, S, T;</hi> to which
we might add <hi>J</hi> and <hi>V,</hi> when pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
as Conſonants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:50222:85"/>
That which makes in the Alphabets
of ſome Languages a greater Number
of Conſonants, is firſt, becauſe People
joyn the Sound of ſeveral Conſonants
in ſuch manner, that though they be
nam'd double, yet only one of their
Sounds is heard: As in <hi>Z</hi> and <hi>X, Z</hi>
is as much as <hi>D</hi> and <hi>S, X</hi> is as much
as <hi>C</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> This Conjunction aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the Alphabets with a great
number of different Conſonants. All
Languages have not an equal number
of theſe double Letters, in which one
of the Conſonants being pronounc'd
faintly, cauſes the Sounds of them
both to be confounded, ſo that but
one of them is heard. In the ſecond
place, when we pronounce the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants
with Aſpiration, we change
their Sound, and that change forms
quite different Letters. Aſpiration is
made, when we ſtrike the Voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Throats with ſome kind of
force. This Aſpiration is mark'd with
an <hi>H.</hi> Among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> an Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
added to their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> makes their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
which is as much as <hi>Ph</hi> with us: An
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50222:86"/>
Aſpiration joyn'd with their K makes
their X, and is as much as our <hi>Ch.</hi>
This Obſervation makes us compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
why in ſome Languages one
Letter has ſo many different kinds (if
I may ſo call them) for example, the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> have four ſorts of <hi>S:</hi> The
Aſpiration may be made with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degrees: Wherefore to mark by
particular Characters the differences of
the pronunciation, we muſt imploy as
many different Characters.</p>
                  <p>When the Voice is carried up to
the Noſe, it receives a certain diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
So that if we ſhould be to
treat of all Letters that might be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
as there are Letters of the
Throat, there ſhould be Letters of
the Noſe. Cuſtom exerciſes its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over Letters, as well as over
the Body of Diſcourſe, of which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are the Members. It depended
upon Men to chuſe among the Sounds
of the Voice (which might be infinite
in number) thoſe that ſhould be moſt
pleaſing and commodious; for which
Cauſe, there are Letters in uſe in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50222:86"/>
ſome Languages, that are not uſed in
others.</p>
                  <p>Some Nations there are, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
by one ſingle Letter ſeveral
Sounds; others on the contrary mark
the ſame Sound by different Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
and have ſeveral Letters that
might be ſpared: Among the <hi>Latins</hi>
the <hi>K</hi> or the <hi>Q</hi> might be ſpar'd, as
is obſerv'd by <hi>Marius Victorinus,</hi> who
has treated of that matter very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly.
This is it that has produced
ſo much difference in the Alphabets
of Languages both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.
It is not neceſſary I obſerve,
that the Tones of the Voice, and the
divers inflexions wherewith the ſame
Letters may be pronounced, may
change their pronunciation; That
there are Letters of which the Sound
is not diſtinct, if we are not careful
to joyn them with ſuch as have ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
with them. I paſs over ſuch
things as are commonly regarded as
trifles; nevertheleſs the knowledge of
them, though their Object be ſmall,
is in ſome meaſure neceſſary: Order

the neceſſity of eating to be agreeable:

that God has joyn'd uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50222:87"/>
and pleaſure together, is this,
becauſe all Victual that conduces to

                  <p>This ſeaſoning of Neceſſity with
Delight, is to be found in the Uſe
of Speech. There is a ſtrange ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
betwixt the Voice of thoſe
who ſpeak, and the Ears of thoſe who
hear: Words that are ſpoken with
pain, are offenſive to the Hearer.
The Organs of the Ear are diſpos'd
in ſuch ſort, that they are offended
by a pronunciation that grates upon
the Organs of the Voice. A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
cannot be pleaſant to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
that is not eaſie to the Speaker;
nor can it be eaſily pronounc'd, unleſs
it be heard with delight.</p>
                  <p>We feed with more appetite upon
wholſom and reliſhable Meats: We
liſten more eaſily to a Diſcourſe,
whoſe ſmoothneſs leſſens the trouble
of attending. It is with Sciences as
with Meats: We muſt endeavour to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50222:88"/>
make thoſe things pleaſant, that are
uſeful. <hi>Quoniam nonnullam inter ſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent

                  <p>Pleaſure goes far with every Man,
'tis that which is the Principal of all
our Motions, and ſets them on work.
Prudence requires that we make uſe
of this inclination to conduct us to
our deſign'd end; that we delight the
Ears, which being the Porters of the
Mind, may give our words the more
favourable admiſſion. Beſides, the
pleaſure which we give in Speaking,
is preceded by our own proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
becauſe the eaſe of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
cauſes the ſatisfaction of the
Hearer. Let us then endeavour firſt
to diſcover what is to be avoided in
the ranging of our Words; what
faults may be committed in it; what
makes their pronunciation difficult.
The firſt ſtep to Wiſdom, is to diſclaim
Vice: <hi>Sapientia prima, ſtultitiâ caruiſſe:</hi>
Beſides, in what relates to the Senſe,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50222:88"/>
every thing is agreeable that is not
offenſive. <hi>Id omne delectat, quod non
offendit,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the Letters, ſome are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
with eaſe, others with pain:
Thoſe whoſe pronunciation is eaſy,
have an agreeable ſound; thoſe which
are pronounced with difficulty, do
grate upon the ear. Conſonants are
pronounc'd with more difficulty than
Vowels, and therefore their ſound is
leſs ſoft and fluent. It is convenient
to temper the harſhneſs of the one by
the ſweetneſs of the other, and that
is to be done by placing the Vowels
betwixt the Conſonants, that there
may not be too many of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This harſhneſs ariſing from the
concourſe of Conſonants is obvious
in the Northern Languages. Dutch
and Engliſh are very unpleaſant to
them whoſe ears have not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to thoſe Languages.</p>
                  <p>Cuſtome takes off this harſhneſs
from words, or at leaſt makes us not
ſo ſenſible of it: Nevertheleſs it
is obſerv'd, that according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
degrees of the peoples inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50222:89"/>
to delicacy, their words are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of Letters more or leſs ſoft;
they having had leſs regard to follow
reaſon, than to tickle their ears. In
reſpect of this ſoftneſs of pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
the Romans uſed <hi>aufero</hi> for
<hi>abfero, colloco</hi> for <hi>cumloco,</hi> as analogy
oblig'd them to ſpeak. Analogy has
remitted of its rights in favour to the
ſoftneſs of pronunciation; <hi>Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
eſt a Conſuetudine ut ſuavitatis
cauſa peccare liceret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Conſonants have their aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
or are pronounc'd in a quite
contrary manner, we are more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
oblig'd to avoid their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
There are Conſonants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
with the mouth ſhut, as <hi>P.</hi>
There are others to be pronounc'd
with the mouth open, as <hi>C. &amp;c.</hi> Theſe
Conſonants cannot march together;
they do not agree, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be pronounc'd one after the other
immediately, without ſome kind of
difficulty; becauſe we are forced (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
at the ſame time) to diſpoſe the
Organs of pronunciation in ſeveral
different faſhions.</p>
                  <p>

A ſecond error into which they fall
who range their diſcourſe with negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
is the concourſe of two or more
Vowels. This concourſe of Vowels
is unpleaſing for a reaſon quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what has been given for the
harſhneſs of the concourſe of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.
Conſonants are pronounc'd
with pain, Vowels with eaſe; but this
great facility accompanied with great
ſwiftneſs, is the cauſe that their ſounds
are not ſo diſtinguiſhable, but that for
the moſt part one of them is loſt; by
which means there is a kind of <hi>vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
in the pronunciation, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it unpleaſing. In pronouncing
many Vowels ſucceſſively, it happens
with us as if we were walking upon
poliſh'd Marble, the too great ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is troubleſome; it cauſes us to
ſlip, and 'tis hard for us to keep upon
our legs. In pronouncing theſe two
words in French <hi>Hardi Ecuyer;</hi> or in
Latin theſe, <hi>ni interſiſtat &amp; laboret
animus,</hi> unleſs we ſtop for ſome time
at the words <hi>Hardi,</hi> or <hi>ni,</hi> the ſound
of the firſt Vowels will be confounded
with that which begins the following
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50222:90"/>
words, and create an uneaſineſs to the
ear, as not being able to diſtinguiſh
clearly the two different ſounds.</p>
                  <p>To prevent this concourſe, we either
retrench one of the Vowels that are
found together, or we put in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to fill up that void ſpace which
would happen without this artifice;
for this reaſon they ſay in French, <hi>qu'il
fit,</hi> for <hi>que il fit; a-t-il fait,</hi> for <hi>a il
fait; fera-t-il,</hi> for <hi>fera il.</hi> When one
of the Vowels has a ſound ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make it ſelf diſtinguiſh'd,
this artifice is uſeleſs. This care of
ranking of words ought to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſquiet: We are not to conſider
as material faults, the failings in this
part of the Art of Speaking. <hi>Non id
ut crimen ingens expaveſcendum est,

                  <p>I know not whether neglect or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude

repoſe: We may commit three faults
in ill-placing the repoſe of the voice.</head>
                  <p>THE neceſſity of taking breath,
obliges to interrupt the courſe
or our pronunciation, and the deſire
of explaining our ſelves diſtinctly, is
the cauſe that we chooſe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of our voice the end of every
ſentence, to diſtinguiſh by theſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
the different things of which we
ſpeak. Two faults may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by ill-diſtribution of theſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.
If the expreſſions of each Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be too ſhort, and by conſequence
the pronunciation often interrupted,
this interruption leſſening the force of
the voice, and cauſing it to fall, the
mind of the Reader (that ought to be
kept in breath) relaxes, and his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
abates. There is nothing that
more cools the heat of an action, than
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50222:91"/>
to diſcontinue it with too many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
Labour makes the mind vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
and attentive; Idleneſs makes
it drowſy and ſtupid. <hi>Fit attentior ex
difficultate,</hi> S. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When our thoughts are delivered
too ſhort, and the mind of the Reader
is obliged to attend ſometime to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, this retardment keeps him
in breath, and rendring him more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive,
gives him a better conception
of the ſenſe of our diſcourſe. We have
ſaid in the firſt Book, that for this
reaſon the Romans rejected at the end
of the ſentence ſome word upon which
the underſtanding of the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended:
But without this tranſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſubverſion of the natural or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it ſuffices to hinder that our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
be not often interrupted,
to make choice of ſuch copious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
as may comprehend a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
number of words; or elſe it is
neceſſary that the things expreſſed be
ſo link'd together, that the firſt may
excite the deſire of underſtanding the
latter, and that the voice repoſe after
every ſenſe in ſuch manner, that we
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50222:91"/>
may perceive it has ſtill farther to go.</p>
                  <p>When a thought is expreſſed by
too great number of words, we fall
into another extream, commonly we
continue the actions we have begun;
ſo the voice not repoſing till it comes
to the end of the ſenſe of which it
has begun to pronounce the expreſſion,
if the ſenſe comprehends many things,
the long ſucceſſion of words to which
it is link'd, heats the lungs, and ſpends
the ſpirits; the pronunciation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious
and unpleaſant both to
ſpeaker and hearer.</p>
                  <p>One of the greateſt difficulties in
Rhetorick is to keep a Mean, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
theſe two Extreams. Thoſe who
ſpeak without art, and have but a
weak <hi>genius,</hi> fall commonly into the
firſt errot; they can hardly ſpeak four
words that will hang together; every
ſentence ends as ſoon as it begins. We
hear nothing but <hi>for, to conclude, after
that, ſaid he,</hi> and other ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
brought in only to patch up the
incoherence of the words. There is
no fault in Diſcourſe ſo contemptible
and inſupportable as this. Thoſe who
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50222:92"/>
would exceed, run into another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme.
The firſt proceed as if they
were lame, the other by leaps. For
fear of debaſing their ſtyle, they exalt
it too high: They make uſe of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Bombaſt, <hi>Seſquipedalia ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba;</hi>
and phraſes long enough to take
away a mans breath.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſy to abridg, or lengthen a
Sentence: We may link two or more
conceits together, make them but one,
and ſo continue the Diſcourſe by a long
<hi>ſeries</hi> of words that make but one
ſenſe. There is no need of repairing
to hollow and empty phraſes, or to
blow up our diſcourſe with vain
words. On the contrary, if a ſentence
contains too many things that require
great numbers of words, 'tis eaſy to
contract the ſenſe of that ſentence, to
ſeparate the ſaid things, and to ſignify
them by ſelect expreſſions, which may
be by conſequence more ſhort and
conciſe than that which expreſſed the
whole body of the ſentence.</p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe commit a third
fault againſt the juſt diſtribution of
the repoſe of the voice. In beginning
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50222:92"/>
a ſentence, when we lift up our voice
inſenſibly, the Greeks call it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and
at the end of a ſentence when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it, it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> The ear
judges of the length of a phraſe by
the elevation of the voice, if that be
loud, it makes us expect many words;
if the expected words do not follow,
the defect deceives them, and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
as well to the ſpeaker as hearer.
It is hard to ſtop in the midſt of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer:
When in the dark we are got to
the higheſt ſtep of a pair of ſtairs
without perceiving it, and we believe
we may go ſtill higher, the firſt ſtep
we make afterwards diſcompoſes us,
and we are in as much diſorder as if
the board ſlip'd from under our feet:
All the expletive particles in French,
as <hi>pas point, &amp;c.</hi> have been found out
to ſupply the place of words which
the ear expected. The Greeks have
great number of theſe particles, which
have no other uſe but to lengthen a
Diſcourſe, and keep it from falling too
ſuddenly: If the ear be offended
with the length of a Diſcourſe, all the
words unexpected are importunate.

                  <p>The moſt of the faults of which
I have ſpoken, we avoid to render our
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50222:94"/>
Diſcourſe equal and ſmooth. 'Tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
to walk in an uneven way; an
unequal Diſcourſe cannot be carried
on without trouble: Pronunciation
is incommodious and importunate,
when without any proportion we
ſometimes advance, ſometimes depreſs
our voice, and paſs from one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to another. The words, the ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables,
which enter into the compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Diſcourſe, have different ſounds;
the ſound of ſome is clear, the ſound
of others is obſcure: One fills the
mouth, another is pronounced with
a feeble tone. All do not require the
ſame diſpoſition of the organs of the
voice, and that inequality cauſes the
different pronnciations. To ſupport a
Diſcourſe, and render it equal, we muſt
help the cadence of a weak word, with
another that carries a ſtronger pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation;
and on the contrary, tempering
the force of one word by the gentlenes
of another, order it ſo, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
words diſpoſe the voice to the
pronunciation of the ſubſequent, that
the voice may fall by degrees.</p>
                  <p>I might add other Precepts, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50222:94"/>
what I have ſaid is ſufficient for their

upon thoſe things which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be conſidered in the ranging of

only, profit to be drawn from theſe
Precepts, is that they make us regard
ſeveral things, which perhaps would
not otherwiſe occur to our thoughts.
And farther to perſwade you of the
uſefulneſs of theſe Precepts about the
diſpoſition of Words, obſerve I pray,
that the <hi>Anomala,</hi> or irregularities
crept into ſeveral Languages, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to avoid thoſe Faults which

of thoſe multitude of pricks which

of the different long and ſhort Points
which are chang'd according to the

There is not a ſenſe that we can want

                  <p>THeſe Conditions are neceſſary to
all Sounds to make them agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
whether it be to the ſounds of the
Voice, or of Inſtruments; yet I have
deſign'd to ſpeak only of the Sounds
of Humane Voices, which I diſtinguiſh
into two ſorts, Forc'd, and Natural.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50222:100"/>
The forc'd Voice is uſed in Singing,
when the Air that makes the ſound is
forc'd with violence from the Lungs.
The Natural Voice is that which we
uſe when we ſpeak, it is form'd with
eaſe, and wearies not the Organs like
the other. What I ſhall ſay hereafter
in this Treatiſe, relates only to the
Natural Voice. Let us ſee now how
we may make the Sounds or Words
have ſuch conditions as may render
them agreeable to the Ear.</p>
                  <p>We may without much difficulty
range our Diſcourſe in ſuch manner,
that the pronunciation be neither too
violent nor ſaint; that it be moderate
and diſtinct, and that our Diſcourſe by
conſequence have the two firſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The firſt Chapter has been
ſpent intirely in inſtructing what is to
be done, and what to be avoided, that
our Diſcourſe may not grate upon the
ear, but be heard diſtinctly. We have
ſhown how carefully we are to avoid
the concurrence of two ruff Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents;
How we are to fill up the void
ſpaces betwixt words where the courſe
of the pronuntiation would be ſtop'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:50222:101"/>
With what prudence we are to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the rufneſs of ſome Syllables
with the ſoftneſs of others; in a
word, how we may equal the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,
and ſuſtain the ſound of
weak Letters, by aſſociating them with
ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>The Four other Conditions may be
found in different manners in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
The Ear perceives ſeveral
things in pronunciation, beſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s the
ſound of the Letters. Firſt, it judges of
the meaſure of time in which each
Letter, each Syllable, each Word, each
expreſſion, is pronounc'd. Next, it
judges of the Elevations and Depreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Voice, by which in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
each word, each expreſſion, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.
In the third place the
Ear obſerves the ſilence or repoſe of
the Voice at the end of Words or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
when we joyn or ſeparate
words: when we cut off a Vowel, and
ſeveral other things compriz'd under
the name of Accents, the knowledg
of which is abſolutely neceſſary for
pronunciation. Theſe accents may be
very numerous: There are more than
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50222:101"/>
thirty of them in the Hebrew Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.
If you will believe <hi>Servius Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratus</hi>
there are eight among the
Latins. The <hi>Sharp</hi> figured thus (´)
which ſhows when the Voice is to be
raiſed. The <hi>Grave</hi> (`) when it is to be

which ſhows that the Voice is to ſtop
upon the Vowel that has that mark:
The <hi>Short</hi> which ſhows that the time

the <hi>Hyphen</hi> or <hi>Conjunction</hi> that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys

<hi>Male-ſanus.</hi> The <hi>Diaſtole</hi> or <hi>Diviſion,</hi>
(,) which ſhows they are to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;
the <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> (') which
ſhows there is a Vowel to be rejected.
The <hi>Diaſtole</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> have
the ſame mark, with this difference,
that in the <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> it is plac'd at

                  </p>
                  <p>But we may order it ſo that the
Ear may receive all theſe with delight,
by obſerving the four conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50222:102"/>
diſpoſing (for example) our
words with ſuch Artifice, that the
Meaſures of the time of our pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation

the Voice or intervals of Reſpiration
be ſuitable; that the Voice be rais'd

may joyn Equality with Variety, by
making ſeveral of thoſe conjoyn'd
meaſures to be equal, though the parts

what is pleaſing to the Ear; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to reflect upon this Maxim,
that the moſt agreeable things are
diſagreeable in ſeveral caſes. Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
is not at at all times ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
working and playing are not to
be uſed together; we never ſtep in
meaſure, when we follow our affairs.
When we are ſimply to diſcover our
thoughts, when we are only to make
the people ſenſible what we have in
our minds: a man of judgment will
not alwayes trouble himſelf to conſider
exactly, and meaſure his words, nor
take the pains to place preciſely the
pauſes of his Pronunciation. Pleaſure
is not pleaſure but where it is deſir'd;
if it comes unſeaſonably, it diſpleaſes,

                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:50222:103"/>
Diſcourſe then is to be diſtinguiſh'd
into two Kinds, Natural and Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
Natural Diſcourſe is that which is
us'd in Converſation to expreſs our
ſelves, to inſtruct and ſignifie the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our Will, and the thoughts of
our Mind. Artificial Diſcourſe is uſed
to pleaſe, and with all poſſible art (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Natural and Familiar way)
to charm and allure our Auditors. In
Natural Diſcourſe, it is ſufficient if we
obſerve exactly what has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
in the firſt Chapter of this
Book, not but that Art may be call'd
in ſometimes to our aſſiſtance: Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of natural Diſcourſe are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſo auſtere, but they may admit
of ſome little Divertiſement.</p>
                  <p>No man is ignorant of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Verſe and Proſe; it is
ſufficiently manifeſt, the Diſcourſe
that is tyed up to the ſtrict Rules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
Verſification, is far from a free Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
as that is which we uſe when
we talk naturally and without art.
For this reaſon Diſcourſes in Verſe are
call'd particularly artificial. We are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50222:103"/>
oblig'd to begin this Art of which we
are treating, by ſhowing how we may
give to free and natural Diſcourſe,
(that is to ſay to Proſe) the conditions
that render Sounds agreeable, without
intrenching upon its liberty. After
which, in order we ſhall come to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Diſcourſe, as <hi>Verſe, &amp;c.</hi> This
Art in Proſe is reducible to two
things, either to render our Proſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical,
or Figurative. Let us ſee now

ſtop commonly at the end of every

of the Voice may ſerve to render our
Diſcourſe more clear, and give us
power to re-aſſume new force for the
continuation of our Speech. The Voice

                  <head type="sub">The Compoſition of Periods.</head>
                  <p>TO compoſe a Period, or (which is
the ſame thing) to expreſs a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50222:105"/>
Sentence that is compos'd of two or
more ſeveral Sences, with ſuch art,
that the expreſſions in the ſaid Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
may have the Conditions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to pleaſe the Ear; we muſt firſt
provide that the expreſſions be not too
long, and that the whole Period be
proportion'd to the breath of him
who is to pronounce it. We muſt
have an eye to all contain'd in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that we would comprize in one
Period: We may make choice of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
cloſe, or extended; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench,
or add, as we find convenient,
to give it a juſt length: But we muſt
have a care not to inſert Periods that
are uſeleſs and weak to fill up Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's,
and compleat the Cadence of the
Period. <hi>Inania Complementa, &amp; ramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
numerorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The expreſſions of particular ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that are Members of the Body of
a Sentence, ought to be equal, that the
Voice may repoſe at the end of theſe
Members by equal Intervals. The
more this Equality is exact, the more
it is pleaſant; as we may ſee in this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50222:106"/>
example. <hi>Haec eſt enim non facta, ſed
nata lex; quam non didicimus, accepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
legimus, verum ex Natura ipſa
arripuimus, hauſimus, expreſſimus: ad
quam non docti, ſed facti; non inſtituti,
ſed imbuti ſumus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. A Period ought to conſiſt at leaſt
of two Members, and at moſt but of
Four: A Period is to have at leaſt two
Members, becauſe its Beauty proceeds
from the equality of the Members, and
equality ſuppoſes at leaſt two termes.
The Maſters of this Art would not
have four Members crowded into one
period, becauſe being too long, the
pronunciation muſt be forc'd, which
muſt by conſequence be diſpleaſing to
the Ear, becauſe a Diſcourſe that is
incommodious to the Speaker can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be agreeable to the hearer.</p>
                  <p>4. The Members of a Period ought
to be joynd cloſe, that the ear may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the equality of the Intervals of
Reſpiration: For this cauſe the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a Period ought to be united
by the union of a ſingle Sentence, of
the body of which they are Members.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50222:106"/>
This union is very diſcernable, for
the Voice repoſes at the end of every
Member, only the better to continue
its courſe: It ſtops not quite, but at
the end of the whole Sentence. A Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
like a Circle, incompaſſes and
incloſes the whole ſence of a Sentence,
and cauſes the ear with eaſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the diſtinction or union of its
Members.</p>
                  <p>5. The Voice is elevated or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
in each Member: The two
parts where the inflexions are made,
ought to be equal, that the degrees of
Elevation and Depreſſion may corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond.
In pronouncing an entire Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
we raiſe our Voice to the middle
of the Sentence, and let it fall gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
afterward. The two parts call'd
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, muſt correſpond
by their Equality.</p>
                  <p>6. Variety may be in a Period two
wayes: In the ſenſe, and in the words.
The ſenſe of each Member of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
ought to differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
In Diſcourſe variety falls in of
it ſelf. We cannot expreſs the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
thoughts of our mind, but by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50222:107"/>
different words of different ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But a Period may be compos'd
of two Members, of three Members,
and ſometimes of four Members. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Periods are not to follow one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
too near; it is beſt when Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
flows with moſt liberty: The
exact and preciſe equality of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals

troubleſome.</p>

This reaſon obliges an Orator
to ſpeak Periodically. Periods main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Diſcourſe, and are pronounc'd
with certain Majeſty that gives weight

that this majeſty is unſeaſonable when
it follows the motions of Paſſion,
whoſe precipitation ſuffers not any
regular way of ranging, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
our words. A Diſcourſe equally
periodical cannot be pronounc'd but
coldly, Paſſion admits not of Rules;
Periods (as I ſay'd before) are not

Authority, or delight the Ear. We

when we ſpeak naturally, the paſſion

traced at leiſure by a mind that is
quiet. The firſt are made by ſally's;
they are violent, they are ſtrong, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

that oppoſes the truth: Thoſe of
which we are ſpeaking are without
that force, and unfit for any thing but
Diverſion. I ſpeak of thoſe that are

We have ſhown in the firſt Chapter,
that the repetition of the ſame word,
the ſame letter, or the ſame ſound, is
unpleaſant: But we have obſerv'd
in the Second Chapter that when that
repetition is made with art, it is not
ungrateful to the ear. In ſhort, the moſt
diſagreeable ſounds are pleaſing when
deliver'd with fit Intervals. The noiſe
of a Hammer is unpleaſant, yet when
the Smith ſtrikes upon his Anvil with
proportion, it makes a kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
that is pleaſing to the Ear. We
cannot repeat a ſound, a letter, or word,
but it makes our Diſcourſe figurative;
The Art of Figures conſiſts in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of a letter; of the ſame ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
of the ſame word, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionated
time, and equality of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval,
ſometime in the beginning,
ſometime in the end, and ſometime in

                  <p>Figures may be infinite, becauſe the

ſufficient to give ſome examples of
them. Expreſſions figured in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may be valued for the ſenſe which
they contain; but 'tis evident that
theſe Figures of themſelves are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
but of moderate eſteem. The art
of making them is very obvious, and
indeed too groſs: Our Language is
natural, and loves them not, and the
beſt of our Authors avoid them with
more care than others affect them.
They will ſcarce entertain them when
they fall in of themſelves, and ſeem to
come by chance. Meaner Wits are
fond of theſe Figures, this feeble arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
being commenſurate to their
ſtrength, and conformable to their

Let us try then what we can ſay

                  <p>We compare all theſe Figures to
the Knots and Figures of a Garden:
As they are pleaſing to the eye by
their variety, and order with which
they are ingeniouſly diſpos'd; ſo the
ſounds and words of a Diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
figured as we have directed, are
as agreeable to the ear. Reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
thoſe Figures when they are not
too much affected, and fall in as it
were by accident. They may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be compar'd to the Figures upon

A Traveller tires himſelf
ſometimes in the contemplation of a
ſhell, or a Flower. A melancholly
Reader is reviv'd by this Figurative
diſpoſition of words; the Figures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
his attention, and thoſe little
Artifices do not diſpleaſe him. Some of
theſe Figures I have obſerv'd in Holy
Writ, and particularly in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the
moſt eloquent of all the Prophets.
The Fathers uſed them, either in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
to that Age which delighted
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50222:112"/>
in them, or becauſe a Sentence is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
retain'd that runs with a Cadence.
But continually to affect them is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great fault. I know not how it
comes about that men have ſo much
eſteem for ſome Authors that are full
of thoſe Affectations: I cannot think
it a ſign of great Wit to ſpend whole
dayes in ranking their words with an
inconſiderable exactneſs. A Diſcourſe
with this Artifice does not affect, nor
make impreſſion upon a ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
it takes only with thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

only to ſuch Authors as are

ſome time upon every Syllable,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50222:112"/>
to make it diſtinct and intelligible.
Our preſent Diſquiſition is about the
Meaſure of Time in matter of Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation;
how to proportion it, and
give it the conditions requiſite to ſuch
things as the Ear perceives in pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.
The manner of Pronouncing
is not the ſame in all Countrys. The
pronunciation of the preſent Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in <hi>Europe,</hi> is different from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of the antient Languages as
<hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew.</hi> In the
preſent Languages we ſtop equally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Syllables, and the time in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
all the <hi>Vowels</hi> is the ſame.
In antient Languages the Vowels are
diſtinguiſh'd by difference of time.
Some are call'd long, becauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in longer time; others are
call'd ſhort becauſe their pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is quicker.</p>
                  <p>We ought not to imagine that we
pronounce at this day the <hi>Greek</hi> and
the <hi>Latin,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>
did of old. In their Diſcourſe they
diſtinguiſh'd the quantity of every
<hi>Vowel.</hi> We, when we pronounce a
Latin word, obſerve only the time of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50222:113"/>
the laſt <hi>Vowel</hi> but one. Though the
laſt <hi>Vowel</hi> be ſhort, we pronounce it
as if it were long. Yet Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>
tells us, that whoever in reading this

the ears of the <hi>Romans</hi> in Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>'s

                  <p>We call <hi>Meaſure</hi> a certain number

that the Artifice of the ſtructure

betwixt them, that their Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and Equality may be united in the
Meaſures.</p>
                  <p>4. This Alliance of Equality and
Variety cannot be diſtinguiſhable in
the Meaſures if they be not joyn'd
one with the other. It is neceſſary
therefore that the ear hears them both
together; that it compares them; and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50222:114"/>
that in the compariſon it perceives
the equality that they have in their
difference.</p>
                  <p>The pronunciation of Languages
being different, the ſtructure of Verſe
cannot be the ſame in all Languages:
All their difference nevertheleſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible

becauſe in theſe latter Languages
they pronounce all the Syllables e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually,

                     <p>It is clear, and without diſpute, a

be both ſhort, becauſe they would

So a Meaſure compos'd of Four long

                     <p>Theſe Rules give us to underſtand

                  <p>WHen two Syllables are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
in equal time, the
quantity or time of the ſayd Syllables
are reckon'd to be equal. This Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is found betwixt two Syllables,
and a third, when in the ſame time
that one of the ſayd Syllables is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
we have leaſure to pronounce
the other two. We ſay that the time of
one ſyllable is either the double or
treble of the time of a ſecond ſyllable,
if in the time that we pronounce the one
the other may be pronounc'd in the
ſame ſpace of time twice or thrice:
ſo the quantity of a long Syllable is
double the time of a ſhort. When the
time of the pronunciation of two Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables
can be meaſured by a preciſe
meaſure, and the time of the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of the one is double to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50222:118"/>
time of pronunciation of the other, the
proportion prevents confuſion, and
makes the Ear perceive diſtinctly the
quantity of the ſaid Syllables; for
which reaſon it muſt neceſſarily
pleaſe, ſeeing the Equality (as we
have ſayd before) is agreeable only
becauſe it renders Sounds diſtinct, and
takes away confuſion. There is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Meaſure or Foot an Elevation, and
a Relaxation. <hi>Pes habet elationem &amp;
poſitionem.</hi> To the end therefore that
Equality may be kept, the time of
Elevation ought to be equal to the
time of Relaxation. In a <hi>Spondaeus,</hi> the
time of Relaxation, and Elevation
perfectly equal, becauſe the Foot is
compos'd of two long Syllables. It is
the ſame in the <hi>Dactylus</hi> and <hi>Anapae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi>
the time of the two ſhort Syllables
being equal to the time of a long
Syllable. In the <hi>Trochaeus</hi> and the <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
the equality is not ſo exact, for
the difference betwixt a long Syllable
and a ſhort is not ſo diſtinguiſhible as
to offend the Ear.</p>
                  <p>This is to be obſerv'd; a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſilence is equivalent at leaſt to a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50222:118"/>
ſhort quantity. So a <hi>Trochaeus</hi> is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to a <hi>Spondaeus</hi> or a <hi>Dactylus,</hi> if
after that Foot the voice repoſes and
ſtops, and then the time of Relaxation
is equal with the time of Elevation;
which is of importance to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
in anſwer to an Objection that
may be rais'd againſt what we have
ſayd, that a Meaſure or Foot does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily

mora,</hi> where the ſilence that follows a
long quantity, holds the place of a
ſhort, with that long quantity, it
makes a <hi>Trochaeus,</hi> which is a meaſure
of two Syllables.</p>
                  <p>In this we may ſee the grounds of
what we have ſayd before, that a foot
cannot be compos'd of more than two
long Syllables; for if the Elevation
or Relaxation comprehends the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenient
Syllable, there will be no
farther equality betwixt the two
parts. If this Syllable be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
in either of the two parts of
the meaſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> will add nothing to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50222:119"/>
the harmony, and by conſequence be
troubleſom. For this reaſon the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimacres,</hi>
and the <hi>Amphibrachus</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand in a Verſe, becauſe there
muſt be either a ſhort quantity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two long; or a long quantity
betwixt two ſhort; ſo that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
Syllable not being to be
joyn'd with either of the extremities,
but by troubling the Equality, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
uſeleſs, and interrupts the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
And yet theſe quantities may
be brought into an harmonious ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
the times of their Elevation and
Relaxation being proportionable. In
a foot of three long Syllables (which
we have call'd <hi>Moloſſus)</hi> the time of
Relaxation upon the two laſt long
Syllables, is double to the time of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
upon the firſt long Syllable, for
which reaſon the times are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and by conſequence may be
agreeable to the Ear as we have ſayd
before. So a Diſcourſe compos'd of
a mixture of thoſe feet, may be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious.
But in this caſe Verſe is
excluded, becauſe the harmony of
Verſe ought to be diſtinguiſhible,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50222:119"/>
which cannot be, if the equality of
the meaſures be not axactly obſerv'd.
In an <hi>Jambus</hi> and a <hi>Trochaeus</hi> this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
is not to be kept; but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt a ſhort quantity and
a long is not much diſcernible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a ſhort quantity is pronounc'd
quick. Whereas the inequality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the parts of a meaſure of three
long Syllables is very plain, being
much greater; for two long are as
much as four ſhort, V V V V, one
long, is to two long as to V V, and
one long is to one ſhort as to V. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorinus</hi>
tells us a ſhort is a quantity,
and therefore as <hi>Servius Honorius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
a <hi>Spondaeus</hi> has four times.</p>
                  <p>A meaſure is equal to another mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
when the time of their pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is equal. The <hi>Spondaeus,</hi> the
<hi>Dactylus,</hi> and the <hi>Anapaeſtus</hi> are of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
meaſures. <hi>Tempora elationis &amp;
poſitionis aequalia ſunt.</hi> The <hi>Trochaeus,</hi>
the <hi>Jambus,</hi> and the <hi>Tribrachus</hi> are
likewiſe of equal meaſures, for the
two ſhort of the three of a <hi>Tribra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
being equivalent to the one long,
that foot is equal to a <hi>Trochaeus,</hi> or an
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50222:120"/>
                     <hi>Jambus.</hi> The equality is not exactly
juſt betwixt a <hi>Spondaeus,</hi> or an <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;</hi>
but, as is ſayd, the difference
being ſmall, a verſe may be well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of the ſix ſort of Feet before

When the Voice has pronounc'd the

in the ſame manner with the Fourth.
Verſe without Sections do not appear
to be Verſe, becauſe (as we have ſayd)
the Equality of Meaſures that makes
the beauty of a Verſe, is not diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable,
unleſs they be joyn'd, and the

may read the following words, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50222:123"/>
not obſerve that they make a Verſe,
becauſe they want the aforeſaid Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                  <p>It remains now only that I ſpeak of

We have ſhown that it is the
equality of theſe Meaſures that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Ear, when the ſaid Meaſures
being preſented to it, it perceives the
equality by comparing them one
with another: But, as has been often
ſayd, all compariſon preſuppoſes at

Meaſures be too great, it is plain the
Ear that ought to conſider them all
together, will be overlay'd and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
with the greatneſs of their
number. Wherefore a Verſe is never
compos'd of above ſix great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
ſuch as the <hi>Sponde's</hi> and the
<hi>Dactyles.</hi> An <hi>Jambick</hi> is capable of
eight Feet, becauſe as aforeſayd, the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50222:123"/>

only at the end of a Sentence; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if a meaſure in <hi>French</hi> Poeſy
ſhould begin in the middle of one

another word, the Voice could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
by any inflexion, the ſayd
meaſure as it does in Latin. To put
diſtinction therefore betwixt the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and that the Ear may perceive
that diſtinction by Elevation of the
Voice at the beginning, and depreſſion
at the end, each meaſure ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50222:124"/>
a perfect ſenſe; which makes
the meaſure large, and ſo as a <hi>French</hi>
Verſe is ſeldom compos'd of above
two Meaſures, which parts it in two
equal parts, of which the firſt is call'd
<hi>Hemiſtick.</hi> So the meaſures of the
<hi>French</hi> Verſe are diſtinguiſh'd after a
natural way, for naturally and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any art we raiſe the Voice at the
beginning of an expreſſion with a
compleat ſenſe, and we let the Voice
fall naturally at the end of a compleat
ſenſe. The Equality of the meaſures
depends upon an equal number of
Vowels; in the <hi>French</hi> Language all
the Vowels are pronounc'd with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
time: It is evident, if two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
have an equal number of
Vowels, the times of their pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are equal.</p>
                  <p>The equality of two meaſures of
which every Verſe is compos'd, can
give but an indifferent pleaſure, ſo we
commonly joyn two Verſes together
which make four Meaſures: This
conjunction is made by the union of
the ſame ſenſe. To render this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
the more ſenſible, the Verſes
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50222:124"/>
which comprehend the ſame ſenſe, are
made to Rime, that is, to end both in
the ſame manner. Nothing is more
perceptible to the Ear, than the ſound
of words: So Rime that is nothing
but repetition of the ſame ſound, is
very proper for the better diſtinction
of the meaſures of Verſe. When upon
the declenſion of the Empire, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to give the ſame quantity to all
the Vowels, the Poets troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
no farther than for Rime, and
to equal the expreſſions which they
ended by thoſe Rimes. This way of
making Verſes is very ſimple, and
quickly tyreſom, unleſs we be careful

the richneſs and variety of our
thoughts, ſo as it may not be ſenſible
of their ſimplicity.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſhow in few words the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals

Voice in the beginning, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

theſe two Verſes are bound together
by the union of the ſame ſenſe, and by
the Rime. Beſides the equality of
time, we may obſerve that the equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the repoſe of the Voice (which
is repos'd in pronouncing our Verſe

to their beauty: I ſpeak not of the

                  <p>As among the Latins works are

Their Concourſe, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

an equal number of Vowels, ſome are
ruff, ſome ſweet, ſome fluent, others
languiſhing; wherefore to render the

our paſſions, we muſt know that
the motions of the mind, do follow
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50222:127"/>
the motions of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
as thoſe Spirits are ſlow or
quick, calm or turbulent, the mind
is affected with different Paſſions:
The leaſt force is able to obſtruct or
excite the Animal Spirits, their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is but ſmall; and their Levity
is the cauſe that the leaſt unuſual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
determines them; the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a ſound puts them in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Our Body is ſo diſpos'd, that a
ruff and boyſterous ſound forcing our
Spirits into the Muſcles, diſpoſes it to
flight, and begets an averſion, in the
ſame manner as a frightful Object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
horror by the eye. On the other
ſide a ſoft and moderate ſound, attracts
and invites our attention. If we ſpeak
lowd or haſtily to a Beaſt, it will run
from us; by ſpeaking gently, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
and make it tame. From whence
we may collect that diverſity of
Sounds do produce diverſity of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Animal Spirits.</p>
                  <p>Every motion that is made in the
Organs of Senſe, and communicated
to the Animal Spirits, is connext by
the God of Nature, to ſome certain
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50222:127"/>
motion of the Soul; Sound can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
paſſions, and we may ſay, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
paſſion anſwers to ſome ſound or
other; which is it, that excites in the
Animal Spirits, the motion wherewith
it is allyed. This Connexion is the
cauſe of our Sympathy with Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and that naturally, according to
the Tone of the Speaker, our Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is different. If a Tone be langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
and doleful, it inſpires ſadneſs;
if it be lowd and brisk, it begets viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and courage; ſome Ayres are
gay, and others Melancholly.</p>
                  <p>To diſcover the particular Cauſes
of this Sympathy, and explain how
among the numbers, ſome produce
ſadneſs, ſome joy, we ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the different motion of the Animal
Spirits in each of our Paſſions. It is
eaſy to be conceiv'd, that if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of ſuch a ſound in the Organs
of hearing is follow'd by a motion in
the Animal Spirits like that which
they have in a fit of Anger, (that is,
if they be acted violently and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality)
it may raiſe Choller, and
continue it. On the contrary, if the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50222:128"/>
impreſſion be doleful and melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if the commotion it cauſes in the
Animal Spirits be feeble and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,
and in the ſame temper as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in Melancholly, what we have
ſayd ought not to ſeem ſtrange; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we reflect upon what has been
deriv'd to us from many eminent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
relating to the ſtrange effects of
Muſick. Some have affirm'd there
were perſons who play'd ſo excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Flute, that they knew how
to accommodate their Ayres to all
kinds of Malady's, how to eaſe thoſe
who were in pain, delight thoſe who
were ſad, and recover thoſe who were
ſick.</p>

Emphaſis and Elevation of Style, that

Connexion among themſelves, and do
excite one another. It is not to be
queſtion'd, but certain ſounds, certain
Numbers, and certain Cadences, do
contribute to awake the Images of
things with which they have had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance

Is enough to excite compaſſion in the
<hi>Trojans.</hi> Often-times the manner of
delivering a thing, the poſture, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
are more Eloquent and Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
than the words. A neglected ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
a dejected poſture, a ſorrowful
look, prevails more than argument, or
intreaty. So the Cadence of Words is
many times of more force than the
words themſelves. In ſhort, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doubt of the efficacy of the Tone.
A bold Tone begets an Impreſſion of
Fear. A ſorrowful Tone diſpoſes to
compaſſion. Diſcourſe loſeth much of
its force when not ſuſtain'd with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of action and voice: It is an
Inſtrument that receives its vertue
from the hand that manages it. Words
upon Paper, is like a dead body upon
the ground: In the mouth of the

A Cadence ſuitable to the things of

were made of Letters, whoſe

thing ſignified. It would be hard to
defend this Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> in all the

all Languages there are words whoſe
ſounds are ſignificative; and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Names conſiſts in their
correſpondence with the thing that
they ſignifie, either by the agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Cadence, as in the word
<hi>Boar:</hi> or becauſe it is deriv'd from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

                  <p>He who would joyn his Diſcourſe

needs no more than to conſult his
Ears, and learn from them what is the

                  <p>Particular regard muſt be had to

<hi>Dactylus</hi> are the two largeſt feet,
therefore <hi>Hexameters</hi> of all Verſe are
the moſt Majeſtick, and the Sponde
at the end makes us pronounce it
ſtrong, by ſuſtaining our Voice. The
<hi>Anapaestus</hi> which is at the end of the
<hi>Pentameter,</hi> cauſes the Voice to fall;
and therefore <hi>Pentameters</hi> are uſed to
expreſs complaints and ſuch-like,
where the Voice is falling perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and its courſe often interrupted.
The <hi>Pentametre</hi> and <hi>Hexametre</hi> are
joyn'd, that the weakneſs of the one
may be ſupported by the ſtrength of
the other. The <hi>Jambus</hi> is a foot ſo
fleet, that the Cadence of a Verſe
compos'd of them, is often unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable:
It paſſes with ſuch ſwiftneſs
that that kind of Verſe is ſcarce di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable
from proſe: For which
reaſon the <hi>Jambus</hi> is uſed commonly
in Plays, and pieces for the Stage,
where it is requiſite the ſtyle be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,

'Tis an eaſy matter to render the
Cadence of a Diſcourſe ſmooth or
ruff: To make it ſmooth we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the concourſe of Vowels, which
cauſes chaſmes and void places in
our Diſcourſe, and hinders its equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and union. The Concourſe of Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and the Concourſe of Conſonants
(particularly of thoſe which are ſharp,
and thoſe which do not accord) do
make a Diſcourſe rough and uneven.
A rough Diſcourſe agrees witn things
that are ruff and unpleaſant, <hi>Rebus
atrocibus conveniunt verba auditu
aſpera.</hi> To deſcribe great things, we
muſt make uſe of bigg words, words
that make a noiſe, and fill the mouth.
The Cadence of a mean Diſcourſe
ought to be neglected, and languiſhing;
for this cauſe it is requiſite that all
the terms of which it makes uſe,
ſhould have a feeble weak Sound.</p>
                  <p>The longer the <hi>Period's</hi> are, the
ſtronger is the action of the Voice:
when it concerns us to ſpeak ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
our expreſſions ought to be
ſhort and abrupt. If the action be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement;
if we be to add weight to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50222:133"/>
our words (as thoſe who would make
themſelves formidable, do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make a great noiſe) we muſt make
uſe of long periods, which cannot be
pronounc'd but with a tone more than
ordinarily ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>But no more of this; it would be
loſs of time to give particular Rules
for each number. It is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
but by long habit, and ſtrong
application, which animates and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens
us in our Compoſitions; and
it is naturally that we make choice of
rough or ſmooth terms according to
the things we would expreſs. I would
not have an Author perplex himſelf to
find out a ſignificative Cadence, as
he would do to find out a leak in a
Ship. I confeſs freely, 'tis by accident
when he ſucceeds; 'Tis ſometimes
impoſſible, and we ought not to ingage
raſhly in a thing where the ſucceſs is
ſubject to many accidents.</p>
                  <p>In appearance the greateſt part of
Poets were ignorant of this accord
betwixt numbers and things. They ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at nothing in their Verſe but a
certain ſoftneſs that flagg'd and grew
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50222:133"/>
languid by degrees. With them the
joyful and the afflicted; the Maſter
and the Man, ſpake in the ſame tone:
A Clown ſpake as quaintly as a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
and yet thoſe Poets have their
admirers, who think they favour <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
exceedingly, when they repeat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the rough and uneven Verſes
wherewith he ſometimes expreſs'd
mean things, and ſay he did it on

we might not think it meer chance

he ſhows how the Cadence is
quite different from the next Verſe,

his Stone, how it tumbles from
the top to the bottom, after it had

two different things at one time, and
therefore it happens often that whilſt

What Style is.</head>
                  <p>WE have obſerved that
Words do not give the
ſame Idea of things
that they ſignifie, and
that to make us underſtand the form
of our Thoughts, we ought to uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

their true lineaments, and their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

in the minds of other people, the
ſame Ideas, and the ſame Sentiments
as we have in ours. In this Fourth
part we ſhall make it appear, that
according to the difference of the
matter, we muſt make uſe of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner of Writing; and that as
every thing requires convenient
words, ſo an entire ſubject requires a
ſtyle that may be proportionable to it.
The Rules we have given for Elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
regard no farther than (if we may
ſo ſay) the members of Diſcourſe;
that of which we are now ſpeaking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the whole body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Style,</hi> in its primitive ſignification,
is taken for a kind of Bodkin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Antients writ upon Bark, and
little Tables covered with Wax: To
ſay who is the Author of ſuch a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
we ſay 'tis ſuch a mans hand,
whereas the Antients ſaid it was ſuch
a mans Style. In proceſs of time, the
word <hi>Style</hi> came to be applyed only
to the manner of expreſſing: When

we ſay ſuch a diſcourſe is <hi>Cicero</hi>'s

I determine with what ſtyle we are to
treat of ſeveral things that are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of common Diſcourſe, what
ought to be the Style of an Orator, an
Hiſtorian, or Poet, who would delight,
or inſtruct; I thought it not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to enquire into the different Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
wherewith ſeveral Authors
expreſs themſelves in the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and who writing on the ſame
Subjects endeavour the ſame Stile.
Some are diffuſe, and though they
pretend to be ſuccinct, half their words
may be retrenched without prejudice
to the ſenſe: Others are dry, flat,
barren, and what Effort ſoever they
may make to beautify and adorn
things, they leave them half-naked:
The Style of ſome is ſtrong; in others
it is weak and languiſhing; in ſome
it is rugged, in others it is ſmooth: In
a word, as faces are different, ſo are
the ways of Writing, and it is the
cauſe of this Difference of which we
are going to enquire.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Qualities of the Style depend upon
the Qualities of the Imagination,

                  <p>WHen the outward Object
ſtrikes upon our Senſe, the
motion it makes is communicated by
the Nerves to the very Centre of the
Brain, whoſe ſubſtance being ſoft, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
thereby certain prints and
impreſſions: The Alliance or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
betwixt the Mind and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
is the cauſe that the Ideas of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
things are annex'd to theſe
Prints; ſo that when the Prints of
an Object, (for Example of the Sun)
are imprinted in the brain, the Idea
of the Sun preſents it ſelf to the mind;
and as oft as the Idea of the
Sun is preſented to the Mind, the
Impreſſions caus'd by the preſence
of the Sun, begin to open and dilate.
We may call thoſe Prints the Images
of the Objects. The power the Soul
has to form upon the Brain the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50222:138"/>
of things that have been percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd,
is called Imagination, which
word ſignifies both that power of the
Soul, and the Images that it forms.</p>
                  <p>The Qualities of a good Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are very neceſſary to Well-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for Diſcourſe is nothing but a
Copy of thoſe things of which we
are to ſpeak, form'd before by the
Soul. If the Original be confuſed, the
Copy muſt be ſo alſo; if the Original
be not, the Copy cannot be like. The
form, the clearneſs, the good Order of
our Idea's, depend upon the clearneſs
and diſtinction of the Impreſſions
which the Objects make upon our
Brain; ſo that it cannot be doubted
but the Quality of the Style muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the quality of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
The ſubſtance of the Brain
has not the ſame qualities in all heads,
and therefore we are not to wonder
if the ways of Speaking be different
in each Author.</p>
                  <p>Words read or heard leave their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
in the Brain, as well as other
Objects, ſo as we commonly think of
Words and Things at the ſame time;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50222:139"/>
the Impreſſions of Words and Things
which have been opened in Company
at ſeveral times, are linked together
in ſuch ſort that the Things repreſent
themſelves to the mind with their
Names: when this falls out, we ſay
the Memory is happy, and its Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conſiſts only in the eaſineſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the prints of words, and the
things to which they are linked, do
open themſelves at the ſame time;
that is to ſay, when the name of the
thing follows the thought we have of
it. When the Memory is unfaithful
in repreſenting the proper Terms of
the things committed to it, we cannot
ſpeak juſtly; we are forced either to
ſay nothing, or make uſe of the firſt
words that occur, though perhaps
they are not proper to expreſs what
we would ſay. Happy and juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is the effect of good Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, it is manifeſt the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Mind are the cauſe of the
Difference obſerved among all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
Diſcourſe is the Image of the
Mind; we ſhew our Humours and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50222:139"/>
in our Words before we
think of it. The Minds then being
different, what wonder if the Style of

                  <p>A Good Imagination contributes
particularly to the clearneſs and
facility of Diſcourſe 'Tis eaſy to
ſpeak of things that we ſee, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
guides and regulates our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;

with things. A Man whoſe Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

before the eyes of his mind; ſo that
expreſſing by his words, the things
as preſent to him, his Diſcourſe is
clear, and the things do range and
take their places of themſelves in his
Diſcourſe. In the Imagination there
are two things; the firſt is Material,
the ſecond Spiritual; the Material is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50222:140"/>
the prints cauſed by the impreſſions
the Objects make upon the ſenſe. The
Spiritual is the Perception or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the Soul has of theſe prints, and
the power we have to renew or open
them when once they are made. We
ſhall enquire here only into the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
part. I cannot explain exactly
theſe prints without ingaging my ſelf
in Philoſophical Diſquiſitions remote
from my Subject: I ſhall only ſay
theſe prints are made by the Animal
Spirits, which being the pureſt and
moſt ſubtile part of the Blood, fly up
like a Vapour from the Heart to the
Brain: Theſe Spirits are uncertain in
their courſe. When a Nerve is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they follow its motion, and by
their Current they draw ſeveral Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
in the Brain, according as the
Nerves are differently ſtretched or
contracted; but which way ſoever
theſe Figures are made, it is plain, the
clearneſs of the Imagination depends
upon the temperament of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Brain, and the quality
of the Animal Spirits.</p>

Figures ingrav'd upon Marble are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
perfect, becauſe the hardneſs of
the Matter gives too much reſiſtance
to the Chiſſel. This gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that the ſubſtance of the

without which it cannot receive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the Images of ſuch things as the
Soul imagines. If the Brain be too
moiſt, and the little Threads and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
which compoſe it too feeble and
lax, they cannot retain the Foldings
and Impreſſions given them by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Spirits, and by conſequence the
things drawn there are confuſed, and
like thoſe we endeavour to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50222:141"/>
Mud: If the Brain be too dry,
and the Fibers too hard, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
all the ſtrokes of the Objects
ſhould leave their Impreſſions, which
makes every thing ſeem dry and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
to men of that Temper. I ſpeak
not of the other Qualities of the
Brain, of its heat or its coldneſs: when
it is hot, the Spirits move with more
eaſe; when it is cold, the Spirits are
ſlow and retarded in their courſe, the
Imagination is dull, and nothing to be
imagined but with trouble.</p>
                  <p>The Animal Spirits ought to have
three qualities; they ought to be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
hot, and equal in their motion:
A brain whoſe Animal Spirits are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
is empty of Images. Plenty of
Spirits makes the Imagination fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
The prints drawn by the Spirits
in their courſe being large, whilſt the
ſource that produces them is full, they
repreſent all things eaſily, and under
multitude of Figures which ſupply us
amply with matter for diſcourſe; thoſe
who have not this Fertility ſupply'd
to them by abundance of Spirits, are
commonly dry. Things imprinting
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50222:141"/>
themſelves but weakly upon their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
they appear little and
meagre, and dry; ſo their Diſcourſe
expreſſing nothing but what paſſes in
their Imagination, is dry and meagre
and jejune. The firſt are great Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
they ſpeak nothing but Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles,
every thing appears great to
them: The others are low, mean, and
inſipid in their diſcourſe. The Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the firſt makes every thing
greater; the Imagination of the laſt
leſſens them as much.</p>
                  <p>When there is heat enough, and the
Animal Spirits are warm, quick, and
in great quantity, the Tongue is not
ſufficiently nimble to expreſs all that
is repreſented in the Imagination; for
beſides that abundance (which is the
firſt quality requiſite to the Spirits)
forming the Images of things in their
full dimenſions; the ſecond Quality,
(which is heat) rendring the Animal
Spirits lively and quick, the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is full in an inſtant of differing I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.
Thoſe who poſſeſs theſe two
Qualities, do immediatly without
thinking find more matter upon any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50222:142"/>
ſubject propoſed than others after
long Meditation. A cold Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
move the Imagination without
helps. Experience tells us, that want
of Heat is a great Obſtruction to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence:
In violent paſſion where
the Animal Spirits are extraordinarily
ſtirred, the dryeſt Tempered Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
themſelves with eaſe, the moſt
barren want no words. And this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of Images in the Imagination,
cauſes a pleaſant variety of Figures
and Motions that follow thoſe of the
Imagination.</p>
                  <p>That the Imagination be clear and
unconfus'd, the motion of the Animal
Spirits ought to be equal. When their
courſe is irregular, ſometimes ſlow, and
ſometimes ſwift, the Images that they
imprint are without proportion; as in
ſick People, where the motion of the
whole Maſs of Blood is irregular.
Thoſe who are Gay and of a Sanguine
Complexion, expreſs themſelves grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and readily. In thoſe Tempers
the Animal Spirits move quick and
equal, and their Imagination being
clear, their Diſcourſe being but a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50222:142"/>

with eaſe. Exerciſe adds much
to the Memory; Things fold eaſily
that way that they are often folded.
The Fibers of the Brain do harden
and grow ſtiff, if that ſtifneſs be
not prevented by frequent folding
them, that is to ſay, by often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what we have learned already,
and continual endeavours to ſuck in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50222:143"/>
more. We muſt fill our Memories
with proper terms, and contrive that
the Images of things and their names
be of ſo ſtrict coherence, that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and expreſſions may preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
together. An excellent Perſon
has reſembled the Memory to a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Preſs;
a Printer who has none
but Gothick Characters, prints no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but in Gothick Characters, let
the Treatiſe be never ſo good. The
ſame may be ſaid of thoſe whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
are ful of nothing but improper
words; having nothing in their minds
but Gothick Molds, and their thoughts
clothing themſelves with Expreſſions
from thence, no wonder if they always
aſſume a Gothick aire and faſhion.</p>

                  <p>WHat we have hitherto ſayd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
only to the Corporal
Organs: The qualities of the Mind
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50222:143"/>
are more conſiderable and important.
Reaſon muſt regulate the advantages
of Nature, which are rather Defects
than advantages when we underſtand
not how to uſe them. He that has a
fertile Imagination, but knows not
how to cull and pick his Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
looſes himſelf, and runs out into
long and tedious Diſcourſes. Among
the multitude of things that he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
half of them are improper; and
thoſe which are good, are ſtifled and
incommoded by theſe that are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
If his Imagination be hot as
well as fertile, and he follows the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his heat, he falls into thouſands
of other faults; his Diſcourſe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a continuation of Figures;
he ſeldom ſpeaks without paſſion,
but for the moſt part without reaſon.
Being haſty and hot, the leaſt thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
him, and ſets him on fire; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect to Civility, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the merits of the Cauſe, he fly's
out into a fury, and ſuffers himſelf to
be hurried away by the <hi>impetus</hi> of his
Imagination, whoſe irregularity and
extravagance is diſcovered in his
words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50222:144"/>
To enjoy the Soveraign Perfection
of Eloquence, the mind muſt be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with theſe three Qualities: Firſt,
a capacity to diſcover abundantly all
that may be ſaid upon any propoſed
ſubject. A narrow Apprehenſion is
incapable of giving things their juſt
latitude and extent.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond quality conſiſts in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſagacious Vivacity, that ſtrikes
immediately into things, rummages
them to the bottom, and cleanſes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
corner: thoſe whoſe minds are
heavy and dull, do not penetrate into
the Folds or Intricacies of an Affair,
and therefore can only skum off what
they find at the top.</p>
                  <p>The Third quality is exactneſs of
Judgment, and that regulates both
the other qualities. A good Judgment
chooſes and picks, it ſtops not at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing preſented by the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but diſcerns and diſcriminates
betwixt what is fit to be ſaid, and
what is fit to be paſs'd: it dilates not
upon things according to the bigneſs
of their Images, but amplifies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
or contracts it, as the thing and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50222:144"/>
reaſon require; it relys not upon firſt
Idea's, but judges whether things are
as great as they appear, and ſelects
convenient expreſſions according to
the light of Reaſon rather than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of Imagination, which like magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Glaſſes do many times repreſent
things greater than they are: It ſtops
the Idea's where they are too light; it
excites and chafes them when they
are cold: in a word, it uſes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
many advantages that Nature
has given it; it prevents Faults, and
endeavours to correct them.</p>
                  <p>The good Qualities of the Mind are
not always concomitant with the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of a good Imagination, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Memory; which cauſes a great
difference betwixt Speaking and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
well. Oftentimes thoſe who
write well upon premeditation ſpeak
ill <hi>Ex tempore:</hi> To write well there
is no need of a prompt, hot, and fertil
Imagination. Unleſs our Wit be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bad indeed, upon ſerious Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we ſhall find what we ought, and
what we might ſay upon any ſubject
propoſed; thoſe who ſpeak eaſily and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50222:145"/>
without premeditation, receive that
advantage from a certain fertility and
fire in their Imagination, which fire is
extinguiſhed by repoſe and cold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
in a Study.</p>
                  <p>The Qualities of the Mind are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to the qualities of the Body;
the Eloquence of thoſe endued with
theſe laſt Qualities is like a flaſh of
Gun-powder, gone in a moment; this
Eloquence makes a great noiſe, and
flaſhes for a time, but 'tis quickly
ſpent and forgot. A Treatiſe compos'd
with Judgment retains its Beauty,
and the oftner it is read, the more it
is admir'd. This is obſerv'd by <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
in the Fourth Book of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales,</hi>
where he ſpeaks of one <hi>Haleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
a Famous Orator whilſt he lived,
but when dead, his Writings were not
ſo much admired; his Talent lay in
ſpeaking well <hi>Ex tempore,</hi> not in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
having more flame in his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
than judgment in his Mind.

                  <p>DIſcourſe is the Character of the
Mind; our Humour deſcribes
it ſelf in our words, and every man

his diſpoſition naturally carries him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We know not only the Humor of a

The <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> whoſe Imaginations
are warm and full of Images, ſpeak
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50222:146"/>
nothing but by Allegories, Similitudes,
and Metaphors; by which means
their Style is obſcure to thoſe whoſe
Imaginations are not ſo lively and
prompt. The Northern people have
not that heat, and therefore ſpeak
more plain and intelligibly.</p>
                  <p>Antient Rhetoricians diſtinguiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three Forms the different Styles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to the people by their
different Inclinations. The firſt form
is the <hi>Aſiatick,</hi> high, pompous, and
magnificent. The people of <hi>Aſia</hi>
have been always ambitious, their
Diſcourſe expreſſes their Humor; they
are lovers of Luxury, and their words
are accompanied with ſeveral vain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
that a ſevere Humour cannot
approve. The ſecond form of Style is
the <hi>Attick:</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> were
more regular in their Lives, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were more exact and modeſt in
their Diſcourſe. The Third is the
<hi>Rhodian</hi> Stile; the <hi>Rhodians</hi> had a
touch of the Ambition and Luxury
of the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> and the modeſty of
the <hi>Athenians;</hi> their ſtyle characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes
their Humour, and keeps a <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50222:146"/>

and the reſervedneſs and retenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Attick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Diverſity of Styles proceeds again
from another Cauſe, that is to ſay, from
the precogitancy or pre-occupation
wherewith we ſpeak or write; when
we have taken a fancy to any way of
Writing, we make it our model, and
endeavour to imitate it. A Style <hi>a-la-mode</hi>
is followed by the whole world;
but as we change our Modes, and
thoſe who invented them, finding them
common, contrive new, to diſtinguiſh
themſelves from the people, there is
a perpetual change, and every Age
has its peculiar Mode. A good Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
gueſſes the time when an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
writ, by obſerving his way: The
Style of each Age gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Inclinations of thoſe who
lived in that Age. Commonly the
Style is dry, rugged, without Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in thoſe Ages where the people
were ſerious and regular. Luxury
was introduced during the Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Governments, in Languages
as well as Habits, in Books as well

                  <p>THe Matter is to direct in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

ſtrength of judgment in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

But if the matter it ſelf be unworthy,
if it be great only in the Imagination
of the Author, his Magnificence turns
to his prejudice, and ſhows the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his judgment, in putting a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
upon that is only worthy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Figures, and Tropes, unknown
to the natural order of Diſcourſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
likewiſe the motion of the heart;
but that theſe Figures may be juſt, the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50222:147"/>
paſſion, of which they are the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
ought to be reaſonable. There is
nothing comes nearer Folly, than to
be tranſported without Cauſe; to put
ones ſelf into a heat for a thing that
ought to be argued coolly; each Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has its Figures: Figures may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
and embelliſh a Style, but unleſs
the Motion that cauſes them be lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
the Figures cannot be worthy
of Commendation.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then, 'tis the Matter that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates
the Style: When things are
great, and cannot be conſidered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great Emotion, it is neceſſary
that the Style which deſcribes them be
ſprightly, full of motion, and inriched
with Figures, and Tropes, and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors.
If in the ſubject of which we
treat there be nothing extraordinary:
if we can conſider it without paſſion;
the Style is to be plain. The Art of
Speaking having no peculiar matter,
every thing ſubject to our thoughts
being matter for Diſcourſe, there are
infinite diverſity of Styles, as the ſorts
of things of which we may ſpeak are
infinite: Yet the Maſters of that Art
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50222:148"/>
have reduced the peculiar matter for
Writing under three kinds; Sublime,
Mean, or Indifferent. There are three
Kinds of Styles anſwerable to theſe
three Kinds of Matters; the Lofty, the
Plain, and the Moderate. Sometimes
theſe Styles are called Characters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they denote the quality of the
matter that is the ſubject of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
I ſhall in this Chapter hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
together the Rules to be obſerved
in each of theſe three Characters.
When a Work is undertaken, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
propoſe a general Idea; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
when an Orator makes a Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick
upon ſome Prince, the deſign
is to magnifie and illuſtrate the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that <hi>Hero,</hi> to advance him to
ſuch an Elevation of Glory, that he
may be looked upon as the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
and moſt venerable perſon
of his Sex. An Advocate pleading
the cauſe of a <hi>Pauper,</hi> will be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
if he perſwades his Auditory that
the perſon whoſe defence he has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
is a good man, an innocent
man, and one that behaves himſelf in
his ſphear like a very good Citizen.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50222:148"/>
That which I ſhall ſay of theſe three
Characters, relates to our prudence
in carrying on our Work, ſo as we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuffer the general Idea we have
propoſed to our ſelves to be out of
ſight.</p>

                     <hi>APelles</hi> being to draw the Picture
of his Friend <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who
had loſt his left eye in the Wars, drew
him in <hi>Porfile</hi> with the half-face that
had no deformity. We muſt imitate
this Artifice: Let the ſubject of
which we deſign to give a lofty <hi>Idea,</hi>
be never ſo Noble, its Nobleneſs will
never be ſeen, unleſs we have the skill
to preſent it with the beſt of its faces:
the beſt of things have their imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and yet the leaſt new blemiſh
diſcovered in what we valued before,
abates our eſteem, and perhaps extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
it quite. After we have ſpoke
a thouſand fine things, if among them
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50222:149"/>
all we ſhuffle in but one Expreſſion
that is mean or impertinent, ſome
people (and thoſe Wits) are ſo ill-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as to regard nothing but that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence,
and to forget the reſt. We
muſt likewiſe be careful not to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in one place that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
or interfere with what we
have ſayd in another. We have an
Example of this Fault in <hi>Heſiod,</hi> who
in his Poem called the <hi>Buckler,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> ſays that ſhe had
<hi>a filthy humour running at her Noſe:
Longinus</hi> obſerves well, that <hi>Heſiod's</hi>
deſign being to make her terrible, this
Expreſſion did not ſuit, but made her
rather odious and contemptible.</p>
                  <p>We are likewiſe to imitate the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of another Painter no leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
than <hi>Apelles,</hi> and that is <hi>Zeux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi>
who being to repreſent <hi>Helen</hi> as
fair in colours as the Greek Poets
had done in their Verſe, he took the
natural touches of all the Beauties of
the City, where he drew it, uniting in
her Picture all the Graces that Nature
had diſtributed in a great number of
handſome Women. When a Poet is

Maſter of his Subject, and can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large

deſigns a deſcription (as for example

ſay. Though the matter be not equal
in all its parts, yet we are to obſerve
a certain Uniformity in our Style. In
a Palace there are appartments for
Inferior Officers, as well as thoſe who
are near the King; there are rooms of
State, and there are Stables: the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are not built with the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the rooms of State, and yet
there is a ſuitableneſs and proportion
betwixt them, and every part ſhows
its relation to the whole. In a lofty
Style, though the Expreſſions ought to
correſpond with the matter, yet we
muſt ſpeak of indifferent things with
an Ayre above their condition, becauſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50222:150"/>
our deſign being to give a high Idea

becauſe they ought to be

the greatneſs of things dazles
and conceals the faults of a Writer.
When we ſpeak of things rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
we make uſe of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors,

pomps and ornaments of Eloquence,
nor to be dreſs'd up in magnificent

its habits be cleanly and neat.</p>

the ſimplicity of the plain Character.
<hi>Virgil</hi> has given us examples of all
theſe three Characters; his <hi>Aenead's</hi>
are in the ſublime Character, where
he ſpeaks of nothing but Combats,
Sieges, Wars, Princes, and <hi>Hero's:</hi> In
them all is magnificent, both ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and words. The grandeur of
his Expreſſion is ſuitable to the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of the Subject: Every thing in
that Poem is extraordinary; he uſes
no terms profan'd by the cuſtom of the
Populace. When he is obliged to name
common things, he does it by ſome
Trope, or Circumlocution. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when he ſpeaks of <hi>Bread,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
it by <hi>Ceres,</hi> who among the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50222:153"/>
Pagans was the Goddeſs of Corn. The
Character of his <hi>Eclogues</hi> is ſimple.
They are Shepheards who ſpeak and
entertain themſelves with Love, with
Dialogues of their Sheep, and their
Fields, after a plain ſimple manner
ſuitable to the diſcouſes of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Georgicks</hi> are of the middle
Character: The matter of which they
treat is not ſo ſublime as the matter
of his <hi>Aenead's,</hi> he ſpeaks not there of
Wars and Combats, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which are

the myſteries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion;
he mingles them with Philoſophy,

                  <head type="sub">Of Styles proper to certain Matters;
and qualities common to all Styles.</head>
                  <p>WE are now ſpeaking of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Styles, peculiar to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
matters, as the Styles of Poets,
Orators, and Hiſtorians: But it is
not amiſs to premiſe certain Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
relating to the Qualities that are
common to all Styles. Among thoſe
who uſe the ſame Style, ſome are ſoft,
others more ſtrong: Some are gay, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more ſevere. I ſhall ſhow in
what theſe Qualities conſiſt, and how
they may be attributed to a Style,
when they are convenient to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Qualities is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
a Style is ſaid to be eaſy when
things are delivered with ſuch clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and perſpicuity, that the mind
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50222:154"/>
is put to no trouble to conceive them.
Thus we ſay the declenſion of a
Mountain is eaſy, when it is not hard
to aſcend. To give this eaſineſs to a
Style, we muſt leave nothing to the
Reader's determination; we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all doubts, and remove every
thing that may perplex it. In a word,
we muſt deliver things in their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
latitude and extent, that they may
be eaſily comprehended; for ſmall
things are not ſo viſible to the eye. I
have ſaid in the precedent Book how
cadence is to be ſweetned, and pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
in diſcourſe. The eaſineſs of
the number contributes ſtrangely to
the eaſineſs of the Style. This eaſineſs
may have ſeveral degrees: The Style
of an Author that writes with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
eaſe, is ſayd to be tender and
delicate. I will not forget in this place
that there is nothing contributes more
to the ſoftneſs and eaſineſs of a Style,
than the careful inſerting in their due
places all the Particulars neceſſary to
make the conſequence and connexion
of the parts of diſcourſe perceptible
and plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:50222:155"/>
The ſecond Quality is <hi>Strength,</hi>
and it is directly oppoſite to the firſt;
it ſtrikes the mind boldly, and forces
attention. To render a Style ſtrong,
we muſt uſe ſhort expreſſions that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
much, and excite many <hi>Idea's.</hi>
The Greek and Latin Authors are full
of theſe ſtrong expreſſions: They are
more rare among the <hi>French,</hi> who
chooſe rather to have their Diſcourſe
natural, free, and with ſome kind of
diffuſion; for which reaſon we are not
to wonder that the <hi>French</hi> in their
Tranſlations of Greek and Latine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
are more copious and verboſe
than the Originals, becauſe they have
not thoſe ſhort and compact Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the <hi>Genius</hi> of our Language
chooſing rather to explain and diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
thoſe <hi>Idea's</hi> which the Greek
and Latin words leave abſtruſe and
involved. St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſing his
readineſs to dye, ſays very nobly in
Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Tranſlation renders it, <hi>Ego
enim jam delibor.</hi> To turn it into
<hi>French,</hi> it muſt be done thus, <hi>Lar
pour may, je ſuis comme une victime
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50222:155"/>
qui a deja recu l'aſperſion pour etre
ſacrifice. For I am as a victim that has
already received aſperſion to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd.</hi>
All theſe words do but explain
the <hi>Idea's</hi> given by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
when we conſider its force with
neceſſary attention.</p>
                  <p>The Third quality renders a Style
pleaſant and florid. This Quality de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
in part upon the firſt, and ought
to be preceded by it; for the mind is
not pleaſed with too ſtrong an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Tropes and figures are the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of a Style; Tropes give a ſenſible
conception of the moſt abſtracted
thoughts; they are pleaſant delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of what we deſire to ſignifie.
Figures awaken our attention, they
warm and animate the Reader, which
is pleaſant: Motion is the principle
of Life, and of Pleaſure; coldneſs mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies
every thing. The laſt Quality
is ſevere, it retrenches whatever is not
abſolutely neceſſary; it allows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to pleaſure; it admits of no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
nor decoration, and like an
old <hi>Arepagit,</hi> rejects in Diſcourſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing that is ſprightly; it bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50222:156"/>
all things capable of intenerating
the heart.</p>
                  <p>We are to endeavour that our Style
have ſuch qualities as are proper to
the ſubject of which we treat. <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
that excellent Architect, who
lived under <hi>Auguſtus</hi> obſerves, that in
the ſtructure of Temples they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that order that expreſſed the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Deity to whom the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was dedicated. The <hi>Dorick,</hi> that
is the moſt ſolid and plain order, was
uſed in the Temple of <hi>Mars, Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
and <hi>Hercules.</hi> The Temples of
<hi>Venus, Flora, Proſerpina,</hi> and the
Nymphs, were built according to the
<hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, which is ſprucer
and delicater, adorned with Garlands
and Flowers, and all the Ornaments
of Architecture. The <hi>Jonick</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
to <hi>Diana, Juno,</hi> and other
Deities, of whoſe Humor the rules of
that Order gave a character, obliging
the Builders to a Medium betwixt the
ſolidity of the <hi>Dorick,</hi> and the Spruce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order. It is the
ſame in Diſcourſe: The Flowers and
Ornaments of Rhetorick are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50222:156"/>
for grave and majeſtick Subjects.

                  <p>THoſe who have writ hitherto of
the <hi>Art of Speaking,</hi> ſeem to have
intended their Rules only for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
Their precepts relate only to the
Style of an Orator; and thoſe who ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that Art, do look upon the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and richneſs of Expreſſion ſo
much admired in the Diſcourſes of
great Orators, as the chief and only
Fruit of their Studies. 'Tis true, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
appears more illuſtrious in
that Style, which obliges me to give
it the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>Orations commonly are to clear up
ſome obſcure and controverted truth;
and therefore they require a diffuſe
Style, becauſe in thoſe caſes it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to diſſipate all the clouds and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50222:157"/>
that obfuſcate the truth; thoſe
who hear an Orator ſpeak, are not ſo
much concerned as he in the cauſe he
defends: They are not always atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
or their apprehenſion not being
ſo quick, they conceive things with
more trouble; ſo that an Orator is
bound to repeat the ſame thing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wayes, that if the firſt be defective,
the ſecond or third may ſupply.</p>
                  <p>But this copiouſneſs conſiſts not in
multitude of Epithetes, Words, and
Expreſſions entirely ſynonimous. To
evince a truth; to make it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
to the dulleſt and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
Wits, we muſt preſent it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſeveral different Aſpects, with this
Order, that the laſt Expreſſions be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
more forcible than the firſt, and
add ſomething to our Diſcourſe, in
ſuch manner that without being tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
we render that ſenſible and plain
which we deſire to inculcate. A skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
man accommodates to the capacity
of his Auditors; he keeps cloſe to his
aſſertion, and quits it not till he has
imprinted and fixed it in the mind of
his Hearers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50222:157"/>
Verities in Pleadings and Orations
are not of the ſame nature with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
truths. Mathematical
Truths depend only on a few, and
thoſe infallible principles. The other
truths depend upon multitudes of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
that ſeparated ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and are of no conviction but
when they are joyn'd and united. They
are not to be amaſs'd but by art, and
in this it is that the ſubtilty of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
appears. They husband the leaſt
circumſtance, and lay the ſtreſs of their
argument upon little particularities,
that perhaps another would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with diſdain. Upon this ſcore
<hi>Cicero</hi> ſwells his Orations with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
that ſeem uſeleſs and
mean. Why does he tell us of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's</hi>
changing his ſhooes, of his put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on his Riding cloaths, of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
late, and waiting for his Wife
who was more tedious in her Dreſs
according to the cuſtom of Women.
It is, that the ſimplicity and life of the
picture which he would ſet before
our eyes, without omiſſion of the leaſt
ſtroke or circumſtance of the action,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50222:158"/>
might perſwade the Judges that there
was nothing viſible in the conduct of
<hi>Milo,</hi> that could make him reaſonably
ſuſpected of meditating the murder of
<hi>Clodius,</hi> as <hi>Milo's</hi> Enemies pretended.</p>
                  <p>Great Orators make uſe only of
ſuch expreſſions as put a value upon
their arguments. They endeavour to
dazle the eyes of the Underſtanding,
and to that end fight with none but
glittering arms. Cuſtom not ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them always with words proper
to expreſs their judgment of things,
and to make them appear in their
genuine grandeur, they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Tropes which are uſeful to
give what Colour they deſire to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
to make it appear greater, or
leſs, laudable or contemptible, juſt
or unjuſt, as the Metaphors they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
are capable of exalting or deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them. But they do often abuſe
this art, and make themſelves ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
We have no juſt right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
an action, to habit it as we
pleaſe; to call a Venial fault a Crime,
or a Crime an excuſable fault. Crimes
and faults give two different Idea's:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50222:158"/>
If we do not uſe theſe terms with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs,
it implies want of Judgment,
or want of Faith. A ſober hearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
principally the thing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſuffers himſelf to be perſwaded
by words, he examines whether they
be juſt. I cannot but admire thoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
who fancy they have utterly
overthrown their adverſaries, when
they have but droll'd upon their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments;
they think they have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuted them, when they have only
loaded them with Injuries, turned
their Reaſons into <hi>Ridicule,</hi> and ſpent
all the Figures of their Art to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them as contemptible as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
                  <p>We cannot defend a Truth well, if
we do not intereſt our ſelves ſeriouſly
in its defence. That diſcourſe is faint
and ineffectual that proceeds not
from a heart zealouſly diſpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for the truth when it has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
its protection. We have ſhown
in our Second Book that as Nature
puts the members of the Body into
poſtures proper for defence, or inſult,
in a ſingle Duel; ſo the ſame Nature
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50222:159"/>
prompts us to Figures in our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and that we give them ſuch
touches and circumſtances as may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the controverted truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
all that is brought in oppoſition.
Thus we ſee there is nothing ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
as the Harangue of an Orator,
who eſpouſes the Sentiments, and
drives at nothing but the Intereſt of
the perſon for whom he pleads.</p>

with more advantage, than in
Hiſtory: and indeed it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
buſineſs of an Orator to write Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.
<hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, <hi>Hiſtoria, opus
est maxime Oratorium.</hi> By his mouth
the actions of Great Men ought to
be publiſhed; by his Pen their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ought to be tranſmitted to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
The chief qualities of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50222:159"/>
Style are clearneſs and brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
An Eloquent Hiſtorian relates
not only the action, but every conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
circumſtance. An inſipid man
gives us only the Carcaſs, and delivers
things but by halfs; his relation is
dry and jejune. When we tell of a
Fight, and Victory that enſued, 'tis
not like a Hiſtorian to ſay barely they
Fought: we muſt tell the occaſion of
the War; how it was begun, upon
what deſign; what force was in the
Field, in what place it was Fought,
what accidents hapned, and by what
Stratagems it was obtain'd. But above
his Hiſtory, like a Glaſs, is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Object ſimply as it is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
magnificence or diminution.</p>
               <p>Brevity contributes to perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity:
I ſpeak not of that brevity which
conſiſts in things; in the choice of
what we are to ſay, or what we are to
omit. The Style of an Hiſtorian ought
to be cloſe and compact, free from
long phraſes, and periods that hold
the mind in ſuſpenſe; it muſt be equal,
not interrupted with numerous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
partiality, or paſſion, all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50222:160"/>
for an Hiſtorian: Not but
that an Hiſtorian that is a good Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
may make uſe of his Eloquence;
he muſt relate what is ſayd, as well as
what is done: Speeches are Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to a Hiſtory, in which Figures

are docible, and receive all as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
that we ſay, we have no occaſion
for that zeal and fervour: Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Geometry, the Poſitions are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and evident; to propoſe them is
ſufficient, without Rhetorical Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

It is not there as in the Law
where the knowledg of truth is
pleaſing to one, and diſpleaſing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
inriches the one, and impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
the other. Who is he that will
trouble himſelf to conteſt or defend a
Propoſition in Geometry? the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician
demonſtrates that the three
angles of a Triangle are equal to two
right Angles: Whether this be true
or falſe is indifferent, and no man will
concern himſelf; for this Reaſon the
Style of a Geometrician ought to be
plain and naked, and free from thoſe
Ornaments that Paſſion inſpires into
an Orator. Beſides, the clearer and
more evident a truth is, the more are
we diſpoſed to expreſs it in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>When we treat of Natural or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philoſophy, our Style is not to be
ſo dry and barren, as when we write
of Geometry; the truths diſcovered
in them depend not always upon ſuch
ſimple principles. A man that applys
himſelf eagerly to the ſolution of a
Probleme in Geometry; to find out
the Equation of <hi>Algebra,</hi> is ſtrict and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50222:161"/>
auſtere, and cannot endure words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd
only for Ornament. Natural
and Moral Philoſophy are not ſo knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as to put the Reader into an ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
by ſtudying them, and therefore
the Style of thoſe Sciences needs not
be ſo ſevere. The truths diſcovered
in prophane Sciences are barren, and
of little importance. Paſſions are not
juſt and reaſonable, but when they
provoke the mind to the diſcovery
of ſome ſolid good, or the avoiding of
ſome real evil: it is therefore a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
thing to expreſs paſſion in the
defence of an indifferent thing; to
fly out into Tranſportations, and Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and Figures, that diſcretion
would reſerve for more conſiderable
occaſions. I have not patience to ſee
a man furious in defending the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Aristotle;</hi> to hear a man
rail againſt another for not having ſo
profound a Reverence for <hi>Cicero</hi> as
himſelf; to exclaim and fall to work
with his Figures againſt a poor Man
that is perhaps miſtaken in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits:
And if you will have the truth,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50222:161"/>
it is with little leſs averſion that I read
the Works of ſome Divines, who han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the fundamental verities of our
Religion as drily and ſlightly as if
they were of no importance at all. It
is a kind of Irreligion to be preſent at
Divine Service, without ſome outward
expreſſion of love, reſpect, and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
we cannot communicate in
an irreverent poſture without ſin.
Thoſe who profeſs Divinity, and
would inſtruct others, muſt as much
as in them lies imitate their great
Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, who convinc'd
the underſtanding, wrought upon the
will, and inflam'd the heart of his
Diſciples whilſt he taught them. It
was this divine fire that he kindled
in their minds, that the Diſciples ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
<hi>Nonne cor erat ardens
in nobis, dum nobiſcum loqueretur in

Devots read the Writings of our

that correſponds to the Majeſty of
their Matter: Their arguments are
low and flat, and ſufficient to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat
the authority of the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50222:162"/>
truths. Their expreſſions are rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
their Style mean, without efficacy
or vigoun. The holy Scripture is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick:
The Writings of the Fathers
are full of love and zeal for thoſe
truths that they teach. When the
heart is on fire, the words that come
from it muſt of neceſſity be ardent.</p>

                  <head type="sub">[What ought to be the Style of a Poet.</head>
                  <p>A Poet is unconfin'd, we give him
what liberty he pleaſes, and do
not pin him up to the Laws of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom:
This liberty is eaſily juſtified.
Poets are deſirous to delight and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
us by things that are great, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
extraordinary: they cannot
arrive at their deſigned end, unleſs
they maintain the grandeur of things
by the grandeur of words. All that
they ſay being extraordinary, their
expreſſions being to equal the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their matter, ought likewiſe to
be extraordinary; for this cauſe in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50222:162"/>
Poetry we ſay nothing without <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles</hi>
and <hi>Metaphors,</hi> cuſtom not
being able to ſupply us with terms
that are ſtrong enough. A Poetical
Diſcourſe is figure all over. The dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the matter filling the Soul of
a Poet with Raptures, Eſteem, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
the courſe of his words
cannot be equal; he is neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by floods of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whereby his mind is agitated.
So, when the ſubject of his Verſe has
nothing in it that can cauſe theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
and raptures (as in Eclogues
and Comedies, and certain other verſe
whoſe matter is low:) his Style muſt
be plain without Figures. It is the
quality of great and extraordinary
things that excuſes a Poet, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes
him in his manner of ſpeaking;
for his matter being common, 'tis no
more lawful for him than an Hiſtorian
to decline common Expreſſion. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
we do not affect abſtracted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
that are not to be perceived but
by the eyes of the mind. We are ſo
accuſtomed to conceive only by the
mediation of our ſenſes, that we are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50222:163"/>
not able to comprehend barely with
our minds, unleſs what we would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
be grounded and eſtabliſhed
upon ſome ſenſible experiment. Hence
it is that abſtracted Expreſſions are
Enigma's to moſt people; and thoſe
only pleaſe which are ſenſible, and do
form in the Imagination the picture
of the thing that is to be conceived.
Poets, whoſe great end is to pleaſe, do
uſe only theſe latter Expreſſions; and
for the ſame reaſon it is, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors
which (as we ſaid before)
make every thing ſo plain, are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in their Style. This deſire of
ſtriking effectually upon the ſenſe, and
making themſelves eaſily underſtood,
has prompted the Poets to make uſe
of ſo many Fictions, and indue every
thing they mentioned with body, ſoul,
and ſhape.</p>

                  <p>When a Poet tells us, that <hi>Bellona</hi>
Goddeſs of War <hi>put fear and terror
into a whole Army,</hi> that <hi>the god</hi> Mars
<hi>quickned the courage of the Souldier,</hi>
theſe ways of expreſſing things
gives a different impreſſion upon our
ſenſe, from what we receive by the
common way of Expreſſion, <hi>The whole
Army was terrified; the Souldier was
incouraged.</hi> Every Virtue, every Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is a god among the Poets. <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
is Prudence: Fear, Choller, Envy
are Furies. When theſe words are
conſidered only with the <hi>Idea's</hi> that
common cuſtom has joyned to them,
they make no great impreſſion; but

made uſe of ſuch ways of ſpeaking to

of an exact Obſervation of the Rules
of Speaking.</head>
                  <p>AN antient Author has told us
that Beauty is the flower of
health. Flowers are the effect and
declaration of the good condition of
the Plant that produces them. Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
in diſcourſe proceed in the ſame
manner from the good Complexion,
that is, from the juſtneſs and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a diſcourſe. The ſame thing
admits of ſeveral Names according to
the ſeveral faces by which it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.
When Beauty is conſidered
in it ſelf, it is the flower of health; but
when it is conſidered with reference
to thoſe who do judg of that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
we may then ſay, that true Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is that which pleaſes Ingenious
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50222:166"/>
men, who are they that judg of things
moſt reaſonably. It is a hard matter
to determine what it is that pleaſes,
and in what conſiſts that <hi>Je ne ſcay
quoy</hi> of delight that we feel in the
reading a good Author. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
upon reflexion we ſhall find the
pleaſure we conceive in a well-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Diſcourſe, proceeds only from
the reſemblance betwixt the Image
form'd by the words in our mind, and
the things whoſe Image they bear; ſo
that it is either the truth that pleaſes,
or the conformity betwixt the words
and the things. That which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Sublime,</hi> is nothing but
that conformity in its perfection and
excellence. <hi>Longinus</hi> in his Book of
this Sublimity, has given us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of a ſublime expreſſion taken out
of the Firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of the Creation, uſes
theſe words; <hi>And God ſaid let there
be light, and there was light;</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
that gives a ſtrong <hi>Idea</hi> of the
power of God over his Creatures,
which was the thing that <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50222:166"/>
The greatneſs of an Expreſſion being
founded upon its perſpicuity and
force, it is no hard matter to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
which are the true Ornaments
of Diſcourſe, and in what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.
A diſcourſe is beautiful when it
is compos'd according to the Rules of
Art; it is great when it is more than
ordinary perſpicuous; when there is
not one equivocation; no ſentence
unintelligible; no expreſſion ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous;
when it is well-diſpoſed, and
the mind of the Reader led directly to
the end of the deſign, without the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora</hi>
or impediment of impertinent
words. Such clearneſs like a Torch
diſpells all obſcurity, and makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing viſible. We have ſhown al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in our Third Book, that when
we range our words in ſuch manner
as their pronunciation is fluid and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
they make a delightful harmony to
every Body that hears them: ſo we
need no other Rules for ſpeaking Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
than the Rules already given
for ſpeaking juſtly.</p>
                  <p>Ornaments in Diſcourſe, like Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Nature, have this property,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50222:167"/>
they are both pleaſant and profitable.
In Natural Beauty whatever is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is uſeful. In an Orchard where the
Trees are planted in rows, or in
ſquares, the diſpoſition of them is
pleaſant and uſeful; becauſe they are
ſo ſet, that the Earth may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
its juice equally to them all. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bores
in Ordinem, certaque intervalla
redactae, placent; Quincunce nihil ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſius
eſt, ſed id quoque prodest, ut ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum

are the principal Ornaments of Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
their beauty is link'd ſo ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the ſolidity of the Work, that
the Pillars cannot be pull'd down
without deſtruction to the whole
Houſe. The Ornaments of a good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
are alſo inſeparable. Alluſions
and ſporting with words; Figurative
repetition of certain Syllables, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ornaments not altogether Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
can give but ſmall ſatisfaction to
thoſe who conſider them with the eye
of Reaſon: for in a word, it is truth
only that ſatisfies a rational man; in
Ornaments there is nothing of truth;
they do rather perplex and Embaraſs,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50222:167"/>
and render things more unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
than if our Diſcourſe were ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

makes their ſtupidity the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
is, that they admire what
they do not underſtand, <hi>Mirantur

has ſome appearance of Grandeur, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime

                  <p>Men having then ſo falſe an <hi>Idea</hi> of

to ſpeak nothing but what is

them beyond their pitch, they miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in their ſlight, and puff themſelves
up, till they crack with the too great
quantity of wind. Copiouſneſs is a
mark of Grandeur; our impatience to
appear copious, chokes up our
thoughts with too great abundance
of words. When men are pleas'd

much, and repeat it over and over.

They are like young Hounds that
worrey their Prey, and are not eaſily
got off. Every thing is to be allowed
its natural dimenſion. A Statute whoſe

leggs are great, and arms ſmall, whoſe
body is large and head ſmall, is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous

when we ſtop too long upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

at this wild way of ſpeaking, as at the
diſcourſe of a mad-man. This is a
fault that diſgraces a ſtyle, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it from being natural and clear.
If it be to add weight to our words,
that we add the Names of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
we ought to do it only when
neceſſity requires us to make uſe of
the authority and reputation of an
Author. What need is there that we
quote <hi>Euclid</hi> to prove that the whole
is equal to all the parts: Or cite Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
to perſwade the World that
Winter is cold. I do not blame all
theſe citations, on the contrary they
are commendable, when the words
are clear, and convenient to awaken
the mind of the Reader by variety:
It is only exceſs in this kind that is
blameable. Thoſe who have read
much are to imitate the Bee, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts
what it has ſuck'd from the
flowers, and turns all into Honey. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
loves ſimplicity. It is the ſign of
diſtemper to have the skin marked w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
ſpots of ſeveral colours. Too frequent
ſentences trouble alſo the uniformity
of a ſtyle: By the word Sentence is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50222:170"/>
underſtood thoſe exalted and abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thoughts that are to be expreſs'd
in a conciſe way, and in few words;
and theſe Sentences are called points.
I ſpeak not of thoſe childiſh and falſe
Sentences which have nothing in them
but what is forced and unnatural. The
beſt expreſſions plac'd too thick, do
but perplex and incommode a Style,
and render it rugged: and when
they are ſeparated from the reſt of
the diſcourſe, the Style may be ſayd
to be rough and unpleaſing. Theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
thoughts are like patches
ſow'd together, which being of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
colour from the reſt of the ſtuff,
make the Garment ridiculous, <hi>Curan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
eſt ne ſententiae emineant extra
Corpus orationis expreſſae, ſed intexto
veſtibus colore niteant.</hi> Some love to
interſperſe their diſcourſes with theſe
kind of Sentences, ſuppoſing they add
reputation to the Wit of the Author:
<hi>Facie ingenii blandiuntur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt fault into which they fall
who are deſirous to have the honour
of doing ſomething exactly, proceeds
from an extraordinary endeavour to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50222:170"/>
make their Works excellent. A man
who writes with too much affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is not capable of perceiving the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
of his words. The darkeſt of
them ſeem clear to him; he diſcovers
eaſily all the Idea's that his Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ought to awaken to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
becauſe thoſe <hi>Idea's</hi> are preſent
to him. But it is not the ſame with
thoſe who read his Works, whoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
are not ſo hot, and who do
not addreſs themſelves to penetrate
the ſenſe of his words with ſo great
zeal and application as he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
them. When a man expreſſes
himſelf with pain, we labour with him,
and in ſome meaſure we participate
of his pain: If he expreſſes himſelf
eaſily and naturally, ſo as every word
ſeems to fall into its place without the
trouble of picking them, that eaſineſs
is pleaſant. The ſight of a merry Man
diſpoſes us to mirth.</p>
                  <p>This facility appears in a Treatiſe,
when we make uſe of natural expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when we avoid thoſe which are
elaborate, and carry the ſenſible marks
of Writing with pain. Not but that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50222:171"/>
to furniſh our ſelves with terms natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and proper, we have need ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of ſtudy and application: But
this ſtudy, this application ought not
to appear. <hi>Ludentis ſpeciem dabit,
&amp; torquebitur.</hi> As much as we may,
and the matter of which we treat will
permit, we muſt give our diſcourſe
this latitude and liberty of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Doubtleſs when a perſon in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
ſpeaks eaſily and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it goes far towards towards the
putting us into the ſame humour; the
pleaſure we take in his diſcourſe, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
every thing eaſy that he ſays.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of Artificial Ornaments: Rules rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to thoſe Ornaments.</head>
                  <p>BEſides this natural Beauty which
is the excellence and exactneſs
of Diſcourſe, we are obliged to take
notice of certain Ornaments that we
may call Artificial. It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that in the Works of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50222:171"/>
moſt judicious Authors, ſome things
are to be found that might have been
ſpared without injury to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
without perplexity to the ſenſe,
and without diminution to the
ſtrength of their ſtyle. They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd
only for Imbelliſhment, and
are of no other uſe but to detain the
mind of the Reader, and make him the
more willingly attentive. Many times
when we have ſaid all that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
we add ſomething for Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and chooſe to expreſs our ſelves
by Metaphors or Hyperboles: Though
perhaps cuſtom affords us Terms
proper enough to expreſs our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
yet we think it better in
Diſcourſe to make uſe of Figures to
prevent being tedious. When our
Words and Expreſſions are well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and may be conveniently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
we go farther, we meaſure
them, and give them ſuch Cadence as
may make them grateful to the ear.
Nature ſports her ſelf ſometimes in
her own Works: all Plants do not
bear fruit, ſome having nothing but
flowers. We cannot therefore abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50222:172"/>
condemn theſe Ornaments that
are inſerted only for the diverſion and
entertainment of the Reader. They
have their worth, but it is the right
uſe of them that gives it. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Rules will not be unprofitable
for our uſing this copiouſneſs of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
with dexterity and Art. The
firſt Rule to be obſerv'd in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of Ornaments, is to apply them
in their due time and place: Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is of Importance when we have
been over-laden with buſineſs. When
a ſubject is difficult, and that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
has perplex'd and troubled the
Reader, we muſt have a care of ſuch
ſporting with words as may increaſe
his perplexity by diverting his
thoughts before he comprehends.
When we aim at nothing but convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
diverſion is unpleaſant. Some
things there are that admit of no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
ſuch as theſe we call Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</p>
                  <q>Ornari res ipſa negat, contenta do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceri.</q>
                  <p>When the ſubject of our Diſcourſe
is ſimple, all the reſt ought to be ſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50222:172"/>
too. Pretious Stones, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Ornaments, are uſed only in
great Feſtivals, and upon extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The Second Rule requires that the
Ornaments be juſt, and the Rules of
Art exactly obſerved. Some people
are ſo idle as not to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for the impertinence or falſity of
what they ſay, if it be ſpoken after
the manner of a Sentence: If they can
but hedg a Metaphor or other Figure
into their Diſcourſe, they regard not
whether what they ſay be for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: If they can bring in an
<hi>Antitheſis,</hi> a Repetition, a Cadence
that tickles the ſenſe, they care not
how vain it be, and unſatisfactory
to Reaſon. But we muſt know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is beautiful that is falſe; and if
there be any thing that puts a value
upon theſe fallacious Ornaments, it
is becauſe they dazle us by their
falſe luſtre, and deafen us by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant
Noiſe; or if I may ſpeak
my thoughts freely, it is becauſe our
judgments are defective. A Noble
mind affects things and truth in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50222:173"/>
rather than words. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
tells us, <hi>Bonorum ingeniorum inſignis
eſt indoles, in verbis verum amare,
non verba.</hi> I cannot value a Diſcourſe
that tickles my ear, unleſs the matter
pleaſes my judgment. <hi>Nullo modo
mihi ſonat diſerte, quod dicitur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third Rule in theſe Artificial
Ornaments is to conſider firſt what is
uſeful; to make choice of ſuch terms
and expreſſions as are capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
in the minds of our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ſuch thoughts and motions as we
deſire to give them. The firſt thing
that takes up the thoughts of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect,
is the raiſing of his walls, and
erecting ſuch ſtrong Pillars as may
ſupport the Superſtructure. If he has
a mind to beautifie, he adorns his
Pillars with Gutter-work, his Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
with Frezes, and Flowers, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topes,</hi>
and <hi>Treglyphes,</hi> and other deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
wherewith his art ſupplies
him. But this is to be obſerv'd, things
of Ornament are never ſet up till the
ſolid and ſubſtantial part of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
be finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:50222:173"/>
The laſt Rule is, that we keep a juſt
Moderation in our Ornaments; they
muſt not be too frequent: The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
pleaſures are the ſooneſt gone:
<hi>Omnis voluptas</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Auſtin) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
finitimum faſtidium.</hi> Nothing is
more graceful than the eye, but he
that ſhould have more in his face
than two, would be a Monſter. Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Ornaments hinders diſcourſe
from being clear: and it is as obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
as any thing I have hitherto
ſayd, that exceſs of Ornaments keeps
the mind of the hearer from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon the ſubſtance. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
very frequently in Panegyricks,
where Orators are uſually laviſh of
their Eloquence, and with full hands
throw about the flowers of their Art.
The hearer admires the Orator, but
never thinks upon the perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
We are in every thing to
reſpect the deſign. When we would
arrive happily at the end of our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
we chooſe the beſt way we can
find; but it muſt be ſure to conduct us
thither. When leaves cover the
Fruit, and hinder their ripening, we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50222:174"/>
pull off thoſe Leaves without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that we rob the Trees of ſuch
beautiful Ornnments.</p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon it is, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt which directed the Pens of
the Apoſtles, ſuffered them not to
make uſe of the Rhetorick and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Eloquence of profane Orators,
which deludes the eye, and makes us
conſider rather the beauty of words,
than the ſenſe and reaſon of things.
The Sacred Scriptures were nor writ
to indulge our Vanity, but to edifie
our Souls. Thoſe who in Books re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
nothing but idle diverſion, do
undervalue them; but he who loves
Reaſon and Matter, ſhall find enough
in the Holy Scriptures to delight and
edify himſelf. One ſingle <hi>Pſalm</hi> of
<hi>Davids</hi> is worth more than all the
Odes of <hi>Pindar, Anacreon,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race.
Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> are
not to be compar'd to <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> All the
Works of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are not
equivalent to one of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
For in ſhort, words being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſound, we ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their harmony to the ſolid know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50222:174"/>
of truth. For my own part I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
not the Art of Speaking, but as it
contributes to the diſcovery of truth;
as it forces it from the bottom of our
thoughts where it lay conceal'd; as it
diſintangles it, and diſplays it to our
eyes; and indeed this is the true cauſe
that has incouraged me to write of
this Art, as a thing not only uſeful,
but neceſſary.</p>

                  <p>IF that which <hi>Diodorus Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
has writ of the Original of
Languages be true, what we have fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd
of our new men forming a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
to themſelves, would not be a
Fable, but a true Story. That Author
ſpeaking of the opinion of the <hi>Greeks</hi>
in relation to the beginning of the
World, tells us, that after the Elements
had taken their places in the Univerſe,
and the Waters were run down into
the Sea, the Earth being yet moiſt,
was chafed by the heat of the Sun,
became fruitful, and produced man
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50222:175"/>
and the reſt of the Creatures. That
theſe men being diſpers'd up and
down in ſeveral places, found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Beaſts, it would be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to live together: That at firſt
their words were confuſed and groſs,
which they poliſhed afterwards, and
eſtabliſhed ſuch terms as were judged
neceſſary for the explanation of their
thoughts; and that in time men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
born in ſeveral corners of the
Earth, and by conſequence divided
into ſeveral Societies, of which every
one had form'd to it ſelf a diſtinct
Language, it followed that all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did not make uſe of the ſame
Language.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the conjectures of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> who had no true knowledg of
Antiquity: <hi>Plato</hi> reproaches it to
them in one of his Dialogues, where
he brings in <hi>Timaeus</hi> telling that the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> commonly call'd the <hi>Greeks</hi>
children, becauſe they underſtood no
more than Children, from whence
they had their Original, or what paſs'd
in the world before they were born;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50222:175"/>
ſo that we are not much to depend
upon their Salvation. All the antient
monuments of Antiquity bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the verity of what <hi>Moſes</hi>
relates in <hi>Geneſis</hi> about the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World, and the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of man-kind.. We underſtand
from thence that God formed <hi>Adam</hi>
the firſt of his Sex, and gave him a
Language of which alone his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
made uſe till the building of
the Tower of <hi>Bebel</hi> ſome time after
the Deluge. The deſign of building
that Tower, was to defend themſelves
againſt God himſelf: If ever he ſhould
puniſh the world with another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
they hop'd by that Edifice to
protect themſelves againſt him; and
they were ſo inſolent in their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
that God Almighty finding
them obſtinate, ſent ſuch Confuſion
into their Language and Words as
diſabled them from underſtanding one
another; by which means their deſign
was fruſtrated, and they forc'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
and ſeparate into ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                  <p>The common Opinion concerning
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50222:176"/>
this Confuſion is, that <hi>God</hi> did not
ſo confound the Languages of theſe
Undertakers, as to make ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Languages as there were men.
It is believed only that after this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
every Family made uſe of a
particular Language; from whence it
followed that the Families being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
the men were diſtinguiſhed as
well by difference of Languages, as
the places to which they retir'd. This
Confuſion conſiſted not alone in the
Novelty of Words, but in the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tranſpoſition, addition, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
of ſeveral Letters which
compos'd their familiar words before
that Confuſion. Hence it is that we
eaſily deduce from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
(which is rationally preſumed
to be that which was ſpoken by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and uſed a long time afterwards)
the Original of the antient Names of
Towns, and Provinces, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
as has been prov'd by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Learned men, and particularly by
<hi>Samuel Bochart</hi> in his Sacred Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of words then did not come
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50222:176"/>
by chance; it was God who taught
them at firſt, and from the firſt Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that he gave to <hi>Adam,</hi> all other
Languages are deriv'd, that being
afterwards divided and multiplyed as
aforeſaid. Yet this Confuſion which
God brought into the Languages of
the Builders of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi>
was not the ſole Cauſe of the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
and multiplicity of Languages.
Thoſe in uſe at this time in the world
are much more numerous than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the children of <hi>Noah,</hi> when
they were ſeparated, and much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from their Languages. As in all
other things, ſo in Languages, there are
inſenſible alterations that in time
makes them all appear quite other
than what they were at firſt. It is not
to be doubted but our preſent <hi>French</hi>
is deriv'd from that which was ſpoken
five hundred years ſince: and yet we
can ſcarce underſtand what was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
but two hundred years ago. It is
not to be imagin'd that theſe alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
happen'd only to the <hi>French</hi>
Tongue. <hi>Quintilian</hi> tells us that the
Language of the <hi>Romans</hi> in his time
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50222:177"/>
was ſo different from what it was at
firſt, that the Prieſts could ſcarce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the old Hymns compos'd by
their Primitive Prieſts to be Sung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Idols.</p>
                  <p>The inconſtancy of man is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
cauſe of this alteration. His love
to Novelty makes him contrive new
words inſtead of the old, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſuch ways of Pronunciation as in
proceſs of time changes entirely the
old Language into new. So that thoſe
who are inquiſitive after the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
or Original of new Languages, to
diſcover how they are deriv'd from
the Antients, ought to conſider what
have been the different manners of
pronunciation in different times, and
how by thoſe different manners the
words have been ſo chang'd, that they
appear quite different from what they
were in their Original. For example,
there is no great conformity betwixt
<hi>Ecrire</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Scribere</hi> in
Latin, betwixt <hi>Etabler,</hi> and <hi>Stabilire.</hi>
In time it came to be the cuſtom not
to pronounce the Letter <hi>S</hi> after <hi>E</hi> at
the beginning of a word, and then
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50222:177"/>
they writ <hi>Ecribere, Etabilere,</hi> and at
length abbreviating farther, they came
to write <hi>Ecrire, Etabler.</hi> Changes
of this Nature have ſo diſguiz'd the
Latine words, that they have made a
new Language. In all Languages it
is the ſame with the <hi>French,</hi> which
with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> proceeds
from the Latin. Latin comes from
the Greek, Greek from Hebrew, as the
Chaldee, and Syriack. It is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manners of Pronunciation that
have caus'd the great difference at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in all Languages. We are much
ſurpriz'd at firſt, when from an antient
Language we can derive any word of
a new Language: for example, a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
from an Hebrew word, if their
difference be conſiderable. The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
proceeds from this, that no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
is taken that the Latin word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it received its preſent form, paſs'd
through ſeveral Countries and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that altered it. Theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the different manners with
which it has been pronounc'd.</p>
                  <p>People have particular inclinations
for particular Letters, and particular
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50222:178"/>
terminations; apprehending either
by fancy or reaſon, that the pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of theſe Letters; and thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
is more eaſy, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
to their natural diſpoſitions. This
is particularly remarkable in the
Greek Tongue; and is it, that has
introduc'd in the common uſe of that
Language, the particularities cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Dialects. The <hi>Atticks</hi> for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

in reſpect of the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> The <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,
French,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> have their
peculiar Letters and terminations, as
may be ſeen by their Grammars and
Dictionaries. Theſe peculiarities do
manifeſtly change much of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
and create great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them; ſo that though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50222:178"/>
from the ſame Parents (if I may
ſo ſay) they do not ſeem to be Siſters.

ſeem to be deriv'd from ſeveral Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
                  <p>The changes and revolutions that
happen to States, produce alteration
in Languages, becauſe in alteration of
Governments ſeveral different People
are united, from which mixture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of Language muſt neceſſarily
follow. So our <hi>French</hi> Language is
not deriv'd wholly from Latin, but
compos'd of ſeveral words in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the antient <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
with whom the <hi>Romans</hi> coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
in <hi>Gallia.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue
has ſeveral <hi>French</hi> words, introduced
upon occaſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a long time in <hi>France,</hi> of which
the greateſt part was in their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ſeveral <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi>
words derived to them from the
<hi>Moors,</hi> under whoſe Dominion they
were for ſome Centuries of Years.
Terms of Art proceed commonly from
the places where thoſe Arts have been
ſtudied and improved. Whence it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50222:179"/>
comes that the <hi>Greeks</hi> having labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
moſt towards the cultivation of
Sciences, the terms of the Liberal
Arts are generally <hi>Greek.</hi> The Art of
Navigation has been infinitely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
in the North, and therefore the
terms of Navigation are generally in
the language of the North.</p>
                  <p>Colonies have been a great means
of the multiplication of Languages.
It is manifeſt the <hi>Tyrians</hi> who traded
formerly all over the world, have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
their Language into moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
At <hi>Carthage</hi> (a Colonie of the
<hi>Tyrtans)</hi> they ſpoke the Language of
the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> which was a Dialect
of <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as may be prov'd by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Arguments, but particularly by
the Verſes in the <hi>Punick</hi> or <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
Language, to be read in <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
But as we have ſayd, Colonies
multiply Languages, and make ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
out of one, becauſe thoſe who are
remov'd into thoſe Colonies, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
well enough their own
Language to preſerve it without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
are apt to participate of the
Language to which they are remov'd;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50222:179"/>
by which means they by degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to ſpeak both Languages, and
frame a third of them both. It is no
hard matter to trace out the Original
of Languages, if we have any ſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of Antiquity; but my deſign
ſuffers me not to enlarge upon this
Subject. From what is ſayd, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
clearly that Cuſtom changes
Languages, that cuſtom makes them
what they are, and exerciſes a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
over them, that ſhall be evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

                  <p>THough the Arts of Speaking
and Perſwading are both
comprehended under the
name of Rhetorick by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
great Maſters, yet it is not to be
deny'd but there is great difference
betwixt them. Every man who
ſpeaks well, has not the ſecret of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50222:180"/>
upon the Affections, or working
to his ſide, ſuch as were before of a
contrary opinion; and this is call'd
to perſwade. Wherefore being to
treat of theſe two Arts, I choſe to do
it ſeparately; yet I ſhall in this place
only give an Idea of the <hi>Art of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,</hi>
not being able to treat of it
in its full latitude, becauſe it borrows
its Arms from ſeveral other Arts, and
cannot be ſeparated from them, as I
ſhall ſhow in the ſequel of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Perſwade,</hi> we muſt find out a
way to bring People to our Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that were of a contrary Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before: We muſt put our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Order in our minds, and having
fairly dispos'd it, we muſt make
choice of ſuch words as are proper to
expreſs it. We muſt get by heart
what we write, that we may pronounce
it with more advantage; ſo the <hi>Art
of Perſwaſion</hi> conſiſts of five parts.
The firſt is, Invention of Proper
Names; the Second is, Diſpoſition of
thoſe means: The Third is, Elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
The Fourth, Memory: The Fifth,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50222:181"/>
Pronunciation. When a truth is eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conteſted, unleſs we be blinded
with Intereſt, Perverſeneſs, or Paſſion,
good proof is ſufficient to convince us;
to remove all difficulties, and diſpel all
clouds. But when the controverſy
is with people that are not fond of
the truth; that are perverſe in their
inclinations, and prepoſſeſs'd by their
Paſſions, Reaſon is too weak, and we
muſt make uſe of cunning. Upon this
occaſion two things are to be done;
we muſt ſtudy their humours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to gain them: And becauſe
moſt men judging (according to their
Paſſions) that their Friends were in
the right, and their Enemies in the
wrong, we muſt infuſe ſuch Motions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them as may bring them to our ſide:
Wherefore the Maſters in that Art
have owned three ways of Perſwading;
Arguments, Manners, and Paſſion.
They teach us that to perſwade we
muſt find proofs; we muſt deliver our
ſelves ſo as to work upon the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of him we would gain, or excite
ſuch paſſion in his mind as may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him to our Party.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Invention of Proofs.</head>
                  <p>CLearneſs is the character of
Truth; no doubt can be made
of a clear truth, and when it is evident
in the higheſt degree, the moſt ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
and obſtinate are obliged to throw
down their Arms, and ſubmit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.
No man will ever deny that
the whole is greater than the part;
That all the parts united are equal to
the whole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes we turn
our faces, and will not ſee the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſuch truths as offend us: Yet
at length, when in ſpight of our Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
truth ſtrikes ſtrongly upon our
eyes, we are glad to ſurrender, and our
Tongues many times give the lye to
our Minds. To perſwade thoſe whoſe
Diſputes are grounded only upon the
obſcurity or uncertainty of a Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we muſt make uſe of one or more
inconteſtable Propoſitions, and make
it appear that the Propoſition conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50222:182"/>
is the ſame with thoſe which are
inconteſtable. The <hi>Roman</hi> Judges
doubted whether <hi>Milo</hi> had done ill in
killing of <hi>Claudius;</hi> they doubted
not but it was lawful to repel force
by force. <hi>Cicero</hi> to clear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
of the accuſed party, made
uſe of theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>We may
kill him that would murder us, and
therefore</hi> Milo <hi>might kill</hi> Claudius <hi>for
ſeeking his life.</hi> One of theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
is clear, the other obſcure:
One is granted on all hands, the other
uncertain; yet they ſignifie but the
ſame thing, and by conſequence one
of them being inconteſtable, the other
muſt be ſo too. It is the firſt part of
Philoſophy call'd Logick, to give
Rules of Argumentation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not without reaſon that we
have ſayd in the beginning of this
Diſcourſe, that to handle this Art of
Perſwaſion in its full dimenſion, we
muſt treat of ſeveral other Arts, which
could not be done without Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>The matter of the <hi>Art of Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
is not limited: This Art ſhows
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50222:182"/>
it ſelf in the Pulpit, at the Bar, at all
manner of buſineſs and converſation;
for in a word, the whole end of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Converſation is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
thoſe with whom we deal, and
reduce them to our Sentiments. To
be then a compleat Orator, and ſpeak
well upon any thing that occurs (as
the Rhetoricians pretend their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
may,) we ought to be univerſally
well-read, and ignorant of nothing:
for a man indeed is not perfectly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Arguing, but when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
his Subject to the bottom;
when his mind is full of clear truths,
and undoubted Maxims, from whence
Conſequences may be deduced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
the Controverſie in queſtion. For
example, a Divine argues rationally
and well, when to perſwade an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to his Opinion, he produces
Texts of Scripture; the Fathers, the
Councils, Tradition, and the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Church.</p>

                  <p>THere is no way of filling the
mind with certain truths up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matters of which we are to
Treat, like ſerious Meditation, and
long ſtudy, of which few men are
capable: Knowledg is a Fruit envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd

men at a diſtance: ſo that if it were
not lawful to ſpeak of any thing but
what we know, the moſt part of thoſe
who make Oratory their Profeſſion,
would be oblig'd to hold their peace.
To obviate ſo inevitable an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
theſe Orators have ſought out
ſhort and eaſy ways to ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with matter of diſcourſe, even
upon Subjects on which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ignorant. They diſtribute theſe
ways into ſeveral Claſſes, which they
call Common-Places, becauſe they are
publickly expos'd, and every man may
take out freely what Arguments he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50222:183"/>
pleaſes to prove what is in diſpute,
though perhaps he be quite ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the thing in Controverſy
himſelf. The Logicians ſpeak of theſe
Common-places in their Topicks. I
ſhall explain in few words the uſe of
theſe Common-places, and afterwards
ſhow what judgment is to be made of
them.</p>
                  <p>Common-places do properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
nothing but general advice that
remembers thoſe who conſult them of
all the faces by which a ſubject may
be conſidered; and this may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
becauſe viewing a Subject in
that manner on all ſides, without
doubt we may find with more eaſe
what is moſt proper to be ſayd on that
ſubject. A thing may be obſerv'd a
hundred different ways, yet it has
pleaſed the Authors of thoſe Topicks
to eſtabliſh only 16 Common-places.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt of theſe Common-places
is the <hi>Genus;</hi> that is to ſay, we muſt
conſider in every ſubject what it has
in common with all other the like
Subjects. If we ſpeak of the War
with the <hi>Turks,</hi> we may conſider War
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50222:184"/>
in general, and draw our Arguments
from that Generality.</p>
                  <p>The Second place is call'd <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
by which we conſider what-ever
is peculiar to a Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The Third is <hi>Definition;</hi> that is to
ſay, we muſt conſider the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Subject: The Diſcourſe
which expreſſes the nature of a thing,
is the definition of that thing.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth place is <hi>Enumeration
of the parts</hi> contain'd in the Subject
of which we Treat.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth is the <hi>Etymologie</hi> of the
Name of the Subject.</p>
                  <p>The Sixth is the <hi>Conjugates,</hi> which
are the Names which have connexion
with the name of our Subject, as the
word <hi>love</hi> has connexion with all
theſe other words, <hi>to love, loving,
friendſhip, lovely, friend, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe conſider the <hi>ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,</hi>
or <hi>diſſimilitude,</hi> in the things of
which we treat; which two Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
make the Seventh and the
Eighth places.</p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe make <hi>Compariſon,</hi>
and in our compariſon introduce eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50222:184"/>
thing to which our ſubject is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and this <hi>Compariſon</hi> and <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
are the Ninth and Tenth places.</p>
                  <p>The Eleventh place is <hi>Repugnance;</hi>
that is to ſay, in diſcourſing upon a
Subject, we muſt have an eye upon
thoſe things that are repugnant to it,
to diſcover the Proofs wherewith that
Proſpect may furniſh us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis of importance to conſider all
the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd:
but theſe Circumſtances have
either <hi>preceded,</hi> or <hi>accompanyed,</hi> or
<hi>followed</hi> the thing in queſtion; ſo theſe
<hi>Circumſtances</hi> do make the Twelfth,
Thirteenth, and Fourteenth places. All
the Circumſtances that can accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
an action, are commonly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p>That is to ſay we are to examin
who is the Author of the Action;
what the action is; where it was done;
by what means; for what end; how;
and when.</p>
                  <p>The Fifteenth place is the <hi>Effect:</hi>
and the Sixteenth the <hi>Cauſe;</hi> that is to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50222:185"/>
ſay, we muſt have regard to the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
of which the thing in diſpute
may be the cauſe; and to the things
of which it may be the effect.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Common-places do without
doubt ſupply us with ample matter
for Diſcourſe. The different Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
preſent us with ſeveral Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and are able queſtionleſs to
furniſh the moſt barren Invention. I
examine not now whether this ſupply
be commendable or not. According
to this method if we be to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a Parricide; we ſpeak againſt
Parricide in <hi>General,</hi> and then bring
it home to the perſon accus'd, and to
the reſt of the <hi>Particulars;</hi> then we
proceed to the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
diſcovering the blackneſs of the
Crime by <hi>Definitions, Deſcriptions,
Enumerations.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>
of the Name of the thing upon
which we are ſpeaking, and the other
Names that have reference to it, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
us with matter. A long Diſcourſe
might be rais'd upon the Obligation
which Chriſtians have to live well, by
only remembring them of the Name
that they bear.</p>

                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:50222:185"/>
Diſcourſes are much inlarged by
<hi>Similitudes, Diſſimilitudes,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,</hi>
that ſerve to remove a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and illuſtrate an obſcure truth.
In a word, he who ſhould <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate</hi>
an action, deſcribe what was
<hi>precedent, concomitant,</hi> and <hi>ſubſequent,</hi>
what was the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and what was the

                  <p>THe Places of which we have
ſpoke are called common, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are expoſed to all the
world, and becauſe they furniſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for all cauſes: There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places proper to particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Before we ſpeak of thoſe places,
it is to be conſidered that there are
two ſorts of Queſtions; The Firſt is
called <hi>Theſis,</hi> the other <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> A
<hi>Theſis</hi> is a queſtion not determin'd by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50222:186"/>
any circumſtance of time, place, or
perſon, as <hi>whether War be to be made.</hi>
An <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is a queſtion defin'd,
and circumſtantiated, as <hi>whether War
be to be made with the</hi> Turk <hi>in</hi> Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary
<hi>this Year.</hi> But all theſe queſtions
may be referr'd to three kinds: For
we deliberate whether ſuch an action
is to be done; we examine what
Judgment is to be made of that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and we either approve or diſlike
the action. The firſt kind is call'd <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative;</hi>
the Second, <hi>Judiciary;</hi> the
Third, <hi>Demonſtrative.</hi> Each of theſe
kinds has its peculiar places, that is to
ſay as is ſayd before, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Counſels and Directions given
for each of theſe kinds. As in caſe of
the <hi>Deliberative,</hi> according as we
would adviſe the undertaking, or
quitting of an action, we muſt ſhow
that it is uſeful, or not uſeful; neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or unneceſſary; that the ſucceſs
will be prejudicial, or advantageous;
and that the Enterprize is juſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
                  <p>A Judiciary Queſtion may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in one of theſe three States; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50222:186"/>
we know not the Author of the
action that is the ſubject of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and then becauſe we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to diſcover the ſaid Author by
Conjectures, that is call'd the ſtate of
<hi>Conjectures.</hi> If the Author be known,
we examine the nature of the action.
For Example, <hi>A Thief steals out of a
Church the treaſure which a private
perſon left there</hi> in depoſito: We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
whether this action be <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
or ſimple Theft.</hi> We conſider the
definition of the crime; and therefore
we call the one the ſtate of <hi>Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and the other the ſtate of <hi>Quality,</hi>
becauſe the quality of the action is to
be examin'd as whether it be juſt or
unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt ſtate it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
whether the perſon ſuſpected
would have committed ſuch a Crime
if he could, and what Tokens there
are of it. We judg of his Will, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what advantage it would be
to him to commit it. We judg of his
Power, by conſidering his ſtrength, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and other means: and we
judg whether he was effectually guilty
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50222:187"/>
or not, by the circumſtances of the
action; as whether he was found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in the place where it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
whether before or after it was
committed he did, or let fall, any thing
that may make him rationally ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <p>In the Second State we conſider on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the nature of the Action: All that
can be ſayd of it, depends upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
knowledg. In the Third State
we conſult Reaſon, Laws, Cuſtom,
Preſidents, Compacts, and Equity.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Demonstrative-kind,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
an action or condemn it, we
muſt conſider the <hi>Good</hi> or the <hi>Bad.
Goods</hi> in a man are to be conſidered
three ways; in reſpect of his Body, in
reſpect of his Mind, and in reſpect of
his Eſtate. Goods relating to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are felicity of Country, nobility of
Birth, advantage of Education, Health,
Strength, Beauty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Goods relating
to the Mind are Virtue, Sagacity, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Goods relating
to the Eſtate, are Riches, Honours, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe places proper and common
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50222:187"/>
to each of theſe three kinds, are call'd
interiour or intrinſick, to diſtinguiſh
them from the Exteriour which are
five, that is to ſay the Laws, the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
the Practice, the Tranſactions,
and the Anſwers of the Perſons exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.
The Lawyer is never put to
the trouble of ſearching his Proofs:
The Client or Solicitor puts into his
Councils hands his Breviate, his
Bonds, his Tranſactions; produces
the Depoſitions of his Witneſſes, and
the anſwer of him that was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</p>

                  <p>THus in few words have I ſhown
the Art to find Arguments upon
all Subjects of which the Rhetoricians
are accuſtomed to Treat, which makes
the greateſt part of their Rhetorick.
It is our buſineſs to judg of the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this method. My reſpect for
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50222:188"/>
thoſe Authors who have commended
it, obliges me to give you an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that you may underſtand the
bottom of it. It is not to be doubted
but the helps accrewing from it are of
ſome kind of uſe. They make us take
notice of ſeveral things from whence
Arguments may be drawn; they teach
us how a Subject may be vary'd and
diſcovered on all ſides. So as thoſe
who are skill'd in the Art of <hi>Topicks,</hi>
may find matter enough to amplifie
their diſcourſe; nothing is barren to
them; they ſpeak of every thing that
occurs, as largely and as oft as they
pleaſe. Thoſe who reject theſe To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
do not deny their Fecundity;
they grant that they ſupply us with
infinite numbers of things; but they
alledg that that Fecundity is inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient;
That the things are trivial, and
by conſequent the Art of <hi>Topicks</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
nothing that is fit for us to ſay.
If an Orator (ſay they) underſtands
the ſubject of which he treats; if he
be full of inconteſtable Maxims that
may inable him to reſolve all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ariſing upon that ſubject; If it be a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50222:188"/>
queſtion in Divinity, and he be well
read in the Fathers, Councils, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> He will quickly perceive
whether the queſtion propos'd be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
or otherwiſe. It is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that he runs to his Topicks, or
paſſes from one common place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
which are unable to ſupply
him with neceſſary knowledg for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of his Queſtion. If on the other
ſide an Orator be ignorant, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
not the bottom of what he
Treats, he can ſpeak but ſuperficially,
he cannot come to the point; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he has talk'd and argued a long
time, his Adverſary will have reaſon
to admoniſh him to leave his tedious
talk that ſignifies nothing; to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
him in this manner, Speak to the
purpoſe; oppoſe Reaſon againſt my
Reaſon, and coming to the Point, do
what you can to ſubvert the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon which I ſuſtain my ſelf. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratis

                  <p>If it be urg'd in favour of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Places,
that indeed they do not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50222:189"/>
fully inſtruct us what to ſay upon all
occaſions, but they help us to the
diſcovery of Infinite Arguments that
defend and fortifie one another. To
this it is anſwered, and I am of the
ſame Opinion, That to perſwade, we
need but one Argument, if it be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and ſtrong, and that Eloquence
conſiſts in clearing of that, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it perſpicuous. All thoſe feeble
Arguments (proper as well to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
as the accuſer, and as uſeful to
refel as affirm) deriv'd from Common-places,
are like ill Weeds that choke
the Corn.</p>
                  <p>This Art is dangerous for perſons
of but indifferent Learning, becauſe
it makes them acquieſce and ſit down
with ſmall ſuggeſtions eaſily obtain'd,
and neglect to ſeek after others of
more ſolid Importance. A witty man
ſpeaking of the method of which <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondus

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50222:190"/>
that what is diſagreeable to

the heart before they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
and as if they were Children,
they are to be coax'd and flatter'd till

                  <p>Orators acted by true zeal, are to

A fond Mother trims up her Child,
and her tenderneſs is ſuch, that ſhe

If we loved truth, we ſhould be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to make it appear as lovely to
every body elſe. The Fathers of the
Church have always made it their
care to avoid whatever might render
the Church grievous. When <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> began to preach his Goſpel to
the Jews, who were jealous for the
Honour of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, our Saviour
(as is obſerv'd by St. <hi>Chryſostom)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares

ſome few reflexions upon the means
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50222:191"/>
of inſinuating into the affections of
our Hearers Common Rhetorick hath
none of theſe Reflexions: So though
my deſign was not to Treat of the <hi>Art
of Speaking</hi> in its full Extent, yet I
ſhall ſay more of it than thoſe who
pretend to omit nothing. 'Tis true
the art of working upon an Auditory
is much above the reach of a Young
Schollar, for whom the antient Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
were properly made. This Art
is acquir'd by ſublime Speculations,
by reflexions upon the nature of
our mind, upon our inclinations,
and motions of our will. 'Tis the fruit
of Experience and long Obſervation
of the manner wherewith men act and
govern themſelves; in a word, this
Art is no where to be caught ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically

                  <p>IT is of importance that an Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
has an eſteem for the perſon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50222:191"/>
who ſpeaks. An Orator is to profeſs
and give ſome teſtimony of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to thoſe whom he deſires to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
and pretend it is pure zeal to
their Intereſt that prompts him to
ſpeak. Modeſty is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for nothing is ſo invincible an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
to perſwaſion as arrogancy and
boldneſs. Wherefore in an Orator
theſe four Qualities are eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
<hi>Probity, Prudence, Civility,</hi>
and <hi>Modeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is clear our eſteem for the probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and prudence of an Orator, makes
many times a great part of his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and diſpoſes us to ſurrender
even before we know what he will
ſay. 'Tis doubtleſs the effect of great
prae occupation; but that prae occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
is not amiſs; nor is it to be
confounded with a certain obſtinate
headineſs that inclines us to adhere
to falſe Opinions in ſpight of all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to the contrary. Beſides that the
words of a zealous man full of ardour
for the truth, kindle and inflame the
hearts of the hearers, it adds great
reputation to what he ſays, when he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50222:192"/>
is looked upon as honeſt, and one
who would not delude us; nor is it
more unreaſonable that we ſubmit
our judgments to their light, who are
very eminent for their wiſdom; ſo
that it is more advantage for an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to be famous for his Virtue than
his Learning. <hi>Quintilian</hi> tells us,
<hi>In Oratore non tam dicendi facultas,
quam honesta vivendi ratio eluceſcat.</hi>
Chriſtianity obliges thoſe who are
Preachers ſtudiouſly to endeavour to
gain this authority in the minds of
their Auditory. And the ſame Goſpel
that forbids vanity and oſtentation,
commands that our good Works ſhine
with intention, <hi>that others ſeeing our
good Works, may glorifie, &amp;c. Sic luce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
lux vestra coram hominibus, ut
videant opera veſtra bona.</hi> This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

the moſt Modeſt to aſſert their own
praiſes, and vindicate their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when otherwiſe their natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty

A good life is the mark that

<hi>Auctoritati credere, magnum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium,
&amp; nullus labor.</hi> The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a good, a learned, and an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
man, is a great eaſe and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to any man that is diffident of
his own parts. No man would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
be deceived, yet few are able
to protect themſelves againſt Error;
and therefore we are much pleas'd
when we meet a man upon whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
we may depend in all matters
of diſpute. We ſee many times two
or three Great Men (whoſe Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for Learning have gain'd them u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
eſteem) dividing the whole
World, whilſt every one ranks himſelf
on his ſide whom he believes the moſt
Learned and Honeſt. An Orator
without that authority, gains but few
to his Opinion, becauſe few are able
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50222:193"/>
to perceive the ſubtilty of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
If he would win upon the
multitude, he muſt convince them that
he has thoſe of his ſide, for whom the
Multitude has a great reverence and
eſteem.</p>
                  <p>Nothing goes farther to the gaining
a man, than marks and expreſſions of
Friendſhip: Friendſhip gives us a right
to the perſon belov'd. We may ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing if the perſon to whom we
ſpeak be convinc'd that we love him.
<hi>Ama, &amp; dic quod vis.</hi> Our love for
truth muſt be diſintereſted and entire
to receive it from the mouth of an
Enemy. 'Tis not to be imagin'd an
Enemy would be ſo kind as to inform
us of the truth. St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles
are full of expreſſions of Affection and
Tenderneſs for thoſe to whom he
writes; and he never reprehends them
for their Faults, till he has convinced
them it was his zeal for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that prompted him to thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Quality (which as I
conceive is abſolutely neceſſary in an
Orator) is modeſty. Many times our
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50222:193"/>
obſtinacy and averſion to the truth, is
cauſed only by the fierceneſs and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
wherewith an Orator would
force from our own mouths an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of our Ignorance. Why
do we wrangle and quarrel in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
and refuſe to admit the moſt
indiſputable truths? It is becauſe one
ſide is impatient to triumph, and the
other as obſtinate to adhere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for a Victory that would be ſo
diſhonourable to loſe. Thoſe who
are diſcreet ſuffer the eagerneſs of the
Adverſary to cool, and with ſuch art
conceal their triumph, that the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd
perſon is ſcarce ſenſible of his
defeat, but rather thinks himſelf vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
over that error to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was a ſlave. A prudent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
is never to ſpeak advantageouſly
of himſelf. Nothing ſo certainly ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enates
the minds of his Auditors, and
inflames them with ſentiments of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and diſdain, as the vanity of ſelf-applauſe.
Honour and Reputation is
a thing to which every man pretends,
and no man will ſuffer another to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs
it: For as <hi>Quintilian</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50222:194"/>
we have all a principle of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
that will endure nothing above
us. Hence it is that we love to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
thoſe who debaſe themſelves,
becauſe by advancing them we ſeem
to be greater than they. <hi>Habet enim
mens noſtra ſublime quiddam, &amp; impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens

Yet this modeſty ought not to be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and mean; Firmneſs and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
are inſeparable from our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
zeal in defence of the truth,

to deſert it. That man renders
himſelf terrible, who fears nothing
more than to injure the truth; ſo that
it is not unbecoming if ſometimes he
exalts the advantages of his own ſide,
which is the ſide of truth. To this
may be added, that a diſcourſe muſt
be ſuitable to the quality of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:

Perſon, let us now ſee what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the things of which he treats.
If the Auditors be not concern'd, and
what he ſays touches not too near
upon their Intereſt, Artifice is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.
When we are only to prove
that the three Angles of a Triangle
are equal to two right Angles, there is
no need of Art to diſpoſe our hearers
to believe us. Where there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of prejudice to the Hearer, there is
no fear of Oppoſition to the Speaker;
but when things are propos'd contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the intereſt or inclination of the
Hearer, then is addreſs moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
There is no way to inſinuate with
him but by <hi>ambages,</hi> and fetches ſo
cunningly introduc'd, that he is not to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50222:195"/>
perceive the truth to which we would
perſwade him, till he be throughly
convinced, otherwiſe his ears wil be
ſhut, and the Orator reckon'd an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                  <p>Men are acted only by Intereſt, even
when they ſeem to diſclaim it; we are
oblig'd to demonſtrate that the thing
we would perſwade, is not for their
diſadvantage. We muſt oppoſe Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
againſt Inclination, and to
draw them to our Sentiment, ſerve
them as Mariners do a contrary wind
when they make uſe of it to carry
them to a contrary Port. This will
be better underſtood by an Example.
To poſſeſs a Woman againſt Painting
who loves nothing but her ſelf, and
conſiders nothing but her Beauty, if
you will follow the advice of Saint
<hi>Chryſostom,</hi> we muſt pretend care of
her Beauty, to moderate her paſſion
for it; and this is to be done by ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Ceruſe and Paint are prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the Face.</p>
                  <p>A Debauched man who denys him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
nothing of pleaſure is taken off
by propoſing other pleaſures more
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50222:195"/>
ſweet, or by convincing him thoſe
pleaſures will be attended with very
great pains; we muſt connive at ſelf-love,
and propoſe ſomething of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence
to the man whom we would
perſwade from his intereſt; for unleſs
the Grace of God changes the heart,
the Paſſions may change the Object,
and themſelves continue the ſame.
This changing of the Object is not
difficult: A proud man will do any
thing you would have him to ſatisfie
his Pride, and avoid being underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued;
ſo that there is nothing to which
a man may not be perſwaded, if we
know his Inclinations, and how to
make uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>When we expect to obtain from
thoſe to whom we ſpeak a thing that
they have no intention to grant,
though perhaps reaſon requires it, we
muſt be content to receive it as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
This demand is not to be made
abruptly, but with circumſtance; and
after we have clearly prov'd that there
will remain more of Honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to them by granting, than by
refuſing it. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> commends

them worthy of the higheſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements:
but at length he inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the greatneſs of their offence
would make their pardon more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and that a Chriſtian Prince
could not (with conſiſtence) revenge
an injury with ſo much ſeverity. By
this means he wrought upon <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi>
who would have rather been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated,
had he gone about to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
their crime: beſides it would
have appear'd as if he had approv'd
their Inſolence, and been an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
in their Sedition.</p>
                  <p>It is great advantage to an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
when his Auditors believe him of
their own perſwaſion; which is not
impoſſible though he indeavours to
diſſwade them. There is no Opinion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50222:196"/>
whatever in which all things are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
falſe or unreaſonable: Without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to the truth, we may ſide at firſt
with that Opinion which we deſign
to ſubvert, by commending that in it
which is true, and worthy commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For example, a Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts
from its lawful Soveraign, forces
the power out of his hands, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
it among ſeveral perſons depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Govern. Love of Liberty is
reaſonable and juſt; ſo our Harangue
is to begin with amplifications upon
Liberty, and at length inſinuating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people that Liberty is greater
under a Monarchy, than under a
Common-wealth, (where the Tyranny
is exerciſed by a greater number) we
gain the point, and make uſe of the
ſame paſſion that provok'd them to
revolt, to reduce them to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With the ſame method of prudence
we diſintangle people from thoſe for
whom they have an unreaſonable love,
againſt whom great care is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that we fall not into a blunt and
immediate declamation.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>O
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50222:197"/>
Romans,</hi> never was man more bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and munificent than <hi>Spurius Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi>
he ſpent freely, preſented liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to oblige you was very profuſe
in his expences; But have a care he
be not ambitious: that his Largeſſes
be not ſnares, and his Preſents the
price of your liberty.</p>
                  <p>Humility is the beſt of Virtues; it
is the companion of Innocence, and
ſeldom to be found in a Criminal.
Criminals cannot endure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
by their faults, and therefore
'tis no eaſy matter to gain thoſe whom
we deſire to correct. Nevertheleſs
when a vicious man is effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that his crime is pernicious;
that love to his Intereſt is the cauſe
of his reprehenſion: when he knows
the Speaker to be wiſer, and capable
of perceiving the Conſequences of his
ill ways better than himſelf, he ſuffers
his admonition patiently, as a man in
a Gangreen ſuffers the amputation of
the part.</p>
                  <p>That which makes admonition ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times ineffectual, is the inſolence
and imperiouſneſs wherewith it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50222:197"/>
When we would correct a
guilty perſon, and hope to reclaim
him, it is enough that we diſplay
before him modeſtly what was his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to have done, without upbraiding
him by what he has actually done.
Some things are not ill in themſelves,
but for want of ſome circumſtance:
Such things may be commended, but
we muſt make it appear they were
not done with due circumſtances of
place and of time.</p>
                  <p>That a Criminal may not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
and aſhamed to acknowledg
his Offence, it is not amiſs to leſſen
and extenuate his Crime by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it with a greater; For fear he
ſhould obſtinately perſiſt and juſtify
what he has done, ſome way is to be
found out to eaſe him of his load:
Some people are ſo refractory they
will never condemn what once they
have done. We muſt ſeparate betwixt
the crime and the perſon, and take
no notice that the Offender was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
till we have brought him in to
condemn his own Crime. This was
the Prophet <hi>Nathan's</hi> Method with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50222:198"/>
King <hi>David,</hi> when he deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him for the Adultery he had
committed; he complained to him
againſt another perſon that was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſame Crime; and when
King <hi>David</hi> had paſs'd his judgment
upon the man, then <hi>Nathan</hi> took his
opportunity, and admoniſhed him
that his Majeſty himſelf was the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
and that he himſelf had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that ſin which his own mouth
had condemn'd.</p>

for the leaſt appearance of truth; yet
it follows not but we may profeſs
love to our Auditors, and inſinuate
into their affections, when our love is
ſincere, and we have no deſign but
the intereſt and propagation of
truth.</p>
                  <p>Pagan Rhetoricians have given the
ſame precepts as we have done, and
Sophiſters have made uſe of them,
which obliges us to ſtricter and more
careful application. A wicked man
is not to be more zealous for Error,
than a Chriſtian for Truth: It would
be a ſhame that Chriſtians ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
their natural means for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the truth, whilſt wicked men
are ſo buſie and induſtrious to deceive.
Theſe ways are good and juſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and every man that has pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and charity makes uſe of them
inſenſibly.</p>
                  <p>How wicked ſoever men be, it is
our duty to love them; we muſt have
compaſſion for their perſons, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

are really pious, have no need to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50222:199"/>
counterfeit; their charity ſhows it
ſelf quite through their diſcourſe; they
pitty the faults of other men, and
bear with them patiently: They cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them gently, and reflect upon
them only on that ſide in which they
are moſt venial. <hi>Monitio acerbitate,
objurgatio contumelia careat,</hi> ſays <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero.</hi>
Piety finds out ways not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,
not to afflict the perſons to be
reprehended; Piety moderates cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and with honey-words ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the bitterneſs of her diſcipline:
In a word, piety does for God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſelf-love and intereſt does for
man: So that the outward conduct of
the one, appears the ſame with the
outward conduct of the other, their
manners of acting being diſtinguiſhed
only by their principles. A good
Chriſtian has no leſs Complaiſance
for thoſe whom he would perſwade,
without any deſign but propagation
of the truth, than a worldling has for
thoſe from whom he looks for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.</p>
                  <p>When I ſayd we were not to diſguſt
our Auditors, I did not adviſe that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50222:199"/>

Men love thoſe things that entertain
them with delight, <hi>Loquere nobis

to entertain people of that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
humour. While a Chriſtian
Preacher has hopes of gaining upon
his Auditors by gentleneſs, 'tis his
duty to uſe it; but when they are
hardned, and will not lay down thoſe
arms which they have taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

but flattery to indulge them:
When prayers avail nothing, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

                  <p>The conduct uſed always by the
Fathers, was to begin mildly; but if

But when he found the Heretick

That 'tis unlawful to uſe ſo unjuſt

ill practice to regulate and clear the
mind of an auditor, to raiſe fumes of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paſſions</hi> are good in themſelves;
'tis extravagance that makes them
faulty. There are motions of the
Soul which incline it to good, and
divert it from evil: which puſh it on
to the acquiſition of the one; and prick
it forward when it is too dull and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
to eſcape from the other. Thus
far there is no evil in paſſion; but
when men follow their falſe Idea's of
Good and Evil, and love nothing but
the World, the Paſſions which were
good in their nature, become bad by
contagion of the object upon which
they are turn'd. Who can doubt but
our Paſſions are bad, when in the
Idea of the word <hi>Paſſion</hi> we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the motions of the Sould with
all its irregularities. If by Choller
we intend the Rages, the Raptures,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50222:201"/>
the Tranſports that trouble our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it muſt be confefs'd that Choller is
an ill thing: But if we take it for a
motion or affection of the Soul, that
animates againſt the impediments
which retard us in the poſſeſſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good; If we take it for a certain
force or power inabling us to contend
and conquer ſuch evils; I cannot ſee
how any man can reaſonably think it
lawful to excite that Choller, and
make uſe of its efficacy to incourage
his auditors in queſt of that Good
which he propoſes to them.</p>
                  <p>In our moſt exorbitant <hi>paſſions;</hi> in thoſe
whoſe objects ſeem nothing but falſe
and pretended good; there is always
ſomething that is really good. Is it
not a good thing to love him that is
handſom, great, magnificent, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
We may then make uſe of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that carries on towards beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and grandeur, and by ſo doing
puts us in action. We may without
the leaſt ſcruple awaken this motion
in the mind of our auditory by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing
the grandeur and beauty of
the thing to which we perſwade them,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50222:201"/>
becauſe it is ſuppos'd we will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what is worthily
great, and what is really beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>Men are not to be acted, but by
motion of their paſſions: Every man
is carry'd away by what he loves, and
follows that which gives him moſt
pleaſure: For which reaſon there is
no other natural way of prevailing
upon men, than this we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.
You ſhall never divert a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
man from his avarice, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
inclination to money, but by
giving him hopes of other Riches of
more prodigious value. You ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perſwades a Voluptuous man from
his pleaſures, but by the fear of ſome
impending diſeaſe, or hopes of ſome
greater delight. Whilſt we are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
paſſion, we are without action;
and nothing moves us from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
but the agitation of ſome
paſſion. The paſſions may be call'd the
Springs of the Mind; when an Orator
knows how to poſſeſs himſelf of theſe
Springs, and how to manage them
wiſely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing is hard to him,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50222:202"/>
there is nothing but he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians will confeſs that ſo many
illuſtrious Martyrs have triumphed
over death, and tortures, only by the
ſupport they received from Heaven:
that ſo many Nuns and Holy Virgins
have ſuſtain'd with their weak bodies
a life full of auſterities, and as it were
worn out with ſtrictneſs of penance,
only by aſſiſtance of the Divine Grace:
But it is clear the moſt wicked are
capable of the ſame actions, and can
do what-ever was done either by the
Holy Virgins or Martyrs, if it falls
out that they cannot ſatisfie their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
Paſſion, but by ſuffering
thoſe pains. <hi>Catiline</hi> was a very
ill man, yet in his Life we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
examples of extraordinary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
and patience; but his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Virtue was only ſubſervient to
his ambition: So I make this reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only to prove that a man is wholly
in our power, when we are able to
ſtir in him ſuch Paſſions as are
proper for our deſign: and therefore
a propugner of the truth is not to

neglect ſo efficacious a means.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> advis'd the Sinner ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, when he bid him do that for
fear of puniſhment which he would
not do for love of juſtice: <hi>Fac timore
paenae, quod nondum potes amore juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</hi>
It would not be difficult to make
a painted Dame abhor paint, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
her that it is an enemy to the
face: the fear of that would poſſibly
affright her from it ſooner than the
love of God. This fear is not without
ſin: But at length the Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
this holy artifice, by the uſe
they made of it. Great confuſions
muſt be open'd; an Impoſtume muſt
be cured by Inciſion: This practice
may eaſily be juſtifi'd, but this is not
a convenient place.</p>

                  <p>THe common way of affecting the

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50222:203"/>
lively ſenſe and impreſſion of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of that paſſion wherewith we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
he ſhould be mov'd. Love is an
affection excited in the Soul by the
ſight of a preſent good. To kindle
this affection in a heart capable of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
we muſt preſent him with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of amiable qualities. Fear has for
its object not only certain evil, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
contingent. To fright a timerous
perſon, we need no more than to make
him ſenſible of the Evils that threaten
him. It is not without reaſon that the
arts of perſwading and well-ſpeaking
are not ſeparated; for the one ſerves
for little without the other. To ſtir
and affect the Soul of a man, it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
not to give him a bare repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the object of that paſſion
wherewith we would animate him; we
muſt diſplay all the riches of our Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to give him an ample and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
delineation that may ſtrike it
home, and leave an impreſſion, not like
thoſe phantaſms that ſlide by ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before our eyes, and are ſeen no
more. To diſpoſe a man to Love it
is not ſufficient to tell him bluntly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50222:203"/>
the thing we propoſe is amiable; we
muſt convince him of its good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
make him ſenſible of them by
frequent and effectual deſcriptions;
we muſt repreſent them with all their
faces, that if they prevail not by their
appearances on one ſide, they may not
fail by being diſplay'd on the other:
We muſt animate our ſelves, and (if I
may ſo ſay) kindle a flame in our
hearts, that it may be like a hot Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
from whence our words may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
full of that fire which we would
kindle in the hearts of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>To treat exactly of this Subject, I
ſhould be oblig'd to ſpeak at large of
the nature of paſſions, to explain them
every one particularly; to tell what
are their ſeveral Objects, what raiſes,
and what aſſwages them: But this
would be to ſtuff into this art both
Natural and Moral Philoſophy, which
cannot be done without confuſion. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
I cannot excuſe my ſelf

of the Paſſions, that is to ſay, of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;

                  <p>
                     <hi>Admiration</hi> is a motion of the
Mind, that converts it upon ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Object, and inclines it to
conſider whether the ſaid Object be
good or bad, that it may either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
or avoid it. It is of Importance
to an Orator to excite this Paſſion in
the mind of his Auditory. Truth
perſwades, but firſt it muſt be known;
and that it may be known, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
he to whom we declare it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys
himſelf to underſtand it. We ſee
every day many Arguments rejected,
that are afterwards approv'd, becauſe
at that time we were not at leiſure to

have reviv'd again, and made a noiſe
in the World, becauſe they are ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                  <p>'Tis not enough therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

we muſt uſe them with extraordinary
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50222:204"/>
addreſs, that may ſurprize the hearer,
make him admire and draw the eyes
of the whole world upon us. I have
read in a certain Author, of a witty
Man who having often preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelf before his Prince about
ſome affair that concern'd him very
much, the Prince never vouchſafing
him ſo much as a look; he reſolved
the next time to preſent himſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
cover'd only with ſome few Figg-leaves.
And it ſucceeded as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd;
for the oddneſs of his habit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſtir'd the curioſity of the Prince,
and carry'd him to him to inquire
who he was, he took occaſion to make
anſwer, and by degrees found oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to propoſe that to him, which
before he had attempted in vain.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> obſerves that
Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> begins his Hiſtory of
our Saviour by ſaying he was the Son
of <hi>David,</hi> and of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he ſhould have ſayd <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> to oblige the Jews to read
his Hiſtory with more attention; for
the Jews expected the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> from
the Line of <hi>David:</hi> and therefore
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50222:205"/>
nothing was more like to win upon
their attention, than to ſpeak to them
of a Son of <hi>David.</hi> All Books that
are read, all Orators that are heard,
have ſomething or other extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
either in the matter or manner
of what they treat, or in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of time and of place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Admiration</hi> is follow'd by eſteem,
or contempt. When we obſerve any
thing good in the Object on which
we look with Application, we eſteem
it, we deſire it, we love it. For this
reaſon, as you ſee, we eſteem nothing
properly, but what is true, what is
great, and what is handſome. When
we value ill things, it is either becauſe
we are deceiv'd in our judgments, or
becauſe we conſider them only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to appearance. A deceitful Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
perſwades only for a time, and the
eſteem and love of his Auditors,
turns into hatred and contempt, as
ſoon as they find themſelves delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>The Object of <hi>Contempt</hi> is mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and error; that Paſſion is never
excited but when the Soul perceives
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50222:205"/>
nothing in its Object, but meanneſs
and error. To this Paſſion we do
willingly incline; it is pleaſing, and
flatters the ambition that men have
naturally for ſuperiority and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.
We do not properly contemn
any but thoſe who we look upon as
Inferiors. We look down upon them
with divertiſement, whereas it is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
to lift up our eyes in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of what is above us. Other
Paſſions ſpend and diſturb us, but this
refreſhes, and is uſeful to our health;
and indeed this paſſion may be call'd
rather the repoſe than commotion of
the Soul, becauſe the Soul ſeems qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and at eaſe in this paſſion, though in
others it labours and is diſturb'd.</p>
                  <p>Yet all contempt is not pleaſing, for
if the evil that is its object be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it affects us with fear, which is
really an affliction; but where the
Evil touches us not too near, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us not too much, the contempt
that follows is accompanyed with
laughter, and ſo commonly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
with great and unexpected joy.
There is no way ſo effectual for the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50222:206"/>
turning a man from an Error, as to
make it appear contemptible. There
is nothing we apprehend more, than
to be rendred ridiculous and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
to the world. Therefore a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
peice of Rallery has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
better effect than the ſolideſt

                  <p>When we fight with ſtrong Reaſons,
the trouble the adverſary finds to
conceive the conſequence of a ſolid
Argument, confounds him: When we
propoſe to him any thing that is high,
that height dazles and diſcourages
him. But when his buſineſs is only
to laugh and be merry, he applys
himſelf readily, that application
gives him entertainment; and his
contempt of the thing that is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
as ridiculous, flatters his vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and makes him look down upon
the object as a thing infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
him. For this reaſon we eaſily
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50222:206"/>
excite this contempt, becauſe men are
more prone to it naturally than to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,
as they are to ſports rather
than to work. To this may be added,
that ſeveral things are fit to be laught
at, for fear we ſhould give them
weight and reputation by confuting
them ſoberly.</p>

                  <p>SInce it is allow'd us to ſtir and
provoke the Paſſions, thereby to
excite men to action, the art which
we teach of turning things into <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule</hi>
is not to be blam'd, eſpecially
when by ſo doing our deſign is only
to reclaim and inſtruct our auditors;
but then if theſe Ralleries be not
done with diſcretion, they will have
a quite contrary effect. The Poets in
their Comedy's pretend to mock peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
out of their Vices; yet their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
are vain, experience making
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50222:207"/>
too evident that a Reader of this ſort
of Plays, never made any ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.
The cauſe is plain, we deſpiſe
and laugh at only ſuch things as we
think below us, and ſuch as are but
trifles in our eſtimation. We laugh
not at the ill treatment of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:
If Licentious perſons make a
mock of Adultery, and ſuch Offences
as will force tears from a pious man,
'tis becauſe they have not a true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe Crimes, and conſider
them amiſs.</p>
                  <p>Poets in their Comaedies labour not
to give an averſion for Vice, their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
is only to make it ridiculous; ſo
they accuſtom their Readers to look
upon Debauches as inconſiderable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.
From a Play we ſhall never
receive that horrour that is neceſſary
to deter our Concupiſence; the fear
of being laugh'd at will never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
our inclinations to pleaſure:
and we ſee Debauched perſons are the
firſt will laugh at their own extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies.
There are Vices to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
only by oblivion and ſilence,
of which modeſty and good-breeding
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50222:207"/>
will not permit us to ſpeak. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
of an Adulterer never made
any man chaſt, and yet thoſe ſort of
Crimes are generally the ſubject of
Comedy's.</p>
                  <p>The Orator is likewiſe to keep his
<hi>Decorum,</hi> and omit in his <hi>Ralleries</hi>
ſuch things as modeſty recommends
rather to our ſilence. If we be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and honeſt, there will be no need
of advertiſing that we are carefully to
avoid unſeaſonable &amp; ridiculous buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonory's;
and to conſider that nothing
but ill things are fit to be derided:
If the Evil we would deſcribe be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and great, we are rather to
render it horrid and deteſtable. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
in declaiming againſt great
offences, we may begin with <hi>Ralleries,</hi>
if it be but to draw attention from the
hearers, which indeed is the chief end
of thoſe things, and that which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
me to ſet down ſome Rules how we
are to turn things of that nature into
<hi>Ridicule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laughter being a motion excited in
the Soul, when after it has been ſtruck
with the ſight of an extraordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>object,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50222:208"/>
ſhe perceives it very little; to
render a thing ridiculous we muſt find
out ſome rare and extraordinary way
of repreſenting its vileneſs. No parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Precepts can be given for Ralle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Thoſe, ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> who would
give directions for the laughing at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people, would be laugh'd at
themſelves. And yet all tricks and
extraordinary ways are proper, and
may be uſed upon that occaſion, that
is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to diſcover the meanneſs of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
we would render contemptible.
Wherefore the <hi>Ironia</hi> is of great uſe
in theſe caſes; For ſpeaking quite
contrary to our thoughts in terms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and inconvenient with the
thing of which we ſpeak, this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
makes us obſerve it more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually.
When we call a Raſcal <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man,</hi> that expreſſion remembers
us that he is quite another thing. We
cannot better convince a man he is a
Coward, than by putting into his
hands a Sword that he has not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to uſe in his defence. So <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
droll'd with the Prophets of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
when with great yells and cryes
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50222:208"/>
they beg'd of their Idol, that it would
ſend down fire from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
their Sacrifice. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> told them,
<hi>You muſt cry louder, perhaps your God
does not hear you; it may be he is
in diſcourſe with other people; it may
be he is at home; it may be he is upon
the Road; it may be aſleep, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be awaked but by more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
noiſe.</hi> And this way of ſpeaking
of this Idol being unuſual, made it
appear impotent and mean.</p>
                  <p>Alluſions are likewiſe proper for
Ralleries, becauſe the difficulty of
underſtanding them makes us apply
more ſeriouſly to the finding out the
ſence, and that application cauſes us
to diſcover it more clearly. So alſo
when we have applauded a thing that
we intend ſhould be ridiculous, and
have advanced it by magnificent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
that raiſe an expectation of
ſome great matter, if on a ſudden we
diſcover its meanneſs, it is manifeſt the
ſurprize makes the hearer attentive,
and by conſequence more ſenſible of
what is ſayd.</p>
                  <p>If we lay a thing open, and leave it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50222:209"/>
quite naked, by diveſting it of all ſuch
qualities as may recommend it to our
eſteem, we make that thing infallibly
ridiculous. <hi>Lucian</hi> relates nothing
of the Gods, and the Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi>
but what the Adorers of the one, and
the admirers of the other, have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
in their <hi>Panegyricks:</hi> Yet <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
in his Writings renders them Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
becauſe he diveſts the Gods
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Wiſe-men of
<hi>Greece,</hi> of thoſe imaginary qualities
which the Antients admired in both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
wherefore we cannot read his Books
without conceiving a contempt for
the Religion and vain wiſdom of the
<hi>Greeks.</hi> Beſides, the very nature of
Dialogues (which is <hi>Lucian's</hi> way of
writing) is very proper to diſcover the
Vileneſs of any thing we would abuſe:
by making every one ſpeak according
to the principles he follows, thereby
we make them their own Informers,
and publiſh what-ever in them is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>EFfectually to <hi>Perſwade,</hi> we muſt
firſt diſpoſe our Auditors to a
favourable attention of what we have
to ſay. Next we are to give them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
of our buſineſs, that they
may have ſome notion of what we are
about. It is not enough to aſſert and
produce proofs of our own, but we
muſt refel the arguments of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary:
When a Diſcourſe has been
long, and 'tis to be fear'd part of what
has been ſayd at large, may have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
the memory of the hearer, 'tis
convenient at the end of our Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
in few words to ſum up what
has been deliver'd at length. So a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50222:210"/>
is properly to conſiſt of five
parts, the entrance, or <hi>exordium;</hi> the
<hi>Narration</hi> or Propoſition of the thing
of which we ſpeak; the <hi>Proof</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of what we affirm; the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation</hi>
of what is alledged by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
in oppoſition; and the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
or recapitulation of all that has
paſs'd through the whole Body of the
Diſcourſe. I ſhall ſpeak of theſe five
parts diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>An Orator in his <hi>Exordium</hi> is to
reſpect three things, the favour, the
attention, and the capacity of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
We gain much upon our audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and inſinuate ſtrangely into their
favour, when at the entrance into our
Diſcourſe we aſſure them that what
we ſpeak is out of our ſincere zeal to
the truth, and for advantage of the
Publick: We work upon their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
when we begin with what is moſt
Noble and moſt Illuſtrious in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of which we ſpeak, and what is
moſt likely to excite a deſire of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the reſt of our Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>A Hearer is ſuſceptible when he
loves, and liſtens to what we ſay.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50222:210"/>
Love opens his mind, and clearing it
from all prae-occupations with which
we hearken to an adverſary, ſhe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
it for the reception of the truth.
Attention makes him penetrate the
moſt obſcure things: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lyes ſo cloſe, but will be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to a diligent and aſſiduous man,
who makes it his buſineſs to inquire
into ſuch things as he is ambitious to
know.</p>
                  <p>I have ſay'd before, that 'tis good
at firſt to ſurprize our auditors with
ſomething that is lofty and noble;
but we are likewiſe to be careful that
we promiſe no more than we are able
to perform; and that after we have
ſoar'd and mounted up to the Clouds,
we be not forc'd to come down, and
crawl upon the ground. An Orator
beginning too high, raiſes in the hearts
of his Hearers a certain Jealouſie that
diſpoſes them to criticize, and gives
them a deſign not to excuſe him, if he
flaggs in his Tone. Modeſty is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at firſt, and gains more upon an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory.</p>

                  <p>SOmetimes we begin our Diſcourſe
by propoſing the Subject of it
without an <hi>Exordium,</hi> which is to be
done ſo as the juſtice of the cauſe we
defend may appear in the ſaid Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
that conſiſts only in the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what we are to ſay, and by
conſequence admits no Rules for its
length. When we are to ſpeak only
of a queſtion, it ſuffices to propoſe it,
and that requires but few words:
When we are to ſpeak of an action, or
rhing done, we are to recite the whole
action, report all its circumſtances, and
make a deſcription of it, that may lay
it before the eyes of the Judges, and
enable them to determine as exactly
as if they had been preſent when the
action was done.</p>
                  <p>Some there are who to make an
action appear as they would have it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:50222:211"/>
do not ſcruple to cloth it with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
favourable to their deſigns,
though contrary to the truth; and
they fancy they may do it, becauſe
their pretence is to advance the truth,
by augmenting the goodneſs of their
Cauſe. It is not neceſſary I ſhould
confute the falſeneſs of this perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for 'tis clear, that if it be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to truth, we make uſe of a lye;
it is an ill thing, becauſe we deviat
from the end of Speech, which was
given us to expreſs the truth of our
Sentiments, though againſt truth it
ſelf; and when we equivocate for
truth, we do that which is diſpleaſing
to her, becauſe ſhe needs not equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to defend her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>We ought therefore to deliver things
ſimply as they are, and be cautious of
inſerting any thing that may diſpoſe
the Judges to give wrong Judgment.
There is no affair but has ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſome agreeable that pleaſe, others
diſagreeable that diſcourage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
our hearers. It is the part of a
skilful Orator to propoſe nothing that
may beget in the hearer a diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50222:212"/>
opinion of what is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>An Orator is to ſelect the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the action he propoſes, and
not inlarge equally upon them all.
Some are to be paſs'd in ſilence, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be touch'd by the by. When
we are to be oblig'd to report an ill
circumſtance, that may diſcommend
the action we would defend, we are
not to paſs it over and proceed, till we
have apply'd ſome remedy to the evil
impreſſion that recitation may make,
for we muſt not leave our auditors in
any ill opinion that they may conceive
thereupon. We muſt ſubjoyn ſome
reaſon or circumſtance to change the
face of the former, and preſent in leſs
odious. You muſt relate the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of his death who was kill'd, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
the perſon you would defend:
Being to ſpeak only in the behalf of
an innocent perſon, at the ſame time
when you relate the manner of the
others death, you muſt add the juſt
cauſes of his death, and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that he who kill'd him, did it by
misfortune, or accident, without any
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50222:212"/>
deſign. We muſt therefore prae-occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
the mind of the Judges, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them with all the reaſons, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and circumſtances that may juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the action, that when it is related,
they may be diſpos'd to examine it,
and confeſs that there was only an
appearance of Crime; and that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it was juſt, becauſe accompanyed
with all the Circumſtances that render
ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> actions innocent. This Artifice is
not only lawful, but it would be a
fault to omit it. We muſt have a care
of rendring verity odious by our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence;
and certainly it would be
great imprudence to deliver things in
ſuch manner as may diſpoſe our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
to give raſh judgment. Men do
take their impreſſions immediatly, and
purſue their firſt judgments, and
therefore it is of importance to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them.</p>
                  <p>Rhetoricians require three things
in a Narration; that it be ſhort, clear,
and probable. It is ſhort, when we
ſay all that is neceſſary, and nothing
more. We are not to judg of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of a Narration by the number of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50222:213"/>
words, but by the exactneſs in ſaying
nothing ſuperfluous. Clearneſs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
this exactneſs; impertinences do
but ſtuff up a Hiſtory, and hinder the
action from being exactly repreſented
to the mind. It is not hard for a good
Orator to make what he ſays proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe nothing is ſo like the
truth that he defends, as truth it ſelf;
and yet for this ſome Cunning is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
ſome Circumſtances are of
that nature, that deliver'd nakedly
and alone, they would become ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and would not be believ'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
back'd and ſuſtain'd by other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances:
Wherefore to make a
Narration appear true (as it is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect)
thoſe Circumſtances are not to
be forgot.</p>

                  <p>Firſt we are to conſider the Subject
upon which we are to ſpeak; we are
to mind and obſerve all its parts, that
we may find out what courſe we are
to ſtere for the diſcovery either of the
truth, or the fallacy. This Rule is not
to be practis'd but by thoſe who
have great latitude of underſtanding;
by thoſe who are exerciſed in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Problems, and in penetrating
the moſt occult things; by thoſe who
are ſo well vers'd in affairs of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that as ſoon as a difficulty is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to them, though never ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50222:214"/>
they can immediatly find out the
knot, and having their minds full of
light and of truth, diſcover without
trouble the inconteſtable Principles to
prove the conceal'd verity of things,
and to convince thoſe of fallacy that
are falſe.</p>
                  <p>The Second Rule reſpects the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Principles upon which we
ground our Argument. The ſource
of all falſe Arguments that are uſed
by men, is our eaſy and raſh ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that things doubtful are true. We
ſuffer our ſelves to be dazled by a falſe
luſtre that we perceive not, till we
find we are precipitated in great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
and oblig'd to conſent to
Propoſitions evidently falſe.</p>
                  <p>The Third Rule reſpects the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of Principles examin'd with
the Conſequences drawn from them.
In an exact Argument the Principles
and the Conſequences are joyn'd ſo
ſtrictly, that having granted the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
we are oblig'd to conſent to the
Conſequence, becauſe the Principles
and the Conſequence are the ſame
thing; ſo what we cannot reaſonaby
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50222:214"/>
deny in the one what we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
in the other. If I grant it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to repel force by force, and to
take away the life of my Enemy, when
I find no other means of preſerving
my own; when it is prov'd to me
that <hi>Milo</hi> in killing <hi>Clodius,</hi> did but
repel force by force, I am oblig'd to
acknowledg that <hi>Milo</hi> is innocent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in effect allowing the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That it is lawful to repel one
force by another, I confeſs that <hi>Milo</hi>
is innocent of the death of <hi>Clodius,</hi>

                  <p>There is great difference betwixt
the argumentation of a Geometrician,
and an Orator. Maxims in Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
depend upon a ſmall number of
Principles: The proofs of an Orator
cannot be illuſtrated but by great
number of Circumſtances that fortifie
one another, and being ſeparated,
would not be capable of convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
In the moſt ſolid Arguments,
there are always ſome difficulties that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50222:215"/>
afford matter of Controverſy to thoſe
who are obſtinate, and are not to be
convinced but by multitude of words,
and by clearing of all the difficulties
and objections that may be made. An
Orator is to imitate a Souldier figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with his enemy. The Souldier
is not ſatisfied with drawing his
Sword, he ſtrikes, and watches to
take the firſt advantage that is given:
He moves up and down to avoid the
inſults of his Enemy, and in a word
aſſumes all the poſtures that Nature
and practice have taught him for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
or defence. The Geometrician
lays down his proofs, and that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                  <p>There are certain tricks and ways
of propoſing an Argument, that are
as effectual as the Argument it ſelf,
which oblige the Hearer to attention;
which make him perceive the ſtrength
of a Reaſon; which augment its
force; which diſpoſe the mind; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it to receive the truth; diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
it from its firſt Paſſions, and
ſupply it with new. Thoſe who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Myſtery of Eloquence, do
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50222:215"/>
not demur or amuſe themſelves with
throngs of Arguments; they make
choice of one that is good, and manage
it as follows. They do ſolidly lay
down the Principle of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
they make it as clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
as poſſible. They ſhow the
connexion betwixt the Principle and
Conſequence deduced from it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to demonſtrate it. They remove
all obſtacles that may hinder the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
from being perſwaded: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
their Reaſons ſo oft, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eſcape from its efficacy: They
repreſent their deſign with ſo many
faces, that we cannot but own it, and
they work it ſo effectually into our
minds, that at laſt it becomes abſolute
Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The Precepts of common Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
touching Proofs, and Refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are not conſiderable: Rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
adviſe us to place our ſtrongeſt
Arguments in the Van and Front of
our Diſcourſe; our weakeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Battle, and keep ſome
few of our beſt Arguments as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.
The natural Order to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50222:216"/>
in the diſpoſition of Arguments;
is to place them in ſuch ſort that they
may ſerve as ſteps to an Auditory to
arrive at the truth, and make among
themſelves a kind of chain to ſtop
thoſe whom we would reduce to the
truth.</p>
                  <p>Refutation requires no peculiar
Rules: When we are able to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
a truth, we can eaſily diſcover
an Error, and make it appear. That
which we have ſayd of the care an
Orator ought to have to demonſtrate
the force of his Principles, and their
connexion with the Conſequences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
ought equally to be underſtood
of the care we are to take to make
the falſe Principles of our Adverſary
remarkable; or if their Principles be
true, to make their Conſequences ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
falſe and unnatural.</p>

                  <p>AN Orator who apprehends the
things that he ſays, may ſlip
from the memory of his Auditors, is
oblig'd to repeat them before he gives
over. 'Tis poſſible thoſe to whom he
ſpeaks are diſtracted and perplex'd
for ſome time; and the multitude of
things that he has profer'd, has not
had room in their minds. It is fit
therefore that he repeats what he ſaid
before, and contracts all into ſuch an
abridgment as may not be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
to the memory. Great number of
words, amplifications, and repetitions
are only for better explication of
things, and to render them more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.
Wherefore after we have
convinc'd our Auditors of the truth of
our Propoſition, and made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it clearly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50222:217"/>
may be laſting; we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
that our Auditory may not looſe
the memory of our Arguments. To
do this, our abridgment and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
mentioned before, ought to be
made in a brisk way, but not ſo as
to be troubleſome. We muſt at the
ſame time awaken the motions that
we have excited, and as I may ſo ſay,
unbind the wounds that we made:
But reading of Orators (among whom
<hi>Cicero</hi> is excellent for Epilogues) will
give you a better notion (than my
words) of the addreſs and cunning to
be us'd in ramaſing and contracting
in the Epilogue, what in the body of
our Diſcourſe was more large and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now finiſh this diſcourſe, in
which my deſign was to give an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
or <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Art of Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
There ſtill remains for Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
three parts of this Art, <hi>Elocution,</hi>
or the manner of diſpoſing our Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Pronunciation:</hi> Of
<hi>Elocution</hi> I have writ a whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe:
<hi>Memory</hi> all the world knows is
a gift of Nature, not to be improv'd
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50222:217"/>
by any thing but exerciſe; for which
no Precepts need to be given: and
<hi>Pronuuciation</hi> is of ſuch advantage to
an Orator, that it deſerves to be
treated on at large; for there is a
Rhetorick in the eye, the motion and
air of the Body, that perſwades as
much as Arguments. When an Orator
with this air begins his Harangue, we
comply immediatly: Many Sermons
well pronounc'd are well receiv'd,
which ill pronounc'd would be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Men are generally content with
the appearance of things. Thoſe who
deliver themſelves with a firm and
emphatical tone, and are graceful in
their <hi>Mine,</hi> are ſure to prevail. Few
perſons make uſe of their Reaſon; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
recourſe is to the Senſe. We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
not what an Orator ſays, but
judg of him by our eyes and our ears:
If he ſatisfies their eyes, and pleaſes
their ears, he ſhall be certain of the
hearts of his auditory. The neceſſity
of taking advantage of our weakneſs,
obliges an Orator (if he be zealous for
the truth) not to deſpiſe Pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
We have certainly many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50222:218"/>
Poſtures that are indecent, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
affected, mean, and not to be
ſuffer'd: There are likewiſe Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in the Voice, that are tireſome
and unpleaſant to the Ear. 'Tis not
neceſſary that we particularize, every
man daily obſerves them. Every Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
has its peculiar tone, its peculiar
geſture, its peculiar <hi>Mine,</hi> which if
good or bad, make a good or a bad O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator:
If good, they contribute not a
little to the conception of what we
would perſwade, and the pains that
we take to pronounce things well, will
neither be vain nor unprofitable. But
in Books or Writing it will be more
vain. Rules for Pronunciation cannot
be well taught, but by experience and
practice.</p>
