            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>4. Experience, and examples of all ages, from the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on downeward clearely prooue the point. At this time, as you see, the Saints of God were all harboured vnder one roofe, and yet not all sound there. Suruey the ages after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: The time of <hi>Abraham;</hi> who was as a brand taken out of the fire of the Chaldeans: The time of <hi>Elijah,</hi> when none appeared to that blessed man of God: The time of <hi>Esaiah,</hi> who cryed, chap. 53. 1. <hi>Who hath beleeued our report?</hi> The time of <hi>Manasseh, who built altars for all the host of Heauen, in the two Courts of the House of the Lord:</hi> The time of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> when he commanded the Sanctuarie, and holy people to bee polluted with Swines-flesh, and vncleane beasts to be sacrificed, the abomination of desolation to bee set vp vpon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6825:11"/>
the Altar: That darksome time, when the glorious Day-Star, Christ Iesus himselfe, came downe from Heauen to illighten the earth: The time of Antichrist, <hi>when all the world won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred after the Beast:</hi> Our times, wherein, of sixe parts of the earth, scarce one of the least is Christian. And what a deale of Christendome is still ouer-growne with Popery, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exorbitant distempers in point of Religion? And where the Truth of Christ is purely, and powerfully taught, how few giue their names vnto it? And of those who professe, how many are false-hearted or meerely formall?</p>
            <p>5. Me thinks worldly wisdome should rather wonder that any one is wonne vnto God; then cry out, and complaine; Is it possible, there should be so few? Sith all the powers of darknesse, and euery diuell in hell oppose might and maine the plantation of grace in any soule: sith there are moc snares vpon earth, to keepe vs still in the inuisible chaines of darknesse and sinne, then there are starres in heauen: sith euery inch, euery little artery of our bodies, if it could, would swell with hellish venome to the bignesse of the greatest <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> the mightiest Gyant, that it might make resistance to the sanctifying worke of the holy Ghost: sith our soules na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally would rather die, and put off their immortality and euerlasting being, then put on the Lord Iesus: In a word, sith the new creation of a man is holden a greater worke of wonder, then the creation of the world.</p>
            <p>6. Lastly, let vs set aside in any Country, Citie, Towne, Family: First, all Atheists, Papists, and distempered exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birants, from the blessed Truth of doctrine taught in our Church: Secondly, all Whoremongers, Drunkards, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Lyers, <note n="i" place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fourthly, all grosse Hypocrites, whose outsides are painted with superficial flourishes of holinesse and honesty, but their inward parts filled with rottennesse and lust; who haue their hands in godly exercises, when their hearts are in hell. Fiftly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6825:11"/>
all formall Hypocrites, who are deluded in point of Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as were the foolish Virgins, and that proud Pharise, Luk. 18. 11. Sixthly, all finall back-sliders, of which some turne sensuall Epicures, and plunge themselues into worldly pleasures, with farre more rage and greedinesse, by reason of former restraint by a temporarie profession; others become scurrill deriders of the holyway; some, bloody goads in the sides of those with whom they haue formerly walked into the house of God, as friends. Seuenthly, all vnsound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors for the present, of which you would little thinke, what a number there is: I say, let these and all other stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the purity and power of godlinesse be set apart, and tell mee how many true-hearted <hi>Nathaneels</hi> wee are like to <note n="k" place="margin">Non possumus negare plures esse malos, &amp; tam plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, vt inter cos prorsus non appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentgrana in areâ.

               <hi>Vses:</hi> 1. Trie then the truth of thy spirituall state by this marke of a sober and sincere singularitie.

But if with a mercifull violence thou bee pulled out of the world, by the power of the Word, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily weaned from the sensuall, insensible poison of all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-sweet pleasures; and fellowship with vnfruitfull workes of darknesse; If by standing on Gods side, and hatred of <hi>all false wayes,</hi> thou art become <hi>the Drunkards song,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> was, and a by-word amongst the sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> as was <hi>Iob;</hi> If the world lowre and looke sowre vpon thee for thy looking towards Heauen, and thy good-fellow companions abandon Thee, as too precise; <hi>If thy life be not like other mens, and thy waies of another fashion,</hi> as the Epicures of those times
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6825:12"/>
charged the righteous man, when the booke of Wisedome was written; In a word, if thou walkest in the narrow way, and be one of that little flock, which liues amongst Wolues,<note place="margin">Luk. 10 3.

            <p>It is strange! men are content to be singular in any thing, saue in the seruice of God, and saluation of their soules.

They would with all their hearts be in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour alone, and adored aboue others. They would dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not suffer a poore mans house to be within sight. They affect singularitie in wit, learning, wisedome, valour, worldly reputation, and in all other earthly precedencies; but they can by no means endure alonenesse, and singularity in zeale, and the Lords seruice. In matters of Religion, they are resolued to doe as the most doe, tho in so doing they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly damne their owne soules, Math. 7. 13.

There are some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions of Gods loue, which arise meerely and onely out of the absolute will of God, without any concurrence of Christs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; As the eternall purpose of God, whereby Hee hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to chuse some men to saluation; this is an action of Gods loue meerely rising out of His absolute will, without Christs merits. For Christ is a Mediatour, and all his merits are the effects of his loue, not the cause of it. And yet this loue, though it be not for Christ, yet is it in Christ,</hi> Ephes. 3. 11. According to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6825:14"/>
the eternall purpose, which hee wrought in Christ Iesus our Lord: <hi>that is, in regard of the execution of it; for euen this eternall purpose, and all the actions of Gods loue, which arise from his absolute Will, are effected, and brought to passe in and through Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Wee may take an estimate of the absolute, and infinite frankenesse of this vnconceiueable loue of God to his, which reacheth from euerlasting, to euerlasting, by looking vpon that goodly, faire, sweete, amiable creature described, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel 16. In the beginning of the Chapter, shee lies most fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and foule, tumbling in her owne blood, pittied by no eye, abhorred of all; which loathsomnesse should rather haue begot loathing, then loue: auersion and hate, then affection, and liking: yet God Himselfe doth there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, out of a melting pang, and ouer-flowing abundance of His free grace, that, that time was vnto Him the time of loue: Hee spred his skirt ouer her, and couered her naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. In a word; after she was dressed, and adorned with Gods most skilfull mercifull hand, she became a most louely thing: First, washed with water, cleansed from blood, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed with oyle; then cloathed with broidered worke, shod with Badgers skinne, girded about with fine linnen, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with silke, decked with ornaments of siluer and gold; with bracelets vpon her hands, a chaine on her necke, a iewell on her forehead, earerings in her eares, and a beautifull Crowne vpon her head; fedde with fine flower, honie and oyle; so that she became exceeding beautifull, and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the whole World, for her perfect comelinesse, euen mine owne comelinesse, which I put vpon her, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uses:</hi> 1. All praise then is due vnto <hi>Iehoua,</hi> the Author of all our good, the Fountaine of all our blisse, the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of immortalitie and life, whereby we liue, and moue, and haue our being; our naturall being, the beeing of our outward state; our gracious being, the euerlastingnesse of our glorious state.

We may, and are bound, to blesse God for all the meanes, instruments, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes, whereby it pleaseth God to conferre, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey good things vnto vs: but we must rest principally, with lowliest thoughts of most humble and heartiest praiseful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, at the Well-head of all our welfare, <hi>Iehoua,</hi> blessed for euer. Wee receiue a great deale of comfort, and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Moone and Starres; but wee must chiefly thanke the Sunne: from the greater Riuers also; but the maine Sea is the Fountaine. Angels, Ministers, and Men may pleasure vs; but <hi>Iehoua</hi> is the principall. Let vs then imitate those Lights of Heauen, and Riuers of the Earth; do all the good wee can with those good things God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs by his instruments; and then reflect backe towards, and returne all the glory and praise vnto the Sunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and Sea of our saluation. The beames of the Moone and Starres returne as farre-backe to glorifie the face of the Sunne, which gaue them their beauty, as they can possibly, vntill they be reflected, or determine by necessarie expiration, the Sunnes eiaculatorie power being finite: Let vs semblably euer send backe to Gods owne glorious Selfe, the honour of all His gifts, by a fruitfull improouement of them, in setting forth His glory, and by continuall feruent eiaculations of praise, to the vtmost possibilitie of our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts.</p>

Godly Parents doe infinitely more desire to see the true feare of God planted in their childrens hearts, then, if it were possible, the Imperiall Diadem of the whole Earth set vpon their heads. And therefore their principall care is, and the Crowne of their greatest ioy would bee, by good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, religious education, daily instruction, louing admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, seasonable reproofes, restraint from wicked company, the corruptions of the times, &amp;c. by all dearest meanes, and vtmost endeauours, to leaue them gracious, when they goe out of this world.

            <p>3. Children are ordinarily apt, out of a kindly instinct of naturall louingnesse, from many and strongest motiues, to imitate, and follow their Parents, either in basenesse, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carriage, to Heauen, or Hell.</p>

A father that truly feares God, dare not for his heart heape vp riches, or purchase high roomes for his children, by wrong-doing, or any wicked waies of getting; whereupon, both he and his fare farre the better, and happily decline the flaming edge of those many fearefull curses denounced in Gods Book, against all vnconscionable dealers.

For whereas the bloody knife of prophane mens vnconscionable and cruell negligence in training vp their children religiously, doth sticke full deepe in their soules; and leauing this life, they bequeath vnto them the curse of God, together with their ill gotten goods: he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finds his conscience, by reason of his former thirsty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

If wee will needs bee our owne caruers for things of this life, either by right or wrong, fraud or faire dealing, all is one, so that wee may thriue and grow great in the world; then are we iustly cast off from all mercifull care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, and exposed to ruine and curse. But if wee rest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely for our selues and ours vpon the all-powerfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, it will neuer faile, nor forsake vs, but euer exercise, and improoue its sweetnesse and wisedome, for our true and euerlasting good.</p>

               <hi>Doct.</hi> That constancie is euer an inseparable Attendant vpon true Christianitie. But because a double constancie is heere implyed: 1. One in respect of continuance of time: 2. Another in respect of opposition to the corruptions of the times; I may obserue two points.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Grace once truely rooted in the heart, can neuer be remooued. See for this purpose, Rom. 11. 29. Mat. 24. 24. 1. Ioh. 2. 19, 27. Ioh. 10. 28. Rom. 8. 35. Luk. 22. 32. 2. Cor. 1. 21, 22. Ephes. 4. 30, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Reasons may be taken, from</p>
            <p>1. The dearenesse, strength, constancie, inuiolablenesse of God the Fathers loue vnto His Children. It is dearer then a Mothers to her sweetest Babe, Isa. 49. 15. It is stronger then the mountaines, Esa. 54. 10. It is as constant as the courses <hi>of the Sunne and Moone and Starres; of the day and of the night,</hi> Ier. 31. 35, 36. and 33. 20, 21. It is as sure, as God Himselfe, Psal. 89. 35, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:6825:20"/>2. Christs triumphant session and intercession at His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand. Which may for euer, with sweetest peace, and freedome from slauish trembling, assure vs of our rooted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Christ, constancie in grace, and euerlasting abode with him in the other World. Hee that will rent vs from Christs mysticall Body, being once implanted into Him by a liuely fruitfull Faith, and blessedly knit vnto Him by His Spirit, as fast as the sinewes of His precious Body are knit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His bones, His flesh to his sinewes, and his skinne to His flesh; must pull Him out of heauen, and remoue Him from the right hand of His Father. What so furious or infernall power can or dare lay a finger on vs in this kinde! Hee hath taken the poisoning power out of euery thing, that should hurt vs, or hale vs backe to hell. He hath conquered, captiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, carried in triumph, and chained vp for euer all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our soules, and enuiers of our saluation. They may exercise vs in the meane time for our good; but they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to execute their malicious wils, or any mortall hurt vpon vs, either heere, or in the next life.</p>
            <p>3. The irreuocable obsignation of the blessed Spirit, Eph. 1. 13, 14. &amp; 4. 30. And who or what, can or dare, reuerse the Deede, or breake vp the Seale of the holy Ghost?</p>
            <p>Heere then, as you see, the blessed Trinity is the vnmooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ground of our going on in grace.</p>
            <p>4. The lasting and immortall power of the Word, once rooted in a good and honest heart, Luke 8. 15. 1. Pet. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>6. The force and might of Faith, 1. Pet. 1. 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>7. The efficacie of Christs Prayer, Luk. 22. 32. Ioh. 17. 15, 20. Rom. 8. 34.</p>
            <p>8. The durable vigour of sauing graces, Ioh. 4. 14. Rom. 11. 29.</p>

Let new Conuerts and Babes in Christ, who are woont to bee very fearefull and much troubled, lest they should not hold out, because vpon their first entrance into the wayes of Christianitie, they are cunningly and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently encountred with so many oppositions: From the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, which then rageth extraordinarily: From the World, which then tendereth moe and more alluring baites: From the Flesh, which naturally is very impatient of any spirituall snaffle: From carnall Friends, who cannot endure their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse: From their old Companions, who cry out, They are turning Puritanes: From the Times, which lowre and looke fowre vpon their zeale: Sometimes from the Father which begat them; from the Mother which gaue them suck; from the Wife which lies in their bosome; from a world of enemies to grace: I say, in such a case let them graspe in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6825:21"/>
armes of their Faith, the proofes and promises in the present Point, and <hi>ride on, because of the Word of Truth.</hi> Let them sweetly, with full assurance, and vnconquerable resolution, repose vpon that euerlasting encouragement, for the finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their spirituall building, which Zerubbabel receiued from the mouth of God Himselfe, for successe of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, a Type of this: <hi>Not by might and power, but by my Spirit,</hi>

Presume not vpon any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without an humble inflamed affection; neither build too much vpon the heate of zeale, without the light of knowledge: Either of these may be single in some, and that in singularitie, who after may fall away shamefully.</p>
            <p>5. Aboue all, looke vnto thy heart. If thy change were Angelicall, in words, actions, and all outward carriage, and yet thy thoughts still the same and reserued: thou art but a guilded Tombe, and cannot bee <note n="n" place="margin">Ier. 4. 14.</note> saued. Let a man take a Wolfe, beate him blacke and blue, breake his bones, knocke out his teeth, cut away his clawes, put vpon him a Sheepes skinne, yet still hee retaines his Woluish nature: Let a man become neuer so harmelesse outwardly, yet without a new heart, all is naught.</p>
            <p>6. Incorporate thy selfe into the company of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by all engagements and obligations of a profitable, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and comfortable fellowship in the Gospell. There is a secret tie vnto constancie in the communion of Saints. Hee is not like to walke long, that walketh alone, especially, if he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6825:22"/>
might enioy good company. Shunning society with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is too shrowde a signe of a temporarie.</p>
            <p>7. Consider well, (for the contrary is a notable discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of counterfeits) that thy calling to grace must settle thee more surely in thine honest particular calling; and make thee therein more faithfull, conscionable, and painefull.</p>
            <p>Let Christians also of longer standing, and more strength, in their assaults about perseuerance, haue recourse vnto this Tower of Truth, and labour to preuent that which they feare:</p>
            <p>1. By constancie, in a carefull vse of all the meanes; the Word, Prayer, Conference, Meditation, Sacraments, &amp;c. To which, let them preserue appetite: and practise that they heare, without omission or delay. Hee that giues way to a heartlesse neglect, or customarie hardnesse of heart, in the vse of the Ordinances, may iustly suspect his neerenesse to some fearefull sinne, or fierce temptation; to some heauy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or dangerous Apostacie.</p>
            <p>2. Assoone as they discouer any spirituall weakenesse, or decay; assault, or temptation; let them complaine betime vnto the Throne of Grace, and mightily oppose with the feruentest prayers of extraordinarie priuate humiliation.</p>
            <p>3. Let them keepe perfection still in their eye, and aime; and towards the attainment thereof, acquire and acquaint themselues with Rules of holy life, daily directions, courses of most mortified men, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. Let them watchfully decline all occasions of falling backe: Spirituall pride, knowne Hypocrisie, desire to bee rich, vnder-valuing &amp; declining the most searching meanes, forme, and perfunctorinesse in religious duties, discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of intimatenesse with the godly, neglect of distractions vpon the Lords Day, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. Let them consider that all is lost which is past, if they fall off, 2. Ioh. 8.</p>
            <p>This former Point of constancie in grace, did arise from consideration of blessed <hi>Noahs</hi> continuance in goodnesse through so many ages: Now in that hee did not conforme to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6825:23"/>
the iniquities of the times, but did stand vnstained, amidst the wickedst generations that euer dwelt vpon earth; I collect the necessitie of another constancie, and that is in respect of opposition to the corruptions of times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The seruant of God must not serue the times. Or thus: The true Christian ought to stand at staues end with the corruptions of the time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason.</hi> Hee is bound vnto it by his Baptisme. Of such as prophaned themselues, being Christians, with irreligious delight in the Ensignes of Idolatry, heathenish spectacles, showes and stage-playes, <note n="o" place="margin">Lib. de spectat. cap. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Hee is <hi>not of the world, Ioh.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>His life is hid with Christ in God, Colos.</hi> 3. 3. There is a secret heauenly vigour infused into euery gracious Soule, by the sanctifying Spirit, which deads it to the world, and makes it delight in God. He ought <hi>to shine in the world, as a light in the midst of a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and peruerse nation, Phil.</hi> 2. 15. Light and darknesse can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure one another; neither the power of Grace, those workes of darknesse in which the world lyes drowned. Hee is by no meanes to <hi>bee conformed to this world, Rom.</hi> 12. 2. nor to runne with the wicked to the same excesse of riot, 1. Pet. 4. 4. He is now new-borne, and become a Child of Eternity; whereby his heart is fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e in loue with new and euerlasting delights; and the eye of his soule turned from the dung of this world, towards the glory of the second Life. As the worldling cannot rellish the sweet ioyes of gracious exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: so neither can the Christian, the frothy pleasures of good-fellowship. You can as hardly draw the sound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor to a Conuenticle of swaggering companions; as a good-fellow to a day of humiliation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vses:</hi> 1. Howsoeuer then, thou mayst seeme to stand on Gods side, by an artificiall acting of some affected formes in Religion, by countenancing the Ministerie, if thou beest a great Man, and outwardly conforming to the Ordinances; yet, if in thy practise thou beest plunged into the corruptions of the present, and thine heart hanker still, and hunt in secret
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6825:23"/>
after youthfull delights, the lusts of men, most applauded fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions of the greater part, thou art not a Christian in truth, but a true counterfeite. Assure thy selfe, if thou swim downe the current, and saile with the tide of the time, thou mayest iustly looke euery moment, to fall vpon the sudden, perhaps<note place="margin">Psal, 11. 6.</note> in the height of thy temporall happinesse, and hottest gleame of thy worldly glory, into the irrecouerable and euerlasting Lake of brimstone and fire, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. Let euery one, who hath giuen his name vnto Christ, euer hold it his Crowne and comfort, to hold a strong and vnconquerable counter-motion to the courses of the world. Let him still discouer the true noblenesse of his Christian spirit, and of a mind spiritually generous by gathering vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and growing inuincible, from the very oppositions of the wicked, and villanies of the time. See Psal. 119. 126, 127. 1. King. 19. 14. 1. Thes. 2. 2.</p>
            <p>It was the saying of a morall Heathen; <hi>That to doe well, where was no danger, was a common thing; but to doe well, where was both perill and opposition, was the peculiar office of a man of vertue:</hi> much more, say I, of a man of God.</p>

            <p>Sutable hereunto is the concurrent iudgement, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our best Diuines, and worthiest Writers, graciously <hi>instructed vnto the Kingdome of Heauen.</hi> These are their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall assertions to the same sense, in their owne words:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A man can haue no peace in his conscience, that fauoureth and retaineth any one sinne in himselfe against his conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>A man is in a damnable state, whatsoeuer good deeds seeme to be in him, if he yeeld not to the worke of the holy Ghost, for the leauing but of any one knowne sinne, which fighteth against peace of conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>So long as the power of mortification destroyeth thy sinfull affections, and so long as thou art vnfainedly displeased with all sinne, and doest mortifie the deeds of the body by the Spirit, thy case is the case of saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>A good conscience stands not with a purpose of sinning; no, not with an irresolution against sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>The rich and precious boxe of a good conscience is pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made impure, if but one dead Flie be suffered in it.</hi> (He meanes, any one knowne sinne, lyen and delighted in impenitently.)</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Where there is but any one sinne nourished and fostered, all other our graces are not onely blemished, but abolished, they are no graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>Most true is that saying of</hi> Aquinas; <hi>That all sinnes are coupled together, though not in regard of conuersion to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall good; for some looke to the good of gaine, some of glory, some of pleasure, &amp;c. yet in regard of auersion from eternall Good, that is God; So that he that lookes but toward one sinne, is as much auerted, and turned backe from God, as if he looked to all. In which respect Saint</hi> Iames <hi>sayes, He that offendeth in one, is guiltie of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>Euery Christian should carry in his heart, a constant and</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:6825:26"/>
               <hi>resolute purpose, not to sinne in anything: for faith, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of sinning can neuer stand together.</hi>

Thou shalt then bee so farre from euer enioying any humble holy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with our God, that thou art gone body and soule for euer. One breach in the walles of a Citie, exposeth it to the surprize of the enemy: one leake in a ship neglected, will sinke it at length into the bottome of the Sea: the stab of a penknife to the heart, will as well speed a man, as all the daggers that kild <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Senate-house: If thou hedge thy Close as high as the middle Region of the Aire in all other places, and leaue but one gap, all thy grasse will bee gone: If the Fowler catch the bird, either by the head, or the foote, or the wing, she is sure his owne. It is so in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case: If thou liue, and lye with allowance and delight, in any one knowne sinne, without particular remorse, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to part with it; thou as yet carriest the Diuels brand, he hath thereby markt thee out for his owne. As obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is vniuersall and Catholike, if sincere; so repentance, if true, is also generall. <hi>It s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As the flood drowned</hi> Noahs <hi>owne friends and seruants: so must the flood of repenting teares drowne our sweetest, and most profitable sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The premonition therefore I tender in the first place, is this: Thou canst neuer possibly be fitly qualified, either for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6825:26"/>
the right vnderstanding, or sauing practise of this sacred and sweetest Art, of walking with God; except thou resolue, to stand for euer sincerely at the swords point against all sinne. Euen thy bosome sinne must be abandoned, if thou look for any blessing in this kinde: Thou must put off the shirt from thy sinfull soule; for as the shirt is to the body, so is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued sinne to the soule; it sticks closest and neerest, and is done off with most adoe.</p>
            <p>And because this darling-pleasure, minion-delight, <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum in delicijs,</hi> as the Fathers call it, is Satans strongest Hold, his Tower of greatest confidence and securitie, when he is driuen out elsewhere, and so by consequent most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull and peremptorie to keepe a mans heart estranged with largest distance, and incompatible auersion from all holy acquaintance with God; I will in short labour to illighten, and dis-intangle any one, who vnfainedly desires an vtter diuorce from this bosome-deuill; by telling him, first, what it is: secondly, what his is: thirdly, how he may be deceiued about it.</p>
            <p>1. As in euery man, there is one element, one humour, and ordinarily one passion predominant; so also one <note n="h" place="margin">Quemadmodum nemo tam perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, aut flagitiosus inuenitur, quin ab aliquo vitio magis qnam à caeteris, abhorreat: sic ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo tantae sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis est, quin ad vnum aliquod peccatum, quàm ad caetera propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sior sit, <hi>Cartw in Prou. pag.</hi> 1262. <hi>Much more then in his state of nature.

And it is that which his corrupt, and originall crookednesse, vpon the first electiue suruay, and prospect ouer the fooles Paradise of worldly pleasures, fleshly lusts and vanities of this life, by a secret sensuall inclination, and bewitching infusion of Satan, singles out, and makes speciall choice of, to follow and feede vpon, with greatest delight, and predominant sweetnesse: afterward, by custome and continuance, growes so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and attractiue, that it extraordinarily endeares, and drawes vnto it the heate of all his desires, and strongest wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of his heart, with much affectionate impatiencie, and headlongnesse: and at the height, by an vnresistable tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it makes all occasions and occurrences, friends and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, the deepest reach of policie, and vtmost proiects of wit, Religion, conscience, credit with the world, the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall possibilitie of body, soule, outward state, seruiceable, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6825:27"/>
contributarie vnto it, as the Captaine, and commanding sin; as to the Deuils vice-roy, domineering in the wasted consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In some, it is worldlinesse, wantonnesse, ambition, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posicion to godlinesse, vsurie, pride, reuenge, or the like: In others, it may bee drunkennesse, the swaggering vanitie of good fellowship, gluttony, pleasures of Play-house hanting, gaming, scurrill iesting, &amp;c. obstinate insatiablenesse in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed recreations, idlenesse, or such like.</p>
            <p>2. Thou mayest discouer it by such markes as these:</p>
            <p>1. It is that, which thy truest friends, thine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the finger of God in the Ministerie, many times finds out, meetes with, and chiefely checks thee for.</p>
            <p>2. It is that, which if it breake out into act, and be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the eye of the world, thine enemies most eagerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, and obiect, as matter of their most insultation, and thy greatest disgrace.</p>
            <p>3. That which thou art lothest to leaue, art oftenest tempted vnto, hast least power to resist, and which most hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the resignation and submission of soule and body, of all thy courses and carriage, heartily and vnreseruedly to the Word and will of God.</p>
            <p>4. It is that which God oftnest corrects in thee, euen in the interpretation, and guiltie acknowledgement of thy selfe-accusing heart. It may be, at seuerall times thou hast bin afflicted with some heauy crosse in thine outward state, losse of a child, some fits and pangs of bodily paine, terrours and troubles of mind, or some such proportionable visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: now in all these, and like afflictions, vpon the first smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apprehension, thy conscience, if any whit awaked, on its owne accord seized vpon that sinne we now seeke for, as the principall <hi>Achan</hi> and author of all thy misery.</p>
            <p>5. If euer thou wast so sicke, as out of extremitie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue sentence of death against thy selfe, and despaire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie; if thy conscience was stirring, this sinne afrighted thee most, and gaue the deadliest blow to driue thee to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall despaire. And if thou shouldest die in it without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which God forbid, it would infuse most hellish vigor,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6825:27"/>
and venome, into the neuer-dying worme, which would thereby more mightily gnaw vpon thy conscience, thorow all eternitie. If euer the sword of the Spirit shall cleaue it from thy bosome, which is infinitely to bee desired, and strike thorow thy sensuall heart with true remorse, it will cost thee the bitterest teares, most sighes, and deepest groanes.</p>
            <p>6. It is that, which thou art lothest, and wouldst least be acknowne of. If it were possible, thou couldest be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that no <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> should euer heare of thy <hi>Herodias.</hi> And therefore thou bearest thy braines, and improouest thy wit, to deuise (if it be capable of dawbing) distinctions, eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, excuses, extenuations, whole cart-loades of fig-leaues, to colour and cloke this soule Fiend, though fauourite to thy bewitched soule.</p>
            <p>7. That, which thou art in a bodily feare, the Minister will meddle and meete with, when thou art going towards a conscionable, and searching Sermon. For thou thinkest with thy selfe, If this day he disclose my bosome, I shall both be disgraced amongst my neighbours that know it, and cast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so into dumps, and melancholy by his denouncing of terrour against it.</p>
            <p>8. Thoughts, plots, and proiects, about it, a thousand to one, ordinarily seize vpon thine heart, with first and most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable entertainement at thy very first waking; if they haue not broken off thy sleepe, and troubled thee in thy dreames.</p>
            <p>9. The cares, pleasures, and appurtenances of it, are woont to thrust, and throng vpon thee on the Lords Day, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary eagernesse, importunitie, and vnresistablenesse. For the Deuill that desires to haue thy mind most distracted vpon that Day, makes choyse of the fittest, and pleasingest baites, to draw away and detaine thy heart, and the most al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring obiects, for diuersion.</p>
            <p>10. In the darkenesse, and discomforts of the night, if thou beest sudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly awakened with some dreadfull thunder, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or terrible tempest, the guilt and accusations of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued

sinne is wont to come into thy minde in the first place, and with greatest terrour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a man may be deceiued, in conceiuing, that hee is vtterly diuorced, and quite deliuered from his bosome sinne, and yet it bee but a meere exchange, or some other mistake. This grosse, affected selfe-imposture, may be seene in such cases as these:</p>
            <p>1. He may change onely the outward and visible forme of it. For instance: Whereas the same sinne of couetousnesse doth vtter and expresse it selfe by vsury, simony, sacriledge, bribery, grinding poore mens faces, crushing, and vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keeping vnder the poorer of the same trade, stealing, ouer-reaching by tricks of wit, all manner of wrong-doing, all kinds of oppression, detaining ill-gotten goods without restitution, &amp;c. he may insensibly glide out of one gulph of griping crueltie, into another; he may fall from one of these, being a more notorious, &amp; cursed trade of hoarding, to some other of them lesse obserued, and odious in the world, &amp; yet still abide in the <hi>chambers of death,</hi> and vnder the tyranny of a reigning sinne. The soule sinne of vncleannesse doth actuate it selfe by fornication, adultery, selfe-pollution, brutish, and immoderate abuse of marriage, and such other abborred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities. Now, hee may passe from one of these pollutions, more crying and abominable, to some other of them, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting the conscience with such grislinesse &amp; horror, and yet still lye in the impenitent and damnable shares of lust.</p>
            <p>2. He may surcease, and refraine from the outward grosse acts of such hatefull villanies; and yet his inward parts bee still defiled with insatiable sensual hankerings after them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull reuoluing them in his mind, &amp; contemplatiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of them. For instance: He may hold his hand both from the crying violence of oppressions and wrong, and the closer conueiances of cunning and fraud; and yet couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may still reigne in him, by the earthly exercise of the heart. He may forbeare the externall acts of vncleannesse, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> lie and languish abominably in speculatiue wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and adulteries of the thought; the visible executions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6825:29"/>
of reuenge, and yet nourish in his distempered affections, the hellish Vipers of heart-burning hatred, and spite; all indirect ambitious climing into high roomes, and yet be passingly proud, and ouer greedie of precedencie.</p>
            <p>3. Nay, he may change the kinde of his bosome sinne, in respect of matter, forme, obiect, euery way; and yet vpon the matter, it is but the exchange of one foule fiend for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For instance: wantonnesse may bee his sweete sinne in youth, and worldlinesse in old age: reuelling in his yonger yeeres; downe-right drunkennesse in his declining time: prodigalitie may sway in some part of his life; pinching in some other: Hypocrisie may raigne at one time; Apostacie at another: furious zeale for one while; prophane irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse for another.</p>
            <p>4. When the blasting frosts and feeblenesse of old age, haue with a sott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

of bringing againe his beloued sinne in his bosome to the Communion, after so many causefull prouocations of Diuine Iustice; obseruation of some remarkeable vengeance seized vpon his fellow-delinquents; or sensible smart of some terrible blow from Gods visiting hand in one kinde or other: I say, vpon some such occasion, he may for a time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare his bloudy oathes, vsury, drunkennesse, gaming, Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house haunting, selfe-polluting, walking <hi>in the blacke and darke night after the strange Woman,</hi> or what other sinne soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doth reigne in him, and retaine him strongliest in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils slauerie. But because it is not the worke of the Word, humbling him soundly vnder Gods mighty hand, planting faith, and infusing mortifying power, he is not able to hold out long; but the <hi>vncleane spirit</hi> returnes, and rules in him againe farre more imperiously, and sensually, out of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of its discontinuance, and proportionally to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties new-collected strength, and eagernesse, to recommit it, after his extraordinary, and impatient forbearance. I know, it is not impossible, but that a man, after his conuersion, by the sudden surprizall of some violent temptation, and cunning traine of Satan, may bee haled backe to commit his sweete sinne againe; especially if it bee of some nature, (though it be a very heauy case, and to bee lamented, if it were possible, with teares of blood:) yet hee neuer doth, nor can returne to wallow in it againe, or allow it. After such a dreadfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse, his heart bleeds afresh with extraordinarie bitternesse of penitent remorse, hee abhors himselfe in dust and ashes, as exceedingly vile, cries more mightily vnto God in a day of humiliation, for the returne of his pleased countenance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires and fortifies the breach with stronger resolution, and more inuincible watchfulnesse, against future assaults, and all assayes of re-entry. But now the temporarie I talke of, after his formall enforced forbearance, engulphs himselfe againe, with more greedinesse, into the pleasures and sensualitie of his bosome sinne, lies, and delights in it againe, as the very life of his life, and hardens himselfe more obstinately in it, as a thing impossible to leaue, and liue with any comfort.

Doe you not thinke, that many drunkards would as well liue in murther, and vpon the spoile, as in their present abominable swinish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; did they not hold it a more horrible thing to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, than to pay fiue shillings, or sit in the stocks? Would not many at Sermon time, rather be in the Ale-house, than in the House of God, were not the constitutions of men a curbe vnto their corruptions? Would not some desperate wretches as well strike thorow at once, and quite dispatch those they hate, as kill them all the yeere long, with their cruell thoughts and bloody malice; were not thought free, and actuall murther death by the lawes of men? Would not many malicious Papists, thinke you, as well speake traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously of the King, as teare Gods glorious name with their oathes, and blasphemous tongues; were they not terrified with feare of Tyburne? It may be so proportionably in mens behauiours towards diuine Lawes, the holy Statutes of Heauen, and that highest Tribunall.

            <p>I feare me, there are too many abroad in the world, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially great Ones, who by forbearance of other grosse sinnes, to which their sensuall affections are not so endeared, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performance of some holy duties, formall presence at religious exercises, countenancing, and patronage of godly Ministers and good men, hope to make amends, as it were, and to purchase protection and dispensation, for the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance

noted to be on the best side. In a word, such fellowes as these, out of a base and vnblessed ambition to be well spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by all, though a woe waites vpon such, Luke 6. 26. furnish themselues, both with a forme of profession to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Christians, and flourishes of good-fellowship to please the prophane.</p>
            <p>6. Others there are, who may gloriously pretend, and protest with great brauery and confidence, their assent and assistance to the best and holiest courses; put on a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry counterfeite profession, and fashionable conformity to the communion of Saints; that thereby they may passe more fairely and plausibly, out of one calling into another: from a baser, lower, more neglected, and toilesome Trade, into some other of more liberty, acceptation and ease: or else breake out of all Callings; and so, by the vnhallowed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of a sacred coozening, if I may so call it, liue vpon their profession; and by amusing the tender consciences of weake Christians, with the controuling and countermanding ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies, as it were, of an affected furious zeale, sucke out of them no small aduantage, and prey too plentifully vpon the people of God. Such as these, are ready to pretend, and intimate, that such base, earthly, and worldly imployment, and spending of their time, is disgracefull, and derogatory to the prouidence of God, and their Christian liberty: that with vnworthy detainments, and auocations, it interrupts them in the pursuite of their generall Calling; disables and hinders them in the discharge of holy duties. But let them know, that Christianity, if sound and true, doth not nullifie, but sanctifie our particular Callings.

            </p>
            <p>1. What sonne or daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> can challenge and plead exemption from that common charge laid vpon them by the Lord of Heauen: <hi>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate</hi>

            <p>2. Diligence in a ciuill Calling, is necessary for a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prouision of earthly necessaries.</p>
            <p>3. Hee is a cursed Drone, a child of idlenesse and sloth, the very Tennis-ball of temptation, most vnworthy the blessings and benefits of humane societie; who doeth not one way or other cooperate, as it were, and contribute to the common Good, with his best endeauours in some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest particular Calling.</p>
            <p>4. A seasonable imployment in a ciuill Calling, is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne preseruatiue, and curbe for preuention of infinite swarmes of idle, melancholike, and exorbitant thoughts; and for restraint from many wicked and vnwarrantable medlings and miscarriages.</p>
            <p>5. An honest Calling, is a Schoole of Christianitie. In which a man performing duties for the Lords sake, may dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit in the practise and increase of many heauenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Faith, Obedience, Patience, Meekenesse, Constancie, Truth, Fidelitie, Inuocation, Thanksgiuing, experience of Gods prouidence, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A true Conuert therefore is so farre from casting off his personall Calling; that after his calling to Christianitie, he is woont to discharge the duties thereof with farre more care and conscience, though with a better minde, more moderate affections, and for a blesseder end.</p>

Loue therefore, and labour to liue by the power of faith, the life of saluation, sanctification, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. 1. Of saluation, thus: Let thy truely-humbled soule, grieued and groaning vnder the burden of sinne, throw it self into the meritorious, and merciful armes of Iesus Christ, wounded, broken, and bleeding vpon the Crosse; and there let it hold, and hide it selfe for euer in full assurance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, by vertue of that promise, Ioh. 3. 36. <hi>Hee that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth on the Son, hath euerlasting life.</hi> For hauing thus laid hold vpon him, He by his Spirit doth communicate first himselfe vnto thee; then both the merit of his death for remission of thy sinnes; and of his actiue obedience for thy right to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and happinesse; and withall, the power of his Spirit, to quicken thee to the life of grace in this World, and to raise vp thy body to the life of glory at the last day. 2. Of sanctification: If thou keepe thy <hi>faith,</hi> the fountaine, roote and heart, as it were, from which all thine other graces spring, in life and vigour, thou shalt pray more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, bee more couragiously patient, heare the Word more fruitfully, receiue the Sacraments more ioyfully, passe the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6825:37"/>
Sabbaths more delightfully, conferre more cheerefully, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate more heauenly, walke in all the wayes of new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with more strength, and conquest ouer corruptions. For ordinarily, euery Christian shall finde the exercise of other graces to bee comfortable, or cold, according to the liueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or languishing of his faith. 3. Of preseruation, both temporall and spirituall.</p>
            <p>In crosses, afflictions, and all Gods outward angry visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the power of such promises, as those, Psal. 89. 33. and 50. 15. Heb. 12. 7, 8, 11. 1. Thes. 3. 3. Act. 14. 22. Luke 9. 23. Isai. 63. 9.</p>
            <p>In the course and carriage of thy particular Calling: the duties and workes whereof, if thou discharge with consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, diligence, and prayer, thou mayest goe on with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, contentment, and freedome from that torturing and racking thoughtfulnesse; from those restlesse and cursed carkings of carnal worldlings, wherein they basely languish, and lose their soules; and leaue the successe, issue, and euent of all thy labours and vndertakings vnto the Lord, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it may bee, resting sweetly, and euer relying vpon that gracious promise, Heb. 13. 5. <hi>I will neuer faile thee, nor forsake thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ordering and guiding the affaires of thy family, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend by faith vpon Gods blessing, the strength and sinew of all sound comfort, and true contentation that way. See Psal. 127.</p>
            <p>In the losse of outward things for thy loue, and seruice vnto God; by beleeuing that Man of God, 2. Chron. 25. 9. <hi>The Lord is able to giue thee much more then this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, in the losse of all earthly things in euery kind: see Habac. 3. 17, 18. <hi>Although the fig-tree shall not blossome, neither shall fruit be in the Vines: the labour of the Oliue shall faile, and the fields shall yeeld no meate, the flocke shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalles: yet I will reioyce in the Lord: I will ioy in the God of my saluation.</hi> Consider also for this purpose, <hi>Iobs</hi> patient blessing of God vpon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and concurrence of an vniuersall misery, Iob 1. 21.</p>

            <p>In oppositions against the raising or restauration of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall buildings by the Ministery of the Word: or in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against a mans personall progresse, and holding out against Gods waies vnto the end; by renouncing our owne strength, disclaiming the arme of flesh, and crying in euery encounter: <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith</hi>

            <p>In languishings and tremblings after relapse into some old, or fall into some new sinne; by such precious places as these: 1. Ioh. 2. 1. Luk. 17. 4. 1. Sam. 12. 20. 1. Iohn 1. 9. From this last place a reuerend Diuine collects this comfort: <hi>If we see our vnworthinesse, and with broken hearts acknowledge it, God is faithfull and iust to forgiue it, bee it neuer so great.</hi> But this is a iewell fit onely for the eare of a sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, when out of the fearefulnesse of his distrustfull spirit, he puts off all comfort, though truely humbled, after ensnare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in some more speciall affrighting sinne. Let no swine trample vpon it.</p>
            <p>In all kindes of temptations, by the power of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, 1. Cor. 10. 13. Nay, euen amidst varietie of them by obeying that precept, Iam. 1. 2. <hi>My brethren, count it all ioy when you fall into diuers temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In spirituall desertion, by refreshing, and resting thy sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing soule, in the meane time vntill the Lord returne, vpon that surest Rocke, Isa. 30. 18. <hi>Blessed are all they that waite for him.</hi> Most blessed, deare, and sweetest Sanctuary!

            <p>In the valley of the shadow of death; by an assurance of Gods mercifull omnipotent presence, Psal. 23. 4.</p>
            <p>In the extremitie &amp; depth of such desperate distresses, and perplexities; wherein in thy present feeling, thou canst see, and find no possibilitie of helpe from Heauen or Earth, God or Man; but art both helpelesse and hopelesse, as the Church complaines, Lam. 3. 18. by such like places as those, Isai. 33. 9, 10. 2.

            <p>Thus in any trouble of soule, body, good name, outward state, present, or to come; thou mayest by the soueraigne power of faith working vpon the Word, not onely draw out the sting, and expell the poison of it; but also create a great deale of comfort to thy truly-humbled soule, and maintaine it in despite of all mortall or infernall opposition, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant spirituall gladnesse.

and therefore are as sure, as God himselfe: they are sealed with the bloody sufferings of his onely Sonne, and therefore as true, as truth it selfe: and, if thou be in Christ, are all as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely thine, as the heart in thy body, or blood that runnes in thy veines.

He that will take shewes from the substance of Religion, let him take brightnesse from the Sunne, glistering from Gold, breathing from a liue-body.

Thou mayest iudge no man rashly, nor of his finall estate: (If we see a malefactour cast, and condemned for some grieuous crime, yet reprieued vnto the next Assize; no man can say, he shall be certainely hanged, because a pardon may be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and come from the King in the meane time: it is so in the present case.) But thou mayest call a spade, a spade; a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, a drunkard; an vsurer, an vsurer.

All earthly-minded men ordinarily, howsoeuer they may be outwardly restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reserued, are secret deriders of the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, holy strictnesse of the Saints, and mysteries of Grace. <hi>And the Pharises also,</hi> saith <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 16. 14. <hi>who were coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, heard all these things: and they derided him:</hi> euen mockt, and made themselues merry with the searching, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piercing Sermons of the Sonne of God.

            <p>2. Or consider Him in relation to thy selfe; and shouldest thou euery moment thorow an interminable time, lay down ten thousand liues for His sake, thou couldest neuer come neere the requitall of the least inch of His infinite loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, which reacheth from euerlasting, to euerlasting. 1. He bore thee in the bosome of this His free loue from all eternitie, and that so dearely, that from the same eternity, He decreed that His owne deare Sonne should die for thee. 2. Hee brought thee out of the abhorred state of being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, into the ranke of his reasonable and noblest creatures. 3. Hee bought thee againe, when thou hadst wilfully lost thy selfe, with the hearts-blood of His onely Sonne. 4.

What a deale of loue then doth the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord of all goodnesse, the well-spring of all beauty, excellencie, and sweetnesse exact at our hands? especially

Prize the fruition of Gods pleased face, a neerer communion and acquaintance with His blessed Maiestie, the loue and light of His countenance; and thereupon a free and frequent accesse, with an humble boldnes, vnto the throne of Grace, at a far higher and more vnualuable rate, than heauen and earth; as a very reall fruitfull fore-taste of eternall ioyes. For to say no more at this time; If thou hold an holy familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with thy God, and He looke pleasedly vpon thee, thou shalt graspe Iesus Christ more sweetly and feelingly in the armes of thy Faith; partake more plentifully of the ioyfull freedome, presence, and communication of His comforting Spirit; be garded more strongly and narrowly by His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels; sucke more sweetnesse and heauenly Manna out of the Ministerie, and other His blessed Ordinances; walke in safetie amongst the creatures, like an vnconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lyon: <hi>Thou shalt bee in a league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee: when thou goest, thy gate shall not be straite; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not fall: when thou sleepest, thy sleepe shall be sweet; thou shalt dwell safely, and none shall make thee afraid: Thou shalt neuer more be afraid of any euill tidings, or of destruction when it commeth: when thou passest thorow the waters, thy God shall bee with thee; and thorow riuers, they shall not ouerflow thee: when thou walkest thorow the fire, thou shalt not bee burnt; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall the flame kindle vpon thee, &amp;c.</hi> And if at any time thou bee seized vpon with any crosse or calamitie from any of the creatures; any trouble or temptation, from man or Deuill; any lowring or crueltie from the iniquitie of the times, or persecuters of the Truth; yet the refreshing beames of Gods pleased face shining vpon thy heart, through the darknesse of such discomforts, will sweetly mitigate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue, and infinitely make amends for all.

Let the noblenesse of thine inlarged Spirit, as infinitely disdaine to be any wayes, vpon any termes, in bondage to the corruptions of the times; so finde a farre sweeter rellish, and take incomparably more contentment in the seruices of thy Lord, and his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, then in all his outward benefits, and fauours of this life.

3. Striue to hold thy heart in heate, as well in confession as deprecation; in deprecation as petition; in intercession as for personall blessings; as well for puritie of heart, as pardon of sinne, thorowout; though there may bee difference of heate, and crying vnto God, according to the necessitie and neerenesse of the passage in the prayer, to our particular, or the more vniuersall good desire. Prayer is the creature of the holy Ghost, euery part whereof, we should heartily wish, and earnestly wrastle, that He would proportionably ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate as it were, and thorowly enlyue, euen as the soule doth the body.</p>
            <p>For the third, with all intention and watchfulnesse, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and presse after the things prayed for, by a timely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, fruitfull exercise, and vtmost improuement of all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, ordinances, helpes, and heauenly offers, which may any wayes concurre to the compassing of them. For instance: Thou prayest for knowledge: walke then, when thou hast done, with a constant indeauour, in the strength of this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thorow all the meanes, reading, hearing, conferring, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising (for euen that also is a meanes to increase knowledge, Ioh. 7. 17. especially experimentall) catechizing, &amp;c. for the storing of thy vnderstanding with all sacred illuminations and holy sences of Gods sauing Word. Let no opportunitie passe, be violent in catching all occasions, for the enriching thy braine with such heauenly stuffe, and hoarding vp in thine heart such hidden treasures. <hi>If thou cryest after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, and liftest vp thy voyce for vnderstanding,</hi> Chap. 2. 3. there is the prayer; <hi>If thou seekest her as siluer, and searchest for her, as for hidden treasures,</hi> vers. 4. there is the endeauour: <hi>Then shalt thou vnderstand the feare of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God,</hi> vers. 5. there is the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: see Psal. 27. 4. Againe, thou prayest to be preserued out of ill company: thou doest well: but when thou hast done, doest thou make conscience of that counsell of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prou. 4. 14, 15. and by the power and impression thereof, confront and oppose the cunning inticements, &amp; cursed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of thine old companions, and brethren in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?

There must be good doings, as well as good duties. He that doth not earnestly, and in good sadnesse afterwards set himselfe against sinnes deprecated, and pursue with zeale and conscience the graces and good things petitioned, his prayer is not worth a button.</p>
            <p>II. Decline idlenesse, the very rust and canker of the soule, the Deuils cushion, pillow, chiefe reposall; his very tide-time of temptation, as it were, wherein hee carries with much ease, and without all contradiction, the currnet of our corrupt affections, to any cursed sinne. And be diligent with conscience and faithfulnesse, in some lawfull, honest, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Calling (a good testimony, if other sauing markes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre of truth, and true heartednesse, in thy generall Calling of Christianitie) not so much to gather gold, and engrosse wealth, as for necessary and moderate prouision for family and posteritie: and in conscience and obedience to that common charge, laid vpon all the sonnes and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> to the Worlds end; <hi>In the sweate of thy face shalt thou</hi>

               <hi>eate bread, till thou returne vnto the ground.</hi> 1. But euer goe about the affaires of thy Calling with a heauenly mind, seasoned, and sanctified with habituall prayer, eiaculato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eleuations, willingnesse, if God so please, to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, and to bee with Christ; pregnant with heauenly matter and meditation, pickt out of the passages of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent businesse. For instance; Let the Husbandman in Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, collect this sacred Soliloquie, and heauenly thought; If I now take not the season, I shall haue no haruest, but starue in winter. So proportionably; if I gather not Grace in this Sun-shine of the Gospell, and day of my visitation, I shall find nothing but horror vpon my bed of death, and burne in Hell for euer hereafter, &amp;c. 2. In all the ciuill businesses of thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall Calling, let thy eye and aime be vpon Gods glory, as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6825:45"/>
the prime and principall end of all thy actions, 1. Cor. 10. 31. and in them seeke and serue that glorious end of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not so much in procuring thine owne, as the good of Church, Common-wealth, Neighbours and Family, &amp;c. 3. By earthly imployments, do not become an earth-worme. In vsing the world, grow not a worldling, and such an one as findes more sweetnesse and pleasure in worldly dealings, and the comming in of thy Profits, then in thy heauenly traffick and treasures through the practise and trade of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>III. In thy solitarie seasons: 1. Single out some speciall profitable choyce matter to meditate on all the while; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both to preuent the ordinary intrusion of many vaine, foolish, noy some thoughts, impertinent wandrings, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trifling out thy precious time; and also to keepe thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the powers of thy soule aworke, lest as milstones wanting grist, grate and grind one another, they waste themselues in a fruitlesse barren melancholy. When canst thou bee alone, and not haue iust cause, either to busie thy mind about some lawfull affaires of thy Calling; or wrestle with some corruption, which troubles the peace of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or breake out into the praises of God, or some other holy passages of heauenly meditation, whereof there is so great varietie and store? 2.

            <p>In which point to preuent, misconceits and mistakings, consider there is a double fellowship:</p>
            <p>1. Common, <note n="b" place="margin">I haue a ground of this distinction, from a most learned, holy and reuerend Diuine, who speakes thus: In this place, saith he, we be admonished to beware, lest at any time we ioyne our selues to those that are foolish and vngodly.

But to ioyne in marriage with them, to make them priuy to our counsels, or to vse them as more neere and speciall friends, this is vnlawfull, and this is here forbidden, <hi>Greenham, Medit. vpon vers. 7. of Prou. 14.</hi> Nay, the very Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher intimates it in his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nce: There is (saith he) a twofold conuersing: 1. Generall and common, whereunto the times, affaires, the voyages and encounters doe dayly leade, without our choyce or voluntary consents. 2. Speciall, in affected and desired company, wherein there is conference, communication, priuity and familiarity.</note> cold, and more generall. In treading, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayning, buying, selling, saluting, eating and drinking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in other passages of humanity, and entercourse of ciuill society; to which charity, nature, necessity, or the exigents of our generall, or particular calling doe warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably lead vs.</p>
            <p>2. Speciall, deare, intimate: In consultations and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels about matters of speciall secrecy, greatest weight, and highest consequence. In spirituall refreshments, religious conferences, prayer, marriage, all manner of neerest engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In a free vnreserued communication of their soules,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6825:47"/>
mutuall exchange of the thoughts of their hearts, faithfull reuelations of the spirituall state of their consciences one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, and in such like blissefull pangs and passages of Christian loue, and ardent sanctified affection.</p>
            <p>The former of these the Christian must of necessitie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and exercise sometimes with the men of this world; except he will goe out of the world, 1. Cor. 5. 10. But the second fellowship is the Saints peculiar The Christian is bound out by the Booke of God, the Law of heauen, vpon his alleageance to his Lord and Soueraigne, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Charter of Gods children, from conuersing with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull intimatenesse, and from the exchange and exercise of those speciall passages of dearest acquaintance with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane men, children of darkenesse, and enemies of God. For these and the like reasons,</p>
            <p>1. He thereby incurres a double hazard: The one, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with sinne: the other, of infliction of punishment.<note place="margin">He entangleth himselfe with acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ablenesse to scandall, punishment and shame.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>He that toucheth Pitch,</hi> saith the Wise man, <hi>shall be defiled therewith; and hee that hath fellowship with a proud man, shall be like vnto him. Can a man take fire in his bosome, and his clothes not be burnt? Can a man goe vpon hot coales, and his feete not be burnt?</hi> Prou. 6. 27, 28. Neither can any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly and intimately conuerse with a profane man, but he shall be corrupted.</p>
            <p>There is a strange attractiue, and imperious power in ill company, to empoyson and peruert euen the best dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</p>
            <p>1. By holding familiar correspondence with lewd companions, there first steales vpon a man a secret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible dislike of his former sober courses: Hee begins within himselfe to censure, and renounce his former wayes of innocency, and harmelesse conuersation; as too restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and distastfull to the ordinary liberty of youth, and common frailty of flesh and blood; and as too much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweetned, and straitned with vnnecessary strictnesse and abridgement.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, there slyly insinuates into his heart a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6825:47"/>
pleasing approbation, and delightfull assent to the sensuall courses, and sinfull pleasures of his lewd companions.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, there followes a resolued, and habituall change of affections and conuersation, a transformation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the manners and conditions of those with whom he doth so familiarly conuerse.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, he growes ill-affected, and disconceited towards good men and godly exercises, because in their prophane, boysterous, and furious conuenticles of good-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, hee heares them dayly rayled vpon, iested at, bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and slandered; and not a man amongst them to take their parts, and to stand on Gods side. And therefore by little and little, hee himselfe is also transformed into a scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing <hi>Ishmael,</hi> a breathing-Deuill, and so becomes at last, as much the child of hell, as any of that gracelesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and damned crew. Thus, and by such steps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as these, many, many times especially in the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities,</hi> and <hi>Innes of Court,</hi> of good nature, honest dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and perhaps religious education, are by little and little caught and fearefully corrupted, and at length brought to horrible and vtter confusion both of reputation and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state, both of soule and body, by the infectious villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of lewd and naughty companions.</p>
            <p>But ordinarily Gods children are not in such danger from notorious sinners, and from men of such desperate and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate conuersation. For who in his right wits will runne vpon a man which he cleerely sees hath the plague sore running vpon him? What Christian in his right minde spiritually, hauing any feare of God in his heart, life in his soule, or tendernesse in his conscience, will delightfully thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the company of swearers, drunkards, scorners, filthy talkers, prophane iesters, or any fellowes of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous ranke? especially sith the soule is a thousand times more capable of the contagion of sin, then the body of any infectious disease?</p>
            <p>The hurt which the Christian doth take in this regard, is most from meerely ciuill men, as such as onely professe in<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 5.</note>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:6825:48"/>
forme; who being more tolerable and plausible comp an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet disacquainted with the great Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, vnseasoned with the power of inward sanctification, and vnpractised in the wayes of sincerity, doe secretly and insensibly infuse, if not a notorious infection with some scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sinne; yet many times a fearefull defection from zeale, forwardnesse, and feruencie in the wayes and seruices of God. Throw a blazing fire-brand into the snow, or raine, and its brightnesse and heate will bee quickly put out and quenched: let a Christian but for a while abandon his holy conference, and comfortable communion with Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and plunge himselfe into the company of those who are but cold and carelesse, lazie and luke-warme Professors; and he shall in very short time find his zeale to be very much cooled, his forwardnesse abated, the tendernesse of his conscience too much qualified with worldly wisedome; much dulnesse of heart, deadnesse of spirit, drowzinesse, and heartlesnesse in his affections to holy things, and an vniuersall decay of his graces insensibly to grow vpon him.</p>
            <p>In this respect many Christians doe themselues much wrong, and afflict their soules with many vnnecessary spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall miseries. For they doe sometimes vnaduisedly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of kindred, for old acquaintance, aduantage, and carnall contentment, because of the worldly wisedome, immunity from grosse sinnes, and other good parts of the parties, hold a too neere, intimate, and delightfull correspondence with such as are but onely ciuill men, or Pharises at the best, with whom spending most of their time, and they wanting both heart and skill to vphold any holy conferences, or to affoord any reciprocall or mutuall helpe, in the feeling passages of sanctification, are occasions to put Gods Children out of vse and vre with the language of Canaan, from the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many ioyfull considerations, and exercise of those comfortable Meditations, and holy conuersation aboue, which Christian company would occasionally and seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly put into them, and keepe fresh and working in their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6825:48"/>
mindes; and by consequent, bereaue them thereby of much zeale, comfort, feelings of Gods fauour, ioyfull springings of heart, boldnesse in their wayes, cheerefulnesse in the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Religion, and that comfortable fruition of other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues of Christianity; which many other of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren doe, and they, by the benefit of religious compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and delightfull conuersing with the Saints, might plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully enioy.</p>
            <p>Apprehend this passage aright: I say, a Christian may be much worsened and weakened in his graces, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying too much, and conuersing delightfully with the meere ciuill man, or <hi>Whited Tombes:</hi> For he may spend with such men whole weekes, nay, moneths and yeeres, and haue not one word of sanctified discourse, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talke ministred vnto him. Scarce a word to bee had from them of the Word of God, and way to heauen; no conference of the secrets of Sanctification, of perplexities of conscience, of their euerlasting abode together in the Mansions of heauen. Motions that way would bee very irkesome and tedious vnto them: such talke would quickly beget silence, melancholy, sadnesse, and a desire to breake off company. Now the Christian by this meanes, neither hauing his tongue exercised, nor his eares much acquainted with edifying Christian discourse, growes neglectiue of storing his memory with holy things, vnzealous, and cold in the apprehensions of heauen, dull and heartlesse to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties.</p>
            <p>If thus; what infection then from notorious and lewd companions? But aboue all, in this point the fellowship of the Papist is most pernicious; for by him a man is in danger both of hauing his vnderstanding and iudgement corrupted with heresie; and his life and conuersation infected with impiety. There are two steps and passages, as it were, out of the state of prophanenesse, into the Paradise of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. 1. Illumination of the vnderstanding with sauing knowledge. 2. Sanctification of the heart with speciall grace. Now the Papist labours to peruert and impoyson
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6825:49"/>
both. For commonly you shall finde the Papist to be stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and branded with a double marke: Hee receiues one immediately from the Beast, a brand of Idolatry: And Satan commonly fastens vpon him another speciall marke, some notorious and scandalous sinne in his conuersation; as swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, lying, vncleannesse, the vanities of good-fellowship, Sabbath-breaking, or such like. For we must know, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianisme cannot produce sanctification; and therefore you shall commonly finde euery Papist to lye in some raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sinne; howsoeuer formall deuotion is the highest perfection attainable in that Antichristian state. By Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish company then a man is in danger of corruption, both in his vnderstanding, and conuersation: By the lewd, which yet make profession of Gods Trueth, of infection with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriousnesse in conditions: By meere ciuill honest men, and formall Professors, of defection from zeale, and forwardnesse at the least.</p>
            <p>2. As the Christian incurres by the company of prophane men, euident hazard, either of infection with their sinnes, if they bee notorious; or defection from zeale, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, if they be something more tolerable and formall: so he is euery houre which hee is in their company, without a warrantable calling, and iust dispensation out of the Word, and from a good conscience, in great danger of being inuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued within the flames of the iust confusions, and inwrapt within the compasse of those outward curses and plagues which Gods indignation inkindles and inflicts vpon wicked men. All prophane men, being vnreconciled to God, are euery moment liable to all those miseries and fearefull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which either man or deuill, any of Gods creatures, or his owne immediate hand can bring vpon them: They are onely respited and reserued by Gods mercy, and deferred onely vnto those opportunities and seasons, which seeme best and fittest to his holy Wisedome. Now, if when they light vpon them (as they may iustly at any time) any of Gods Children bee found amongst them vnwarrantably and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully, it is righteous with God, that he receiue his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6825:49"/>
amongst them at that time, and bee fearefully infolded within the fury of the greatest temporall visitation. It is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with God, that if his owne Child will needs bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably<note place="margin">See 2. Chr. 20. 37.</note> familiar with his enemy, that he also bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of any temporall plague, especially with his enemy, euen to the losse sometimes of his naturall life. Take then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you the holy counsell of the blessed Apostle, Eph. 5. 7. <hi>Bee not therefore companions with them:</hi> And let his reason fright you out of their company: <hi>Let no man deceiue you</hi> (saith he) <hi>with vaine</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Carnall men will be ready to reply and oppose this precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with varieti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>2. Secondly, there must very shortly bee an euerlasting separation betweene the Christian and prophane men: at the farthest, they must part vpon their death-beds, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer see one another againe vnto the day of Iudgement: and then they must shake hands for world without end. For there is set betwixt them, by Gods immutable and irreuocable Decree, a vast and immeasurable gulfe, which stands as fast and vnremooueable, as God Almightie in his Throne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie; so that they can neuer possibly meete. <hi>Betweene vs</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 16. 26.</note> 
               <hi>and you,</hi> saith <hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich man in hell, <hi>there is a great gulfe fixed, so that they which would passe from hence to you, cannot; neither can they passe to vs, that would come from thence.</hi> If it be so then, that after an inch of time, there must bee betwixt them an endlesse diuorce, and an vnpassable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance through all eternity; it is best for the Christian to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this separation and disacquaintance in time, and not to repose his speciall loue, the sweetest and noblest of all his affections, vpon an obiect where it must not eternally rest, nor intimately conuerse with him, whose company he shall not haue heereafter in heauen euerlastingly. Let him euer onely affoord the dearest pangs of his kindest affection vnto Gods Children, and conuey the swetest meltings of his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6825:50"/>
heart, and the most passionate embracements of his soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their bosomes alone: for he shall be sure to meete them in heauen, and there the lesser streames of their former Christian loue shall grow into a mighty torrent, and falling into the great and vniuersall confluence of the vnited zeales and Seraphicall feruours of all the Saints and Angels, runne with a sweete and euerlasting current, into the bottomlesse and boundlesse Sea of all loue and louely excellencies, God himselfe, blessed for euer.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, a good man conuersing with those which be gracelesse, doth very foully distaine and obscure, if not quite lose his Christian reputation and credit with good men; for a man is still reputed to bee of their humour and conditions, with whom he doth ordinarily and intimately conuerse. <hi>All flesh,</hi> saith the Wise man, <hi>consorteth according to kinde, and a man will cleane to his like. What fellowship hath the Wolfe with the Lambe? so the sinner with the godly.</hi> Now it is a most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull and discomfortable thing, to bee iustly cast out of the conceits and good opinions of iudicious and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Christians. I would haue a Christian neuer much trouble himselfe, or labour with too much curiositie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion, too anxiously, vexingly, and sollicitously to giue the world satisfaction, for the vniust censures, and disconceites of witlesse and worthlesse prophanenesse; (only he may thence take occasion to examine his heart more narrowly, to walke more warily, to liue more holily, and pray more heartily.) Let prophane men rage, and swell, and burst, in despight of gall, I would haue him sweetely and calmely to enioy those blessed comforts, which Gods compassionate hand hath put into his heart. But me-thinks, he should much take to heart, and be very sorry for the iust dislike and disconceit of true Christians, or for any scandall taken vpon good ground, from vnaduisednesse and aberration in his carriage and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As the Christian then desires to be dearely esteemed of the godly, and tenders the preseruation of his good name with good men; <hi>which is rather to be chosen than great riches,</hi> Prou. 22. 1. <hi>than precious Ointment,</hi> Eccles. 7. 1. <hi>and maketh</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:6825:50"/>
               <hi>the bones fat,</hi> Prou. 15. 30. which indeed is the most inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Iewell he possesseth in this life, next vnto his owne Crowne of Christianitie: I say, as he would maintaine and vphold a good opinion and conceit of him, in the hearts and consciences of Christians, let him flye the company of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men: for there is no reason hee should bee reputed Gods friend, who conuerses familiarly with his profest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>4. No prophane man can heartily, and directly loue, and affect a Christian for his zeale and spirituall graces; nay, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and ordinarily he disconceits and hates all holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, wrought vpon him by Gods sanctifying Spirit: 1. Partly by reason of that euerlasting vnreconcileable, and implacable enmitie and antipathy betweene the seed of the woman, and the seed of the Serpent; betweene light and darkenesse; Christ and Belial; Grace and prophanenesse: 2. Partly also, because euery vnregenerate man, though fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the best perfections and excellencies attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ble in that state, thinkes, that his lukewarmenesse, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malitie is censured and condemned by the zeale and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse of the true Christian; and that if those gracious endowments and holy strictnesse be reall, and necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they plainely proclaime the damnablenesse of his estate, which he securely reposes vpon, as sufficient for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, and of a sweet and louing disposition, yet was most heauily prest and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued with much causelesse spite, and this hatred euen for his goodnesse: <hi>They that hate me without a cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>are more then the haires of my head: They that would destroy mee, and are mine enemies falsely, are mighty; so that I restored that which I tooke not,</hi> Psal. 69. 4. And in another place saith hee; <hi>They that hate me wrong fully, are many: they also that reward euill for good, are mine aduersaries, because I follow</hi>

               <hi>goodnesse.</hi> But yet vnderstand this further in the point. The expression and exercise of this hatred of the forwardnesse and zeale in the Christian, which naturally and ordinarily lurkes in the heart of euery prophane man, may bee sometimes restrained
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6825:51"/>
for aduantage, and in policy; by accident, and for by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>respects. The sting and furie of it may be weakened, and lessened by the ingenuousnesse of the vnregenerate man, or by other good naturall and morall parts in the Christian. Nay, I doe not see, but that sometimes it may bee, as it were, quite dasht, and confounded by the extraordinary innocency, and heroicall height of spirituall excellencies in a good man: As Moralists say of vertue, that though it be ordinarily atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by enuy, as the body with a shadow, yet it may grow so incomparable and glorious, that enuy is glad to hide its head, and flie away like a weake mist from the Sunne shining in his strength. Assoone as vertue, say they, is growne out of ignorance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she entreth by and by into enuy, till mounting aloft, as the Sunne being verticall abateth all shadowes; so she in the top, and height of perfection, all enuie. Why may it not be so in zeale and pietie, that though it be ordinarily persecuted with extreme hatred; yet sometimes it may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that extraordinarinesse, incomparablenesse and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that hatred may euen hate it selfe, for opposing such vnreprooueable sanctitie? But to my purpose: If it bee so, that a prophane man cannot possibly loue a Christian hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for his Christianitie and Grace, but rather maliciously and mortally hate him; what heart can a Christian haue to conuerse intimately and delightfully with a prophane man? Who would euer vouchsafe his company, and afford the best of his time, and dearest of his affections, to a fellow, which disdaines and despises the most precious Iewell hee beares about him, I meane, his religious zeale; and labours power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, though insensibly, to dimme the brightnesse, and distaine the glory of it; either by the contagion of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriousnesse, or at least, by his formalitie, coldnesse, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zealousnesse?</p>
            <p>5. Fiftly, no Christian ought to enter league, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fellowship with the enemies of God. It is absurd, that a member of Christ should exercise familiaritie, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate passages of loue with a limbe of Satan. What earthly Prince could endure with patience, to haue one of his neerest
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:6825:51"/>
seruants, and of chiefest trust, to bee conuersant continually amongst profest Rebels, and open Traitors to his Crowne and dignitie; or to conuerse intimately with his deadliest enemie? Would any great Man in the State, retaine any as a speciall fauourite, who should bee inward with his greatest counter-factionist? What ingenuous child would delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully digest that company, wherein hee should heare his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a foule and shamefull manner disgraced and rayled vpon? How then should Almighty God hold him his friend, who is familiar with strangers to the life of God, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to his Grace? How can that man looke for the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, and protections of a child of God, who haunts such company with delight, where he heares daily his Almightie Father foulely, and shamefully dishonoured, perhaps, with oathes and blasphemies, with obscenities and raylings; at least, with many idle and prophane speeches?</p>
            <p>6. Sixthly, conuersing with prophane men, doth crosse and ouerthrow a common Christian dutie, which is this; <hi>In all companies, either doe good, or take good, or both.</hi> For in this case, the Christian both takes hurt, and doth hurt: he hurts, 1. himselfe, because he throwes himselfe vpon temptation, and hazard of being infected with notoriousnesse, if his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions be very lewd, and prophane; or at least, with forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and coldnesse; if they be but only ciuilly honest, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall professors. 2. He hurts also others: 1. Hee hardens his companions in their vnregenerate courses, because they thinke, he would not so familiarly conuerse with them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee were well conceited of their spirituall state; and so they rest with securitie and confidence in their vnregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. Hee is a stumbling blocke to the weake Christian, who by looking vpon his example, may bee led awry from the straight path of his profession, and by taking thereupon libertie of imitation, may haue his young beginnings of Grace choaked and smothered by the delightfull vanities of good fellowship, in the presse of prophane company. 3. He grieues also strong and vnderstanding Christians, to see him so far forget himselfe, and disgrace his profession, as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:6825:52"/>
to conuerse with the enemies of God, and by his practise to perswade the world, that the base fooleries of good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, are more sweet and tastefull, then the glorious pleasures of the communion of Saints.</p>
            <p>7. There is another reason, which though it be not very obuious to mens apprehensions, or much taken notice of; yet in my vnderstanding, it should be very powerfull, and of very great weight, to driue Christians out of the company of vnregenerate men, &amp; to restrain them from a familiar and delightfull correspondence, and conuersing with them (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they haue a warrantable Calling, and the testimonie of their consciences to conuerse with them for their conuersion and spirituall good.) It is this: when an vnregenerate man obserues, that a Christian presseth into his company, desires to spend time with him, and is well enough content to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change mutually many offices of intimate kindnesse; hee presently conceiues and concludes, that sure hee sees in him matter worthy of Christian company, and endowments suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ranke him amongst the Saints; else hee could not take such contentment in his conditions and conuersation. Whereupon hee is fearefully hardned in his present courses, and settles with resolution, confidence, and security vpon the plausible deceitfulnesse of his vnregenerate state; and thinks himselfe well, that hee may both enioy the pleasures of the present, and also a good testimony and hope of his rightnesse in the way to Heauen; because it is well knowne and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that his companion both knowes, and walkes in the right path. And sith he hath one to take part, he takes it not much to heart, that other Christians are more vnfami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and strange vnto him; for hee imputes it onely to their sowrenesse and vnsociablenesse. Assuredly, there are many Christians very faulty this way, and haue very much to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for in this kind. They familiarly conuerse with vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men; and because they would not displease and bee distastefull, they say nothing vnto them of the cursednesse of their condition towards God, and of the fearfulnesse of their case, in respect of saluation. Hereupon they grow into a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:6825:52"/>
conceit, that they are well conceited of their spirituall state, and so walke farre more resolutely and confidently towards Hell, by reason of the societie and silence of their Christian companions. I thinke verily, that prophane men doe not onely sometimes desire the company of Christians, to win reputation from the better sort, and to guild ouer the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse of their conuersation with some little tincture, and lesser splendour reflected from the glory of their Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but also to purchase some counterfeit comfort to their consciences, and false hope vnto their hearts, that their case is the better towards God, because Gods children vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to keepe company, and conuerse more familiarly with them.</p>
            <p>8. But aboue all, for this purpose peruse often, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well, 1. The effectuall prohibitions in Gods Booke: 2. the protestations and practise of the Saints, 3. and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments inflicted for familiaritie with the vngodly.

clothe the same thing with diuers formes of speech, and varietie of phrase.</p>
            <p>2. Now in a second place: If thou desirest to conuerse with some of thine vnconuerted kindred, friends, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, old acquaintance, &amp;c. for their spirituall good, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue these three rules: 1. Let there bee good probabilitie, proportionably, of more power of grace, knowledge, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, spirituall wisedome, Christian resolution, &amp;c. in thee to conuert them, then poison of vnregenerate stubbornnesse, sensuall malice, sinfull wit, worldly wisedome, Satanicall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistrie in them, to peruert thee. 2. See that thy heart be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and that in the singlenesse thereof, thou seeke truely their conuersion, and not thine owne secret contentment: for in this point, thine owne heart will bee ready to deceiue thee. Thou mayest offer thy selfe into such company, with pretence and purpose to sollicit them for saluation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with them about the best things; and yet before thou be aware, bee plunged and insnared in the woonted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable delights of good fellowship, pleasant passages of wit, idle and impertinent follies and familiarities, which thou wast accustomed to exchange and enioy with them in thy vnregenerate time. So that in stead of the discharge of a Christian duty, thou mayest both hurt thy selfe, and harden them. 3. As Physicians of the body arme and animate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with strong repercussiues, preseruatiues, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poysons, when they visit contagious and pestilentiall pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: so in such cases, be thou sure to furnish and fortifie thy selfe before-hand with prayer, meditation, the sword of the Spirit, store of perswasiue matter, strength of reasons, and vnshaken resolution, to repell and beate backe all noysome insinuations of spirituall infection.</p>
            <p>3. Into Christian company, which thou shouldest prize thine only Paradise and Heauen vpon Earth; the very flowre and festiuall of all thy refreshing time in this vale of teares, euer bring 1. A cheerefull and lightsome heart. Me-thinks, though thou shouldest come amongst the Saints with a sad heart, and something ouer-cast with mists and clouds of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6825:53"/>
heauinesse and discomfort; yet the presence and faces of those, whom hereafter thou shalt meet in Heauen, and there, with incomparable ioy behold for euer, clothed and shining with eminencie and eternitie of glory, should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse and dispell them all, and infuse comfortable beames of heauenly lightsomnesse and spirituall mirth. I know them, who being cast sometimes full sore against their wils, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst profane company, are quite out of their element all the while, strucke dead in the place, as they say, as solitary as in the silentest Desart. But let them come amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and they are quite other men, as full of lightsomnes and life, as full of heart and Heauen, as if they had the one foot in the Porch of Paradise already-Sadnesse is not seasonable, where such precepts as these haue place; <hi>Be glad in the Lord. and reioyce, yee righteous, and shout for ioy, all yee that are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart.</hi> 2. A fruitfull heart, full as the Moone with gracious matter to vphold edifying conference, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied talke. Being forward and free without any hurtfull bashfulnesse, or vaine-glorious aime, both to communicate to others the hidden treasures of heauenly knowledge, which thou hast happily digged out of the precious quarry, as it were, of the great mystery of Grace, &amp; also by moouing of questions, and ministring occasion mutually to draw from them with an holy greedinesse the waters of life, for a reciprocall refreshing and quickning of the deadnesse and vnheauenlinesse of thine owne heart. And here it will bee a profitable wisedome, to take notice of, and obserue each others singularitie of gifts, and seuerall endowments, and thereafter with wise insinuations, to prouoke and presse them, to powre out themselues in those things, wherein they haue best experience and most excellency. Some are more dexterous and skilfull in discussing controuersed points: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in resoluing cases of conscience; some, in discouering the Deuils depths, and treading the Maze of his manifold temptations: others, in comforting afflicted spirits, and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the heart of mourners in Zion, &amp;c. I am perswaded many times, many worthy discourses lie buried in the brests
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6825:54"/>
of vnderstanding men, by reason of the finfull silence, I think I may say so, and barrennesse of those about them. And therefore Christians ought to be more forth-putting, actiue, and fruitfull this way. 3. An humble heart, ready and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to exchange and enioy common comforts, soule-se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, heauenly consultations, with the poorest and most neglected Christian. If thou bee haunted with the white Deuill of spirituall pride, it is likely thou wilt bee either too prodigall and profuse, and so ingrosse all the talke, which is sometimes incident to new conuerts or counterfeits; or else too reserued and curious, and so say no more then may serue to breed an applause and admiration of thy worth; which is a very filthy and fearefull fault. There is no depth of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, no height of zeale, no measure of Grace; but may be further inlarged, more inflamed, blessedly encreased by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the poorest faithfull Christian: See Rom. 1. 12. and 15. 24. how <hi>Paul,</hi> that great learned and diuinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired Doctor of the Gentiles, stood affected in this point.</p>
            <p>V. But aboue all, bee most busie with thy heart: for it is the roote that either empoysons or ensweetens all the rest; that is the fountaine, which causes all the streames of thy desires, purposes, affections, speeches, and the whole current of thy conuersation, to runne either muddy or cleere. Ply therefore amongst others, these three points of speciall and precious consequence for the present purpose, with all seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and zeale.</p>
            <p>1. Captiuation and conformitie of the thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of thy heart, to the soueraignty and rules of grace. If thy change in words, actions, and all outward carriage were Angelicall; yet if thy thoughts were the same, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified still, thou wert still a limbe of Satan. Purity in the inward parts, is the most sound and vndeceiuing euidence of our portion and interest in the power and purity of Christs sauing Passion and sanctifying Blood-shed: See <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 7. Now, that thou mayest the better conquer and keepe the thoughts of thy heart in subiection and obedience
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6825:54"/>
vnto Christ, be perswaded and acknowledge 1. The pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of that wicked Prouerbe, <hi>Thoughts are free.</hi> It is true, the immediate inuisible productions and proiects of the heart, lie not within the walke of humane Iustice, neither are liable to the censure of earthly Courts and Consistories. But there is an All-seeing and Omniscient Eye in Heauen, to which, the blackest Mid-night is as the brightest Noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 12. <hi>which sees our secretest thoughts afarre off, ver.</hi> 2. <hi>and sets them in the light of his countenance, Psal.</hi> 90. 8. Hence it is that many humble soules, sensible of their secret prouoking the glory of Gods pure Eye, are more grieued (setting aside the ill of example and scandall, ordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants vpon open and visible miscarriages) for the rebellious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their thoughts, then the exorbitancie of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the sting of these is something eased and lessened, as they thinke, by the absence of Hypocrisie, and because the world sees the worst. But concerning the other, it cuts them to the very heart, that they are not as well able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue their inward parts in puritie toward the All-searching Eye of that God, <hi>who stretched foorth the heauens, and laid the foundations of the earth;</hi> as their words and actions in plausiblenesse towards man, <hi>who shall die, and the sonne of man, which shall be made as grasse.</hi> Whereas then the naturall man is woont to let his heart runne riot and at randome into a world of idle imaginations, without remorse or restraint; doe thou make thy sanctification sure vnto thy selfe, by this infallible signe, That thou sufferst the consideration of Gods All-seeing Eye, the curbe of the last Commandement, and checke of a tender conscience, to range thy thoughts into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to confine and keepe them within a holy compasse from their vaine and impertinent vagaries. 2. That thou must be accountable and answerable for euery wandring thought, as well as for idle words and wicked actions. Now consider what numberlesse swarmes of imaginations passe the Forge of thy phantasie euery day; and therefore, if thou be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily and exactly vigilant &amp; eye-full ouer thy heart, thou mayest iustly feare, that vpon the opening and illight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6825:55"/>
of the booke of thy conscience, at those two dreadfull dayes, of Death, and the last Iudgement, innumerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of exorbitant thoughts, which haue lyen in ambush as it were, in the secret corners of thy deceitfull heart, will charge vpon thee with a farre heauier account then perhaps thou art aware of, or hast seriously thought vpon heretofore. 3. That Gods glory must aswell shine in thy thoughts, in the inuisible workings, intentions, desires, and eleuatious of the heart; as in thine outward conuersation. As God exacts and expects honour and seruice from his Children, in words and workes; so there is also a Thought-seruice, a Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship, that I may so call it, which is very pleasing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his eyes, as springing more immediately from the heart, wherein he principally delights; and because the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie of it is attended with more sincerity. Remember ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to render with all reuerence and zeale vnto the Father of Spirits, and Lord of thy soule, the dayly tribute of thy Thought-seruice, as well as the Tongue-seruice and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruice. And the rather and more plentifully: 1. Because opportunities, abilities and meanes may faile for outward performancee, but the heart is euer at leasure and libertie to thinke nobly. No times, no tyrants, no wants or restraint, can hinder it from an inuisible fruition of Gods owne Selfe, with thoughts of sweetest rapture and reuerence, of loue, and lowliest adoration; from bathing it selfe in the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Blood of the Immaculate Lambe, with thoughts of inexplicable peace, ioy, and triumph; from cleauing to the promises of life, and diuing into the Mysterie of Grace with extraordinary dearenesse, purest delight, &amp; victorious faith; from being as a mountaine of Myrrh and Incense, sending vp a spirituall Sacrifice of praise-full thoughts, infinitely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring and magnifying the glory and goodnesse of that mercifull Hand, which writ thy name with the golden Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of his endlesse loue, in the Booke of Life from all beginnings: suffered the dearest and warmest Blood in His Sonnes Heart to be spilt as water vpon the ground, for the washing of thy body and soule from sinne; and after a span
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6825:55"/>
of time, will set a Crowne of Eternitie vpon thy head, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of all comfort, rest, and peace, ioyes, pleasures, and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, &amp;c. And also because, besides Gods more speciall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, and more certaine sinceritie of this inward inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible seruice, it is ordinarily full of more spiritualnesse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and life, by reason that it is neerest and most imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate to the obiect of Adoration. The best man, though he may labour to doe his best euery way, yet he shall find a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and degrees in his ability to discharge, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of his Duties, Deuotions, and seruices towards God. His workes doe not euer answere with that exactnesse to his words: His words cannot expresse so to the life, the thoughts of his heart: The thoughts of his heart come infinitely short of the excellency of God. Those streames which are next to the well-head, are strongest and purest: The thoughts of a sanctified heart, laying hold vpon, with immediate appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and neerest imbracements, that most amiable, holy, and glorious Obiect, God Himselfe, blessed for euer, and his sweetest Attributes, giue Him His due and reuerent Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, with more heartinesse, life, and heauenlinesse, then his words or Actions are woont; though all a mans best and vtmost, in thought, word, and deed, falls too fearefully short of that which we owe and ought to doe.</p>
            <p>2. A continuall excubation and narrow watchfull guard ouer thy heart. It is like a Citie, liable euery moment both to inward commotion and outward assault. The fountaine of Originall impuritie, though its mayne streame and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die issue bee stayed, and in some good measure stopt, by the sanctifying power of Christs sauing Blood; yet it doth still lesse or more bubble vp rebelliously. The world doth labour continually with her three great battering Engines, of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, Riches, and Honours, to lay it waste, and rob it of all heauenly treasures. The Deuill watches euery opportunity to hurle in his fiery darts, to cast all into combustion, and thereby further to enuenome and inrage the already too much impoysoned viciousnesse and impetuousnesse of our corrupt nature. Precious therefore, and worthy all practise,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6825:56"/>
is that Precept of <hi>Salomon: Keepe thy heart aboue all keeping. Prou.</hi> 4. 23. which thou mayest doe with more successe and comfort; if first thou watch ouer the windowes of thy soule, the sences, as the Worthies of old were woont with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie ward; See <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 37. It is incredible what a deale of pollution and ill the Deuill conueyes insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly through these Flood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gates of sinne, into their bosomes who are carelesse and watchlesse this way. To instance in the eare and eye: What balles of Wild-fire, as it were, doth many an obscene and filthy tongue set on fire of hel, throw thorow their eares into mens hearts, with rotten and ribald talke, which after begets within, worlds of speculatiue wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and flames of Lust? Many false reports drop from the slanderers mouth into the eare, which after in the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the cursed seed of heart-burning, spite, and mentall murder at the least. And such wicked weeds cannot but fructifie very rankely, in such a naturally sinfull soile. A Tale-bearer tells thee, that such an one said of thee so and so, when as in truth it was neither so nor so. Thou presently thereupon conceiuest thoughts of vnkindnesse, displeasure, and it may be, of rage, against that man that neuer thought the ill. Heere thou spillest innocent blood, for thy heart may kill as well as thy tongue and hand. It is fit therefore for euery honest face to furnish and fill it selfe with frownes of distaste and indignation at the approach of any Tale-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. <hi>As the North wind driueth away raine, so doth an angry countenance a back-biting tongue, Pro.</hi> 25. 23. Concerning the Eye, <hi>Dauids</hi> wofull example may warne the holiest men to the worlds end, to bee very watchfull with a most restlesse and eye-full iealousie ouer that wandring sence. An idle glance vpon <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> was like a theeuish boy thrust in at a rich mans window, which lets in a number of villanous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Cut-throats, to ransacke and robbe the house; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not resisted at the first, drew after it such a blacke and bloody traine, that robbed his royall heart of much heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wealth, and wounded his soule as deepely and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, as perhaps any of Gods seruants euer since. 2. Resist
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6825:56"/>
and crush euery exorbitant thought, which drawes to sinne at the very first <note n="a" place="margin">Est autem tutis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simum—vt as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Encounter it with this dreadfull Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma: Say vnto thy selfe; If I commit this sinne, it will cost mee vnvaluably more heart-breake and spirituall smart, before I can purchase assurance of pardon and peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, then the sensuall pleasure is worth: If I neuer repent, it will bee the death and damnation of my soule. See what a world of misery man brings vpon himselfe, by giuing way to the first wicked thought, <hi>Disc. of true Happinesse, pag.</hi> 150. 3. Entertaine euer with all holy greedinesse, and make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly much of all good motions put into thy heart by the blessed Spirit howsoeuer occasioned, whether by the Ministery of the Word, mindfulnesse of death, Christian ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, reading some good Booke, some speciall crosse, extraordinary mercy, any way, at any time. Feede; enlarge, and improoue them to the vtmost, with Meditation, Prayer, and Practise. So thou shalt preserue thine heart in a soft ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfortable temper, and heauenward, which is a singular happinesse.</p>
            <p>3. Eleuation, and often lifting vp of the heart towards heauen. What Christian heart can indure to discontinue its sweet familiaritie and humble entercourse with God for one day? Let thy broken heart therefore euery day, besides solemne and ordinarie eiaculations, Euening and Morning, and vpon other speciall occasions, bee sure 1. To bathe it selfe deliciously in the blisfull depths of Gods boundlesse mercies in Christ, that it may bee happily kept, spiritually merry, thankefull, and in heart to all holy duties. 2. To kisse sweetly the glorified Body of our crucified Lord, with the lips of infinitely dearest, and vnexpressably affectionate loue; though the distance bee great, yet the hand of Faith will bring them easily together; that it may be preserued in peace, puritie, and reuengefull opposition vnto sinne; for as the application of his meritorious Blood is a soueraigne Plaister to heale the wounded conscience, to turne Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin and Scarlet into snow and wooll; so me-thinkes a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and compassionate commemoration of the deare effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6825:57"/>
thereof, should bee both a precious corrosiue to eate out the heart of corruption, and a speciall preseruatiue to keepe from sinne; sith sinne was the <hi>principall</hi> in slaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Lord of life. 3. To cast the eye of hope vpon the glory, euerlastingnesse, and vnutterable excellencies of that immortall shining Crowne aboue; which after this life (and this life is but a bubble, a smoake, a shadow, a thought) shall be set vpon thy head by the hand of God: a very glimpse of the goodly splendour and rauishing beauty whereof, is able both to sweeten the bitterest villanies and basest wrongs from the world and wicked men; and to dispell those mists of fading vanities and hurtfull fumes of honours, riches, and earthly pleasures, which this great dunghil of the world, heated by the fire of inordinate lusts, is wont to euaporate and interpose betwixt the sight of mens soules and the blisse of Heauen.</p>
            <p>VI. Be very watchfull ouer thy most predominant and troublesome passion; whether it be feare, sorrow, loue, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp;c. All of them are vnruly and raging enough, but yet commonly one ouer-rules all the rest, and playes <hi>Rex</hi> (as they say) in the vnregenerate man; nay, too often offers to rise in rebellion euen against the most sanctified soule.</p>
            <p>Whatsoeuer it be, 1. In thy priuate morning sacrifice, be sure to lay on loade of deepest groanes and strongest cries for mortifying grace against it, and comfortable conquest ouer it. Let that period and passage of thy prayers bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and enlarged with an extraordinarie pang of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie, and feelingly sealed, as it were, with the most Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall <hi>Selah.</hi> 2. Cut off all occasions, whatsoeuer it cost thee, which may any wayes stirre, awaken and kindle it. Withdraw the fewel that ministers food vnto that passionate flame, though it should bee as painefull vnto thee, as the plucking out of thy right eye, or the cutting off of thy right hand. Assuredly, the pleasures of inward quiet, and sweet spirituall calmnesse of thy so vnderstanding Soule, will infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely recompence any paines in oppositions and resistances in that nature. 3. Consider seriously before-hand, what a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6825:57"/>
deale of disturbance and vnsettlednesse the visible exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy and breaking of it out, will breede and bring vpon thy inward man. It will be like a dead Flie in a boxe of precious oyntment, disgrace all thy graces, and full foully darken the glory of thy profession. It will be like fire in the Thatch, and for the while cast into combustion, as it were, the whole frame of thy spiritual building, and turne the heauenly peace of thy appeased conscience, into a bitter tempest. Tell mee whether after a lawlesse transgression of those bonds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to which thy Christian resolution hath confinde it; and that it hath preuailed against thee with any notorious excesse; I say, whether at night thou finde not thy spirit quite downe and much deaded to the exercise of prayer, or any other euening duty? And if vpon thy waking in the night, there should be any terrible winde, dreadfull thunder, or other affrighting accident, whether thy heart would not smite thee vpon that occasion, with much more feare and apprehensions of horrour?</p>
            <p>I will suppose, thy raigning, or rather rebelling passion (for I speake to the Christian) to be choler and anger: and then first listen to the counsell which the very morall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sages mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister against this spirituall maladie, and to the rules and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which the light of reason leades vs vnto.</p>
            <p>1. Cut off (say they) the causes, and the effect wil vanish. Quench the firebrands which enrage this fury, and thou shalt be at quiet: They are such as these:</p>
            <p>1. Weakenesse of spirit, vnmanlinesse of minde. Hence it is that old men, infant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> and sicke folkes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more cholericke then others. Impotency and excesse of passion euer argues the disgrace and inferiority of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding part, the noblest power of the soule. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we would be armed against the sallies and assaults of this domineering raging distemper, we must suffer the hiest and heauenliest part of our soule to know and exercise its place and strength. Wee must not make our vnderstandings vnder-lings, but giue reason his right and regiment.</p>
            <p>2. Selfe-loue, a foolish doting vpon and adoring our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6825:58"/>
selues, which springs from the cursed root of Selfe-igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and quite puts out that light of Natures law in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; <hi>Doe as thou wouldest be done by.</hi> If before thou lose the reines to that short phrensie, thou wouldst suppose and set thy selfe in the place of the party, with whom thou art angry; and then say and doe no more then if thine owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son were the <hi>patient,</hi> it would bee a notable meanes to curbe thy choler, and keepe the credit of dipassionatenesse and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and make thee patiently suffer that which perhaps thou hast often confidently offered to others.</p>
            <p>3. An ouertendernesse and delicate nicenesse in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wrongs: an impetuous impatiencie for being abused: (Whereas insensibilitie and contempt would better become<note place="margin">Immensae virtutis est, non sentire te esse percussum.</note> a great spirit:) an effeminate facilitie to bee mooued and toucht with euery trifle. A spot or wrinkle vpon their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a dish misplaced vpon their table, some errour in their dressing; a Bird, a Dogge, a Glasse, &amp;c. or some lesser toy will turne some kinde of people quite out of tune, and put them out of their humour, into a pelting chafe, as they say. Great mindes and victorious ouer this furious Arch-Rebell, are not moued but with great matters. It is a speciall point of manly wisedome, to passe by many petty prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to wrath, without notice or acknowledgement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wound or passion; and to digest many times the braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and indiscretions of hasty men, with the same patience that Surgeons do the iniuries and blowes of mad men, when they let them blood.</p>
            <p>4. Credulitie, lightnesse in beleeuing whatsoeuer comes first to the eare: That is the high way to hold choler still in combustion. For so the tongues of slanderers, Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, Whisperers, Pick-thanks, will prooue as so many Bellowes blowne by the Deuill himselfe, to keepe this fire in height and fulnesse of flame.</p>
            <p>5. Curiositie, an itching humour, and needlesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitiuenesse to know euery thing that is done or said. If a man will needs bee so meddling; he shall finde matter inough to fill his gall. Some men, out of this humour, are
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6825:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eager to know what is said against them, in such and such company, listen to heare what their seruants talke concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, and if a letter fall into their hands wherein they thinke themselues to bee mentioned, they will make no bones, against the lawes of humanitie, to breake it open. Busie-bodies in this kind neuer want wrath and woe. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi> as it is said of him, was wise to abandon this vanitie. For when he heard two of his subiects speaking ill of him in the night neere his Tent, willed them to goe further off, lest the King should heare them.</p>
            <p>6. Couetousnesse, the Cut-throate of Grace, and canker of the soule, like an eating insatiable Wolfe, will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther still feede vpon gaine, or else gnaw vpon the heart with fretting: and therefore the very losse of a penny, sometimes the omission of a good bargaine, the miscarriage of some do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall trifle, the death of a beast, &amp;c. will presently put a couetous man into choler: for his eyes are so earthly, that they looke onely vpon the secondary, not vpon the supreme cause.</p>
            <p>7. A conceit of being contemned by others in word, deed, countenance. Many are so weake this way, that if they spy but any secret smiling, two whispering together in the company, or any talking, especially with their eyes now and then cast towards them; they presently thinke, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues certainely are their aime, and obiect of their scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obseruation; and so grow sowre, out of tune, and vnfit for company all the while after. Such as these are extremely troubled, and take on to themselues, if they haue not the chiefe place, and vpper hand at meetings, respect and resalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from those that they salute, exact obseruance, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beisance from their inferiours, the wall from all commers, if they be not begun vnto in matters of complement and serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of humanitie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A riddance and restraint of these and the like maladies of the minde, will bee a notable meanes to preuent and hinder the assaults and surpriz all of this furious and foule fiend.</p>
            <p>2. But if at any time thou feele this Viper to receiue heate
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6825:59"/>
in thy bosome, and that occasions of choler are offered, then say they:</p>
            <p>1. Containe thy bodie in quiet, and tongue in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The stirring and agitation of thy bodie, by stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or flinging about, inflames the blood and humours, and the walking of thy tongue keepes both the passionate heate in thine owne heart, and many times sets on fire those that thou art angry with. The barking of one Dogge sets all the curres in a towne a bawling. Thy breaking forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to raging termes, may raise the spirit of rauing in others: And therefore silence is a singular cooler to this cholericke distemper. If the swelling and boisterous waues rebound from the soft and euen sands, there is no great adoe; but if they encounter a Rocke, they returne with great turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and turne into foame. Silence or a soft answer stops the ouer-flowing of the gall on both sides; but if fury be set vpon with rage, they grow both almost starke mad for the time.</p>
            <p>2. Giue reason leaue to interpose and resolue. It was good counsell which was giuen to <hi>Augustus;</hi> That when the obiect and occasions of choler were in his eye, hee should not bee moued, before hee had pronounced ouer the letters of the Alphabet. It is as absurd for a passion to vsurpe and domineere ouer iudgement, as for an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Scold to iustle a reuerend Iudge out of his place; and there to take on in her talkatiue and scurrill manner. If thou giue the swinge and reines vnto it at the first rising, it will presently quite banish reason and iudgement, and bee like a man that puts the Master out of the house, and sets it on fire, and burnes himselfe aliue within: or like a Ship that hath neither Sterne nor Pilot, nor Sailes, nor Oares, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the mercy of the waues, windes and tempest in the midst of a furious Sea. 3. Diuert to some other businesse, company, place, pleasant imployment, thoughts of content, &amp;c. These are notable coolers, and very conuenient to flake this passionate fire, when it first begins to burne in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:6825:59"/>3. Habituate thy heart, and keepe it exercised and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with considerations: 1. Not onely of melancholy, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall passion, and other bodily distempers, which it naturally breeds, by stirring choler, heating the bloud, and the vitall spirits; but also, euen of the brutish deformities and vgly distortions with which this rage disfigures those which are transported with it; as the fierinesse of the eyes, inflamation<note place="margin">

Hence it was, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry men were anciently counselled in the heate of their fit to looke themselues in a Glasse. The monstrous representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that deformed Fury, were able for euer to fright them out of their cholericke humour. 2. Of the sweete loueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and amiable acceptation of a milde vnpassionate spirit. It is the sinew, as it were, and cyment of all delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full society, the flower of humanity, the very sweetenesse of ciuill conuersation. As it is a singular preseruatiue to keepe a mans owne heart in much calmnesse and quiet; so its also an attractiue Load-stone to draw vnto him the hearts and loues of others. 3. Of the aime and aspirations of morall wisedome which labours to draw a mans heart to that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken, constant and comfortable temper; that beautifull and noble disposition, which resembles the highest Region of the aire, where there is no ouer-shadowing clouds, nor tempestuous thunders, but perpetuall fairenesse, serenity, and peace.</p>
            <p>I haue the longer insisted vpon these morall instructions, purposely to make Christians ashamed, who besides the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest extractions of purerreason, haue also rules of Religion, &amp; heauenly remedies; and yet are too often ouertaken with this mentall drunkennesse, as some call it. For you must know, that all this while I meane hasty, vniust, and exorbitant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which misses in measure, Obiect, end, season ablenesse, or other circumstances. For there is a sinlesse and holy Anger,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6825:60"/>
and therefore saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. 4. 26. <hi>Be yee angry, and sinne not.</hi> Vpon the describing and limiting of which, it is neither incident nor seasonable for me at this time to insist.</p>
            <p>Now then in a second place, for religious directions, and more immediately drawne from diuine learning, consider:</p>
            <p>1. That all thy wrongs and vnworthy vsages, all thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries and indignities, crosses and vncomfortable accidents, that shall euer any way befall thee, are fore-appointed, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and disposed by Gods wise and mercifull prouidence, and that to thy spirituall and euerlasting good. This very one thought, that God is euer the principal Agent, kept fresh and on foote in thy mind, will be of soueraigne power to coole and beate backe any intemperate heate, which might either rise in thine heart, or rage in thy tongue against his instruments; and cause thee many times when thou art cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Be thou then for euer ashamed to take on for euery trifle; to breake patience vpon euery triuiall prouocation; to turne Lyon in thine owne house, and which is common in carnall worldlings, to rage with extreme folly and basenesse against thy wife, children, seruants, cattell, or any thing that comes in thy way, for euery crosse accident, worldly losse, dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall miscarriage: nay, many times to torture thine owne heart, and trouble others in this kinde vpon meete mis-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, groundlesse surmizes, and misconstructions: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take this gracious lesson from the Lord Iesus his owne mouth, Math. 11. 29. <hi>Learne of mee, for I am lowly of heart;</hi> and an example of patience from his first <hi>Martyr,</hi> Act. 7. 60. <hi>Lord, lay not this sinne to their charge.</hi>

What a monster is a man of anger, that <hi>Salomon</hi> should set such a brand vpon him; whereby euery one is warned to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of him, and fly from him, as from a nettling, dangerous, vnsociable creature?</p>
            <p>A word or two of another passion, before I passe out of the point, and that is Feare, which I had not toucht at this time, had it bin only a Rack, wheron the hearts of couetous, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and carnall men are wofully rent, and torne, &amp; tortured all their life long; and not also a cruell engrosser of too much golden time euen from Gods children, not without impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of much fruitlesse sadnesse, and vnnecessarie discontent.</p>
            <p>The vanitie and tyrannie of this passion is specially seene and exercised: 1. In putting all reall stings into imaginarie euils, and drawing true and bitter sorrowes, from supposed sufferings. 2. In an ouer-greedy apprehension and anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sorrowes to come, so that a man by too much fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughtfulnesse, and painefull preconceit, doth suffer them many times, before they seize vpon him.</p>
            <p>1. For the first, who feeles not the phantasticalnesse of opinion to forge, and fasten vpon him many dreadfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; which of themselues haue no vigour to vexe, because no reall being and existence, yet truely torture and afflict, by the onely strength of imagination?</p>
            <p>Thus one eates his owne heart with griefe for losse of those riches, and that superfluous wealth, which if hee had euer still possessed, hee would neuer haue vsed. Another lies vnder the continuall slauerie of restlesse feare, lost fire or robbery, some alteration in the State, or desolation of warre, should disperse his hoard, or hazard his temporall happinesse. One is haunted with much thoughtfulnesse and carking, what shall become of his children after his death; what men will say of him when hee is gone; lest his wife should marrie after his departure. (For naturally our minds are so vaine, that besides the abundance and burden of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent cares, they will transport our desires and affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6825:62"/>
our selues and being.) Another frettingly feares, that hee shall be vndone in a deare yeere, or the next Rot of sheepe, and tires himselfe with varietie of plots for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings in, for many yeeres to come, when many times he dies in the meane time. Some take vp too much precious time, from present and more profitable meditations, by troubling their hearts, lest, if the times turne, they should not be able to endure the fierie triall; whereas afterward, perhaps, they end their life in the peacefull noone-tide of the glorious Gospel. Others vpon thought, or talke of death, are ready to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fearefull apprehensions, lest they should disgrace their Christian life with an vncomfortable end, and by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie temptation, rauing, furious carriage, lye open to the worlds interpretation, sinister censures, &amp; misconstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their former courses; when as after, it may be, they conclude their dayes calmely, in good memory to the last gaspe, without any storme, or cloud of feared horrour and discomfort; (except former distrustfull feares iustly bring vpon them that which they feared.) For sith euery one, whose life hath been consecrated to Gods glory with truth of heart, doth certainely passe thorow those dreadfull pangs and last paine, into pleasures endlesse and vnspeakeable; hee ought also to submit with all patience and quiet, to glorifie him, and to be seruiceable to his secret ends, with what kind of death he please; whether it be, 1. Glorious, and vntemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: 2. Discomfortable, by reason of bodily distemper, and by consequent, interpretable by vndiscerning spirits: 3. Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled of temptations, and triumphs: 4. Or ordinarie, and without any great shew, or remarkeable speeches, after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie singularities of an holy life, which promised an end of speciall note and obseruation.</p>
            <p>2. For the second, besides these vtterly vnnecessarie and meerely imaginarie miseries; many fearefull spirits especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haunted with the humour of melancholy, will not suffer also certaine and ineuitable euils, which at length must needs befall them, to sleepe, and keepe in their stings, vntill the time appointed: but many times awake them by the cry
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6825:63"/>
of Feare, like so many sleeping Lyons, and cowardlily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them with timorous expectation to rent their hearts, and sting terribly before the time. Thus our vaine mindes torment vs more with the feare of euils, then with the euils which we feare; spurre vs on with much vnmanly folly, to meete in the mid-way; nay, to ouertake, out-run sorrowes to come, and make vs a thousand times miserable with one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduall misery.</p>
            <p>For instance: Thou hast a child, and, perhaps, but one which thou louest most dearely; for that affection which would be seuerely strong towards ten, or how many soeuer, is vnited in it alone. Thou enioyest a wife, whose death would be vnto thee, as the losse of halfe thy heart; and so proportionably of any worldly comfort. Now certaine it is, thou must at length part from all these, or what else soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer most deare and desireable things in this life, they must be taken from thee, or thou from them. In this case then, if thou giue way and forth vnto this faint-hearted tyrant, and malicious passion, it will wound thine heart many and many a time with sence of their losse, before thou loose them: and mingle amidst thy dearest and most doting apprehensions of their sweetnesse and worth, many bitter thoughts of the day of diuorce, and stings of much worldly griefe (for such onely I meane) from a torturing preconceit of painefull heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breake at parting. But the most tormenting racke in this kind, vpon which this tyrannicall passion doth much terrifie and teare the hearts of carnall men specially, is death: It is called, the Prince of terror, by reason of its owne extreme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable pangs; and to them also it is a certaine passage to torments without end, and past imagination: and therefore if their consciences be not desperately seared, and sealed vp securely with the spirit of slumber against the Day of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; they are woont to dye almost euery day, by a slauish feare of death: see Heb. 2. 15. <hi>O death, saith the wise man, how bitter is the remembrance of thee, to a man that liueth at rest in his possessions, vnto the man that hath nothing to vexe him, and that hath prosperitie in all things!</hi> Oh how the heart of such a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6825:63"/>
man doth shrug together for horrour, quake like an Aspen leafe, and die all the while, when this feare doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto it in the glasse of his imagination, the griesly formes and ougly face of death, with those other dreadfull circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as the wailings and out-cries of wife, children and friends about his last bed, parting from all worldly pleasures for euer, rotting in the graue, dragging to the Tribunall and terror of the last Day, &amp;c!</p>
            <p>Besides these imaginarie sufferings, and vntimely sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, take notice of three other base pestilent effects and mischiefes, which this naturall, slauish, distrustfull feare (for that I onely meane in the whole point) puts vpon a man. 1. It may bring vpon him the thing which he feares: by fearing to become miserable, he may become that he feares, and so turne his vaine feare into certaine miseries; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prou. 10. 24. <hi>That which the wicked feareth, shall come vpon him.</hi> And that of Isai. 66. 4. <hi>I will bring their feares vpon them.</hi> Thou hast a wife, a child, an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state, an hie place, which thou art immoderately afraid to loose; now this very distrustfull feare derogating from the glory of Gods mercifull prouidence, which sweetly and wisely disposeth all things, may iustly prouoke him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue thee of them, whereas other wise, thou mightst haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed them still. 2. It robs and bereaues thee of the kindly rellish, and comfortable inioyment euen of good things. A man can take no delight in the fruition of that good, which<note place="margin">Quotidiè moritur mortem qui assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duè pauet.</note> hee feareth to loose. Life it selfe is loathsome, if a man slauishly feare to dye. That good breeds the truest present contentment, against the losse whereof we are alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. And therefore those who liue in continuall feare to loose their child, goods, libertie, life, or any other thing that is deare vnto them, loose a great deale of that honest ioy and<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 47.</note> allowed pleasure they maight haue, euen in these outward things. 3. It deiects and debases his noble nature, below the miseries and basenesse of beasts in this point: for they are fenced from this folly and vanitie, by the benefit of their weakenesse, and want of reason; neuer re-afflicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6825:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with euils past, or fearing any to come; but thorow their whole life enioy intirely and with full securitie, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments and pleasures incident to their natures, saue onely when they are pinched with sence of present paine. What a shame then is it to man, who being honoured with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of an vnderstanding, reasonable, and prouident spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby hee out-shines all other creatures, like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell vpon earth, should by the abuse and mis-imployment thereof, make it a meanes vnto himselfe, to become more miserable in this respect then a brute beast?</p>
            <p>Now many and sweete are the places and promises in<note place="margin">See Reu. 2. 5, 10.</note> Gods Booke, which may serue as precious counter-poisons, and cordials, against this carking venome, which haunts with too often insinuations, euen the most heauenly minde; but eates continually like a Canker into the carnall heart: They are such as these; <hi>I will neuer leaue thee nor forsake thee,</hi> Heb. 13. 5. Shouldest thou fall into the fiery tryall, assuredly thy mercifull God would either supply thee with a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and extraordinary power and patience ouer that most exquisite paine; or else, abate &amp; lessen the rage of the flames for thy sake. <hi>All things worke together for good, to them that loue God,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. Sin, in it own nature, is the deadliest and rankest poyson to the soule; and in it selfe, the greatest euill that is or can be; yet Gods infinite Power and Wisedome, which at first drew light out of darknesse, as a skilfull Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary deales with poyson, so orders and tempers it to his, that by accident it proues medicinable: much more doth He turn to their good, crosses, disgraces, losses of earthly things; pouertie, want, life, death, any thing, euery thing. <hi>God is faithfull, who will not suffer you to bee tempted aboue that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to beare it,</hi> 1. Cor. 10. 13. It is Gods Childs peculiar, in the case of afflictions and all future troubles, to expect supportation in them, benefit by them, deliuerance out of them. <hi>He that spared not his owne Sonne, how shall hee not with him also freely giue vs all things,</hi> Rom. 8. 32? If Iesus Christ be ours, it is infinitely absurd to feare slauishly, either
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6825:64"/>
hurt by ill, or want of good. Hee is incomparably more worth then ten thousand worlds, were they all extant. If thou enioyest then such a Iewell, what a cursed vanity is it to torture and teare thy heart with feare of any earthly losse, or of euer being preuailed against by any created power? Take yet more spirituall armour and Heroicall resolution, against the assaults of this cowardly Tyrant, which doth so vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily afflict the spirits of men, not onely with imminent ills, but also with those which are not, and perhaps shall neuer be, nay sometimes, which cannot possibly bee, out of those two sweetest Psalmes, for promises of future protection, 91. and 121. <hi>Esa.</hi> 43. 2. But the speciall preseruatiue, which at this time I would commend vnto you, against this distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearts-poyson, may bee extracted from Christs owne words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 34. After many strong and precious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against thoughtfulnesse and carking, our heauenly Doctor concludes, <hi>Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of it selfe: suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient vnto the day, is the euill thereof.</hi> Whence I collect and counsell, that the Christian ought, in respect of any torturing care, or carking forecast, to vnite and confine his thoughts, the workings and agitations of his spirit, to the managing of the affaires, and mastering the miseries of the present day. The strongest minde and best composed, is weake enough to sustaine the brunt and encounter of euery dayes crosses. Temporall troubles, or spirituall temptations, fightings, without, or terrours within, are the certaine portion of the Saints in this vale of teares. And what day so faire comes ouer the Christians head, wherin he scapes Scot-free, as they say, herein? Sith therefore euery day brings foorth sorrow sufficient for the exercise of the retiredst presence of the most recollected spirit, and the heartiest man shall haue his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in passing patiently and profitably thorow present trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which many times fall as thicke vpon him, as one waue in the necke of another; what a base and vnworthy weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is it, to vnfit and disable our already too weake minds, for a comfortable dispatch, and digesting of dayly vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6825:65"/>
occurrents, by such needlesse, sencelesse, fruitlesse distractions, vagaries of vanity, and Vtopian peregrinations? As either 1. To loose them in the endlesse maze of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary afflictions: 2. Or to waste them by vntimely wrastling with certaine euils to come: 3. Or wound them with a painefull remembrance of sorrowes already past. For some there are so ouer-greedie of grieuing themselues, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the tyrannicall vanity of their owne mindes, that besides their trouble with present, fained, and future mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, collect also matter of mournefulnesse from time past. For instance: Thou hast lost thy dearest child, which is one of the extremest earthly crosses, and goes neerest the heart, but long since, so that if reasons from reason and Religion as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaged not the immoderation and excesse of thy sorrow; yet time hath worne out, and wiped away thy teares, and made thee weary of weeping: but notwithstanding, thy vaine minde will not suffer that griefe, which euen length of time hath buried long agoe, to lie quietly in the graue, but drawes into consideration, and remembers for the nonce, its speeches, fauour, pretty behauiour, and other louely circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, to make thy heart bleed afresh, and wring from thine eyes new torrents of teares, &amp;c. Soueraigne therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these Harpies and deuourers of the heart, is that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of <hi>Christ,</hi> which I haue commended vnto you from his owne mouth; seconded also by the Apostle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Be</hi>

Prince, partly from an inexplicable ioyfull sence of his owne safety. It is proportionably so, when wee mourne for Him whom wee haue pierced, and in Euangelicall repentance. (God hath so mercifully ordered all things for his, that if they be not wanting to themselues, they may be euer merry, and finde continuall matter of reioycing: See 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 10. For he well knowes what great need their poore hearts haue of this ioyfull affection; both to sweeten their outward sufferings and bitternesse from the world, and also to season their spirituall sacrifices and seruices vnto himselfe:) And besides, it is one thing, to rake with our remembrance into the graue of buried griefes, for sharpning the teeth of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow, to eate our hearts: Another thing, to make our memories minister matter from former times, of more humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation vnder Gods mighty hand, deeper detestation of our abominable vilenesse, and to make our hearts many and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a time melt againe, and bleed afresh with comfortable softnesse, and godly sorrow for youthfull sinnes.</p>

Prize and ply, as a most sweet excellency, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable perfection in Christianitie, a right and religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of thy tongue. It is very materiall, and of speciall importance, for preseruation both of outward and inward peace. Originall corruption hath naturally put vpon euery mans tongue an empoysoned fierie edge, whereby like a sword in a Bedlams hand, it kils and slayes on all sides, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wounds his owne conscience, infects and enuenomes mortally the soules of the present, mangles the good names of the absent with deadly malice, and so bathes it selfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morselesly in continuall bloodshed; (for there is heart-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and tongue-murther, as well as hand-murther) vntill the attainment of this grace, and mortifying circumcision of such an vnruly euill. That it may therefore neither be vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably idle, nor sinfully exercised, besides many other caue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats, and constant watchfulnesse, take notice of, and to heart and practise:</p>
            <p>I. That much and generally neglected duty of Christian reproofe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:6825:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>By reason of that generall and common fellowship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I gaue a taste and touch before, (of his arbitrary and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate company, euery Christian makes conscience of better choyce) which thou must sometimes entertaine and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise with the men of this world, except thou wilt goe out of the world; thou shalt meete now and then vpon vnauoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able necessitie, and by the exigencie of thy calling, with men of intolerable conuersation, and very scandalous discourse; and at vnawares, and vnwillingly fall amongst such compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as will sweare, blaspheme Gods Name, talke filthily, slander the Ministery, rayle against good men; besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other scurrill, base, and prophane speeches; much froth and folly in this kind. Now in this case ordinarily, prophane men meddle not. They hold it a point of precisenesse to marre the mirth, and cast the company into dumpes of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, by calling sinne into question. They loue not (as they say in their hearts) to bee displeasing and vnplausible, where themselues gaine nothing, and perhaps doe no good to the partie. They are commonly old-excellent in rayling vpon, and slandering a good man in his absence; but they are starke-naught, and no-body in reproouing a notorious wretch vnto his face. If they open their mouth this way, it is commonly in iest, in brauerie, in forme, in derision, for some Ones sake in the company, who, they know, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it; or at best, out of a ciuill detestation of outragious villany, and furious blasphemies of Gods glorious Name. But in such cases, the Christian is truely sollicitous and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; very much troubled, and carefull how to frame and hold a serious, wise, and seasonable contradiction to the language of hell, which consisteth in oathes, lying, slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in obscenities, raylings, contemptuous insolencies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ministerie and wayes of God, defence of Poperie, and in such rotten and Bedlam talke. Hee dares not many times in such company, for his heart hold his peace, lest thereby he be guiltie in some degree. 1. Of the parties go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in sinne. 2. Of betraying Gods glory, by a coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnchristian silence: and 3. For feare of wounding his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6825:67"/>
owne conscience. The omission of the discharge of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, will somtimes very much vexe the conscience, and grieue the heart of the true-hearted Professour; when hee is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the place, and considers that by his basenesse and frailty he hath failed in so holy a dutie, and beene faint-hearted in the cause of God.</p>
            <p>For this kinde of reproouing then, and such censuring of the words and workes of darkenesse, the Christian is not to bee censured too censorious and precise. Conscience, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 17.</note> and Gods Commandement calles and cries vpon him for the performance of this needfull dutie; whensoeuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auoydable necessitie, or the exigencie of a warrantable cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling shall haue cast him vpon prophane wretches, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned him for the while amongst fellowes of lewd discourse and gracelesse carriage. Except they bee Dogs, or Swine: Christ himselfe hath commanded, that Pearles and holy things shall not bee cast away vpon such. <hi>Giue yee not,</hi> saith hee, <hi>that which is holy vnto Dogs, neither cast yee your Pearles before Swine,</hi> Matth. 7. 6. See also, Prou. 9. 8. and 23. 9.</p>
            <p>The ground of this Commandement of Christ, I take to be two-fold:</p>
            <p>1. A deare, compassionate, and tender-hearted care of God, euen ouer the temporall liues of his children. Besides the glorious Ministery, and continuall guard of the blessed Angels for their preseruation, that they hurt not their foote<note place="margin">Psal. 91. 11, 12.</note> against a stone; his own also All-seeing &amp; All-pittying Eye, doth euer graciously watch ouer them, to keepe them as dearely as the Apple of his owne Eye; and therefore hee forbids them to cast themselues desperately into the mouth of a barking Dogge, or vpon the paw of a reuengefull and blood-thirsty Lyon: that is, he would not haue his child to vouchsafe so much as a reproofe to any blasphemous wretch, or desperate Swaggerer, that would furiously flie in his face for offering him a Pearle.</p>
            <p>2. An holy iealousie ouer the glory and Maiestie of his owne blessed Word. It is that holy Wisedome, which issued
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6825:67"/>
immediately out of his owne infinite vnderstanding. It is farre more pure and vnspotted then siluer tried in a furnace of earth, fined seuen-fold. It is a sacred Pearle, framed and fashioned by His owne Almighty hand in the Palaces of heauen, which onely by an inuisible and inspired power can raise those which are dead in sinnes and trespasses, to spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life; stop the bloody issue of originall corruption, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the soules of men in euerlasting health. In a word, it is the Word of God, and therefore most vnworthy to be troden vnder foote, or trampled in the mire by any sensuall Swine: that is, no wayes to be vouchsafed to those hatefull and Swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish wretches, who out of a malicious sottishnesse enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine so glorious a message from the mighty God of heauen with contempt and scorne.</p>
            <p>These two reasons of the Commandement lye the Text: <hi>Giue ye not, &amp;c. lest they trample them vnder their feete, and turne againe and rent you.</hi> Whence wee haue also some light to discerne who are Dogs, who are Swine.</p>
            <p>1. By Dogs, we see, are meant obstinate enemies, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously<note place="margin">Canes igitur hîc significat homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in impietate viuentes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabili, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this and tremble, all yee that are become scornefull and furious opposites to the power and purity of the Word, and bloody goades in the sides of the faithfullest Ministers. Alas, poore wretches, forlorne Caitifes, you cast your selues despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately into that accursed and horrible condition, that euery good man is bound in conscience not to affoord you so much as an admonition, or reproofe, or a caueat to preuent those curses which are comming vpon you. And you wilfully draw vpon your owne heads that most fearefull doome from Gods Spirit, and from the Church of God; <hi>He that is filthy,</hi>

               <hi>let him be filthy still.</hi> He that is a Swine, let him bee Swinish still. He that rayles against the power of Grace, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still a mad Dog. He that sets himselfe maliciously

against the Ministery of the Word; let that man receiue no comfort or benefit by the Word of Life. If hee will needs, let him roare still, swagger, be drunke, despaire, die, and be damned.</p>
            <p>2. By Swine, are meant those sottish scurrill wretches,<note place="margin">Porcos verò, in luto infraenis lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utiae i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> who doe scornefully and contemptuously trample vnder foote all holy instructions, reproofes, admonitions, tendred vnto them out of the Word of Truth.</p>
            <p>1. Some of these are Swine, as it were, only in practise: they do not say much, or keepe any great grunting against good men; but they feed vnsatiably, though silently, vpon the drosse and filth of sensuall pleasures and carnall content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and if at any time a Pearle bee cast in their way; I meane, a seasonable reproofe ministred vnto them, they trample it in the mire, and with a bruitish basenesse tread it vnder foote; because indeed they hate to be reformed, and are sottishly and stubbornly resolued, not to exchange these worldly pleasures which they haue in present possession and pursuite, for the glory of an hundred heauens, which Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers so much talke of, but they cannot taste of, or tell when to come thither.</p>
            <p>2. Other Swine there are, as it were both in practise and profession; who besides their hating to bee reformed, and obstinate resolution not to forgoe their present pleasures, or forsake their former wayes, are also possessed with a spirit of scoffing. These are rather wild Boares: for with a furious and Giant-like insolency and outrage, they prouoke, and challenge the mighty Lord of heauen, about the truth of his<note place="margin">See Isa. 5. 19. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:6825:68"/>
fashions, say the Preacher what he will: but to liue, and end their dayes, in their ordinary former courses of prophanenes and good-fellowship. They may reade their doome and vengeance that dogs them at the heeles, Psalm. 50. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>Cursed also is the condition of all you that are scoffers at godlinesse and good men. You haue wearied your selues so long in walking and standing in wicked wayes, that you are not set downe at rest in the chaire of scorners. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all those that stand on the Lords side, are commanded by Christ, there to leaue you in your damned case, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet you no further. And what an horrible depth of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall misery is this; That you runne furiously towards the pit of hell, and must haue no body to stay you; not a man to call and cry vnto you, to tell you, that the fiery Lake is a little before you?</p>
            <p>Though we haue thus much light from the natural proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Dogs and Swine, to descrie and delineate those fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, to whom, by Christs commandement, Pearles and holy things, admonitions and reproofes are not to be vouchsafed; yet Christians are sore troubled many times how to behaue themselues, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake, when to hold their peace, whom to repute Dogs and Swine, whom not; when vpon some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auoidable necessitie, or by the exigency of their Calling, they are vnwillingly, and vnawares plunged into the company of prophane wretches, whose ordinary talke is the language of Hell; oathes, scurrill iests, iesting vpon the holy conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Saints, slandering good men, disgracing the wayes of sinceritie, and such other base, and Bedlam-discourse.</p>
            <p>But I do not see, how any constant rules, or immutable direction can be giuen for Christian carriage in this case; it is so variable, and clothed with such varietie of circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and constancy of alterations. The aduice which I would giue in this point to the Christian, is this: when he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext, what to do in this regard amongst prophane company; let him consult with these bosome counsellours, looke vnto his spirituall wisedome; to his heart; and to his conscience. These must bee his guides, and informers in these cases: and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6825:69"/>
they are counsellors euer at hand, he carries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his bosom.</p>
            <p>1. His spirituall wisedome is to guide him in a right apprehension and discretion of circumstances, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the opportunitie and seasonablenesse, when hee is to interpose, and in what manner to oppose against their furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and rotten speeches. It must tell him secretly, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest vnto him, when the cause of God, or the innocency of a good man calls specially vpon him for an apologie, and at what time he hath a calling thereunto. It must informe him how he must reprooue: whether directly and downe-right, or by intimation, and indirectly; whether personally, or in the generall; whether in a faire and milder manner, or with a more bold and resolute spirit; whether presently vpon it, and in hot blood, as it were, or afterward to take occasion to censure the same sinne, with aggrauation of the odiousnes and damnation of it; whether only by discountenance, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; by a silent disapplause, which I think, may be sufficient for some men, at some times, in some companies, or with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne protestation, &amp; a professed opposition and dislike, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. Let him also looke to his heart: That his reproofe spring not from any imperious humour of censuring, and medling with his brethren; from a proud veine of contradicting, and controlling others; out of a Scoical sowrenesse, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding surlinesse; from any purpose to disgrace, and grieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the partie; from a formall affectation of Pharisaicall seuerity from a secret ambitious desire of purchasing an opinion and reputation of forwardnesse, by being forward in finding faults; or from any other by-respect: but from an heart truly humbled with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ight and sence of its owne infirmities, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously thankfull vnto God for preseruing him from the like outrage, and excesse in sinne; graciously resolued into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and commiseration of the offender; lifted vp in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret supplication for the pardon of its owne sinne, successe of the reproofe, and saluation of the party all at once vnto the Throne of Grace, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. His conscience must guide, and hold him in the right path, and golden meane betweene two extremes, which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6825:69"/>
ordinarily in these cases men are very apt to incurre: I meane, faint-hearted silence, and furious zeale.</p>
            <p>1. Men many times, by reason of a sinfull irresolution, and vnchristian cowardlinesse, would gladly make all such offenders, Dogs and Swine; that thereby they might chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the priuiledge of exemption from the discharge of that Christian dutie of reproofe. Though their eares be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the oathes and blasphemies of those that are about them, and grated vpon with gracelesse raylings against good men, and foule disgracements of the wayes of God; yet they neuer open their mouth; as though there could bee any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler obiect, or exercise of their best eloquence, and greatest courage, then the iust defence of Gods glory, and Christians innocency. Oh! these are vile cowards in good causes, and a kind of traitors to the state of Christianitie. By such sinfull silence, they labour to purchase a name of No-meddlers in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens matters; of mercifull men to their Brethrens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; of plausible companions; of wiser and more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derete Christians. But let them know, that such No-medling is a kind of soule-murthering; such mercifulnesse is crueltie; such plausiblenesse is pernicious; such wisedome is not that of the Serpent, commended by Christ; but the wilynesse of that great red Dragon, suggested by Hell.</p>

            <p>Though it be no constant character of Dogs and Swine, yet commonly those desperate wretches, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s commandement we must giue no holy things, are fellowes of dogged, sowre and contracted countenances, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards true Christians; and haue a kinde of desperate furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse impressed vpon their foreheads, which is then most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, when they are crost in their villanies, and heare of any contradiction, or condemnation of their gracelesse courses and contemptuous carriages.

            <p>These premonitions and cautions premised, and obserued, euery Christian ought to addresse himselfe with resolution, and conscience to discharge this Christian duty of reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, when a iust occasion, and a calling thereunto doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and exact it at his hands.

Let hope then of doing spirituall good to thy brothers soule, be the speciall aime, and a principall motiue of performing this dutie. There is a Law, Exod. 23. 4, 5. that if a man meete his enemies Oxe, or Asse, going astray, he must bring him againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If he see his enemies Asse lying vnder his burden, hee must helpe him vp againe: How much more deare and precious in our eies should the immortall soule of our Brother be, then the Asse of our enemie? If we must turne backe the straying Oxe of our enemie, and lift vp his Asse, when he is crusht vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his burden; with what eagernesse and zeale ought wee to labour, to stop the furious course of a reasonable creature towards the pit of Hell; and to put our helping hand to raise vp that silly foule, which by reason of the heauy weight of its finne, is full sorely bruised and bleeding, ready euen to breathe out it last, and sinke into the misery of endlesse hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? Speake then boldly in the cause of God, when thou hearest thy brother blaspheme his Name, iest with his Word, talke filthily, raile against holines, slander good men, pleade for prophane pastimes, &amp;c. for they are so many mortall stabs into his owne poore soule; besides the naturall infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of rotten speeches, which may doe much mischiefe to the standers by. Though thy reproofe preuaile not at the present; yet thou knowest not what impression and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it may haue afterward vpon his hard heart, whereby perhaps he may happily thinke vpon a new course, and of conuersion to God; and so thou be a blessed instrument of sauing a soule.</item>
                     <item>2. But if it haue not so happy a successe vpon his soule, yet it may be, thou mayest thereby tame and take downe his insolency; so cut his combe by a seasonable contradiction, that he doe not carry it away brauely; so coole and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found his swaggering humour, that he doe not glory in his

                     <item>2. Silence at such a time will seeme to bewray either thy cowardlinesse in the cause of God; or hypocrisy in thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. For it will seeme strange, that thou which makest shew of standing on the Lords side, and professest thy selfe to bee a party in that glorious Communion of Saints, shouldst heare the name of God prophaned in a base and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous manner, and the innocency sometimes of a good man carried in triumph by the slanderous tongues of wretches, and trampled vpon, as it were, euen vnto dust, by the feete of pride and malice; and yet neuer open thy mouth. As thou therefore desirest to preserue the glory of thy Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an reputation entire and shining, and hold it thy crowne and honour to bee Champion vnto the mighty Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, a Proctor in his Spirituall Causes, and the protector of the good names of good men; be euer ready to open thy mouth, when a iust apologie in any of these respects is needefull and required at thy hands.</item>
                     <item>3. If thy conscience be inlightened, awake, tender, and rightly informed, it will smite, and checke thee after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of such a duty; when afterwards thou considerest with thy selfe, that by thy cowardly &amp; vnseasonable silence, thy soule is entangled in the guiltinesse, and hath incurred an accountablenesse for that sinne. As thou then wouldest keepe all in quiet at home in thine owne bosome, and still possesse the paradise of a peacefull heart, suffer not blasphemies, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenities, raylings, and other such ribald, and rotten talke passe vncensured, and vnsorrowed for. Nay, and in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, besides the vnualuable comfort of a peacefull consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou shalt also purchase vnto thine heart a sound testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of that gracious tender-heartednesse, which is wont
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6825:72"/>
to melt, and resolue the hearts of Gods children into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and commiseration in such cases<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which they vse to expresse, and exercise euen towards the lewdest wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and such as haue no pitty vpon the spirituall miseries of their owne poore and wofull soules. See 1. Sam. 15. 35. and 16. 1. Ier. 9. 1. Phil. 3. 18, 19. 2. Cor. 12. 21. Luk. 19. 41, 42, &amp;c. It was the dogged, and damned voyce of cruell and cursed <hi>Cain,</hi> to say, <hi>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> But euery true and tender-hearted Christian doth grieue to see so many of his brethren sticke fast in the clutches of that ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lyon, and betweene the teeth of that Red Dragon; and therefore labours by all meanes hee can, to rescue them; to see so many about him runne as fast and furious as they can, to drowne themselues in the pit of endlesse perdition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore as occasion serues, cals and cryes vnto them to stay their course, before the hellish Gulfe of confusion and horrour hath shut her mouth vpon them.</item>

By thy speaking in such a case, thou mayest lay, as it were, the spirit of profanenesse for that time; so that it doe not rage, and ouer-rule in the rest, as otherwise it would.

Which they will ordinarily doe: because,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They were neuer truely humbled with sight and sence of their owne sinfull and accursed state. They neuer trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, nor were thorowly frighted with the wrathfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of God, for their infinite pollutions and prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the eyes of his glory. Their consciences were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer awaked out of their dead sensuall sleepe, by the Trumpet of the Law, nor receiued any speciall and particular illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the sanctifying Spirit. In a word, they haue no terrour, no trouble, no worke or businesse at home about their owne finnes, in their owne consciences, and therefore they haue leasure enough to looke about them, and are full enough of sinfull curiositie, and vnnecessarie medling, to pry and enquire into other mens courses and carriages; of malice and spitefulnesse, to mistake and misinterpret; of pride and peremptorinesse, to proclaime many times with great noise, and selfe-applause, their owne idle malignant forgeries and fancies, for faults of those, who are much more righteous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they. When they looke forward, or any wayes about them, they are very sharpe-sighted into the fashions and failings of others; most exact in obseruing their neighbours wayes; Eagle-eyed, to pierce beyond the Moone; to spy the least moate in the Sun, I meane, the smallest infirmity in the most glorious Saint: Nay, they are of such a refined and sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eye-sight, that they can discerne some errours and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6825:73"/>
especially in Professours of Religion, which neuer had any existence. But when they should reflect vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and turne their eyes to contemplate and consider their owne corruptions, there lyes a great beame of hypocrisie betweene them and themselues; so that they cannot possibly fee so much, as those huge mountaines of many crying sinnes, which full heauily presse downe their owne soules towards hell; those vnnumbred swarmes of beastly lusts, which rage remorslesly within their owne bosomes.</item>
               <item>2. It is a point of their hypocriticall policie, cunningly, and confidently to impute those sinnes vnto others, which are grosly predominant in themselues; that thereby they might purchase an opinion of a supposed innocencie, and freedome from the like faults. For when they cry out with great noise and clamour vpon other men, they thinke they still the cry, and stop the mouth of their owne sinnes; and labour to fasten a perswasion vpon their owne hearts, that sith they, with such confidence, and bold faces reprooue and censure others, others will not, out of the congruity of a charitable ingenuousnesse thinke them so shamelesse, as to bee iustly liable to the same imputations; except some few wiser, and more iudicious Christians, who are able by spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall experience, to discouer the depths and mysteries of their hypocrisie; and for such they care not much: for in point of reputation, they rely most vpon the common sort, and greater part.</item>
               <item>3. It is the naturall humour of an hypocrite, to bee su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious and censorious. Pride is no where more naturally bred, so proudly seated, and highly enthroned, as in his heart. And therefore it is his common practise to hunt after esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, by disgracing and disabling others. Sith hee wants worth in himselfe, he labours to shine by darkening others, misconceiuing that euery detraction from other mens repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is an addition to his owne.</item>
               <item>4. They hold it a point and proofe of forwardnesse, to be forward in finding faults. As though the flame of an holy zeale were enkindled in any mans heart, onely to giue him
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6825:74"/>
light, for the discouery of other mens sinnes, and not as a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred fire, to burne vp the noysome lusts which boyle in his owne brest.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus, and vpon such grounds as these, it is the hatefull propertie of Hypocrites and selfe-guiltie ones; and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon marke of their cruell seueritie, to wade deepely into the search and censure of other mens wayes, and to gore verie bloodily into the consciences of others, whereas they neuer purged their owne. But true zeale euer casts the first stone at a mans selfe, and plucks the beame out of his owne eye, that he may better discerne and draw the mote out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eye: I meane, a sincere heart is euer most censorious and seuere against it selfe; most searching into, and sensible of its owne sinnes; prying with speciall curiositie and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiuenesse, into the endlesse maze of its owne wicked wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and depths of guile. Though it heartily and vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detest all sinne in whomsoeuer; yet its owne iniquities and pollutions sticke closest, and goe neerest, and beget in it a more particular and extraordinary impression of remorse and loathing. The reason is, it hath truly tasted the terrors of a wounded conscience, been scorched with the secret sence of Gods angry face, and formerly full sorely crusht vnder the most grieuous burthen of innumerable sinnes. It knowes right well, by wofull experience, what bitternesse of spirit, and anguish of soule springs naturally from the retired sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of scandalous transgressions in cold blood. It feeles from time to time, deadnesse of heart, lessening of graces, losse of comfort to ensue vpon euery grosse relapse, or willing fall. It findes too often, to its much griefe, that if it foster and nuzzle in it selfe any sensuall corruption or secret lust, the Lord will not heare its prayers. It is full well acquainted with the vnualuable preciousnesse of a peacefull conscience and Gods fauourable countenance, which it cannot possibly enioy, if it lie delightfully in any one sinne against its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp;c. This being the experience, exercise, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of an vpright heart; it is most angry and displeased with, most Eagle-eyde and watchfull ouer, most strict and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:6825:74"/>
seuere against its owne sinnes. Which home-imployment happily hinders and moderates a man from too much med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling abroad. This world of worke within, about his owne soule, in discouering, opposing, and mortifying his owne vnruly lusts and rebellions, ties his tongue from being so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in censuring other mens faults. As therefore thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest haue a true testimonie of taking thine owne sinnes to heart, and of hauing beene sincerely humbled vnder Gods mighty hand thy selfe, keepe a constant and narrow watch ouer thy tongue: be very sparing in speaking the euill which thou knowest by others: iudge no man rashly, out of spleene, humour, passion, pride, preiudice, Pharisaisme, &amp;c. or of his<note place="margin">Noli esse alien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> This I grant, is many times the prophane mans censure of the true Christian, and therein he discouers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a true hypocrite: for with much bitternesse and malice hee censures sincere-hearted men, to be censorious, when himselfe is the only vnconscionable Criticke and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furer. Hee reprooues Gods faithfull Ones for reproouing, when himselfe full often amongst his companions, out of a pang of imperious choler, and implacable hatred to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, condemnes for Counterfeits, without all ground, or truth, those whom the Lord himselfe iustifies for true-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Nathaneels,</hi> and passes sentence of guiltinesse and grosse hypocrisie, after they bee cast by a iury of Ale-knights, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>To illighten a little, and rectifie thy iudgement in this point of priuate iudging; conceiue with me;</p>
            <p>1. First, that all iudging and censuring is not censurable and condemned: But that, when a man with an euill minde iudgeth amisse and vncharitably of others for some euill end. We may iudge the tree by his fruit. If wee see a fellow constant and incorrigible in his lewd rebellious courses, euidently infamous for rotten fruits, hanging out in the open fight of the Sunne; as drunkennesse, swearing, vsury, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, persecuting the power of godlinesse, scoffing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, vnrighteous dealing, &amp;c. Wee may, leauing his finall doome to the Searcher of all hearts, iudge and censure him for the present to be Gods enemy, and in a most wretched estate. But in such cases, besides iust cause, be sure of a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable calling, conscionable <note n="a" place="margin">Christ iudging th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>2. Secondly, let vs take notice of some differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the true Professours, and prophane mans censuring. It differs, in respect,</p>
            <p>1. Of the Obiect. The principall aime and obiect of carnall mens cruell disconceits, and bitterest censures, is the zealous Professour. Dogged they are enough many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst<note place="margin">Luke 13. 32.</note> themselues, about worldly affaires, and maliciously enter-teare one another like wild beasts; mutuall brawlings about earthly things, wrongs, encrochments, vnderminings, coozening, ouer-reaching, ambitious contentions, &amp;c. fill their hearts with much gall and greedinesse of reuenge, their mouthes with mutuall barking at and byting one another. But to the people of God, in their Bedlam fits, they are not only Dogs, but euen enraged Deuils, and swell with the very venome of Hell, the ouerflowing whereof doth drowne all priuate discords. <hi>Herod</hi> &amp; <hi>Pilate</hi> behaued themselues before, like two angry Mastiues one against another; but when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie was offered, they pursued Christ with reconciled malice, and vnited forces. Put vp an hare before two Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6825:75"/>
snarling about a bone, and they will both doggedly concurre in the pursuite of that harmelesse beast. It is iust so with gracelesse men against Gods Child: and euer the more forward he is in the <hi>narrow way,</hi> the more furiously is he persecuted by the spite of tongues. The most resolute for Gods glory, and in good causes, is ordinarily most rayled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and reuiled. The foule spirit of good-fellowship, as they call it, is still foaming out against Gods chiefest Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, the foulest censures: That they are hypocrites, humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists, factionists, traitors, pestilent fellows, and all that naught is. <hi>Dauid</hi> was so charged by <hi>Saul</hi> and his Courtiers: <hi>Ieremie</hi> by the prophane Nobles: the godly <hi>Iewes</hi> by <hi>Haman:</hi> Nay, Christ himselfe by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises: Paul</hi> by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus:</hi> the Prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tiue Christians by the Heathens: and all that will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>liue godlily in Christ Iesus, must looke for the same por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the same persecution amongst the men of this world; euen to be most vile, and contemptible in their conceits and construction. There is no creature that euer God made, not Satan himselfe excepted, which is more maliciously set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst and censured, then good men. Neither should any haue so bad a name as they, could the hellish mists of viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tongues obscure and staine the glory of their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If sentence should passe vpon the godly at that last and great Day, according to the verdict of them that are not friends or parties, wee should certainly all be cast and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, not a man freed and acquit. But blessed be God, the Searcher of all hearts, the Almightie Protectour of all innocencie, who to the shame and confusion of all spitefull opposites, will witnesse for vs at that highest Tribunall; and then at the furthest before men and Angels, will <hi>bring forth our righteousnesse as the light, and our iudgements as the Noone-day. Oh that I had some to heare me!</hi> saith <hi>Iob: Behold my signe that the Almightie will witnesse for mee: though mine aduersaries should write a booke against mee, &amp;c.</hi> And in this itching humour of mis-censuring the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, the wicked are so wilfull and eager, that rather then they will want matter, they will most basely,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6825:76"/>
and vnworthily snatch it from the enuenomed tongue of a Tale-bearer; from the slanderous folly of some seurril Iester, the frothy rauing of a greasie drunken Ale-house-haunter, nay rather then faile, forge it out of a suspicious selfe-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in their owne prophane fancies, and suck it, as they say, out of their owne fingers. But let them know, that when a son of <hi>Belial</hi> censures a sincere Professor, it is as if the darkest nooke in Hell should finde fault with the Moone, that great Light of Heauen, for those little spots in her face, whereas otherwise shee is a faire and goodly creature: as if the most loathsome dunghill should challenge the fairest garden for vnsauourinesse, because there is here and there a weed amidst varietie of other: fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> should cry out of the danger of a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ague in another. For in this case, hee who as yet is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an accursed lumpe of sinne and lust, damnation and hell, loades with censorious lyes that happy soule, which in the fountaine of Christs meritorious blood, is made farre whiter then the Snow in <hi>Salmon,</hi> and fairer then the wooll of the sheepe comming vp from washing, though some spots and staines of infirmities and frailties cleaue vnto it, while it yet dwels in an house of flesh, and tabernacle of clay.</p>
            <p>But now on the other side, the ordinarie obiect of the Christians Censure, is according to Christs rule: those trees which discouer themselues to be stark naught, by the rotten fruits, which hang vpon them in the sight of the Sunne. And yet that also must bee seasoned with charitie, discretion, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonablenesse, freedome from spleene, humour, passion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall hatred, insolencie, or any other exorbitant distemper. Those professours prooue too often, either vtterly vnsound, or not so thorowly humbled, who vnmercifully insult ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouer the damnable estate of those which are without, or vncharitably blaze abroad the infirmities and failings of the brethren, which they ought to conceale; and as the hand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6825:76"/>
it; so to apply a plaister of a gentle and milde reproofe, that it may secretly heale, and the World be neuer the wiser. Ordinarily, so farre as some men are fierce, boysterous, and master-like in searching out, censuring, and secret insulting ouer the falls, fraileties, difference from them in some indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, of their fellow-Christians; so much many times come they short in mortification, holy wisedome, humility, selfe-deniall, faithfulnesse in their Callings, &amp;c. and that of those, perhaps, whom they so imperiously disable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-value. Commonly, too busie-bodies this way, are either dangerously proud, or sinfully politike: proud, and therefore endeuour to raise their owne, vpon the ruines of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians reputation, better then themselues: or politike; for, themselues being censurable for some grosser infirmities, or scandalous walking, they labour cunningly to find answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errours in more noted Professours, that themselues may goe more vnnoted.</p>
            <p>2. In respect of the order. The true Christian euer casts the first stone at himselfe, and first, the beame out of his owne eye; that is, begins with himselfe, searcheth his owne heart, rips vp and ransacks his owne conscience, censures his owne wayes, condemnes and crucifies his owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and abandons all his knowne sinnes; and then hee may with a more comfortable calling, Matth. 7. 5. with more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie and successe censure <note n="a" place="margin">Non generalite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>in cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Mat.</hi>
               </note> others. But hypocrites, and those who hate to bee reformed, first begin with others, are most prying into other mens carriages, perusing other mens liues, thirstily hunting after, perhaps, by the helpe of many dogged spies, and fawning Spaniels, the falls and faults espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Professors; (for there is the kindly triumph:) euer tampering and medling with their motes; but haue neuer any leasure or pleasure to looke into their owne rotten hearts, and rebellious courses. The reason of this difference may be this: Euery godly man, together with the power of grace, puts on an holy bashfulnesse, an ingenuous modestie; that hee would bee fouly ashamed, and could not with any face charge others with those crimes, which he should allow
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6825:77"/>
in himselfe. But hypocrites weare maskes, vizors and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish foreheads; they will hardly blush, or be ashamed at any beastly carriage, especially bringing in pleasure or profit; much lesse for seeming holy by their strictnesse and seuerity against other mens faults, though as full of lewdnesse and lust themselues, as the skin will hold. How often may wee heare imperious Pharises mangle and martyr a good mans good name, for some lesser infirmitie, who neuer learnd to mourne for, or mortifie any one of those many grosse corruptions, and secret villanies, which reigne in themselues?</p>
            <p>3. In respect of the manner. Selfe-guilty Pharises are woont peremptorily to passe their rash censures vpon the more righteous then themselues, with much malice, pride, scornefulnesse, and prophane insultation: but the seasonable censures of truely humbled Christians, ought euer to bee mingled with much mercifulnesse, commiseration, sensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their owne infirmities, and loue.</p>
            <p>4. In respect of euidence and truth. Prophane mens censures of Gods seruants are many times not onely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, causelesse &amp; false; but also prodigiously absurd, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impossible, without any shadow or show at all of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood.

            <p>But now on the other side, Gods people must be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6825:77"/>
and tender, what conceits they entertaine, and what cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures they passe vpon others. They are bound by the Lawes of diuine loue, to conceiue and speake the best of euery one, vntill his words, ordinarie carriage, open prophanenesse, and fruits of the flesh, clearely conu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nce the contrary; to construe and interpret all things in the better part, so farre, as they may with a good conscience, without preiudice to the truth, or impeachment of Gods glory. They ought to bee so farre from greedy apprehension of imaginarie matter, or violent wresting of mens words, actions and behauiour to the worst sence; that if matters be but probable, poyzd with equall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and with euen weight of reasons interpretable both wayes, they are euer to suffer their conceits and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to be carried the more charitable way. They ought to be so farre from censuring others without ground, truth and proofe; (which is the ordinarie practise of most men) that they should neuer speake the ill they too certainly know by their brethren, but with fearefulnesse, as it were, and some kinde of enforcement.</p>
            <p>5. In respect of the end. The ends why Pharises and Good-fellowes, as they call them, entertaine many ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse disconceits, and thereupon exercise such censoriousnesse against holy men, are such as these:</p>
            <p>1. To binde vp their bleeding soules in the meane time with a palliate cure, as they call it; to procure some tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie ease to their hearts, against the checks and bitings of their guilty consciences, For when consideration in cold blood of their impenitent courses, and of their certaine wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the broad way, by reason of their own sensuall liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and much company, doth sting them with remorse, they haue recourse to the ill opinions they haue conceiued of the best men; and thereupon thinke within themselues, and take occasion to say vnto others; What need we take these things so much to heart, or trouble our thoughts with neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of more strictnesse? Are not those, who goe for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest, and are accounted the prime Professors, such and such men? Haue not they also their infirmities and follies, though
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:6825:78"/>
they guild them ouer with goodly showes, and pretence of zeale? Hereupon they somewhat asswage the secret slauish smart of their now and then wounded consciences, and walk more merrily towards their eternall perdition. For a settled disconceite of a Christian harboured and applauded, is a strong naile to fasten an vnregenerate man to his owne wayes, and a mighty barre to keepe him out of a gracious state. Sensualists are so strangely bewitched by Satan, that hee first causeth them to forge in their owne braines, or take vp from a spitefull tongue, some lying tale of a good man, and then after makes it his meanes to keepe them with secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and contentment in the kingdome of darknesse, and to stand in euerlasting opposition to the wayes of sincerity, and saluation of their soules.</p>
            <p>2. To make, by an affected liberty and seueritie in censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others, the maskes of their owne hypocrisie, lesse mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For by their fained triumphs, and imperious insultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this kinde, especially vpon fresh newes of some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours scandalous fall, they would haue the by-standers to conceiue, that howsoeuer they bee not so precise and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or make so great a show as others; yet they are fully as honest men as they, and may, perhaps, step into heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p>3. To wreake their spite vpon the children of Light; who are euer eye-sores and heart-sores to all sorts of sinners, <hi>Hee,</hi> meaning the righteous man, (saith the Author of the<note place="margin">Chap. 2. 15.</note> Booke of Wisdome, though Apocryphal, yet ancient) <hi>is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto vs, euen to behold: for his life is not like other mens, his wayes are of another fashion.</hi> And it angers them at the very heart-roote to consider, that whereas, they hope, and hold themselues sufficiently qualified for Heauen; yet the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans forwardnesse, zeale and liuing of another fashion, if ingenuousnesse dispell the mist of preiudice, clearely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates to their owne consciences, and proclaimes aloud to all spiritually vnderstanding men, that in truth, and vpon tryall, they are in the state of wretchednesse, and of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Hell. Hereupon it is, that they labour might and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6825:78"/>
maine, with many disgracefull censures, to dimme the glory of his goodnesse; and, if it were possible, by publishing their owne malicious surmises, others slanderous tales, or spiteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aggrauated frailties, to pull him backe, at least, in opinion of their fauourites and dependants, to the same measure of infirmities, and pitch of impietie with themselues.</p>
            <p>But now the ends, which humble Christians propose vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselues of iust dislikes, and seasonable censures of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified men, are briefly such as these:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To preserue their thoughts innocent from accessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to sinne, by a secret inuisible allowance of it in other men; and their tongues from cowardly silence, when they haue a calling to disgrace it.</item>
               <item>2. Left a Knaue goe for an honest man, and hypocrites deceiue true-hearted <hi>Nathaneels.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Left the power of Christianitie, wherein Gods glory is highly interessed, suffer, and be vnderualued. For instance: Thou hearest sometimes a fellow notoriously branded with some infamous sinne, yet so spoken of by some dawbers with vntemperate morter, or at least by ignorant worldlings, as though his present condition were tolerable towards God, and hopefull in respect of saluation, by reason of some other good parts, for which they praise him: In this case, if the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Christian hold his peace, the by-standers may be so farre scandalized and mistake; as to conceiue and collect, that a man may lye in a sweet sinne, and yet liue in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; that the pleasures of the World, and peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may consist together, which are as incompatible as Heauen and Hell. And why should not that silence be sinful, which suffers an open knowne prophane man, to carry away the reputation of one in the right way; (if there be time and place for a seasonable, wise and charitable contradiction,) as well as that, which suffers one which is true of heart, to bee charged with hypocrisie?</item>
            </list>
            <p>2. Secondly, be silent from slandering, backbiting, fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accusing: Heere I will say nothing of downe-right forging, and fastning a false crime vpon an innocent, which is the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6825:79"/>
most pestilent and palpable, and other grosse kindes of this very foule sinne: (for so it is indeed, howsoeuer to a carnall eye looking vpon it, painted with the colours of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and selfe-loue, thorow the false glasse of these corrupt times, it appeares not so ougly. The very Casuists and Schoolemen, none of the precisest Diuines, I am sure, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruedly vilifie it with a brand of hainousnesse, farre aboue theft; as they may well, both for a greater breach of loue, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse of obiect, vnrecompensablenesse of losse, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of restitution, concurrence of many sinnes, consequence of much ill, &amp;c) I say, I will bee heere silent of the grosser sorts of slander, because of them, Gods children are for the most part more easily sensible, and ordinarily watchfull: but let mee a little aduise and awake thee to further inspection of the present point, lest sometimes euen in telling the truth, thou bee intangled in the briars of this base sinne, and iustly incurre the fault of a false accuser, which thou maist many wayes: (For detraction, to speake Logically, doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally consist in the diminution of the truth, but in the deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of a mans good name.) 1. By discouering secret infirmities, which loue, that couereth a multitude of sinnes, would haue concealed. It is a base ambition, and most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the noble magnanimitie of a Christian heart, to hunt after, and purchase an opinion of precedencie in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and zeale, by the disgrace of another, perhaps eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, saue onely in the censurers owne ouer-weening conceit, better and more worthy then himselfe. When thou hearest a man worthily magnified, for eminencie of parts and spirituall worth, bee it farre from thee, or any that euer tooke sinne truely to heart, to come in with a <hi>But;</hi> onely because out of a pang, or rather predominancy of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie pride, thou wouldest gladly bee noted for a <hi>None-such,</hi> and passe for the matchlesse Professour. Let it euer bee the property and veine of vaine-glorious Pharises, to raise their reputations, and sometimes themselues, but with execrable villany, vpon the imaginary ruines of good mens innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and to hold euery insolent detraction from other mens
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6825:79"/>
sufficiencies, and addition to their owne. 2. By drawing out of other mens words, actions, and behauiours, vpon the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious racke of a busie wit, aimes, insinuations, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the Author neuer dreamed on: and by fathering vpon them such enforced sinister sences, and wrested croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked constructions, which an ingenuous impartiall Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour could neuer possibly extract. It is the easiest thing of a thousand, for a malicious minde, to soile the glory of the brauest and most beautifull actions, with ill and wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations and surmises of By-ends. (For the pride of a mans owne disdainefull nature, and the deuill himselfe, are ready mid-wiues at such monstrous conceptions and bastard births.) There is some truth in that hyperbolicall speech of him, who said; <hi>Let any man present mee with the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and blamelesse action, and I will oppose it with fifty vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and bad intentions, all which shall carry a face of likelihood.</hi> Vpon this very point, Tribunals of Iustice, which hold more vpon policy than piety, especially of priuate spleene embitter their Iudiciary power against the party, too often strangely blinde the common peoples eyes, and doe a great deale of wrong. A wicked wit, and wide conscience, mounted on horsebacke amongst a number of Princes, walking like ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vpon the ground (the Epidemicall disease of these worst and most vlcerous times) vpon this aduantage, many times worke a world of reuengefull villany. But how so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it bee easie, and too ordinarie, for blacke tongues to blast and staine by wresting and wier-drawing the beauty of the best actions, with malicious misconstructions; yet it is villanous and base. To let lawes of diuine loue alone; euen the light of Reason led wise men to this resolution, as appeares by their <note n="*" place="margin">Semper in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bijs Benignio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6825:80"/>
euer to suffer our conceits and censures to be caried the more charitable way. 3. By adding vnto the truth, or detracting from it, or intermixing false adulterate Glosses, or some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent <hi>Parenthesis</hi> of a mans owne. Christs false accusers were deepely and damnably faulty this way. And in this kinde, many, who are their Crafts-masters, as they say, in malice, will first of all giue good men in their absence their due and deserued attributions, with many magnificent and plausible speeches; <note n="*" place="margin">Pessimum ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micorum genus, laudantes, <hi>Tacit. in vita Agricolae. pag.</hi> 679.</note> but afterward at the cloze, premising some formall counterfeit protestation and Pharisaicall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, as, <hi>I am very sorry to heare it: I would it were otherwise,</hi> come in with a <hi>But,</hi> steept in very gall and vineger, which<note place="margin">Some men are prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed maliciously to their hurt, thereby to stirre enuy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As thus: A man of very good parts, great worth, extraordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; But something proud. Hee is one, that is very well reformed of late, of much knowledge, and growne mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilously forward in Religion; But a little couetous. And thus they speake, not out of any loue vnto the party, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie of censure, or that the imputation is true: but out of a cunning tricke, to bring their owne credit to their owne doore; a peruerse humour of measuring another by their owne foote; an enuious impatiencie of being surpassed in any sufficiencies; or rather than all this, from a base, an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and dung-hill desire of hauing the best men, especially euery forward Professour, branded with one notorious <hi>But</hi> or another. For hypocrites, and enemies to Gods grace, would, rather then their liues, haue the liues of all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple stained with some grosse sinne. Rather then faile, they will fasten vpon them many a lewd slander that way, ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered onely vpon the forge of falshood, and by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery of malice in their own crafty pates; or broched vpon an Ale-bench, or snatcht from the distempered tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of some pedling Tell-Tale, whence they may supply themselues with imaginary matter, both of insolencie, and triumph a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst forwardnesse and zeale, and also nourish a Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perswasion, that howsoeuer there may bee a profession, and showes to the contrary, yet others are as corrupt &amp; cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable

               </note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and spitefull heart towards the partie; or in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous, scornefull, and insulting manner; or to a lewd end, and vpon purpose to bring into hatred and disestimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or some way or other, without any warrantable and comfortable calling thereunto.</p>
            <p>Heere therefore it will be seasonable, for help and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against this more plausible, but also pestilent kinde of slandering, to tell you, that telling the euill that is true of another, in his absence, doth brand you with the guilt and staine of Back-biters, saue in such cases as these:</p>
            <p>1. First, of profit, and good to the partie absent. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; Thou informest thy friend of a third man; telling him, that hee begins to breake out into bad courses, ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, infamous haunts and houses; and so proceedest to a more particular and punctuall discouerie of his lewd pranks and exorbitant carriage: but all this purposely for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the partie. And therefore thou intreatest thy present friend, that he would interpose, ingage, and improoue the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of that power and interest which he hath in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dependance, or some neerer relation, for his reclaiming and amendment.</p>
            <p>2. Of expediencie for him that heareth: when he is any way in danger of iniurie or infection, from the cunning, or corruption of the partie spoken of. For instance: Thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernest and obseruest some slie, smooth companion, vnder a cloake of Profession, and formall colour of conformitie to the best things, to insinuate into liking and acceptation with thine vsuspecting Christian friend: whereupon thou fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seest, that if hee goe on without notice and discouerie, and get once within him; a thousand to one, at length hee will either cunningly prey vpon him, or cursedly betray him. Now in this case, thou maist lawfully lay out such a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit in his colours, and for preuention of the mischiefe which might ensue vpon such a dangerous insinuation, disclose vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy friend his hollownesse and halting, and that lewdnesse
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6825:81"/>
and knauerie which he guilds ouer in the meane time, with a vaile of seeming, and vernish of hypocrisie; but is woont, when once hee hath attained his end, or acted his villany, to throw away his vizor. For such fellowes there are abroad in the world, who purposely mixe and ioyne themselues with Gods children, hang vpon, and adhere vnto true Christians, as men from whom by reason of the singlenesse of their hearts, and charitable vnsuspiciousnesse, they may either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or by accident sucke out the greatest aduantage.</p>
            <p>3. Of necessitie for him which speaketh: That hee may be preserued from guiltinesse and accessarinesse to the sinne, which by silence and saying nothing, hee should incurre and bring vpon himselfe. For instance: There comes to thy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice some notorious villanies, which concealement and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie would mightily animate, and easily transport to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excesse and outrage; but seasonable aduertisement gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to authoritie, as to a Magistrate, Minister, Tutor, Father, Master, Gouernour of Family, might bee a meanes to cut the knot and heart of such cursed good-fellowship, and stay the torrent of that scandalous insolencie: In this case, thou hast a calling to reueale, informe, and implore superiour assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for suppression of sinne. And therefore those of the house of <hi>Cloe</hi> did well to certifie <hi>Paul,</hi> of the disorders and<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 11.</note> dissentions amongst the Corinthians: And <hi>Pauls</hi> sisters<note place="margin">Acts 23. 16.</note> sonne, to acquaint the chiefe Captaine, with that deuillish plot of desperate conspiratours against <hi>Paul.</hi> Otherwise, both thou and they, by cowardly and cruell silence in such cases, might in some sort, iustly incurre the guilt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countablenesse euen for other mens sinnes so vnhappily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, when a seasonable, warrantable occasion is giuen thereby, of performing some Christian duty, as</p>
            <p>1. Of instruction, and forewarning to others; thus, or in the like manner: Thou hast a friend, whom thou seest, and fearest is entring a licencious course, which at length is like to breed his confusion: Whereupon thou tellest him, that such or such a man, iust as he begins; from contempt of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6825:81"/>
the Word, profanation of the Sabbath, disobedience to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, fell fearefully into a desperate knot of lewd compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to Alehouse hanting, after, to gaming, at last, to the gallowes: and therefore thou aduisest him to take heed in time: to let such wofull precedents of sinne and shame stand still in his eye, to stay him from breaking his necke at the bottome of the same staires: for if he continue the reines but a while longer vpon the necke of his rebellious nature, and still hold on so desperately with such wilde colts, the deuils Dromedaries to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ame excesse of riot, hee shall finde no more power in himselfe to stay, vntill from the height of sin, he fall into the bottome of hell, then a man hauing begunne to run down the steepest hill, can stop before he comes at the bottome. He that layes his foundation with fire-worke, must look in the end to be blowne vp: he that premises prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and rebellion, shall bee sure to conclude in cursednesse and confusion.</p>
            <p>2. Of praising God for the ruine, and rooting out of some implacable impenitent <note n="a" place="margin">Non desu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

Vpon which occasion thou discouerest vnto thy friend many passages and plots of his cruelty and hate against the Kingdome of Christ and his precious people, and that purposely to minister mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter also vnto others, of more heartily magnifying the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Gods iustice; which at length hath happily strooke downe <hi>Antiochus</hi> with an incurable, and inuisible plague; eaten vp <hi>Herod</hi> with vermine; made <hi>Pashur</hi> a terrour to his friends; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> to run from chamber to chamber to hide himselfe. For you must know, that the hearts and tongues of all good men, and friends to the Gospell, are woont to be filled with much glorious ioy, and heartiest songs of praise, at the downefall of euery dogged opposite; when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging hand of God, not without speciall terror, hath tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled from the top of malice and pride, any Antichristian and enraged enemy. So the Iewes feasted, after <hi>Haman</hi> was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6825:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But in such cases looke vnto thy heart with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie watchfulnesse and search: That he be an enemy indeed, I meane, to Christianity: that thou doe it not out of spleene, humour, faction, personall enmity, for the destruction of the creature or the like: but simply and sincerely out of zeale to the glory of Gods Iustice, prosperitie of the Gospell, and peace of the Church. Otherwise, in stead of a Christian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it will prooue to thee a cursed cruelty.</p>
            <p>3. Of Prayer, Thus, or in the like manner: Thou art acquainted with the secret plots of some plausible Tyrant against the people of God, whose words perhaps may bee as soft as Butter, or Oyle, and outward deportment promise faire; but his thoughts and inuisible intendments against the better side, composed all of blood &amp; bitternesse, of Gall and Gunpowder; whereupon, as occasion is offered, thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maskest his malice amongst thy Christian friends, to the end that they may communicate, and contribute their prayers for the confusion and infatuation of all his deuilish depths and deuices of hell. Teares, patience, and prayers, were euer the defensiue weapons of Gods people. Let Powder plots, Parisian Massacres, inuincible Armadoes, slaughtering of Kings, and such like horrible and hellish combustions, brand with an euerlasting staine of cruelty and blood, the Popish religion and persecutors of Heauenly truth: But let the sonnes of the Gospell be euer content to confront and beate backe the implacable rage of all Gods enemies, and haters of sincerity and grace, onely with the cutting edge, and shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened poynt of feruent prayer. Which weapon they may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge: hree wayes: 1. Indefinitely, against all desperate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, his Church, and Gospell, without intimation, so much as by thought, of any particular persons. So <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psalm. 129. 5. <hi>Let them all bee confounded and turned backe, that hate Zion. Deborah,</hi> Iudges 5. 31. <hi>So let all thine enemies perish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Lord: but let them that loue him, be as the sunne when hee goeth forth in his might.</hi> 2. Conditionally, when they perceiue some insulting <hi>Shebnaes,</hi> and insolent <hi>Hamans</hi> to persist and hold on in persecuting the Saints, and opposing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6825:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the power of Godlinesse; they may entreate the Lord, if they belong vnto him, to humble them in their places, and giue them repentance: but if hee purpose to giue them ouer finally to a Reprobate minde, and to the impetuous rage of their owne cruell dispositions, to cut them off, and vtterly confound them, that they bee no longer a burden to the Church, and vexation to his people. 3. Abstractiuely; against their extreme oppressions, and malicious plots, without any relation at all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o their persons. So <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. Sam. 15. 31. <hi>O Lord, I pray thee, turne the counsell of Achitophel into foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus: Thou obseruest some one to haue continued long a worthy and noted Professour, but now vnhappily begins to fall off from his former forwardnesse, to grow flacke and negligent in Family duties, cold and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in good causes, heartlesse, and hanging downe the head in godly company; to dis-regard, and vnderprize the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull meanes; to entertaine but ordinarie affections, if not some kinde of strangenesse towards other Professours, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of greater eminencie and acceptation for their grace; to suffer immoderate imployment and entanglement in the world to waste his heauenly-mindednesse; so that in all likelihood God will shortly giue him ouer vnto some scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous fall, as a punishment of his back-sliding: whereupon thou discouerest vnto thy Christian friends his declining state, onely that they may ioyne with thee in prayer, that the Lord would bee pleased to stay him in time, and re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish him in his first loue; lest by his further falling, the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Gospell also receiue a bruize and blemish, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession bee ill spoken of, and the enemies of sinceritie blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</p>
            <p>4. Of vindicating the power and truth of Religion from the mistakings of Ignorants, and Vnder-prizers. Thus, or in the like manner; Thou art in company where thou hearest a meere ciuill man, or a formall Professor at the best, whom the Church neuer discouered, or acknowledged to bee any of Hers, and thy selfe canst auerre out of thy certaine
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6825:83"/>
particular knowledge, that hee neuer set himselfe to seeke God with any conscience or constancie; but is vtterly vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the mysterie of godlinesse, family-exercises, sanctification of the Sabbaths, contributions to the Saints, exercises of mortification, selfe-deniall: I say, Thou hearest such a man commended for his Religion, forwardnesse, and the feare of God; which commendation, if hee carry away without contradiction, the rest of the company may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greedy to apprehend such a precedent, and resolue not to passe his Pitch of profession, as vnaccompanied with such paine and precisenesse; and yet approoued by wise and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding men, as hopefull and comfortable. Now in this case, it may concerne thee, but with as much wisdome, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and charitie as thou canst possibly, to disroabe such a fellow of his vndeserued attributions, and the reputation of that holinesse which he neuer had; lest both the By-stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders bee hartened to come short of Heauen, and the power of Christianitie bee disparaged by an ignorant and hurtfull vnder-ualuation.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, bee silent from all vnsauoury communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as lying, swearing, prophane, foolish, filthy <note n="a" place="margin">Linguam habes, non vt alios sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus tuis mordeas, sed vt Deo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias agas, &amp;c. <hi>Chrysost. in Epist. ad Ephes cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Serm.</hi> 17.</note> iesting; iesting out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> mocking and making Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as <note n="*" place="margin">Lam. 3. 63.</note> 
               <hi>Musike</hi> at Feasts, merry meetings, and cursed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticles of Good-fellowship; and such other rotten, ribald and Bedlam talke: which, because they are the knowne and proper language of the sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> the dung, froth, and damned euaporations of drunken wits; Christians, whom alone I labour to direct in this poynt, are not in such danger of, and therefore I haue nothing to doe with them at this time.</p>
            <p>III. Pray for, and practise an holy and discreete dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie, to diuert and draw from prophane and wicked, or too much worldly and ordinarie talke, to more sauoury conference, and heauenly discourse. Me thinks, it is great pitty, that Professours should euer meete without some talke of their meeting in heauen, or of the blessed meanes and wayes that leade thereunto, before they part. Yet many
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6825:83"/>
times, (such a deadnesse and dampe of zeale, and heauenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindednesse, haunts euen the holiest hearts in these vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie dayes of securitie and forme) worldly matters, Talke of others, or some more remarkeable accidents and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires abroad, speculatiue curiosities, some ceremoniall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable controuersies, or other such like impertinencies in one kinde or other, take vp and ingrosse, euen from Gods children, too much of many golden seasons, which might preciously serue, by their mutuall diuing with more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian edifying discourse into the great mysterie of godlinesse, and walkes of Christianitie, to nourish and increase a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them much spirituall warmth, comfort, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution against all vngodly oppositions, and to build vp one another in their most holy Faith, acquaintance with temptations, experimentall knowledge, more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble walking with God, &amp;c. To confront this common mischiefe and Mar-conference at Christian meetings, come vnto them prepared, as I aduised before; <hi>page</hi> 86, 87. But if the company bee contrary-minded, and vn-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to the language of Canaan, exercise and interpose all thy wit, courage, authoritie, and eloquence, to draw them from the dunghill of rotten talke; and by a wise plausible diuersion, and modestly ouer-ruling transition, carry the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of their present discourse, all thou canst, towards some Heauenly good, and spirituall end. 1. To which end, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, and apprehend all opportunities and occurrences, which may minister matter of digression into diuine talke; and acquaint thy selfe with the Arte of abstracting sacred instructions from the booke of the Creatures and businesses in hand. It was the practise of our blessed Sauiour: Vpon mention of bread, Matth. 16. hee prest vpon his Disciples, a disswasion from the Leauen of the Pharises: when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, Iohn 6. a number of people to throng about him for more miraculous bread, hee digressed into a most hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly discourse of the food of life. Vpon occasion of drinke being denied him by the <hi>Samaritane</hi> woman, Iohn 4. hee forgetting his wearinesse, hunger and thirst, labours to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6825:84"/>
her to the well head of euerlasting happinesse. 2. Haue euer in a readinesse some common heads, of more stirring and quickening motiues to minde heauenly things: as the cursed condition of our naturall state, the incomparable sweetnesse of Christian wayes, the vanity and vexations of all earthly things, the vncertainty and miseries of this short life, the euerlastingnesse of our second state in another world, the sudden executions of Gods fierce wrath vpon some notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones euen in this life, especially those, which are freshest in memory, and lateliest done; the terrors of death, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of that last and great Day drawing on apace, the horrors of a damned soule, &amp;c. Mention of these things, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times will strike full cold to the heart of the most swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering and sensuall <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> the most raging and roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring companions, and driue the most confident and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering worldling into his dumps. Talke then of these ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things, may by Gods blessing prepare and soften sometimes the hardest hearts for some thoughts of remorse, and more heauenly impressions. 3. But aboue all, get into thine own heart an habit of heauenly-mindednesse by much exercise, entercourse, and acquaintance with God, in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of thy soule euer and anon before him, in renuing and recouering thy peace, and comfortable accesse vnto him vpon euery fall and checke of conscience, in often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and foretaste of the inexplicable sweetnesse, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and eternitie of those Mansions aboue; in diuing into the secrets of his Kingdome by the helpe of humblenesse and godly feare; vpon the most sweet and soule-fatting dayes of humiliation, mortifying visitations of troubled and afflicted consciences, often conferences with humblest and best experienced Christians, &amp;c. By priuate imployment of thy soule in solemne reflections vpon it selfe; fruitfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting with what varietie of traines it was long detained in the state of darknesse; with what delayes and tergiuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, lets and assaults it met in its way to light; what bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse and terrors it passed thorow in the pangs of its new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; the tentations incident to its infancie in grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:6825:84"/>
and growth in seuerall graces, and the whole body of Christianitie; relapses, desertions, their discoueries, recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with all the meanes and circumstances: In a word, by a punctuall obseruing how God deales with it euery day. Be, I say, thus blessedly busied at home in thine owne heart, and thou shalt finde thy selfe much more pregnant and plentifull in holy talke when thou commest abroad. Wee are most apt and readiest to powre out our selues in publike, according to our priuate prouisions, and the most predominant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses and contemplations of the minde. The conferences of free and vnreserued spirits are ordinarily nothing else, but the cloathing of their ordinarie mentall conceptions, and heart-secrets with familiar formes of speech. Men for the most part, speake most and most willingly of those things they minde most. I aduise thus in this point, that thou mayst be habituated and heartened with resolution and delight, in the art and exercise of putting forward good talke; or of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting and drawing towards better in case of the contrarie. Otherwise, thou shalt neuer bee able to hold out with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie and courage, to crosse many times the generall mirth of the company, to put worldly-wisemen out of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all earthly talke, to draw worldlings, which goes most against the haire, to heare of heauenly things.</p>
            <p>VIII. Suruey thorowly before hand with the glorious Lampe of the Word of Life and Truth; watch ouer, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly with the illightened eye of a tender conscience, and euer punctually manage, and conduct with the particular light of spirituall prudence, euery action thou vndertakest, or that shall at any time passe thorow thy hand; of what kinde soeuer it be, whether naturall, recreatiue, ciuill, of mercy, Religion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which particulars, before I descend, let me commend vnto thee, and premise this Principle concerning actions in generall.</p>
            <p>Euery truly commendable and comfortable action, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of an absolute integritie of all concurrents and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites. Or thus: That which is good and lawfull, must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.

Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably in the present point; though some mixture of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and imperfections will cleaue vnto the face of the fairest action (an absolute and vnstained purity is incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with this vnglorified state of mortalitie;) yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, euery seuerall ingredient must bee attended, and tempered with its owne particular goodnesse and honestie, and seasonable conformitie to the whole; or else the whole action, howsoeuer right in other respects, is vtterly robd and disroabed of all true splendour, acceptation and grace. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heauen sowres the whole lumpe: one noxious hearbe brings death into the pot: The goodliest deed or dutie is quite peruerted and empoysoned, by the enormitie of any one particular requisite.

Tim. 4. 5. as a good seruant will venture vpon nothing, but what he knowes will please his Master. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, let the person be neuer so pleasing vnto God, his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neuer so good, his heart neuer so zealous, the meanes, circumstances and end neuer so excellent, yet all is naught. Worshipping Christ in a Crucifixe is naught in its owne nature, abominable, idolatrous, condemned in Gods Law, Exod. 20. 4, &amp;c. And therefore, bee it done with neuer so great deuotion and good meaning, with neuer so much Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

But amongst other cautions and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to season them, the parties, that are to be made partakers thereof, are to bee singled out with all godly discretion. 1. The true wants of a religious Professor, should in the first place bee the principall and most moouing obiect, to draw bounty from a truely charitable heart: according to that, Galat. 5. 10. <hi>As we haue therefore opportunitie, let vs doe good vnto all men, especially vnto them who are of the houshold of faith.</hi> 2. In the next place, the lame, the blind, the sicke, the aged, the trembling hand, or any that God hath made poore. 3.

to behold rufull obiects without horrour. And doest thou thinke then, hee will allow thee to feede thine eye and fancy, with their bloody torturing and tearing one another in pieces? 2. With what brutish sauagenesse thou deiectest and debasest humanitie, below the immanitie of beasts. No beast, they say, takes contentment in the hurting of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except in the case of hunger or anger. They satisfie their appetites and rage sometimes with cruelty and blood; but their eyes and fancies neuer. 3. That men bloodily min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towards harmelesse beasts, discouer our naturall propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to cruelty, which is further manifested, 1. by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes many times, thirsting and thrusting after the curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wofull spectacles, and their impatiency to tarrie the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the lamentable executions of guiltie persons. 2. And in that they take no delight to see wild beasts play, and sportingly to make much one of another; but are well pleased to see them bloodily encounter, mangle and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teare each other. These seeds then, or rather weeds of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, originally implanted in our hearts by the curse of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are too ranke and luxuriant of themselues; they need no manuring with barbarous inhumanities, and sports of blood. 4. That Rule which Diuines giue about recreations, we must not make Gods Iudgements &amp; punishments of sinne, either vpon man or beast, the matter and obiect of them. Now, best Diuines hold, that enmitie amongst themselues, was a fruite of our rebellion against God, and more generall iudgement inflicted vpon the creature after the fall. Which miserie comming vpon them by our means, should rather break our hearts and make them bleed; then minister matter of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our shame, &amp; vexing those very vexations, which our impiety hath put vpon them. Alas, sinfull man, what an heart hast thou, that canst take delight in the cruell tormenting of a dumbe creature! Is it not too much for thee to behold with dry eyes that fearefull brand, which only thy sinne hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest vpon it; but thou must barbarously also presse its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and make thy selfe merry with the bleeding mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that poore harmelesse thing, which in its kinde is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6825:88"/>
much more and farre better seruiceable to the Creator then thy selfe? Yet I deny not, but that there may bee another lawfull vse of this Antipathy, for the destroying of hurtfull, and enioying of vsefull creatures; so that it be without any taint, or aspersion of cruelty on our parts, or needlesse tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of the silly beasts.</p>
            <p>3. Ingrossers of time. Thousands there are, who plunge themselues ouer head &amp; eares in courses of pleasure; which they call recreations, wherein they very vnworthily and wofully waste the fat and marrow, as it were, of deare and precious time, the flower of their age, the strength of their bodies; emasculate and melt the vigour of their spirits, into effeminatenesse, sensualitie, and lust; drowne the faire and goodly hopes of their education, the honour of their Families, the expectation of the Countrey, the improoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their parts, in froth and folly: As though they were placed vpon earth, as <hi>Leuiathan</hi> in the Sea, onely to take their sport and pastime <note n="a" place="margin">Sunt profectò, qui ob hoc in hanc vitam addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos se putant, vt delicijs vacent, &amp; ventrem disrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant, &amp; corpus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinguent: ato; sic hinc migrent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mibus largiorem è suâ ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They haue their fooles Paradise heere, and therefore in the equitie of a iust and holy proportion, must with the Rich man looke for their payment and torment hereafter. But Gods children must make conscience of meddling at any time with recreations, without true cause and a iust calling thereunto, and hold them of the same account and consequence, with sleepe and other temperate refreshings, which serue onely to quicken the minde, reuiue the body, enlarge the breath, that wee may returne with more lightsomenesse and alacritie to our worke and Callings. The season then of comfortable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto these repaires and restoratiues is, when wee haue truely wearied our bodies with some honest imployment, or tired our minds in worthy and noble exercises, or both. And as we must not presse vpon them at our pleasure, and preuent true need, out of an hankering humour after sportfull vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, old haunts, good-fellow meetings, conformitie to the times, or some such sensuall and inordinate attractiue: so in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6825:89"/>
the entertainment of them, wee must receiue them, as men doe honey, with the tip of the finger, not with a full hand. By no meanes ought we to engage, and as it were, to engulfe our affections into their excesses and immoderation; not suffer them so to insinuate, as to steale away our hearts into a pleasing insensible thraldome; so creating necessities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations; which is an extreme misery, and intolerable sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery; wherein, notwithstanding many truly vnworthy and vnnoble Gallants miserably languish, and come to nothing; prooue onely vnprofitable burthens of the earth; and in stead of a blessing, the very bane of the Countrey that bred them.</p>
            <p>Let such considerations as these serue as so many curbes, to restraine vs from an vnseasonable intrusion vpon them: and so many keene spurres to poast vs out of them, before we be limed and entangled by them.</p>
            <p>1. Time is short. Our life is but a span long, a bubble, a<note place="margin">Punctum est, quod viuimus, &amp; puncto minus.</note> thought, a smoake, a shadow, a dreame, the very dreame of a shadow; or if you can name any thing more fading and fraile: and yet vpon this moment depends eternitie. As wee behaue our selues heere vpon earth, either in conformitie to the wayes of God, walking with him, selfe-denyall, &amp;c. or in fashionablenesse to the world, seruing the times, and our owne turnes, &amp;c. so shal we fare euerlastingly in another life: And either become most glorious and happie creatures, crowned with an exquisite confluence and quintessence, as it were, of sweetest vnmixed eternall pleasures; a very shadow whereof, not the largest naturall hearts of deepest vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men, from the Creation, to the last day, were they all v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited into one exactest height and excellency of conceit, could possibly comprehend; nay, in this one circumstance, at the least, the Saints shall surpasse euen Angelicall felicitie; they shall behold, with incredible ioy, their owne nature, in that respect, honoured and aduanced aboue the brightest Cherub, shining for euer with infinite beauty and glorified splendour, in the sacred Person of the Sonne of God: or else fall irrecouerably into the mouth of inexplicable and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesse
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6825:89"/>
horrour, and so become the forlorne and wofull Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, vpon which shall bee exercised and executed the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable wrath of God, and fiercest torments in hell, with extremitie and euerlastingnesse; nay, and in this point, more vnhappy than the very Deuils: For since their Apostacie, there was no meanes or possibilitie vouchsafed vnto them of recouery and returne to those euerlasting Mansions of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; But the sonnes and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> since their fall, haue had the very Sonne of God himselfe, with the deare and vnualuable cry of his owne hearts blood, to meditate vnto, and sollicite the Father of all compassions and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for restitution into fauour and plantation into the Angels roome. And therefore as this thought, Oh what vnhappy and accursed creatures were we, who being crowned with the matchlesse transcendency of all felicities and glory, would not hold our station and haue shined still! I say, as this thought will endlesly haunt the damned angels with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiueable byting and anguish; so, not onely an answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble selfe-fretting torture from this conceit; Alas, that wee kept not Paradise! will rent and teare the wofull hearts of the wicked in hell: but also a further sting of that neuer-dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Worme, not incident to the Apostate angels, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely enrage them with restlesse gnawings of conscience and gnashing of teeth; when out of the horrour of their hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous wofull yellings, they shall cry out against themselues; What wretches? What beasts? What madded Deuils were we! who when the glorious Blood of Christ Iesus was so mercifully tendered vnto vs in the Ministery of the Word, all our life long, we turned our backes against such blessed and bleeding imbracements; and cruelly cut the throates of our owne poore soules, by impenitent continuance in sinne: so loosing for a few bitter-sweet pleasures in this vale of teares, for an inch of time, fulnesse of ioy at Gods right hand, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all eternitie.</p>
            <p>2. Time is precious. If all this great massie bodie of the whole earth, whereupon we tread, were turned into a lumpe of gold, it were not able to purchase one minute of time.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:6825:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And were there no other circumstance to set an impression of high valuation vpon it, yet this very one doth much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble it; That all these faire and shining bodies aboue our heads, and principally the Prince of all the lights of heauen, that glorious and mighty Giant, the prime and crowne of all corporall creatures, doe tire &amp; waste, as it were, their celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vigours, with the incredible swiftnesse of endlesse reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to beget and giue vs time; I say, vs, who for the sinne of euery moment in it, deserue eternity of punishment. But that our hearts may bee more sensibly wrought vpon, and more effectually affected with the dearenesse and precious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it; let vs suppose that the Lord, by diuine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie dispensation, should giue leaue to a damned soule to come into this life againe, and would vouchsafe him but one houre of a new triall, as it were, and a second time of gracious visitation: Oh how highly would hee prize, how eagerly would hee apprehend, with what infinite watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, endeauour, and diligence, would hee improoue that little short golden season? And if therein he might haue but the happinesse to heare a Sermon; Oh with what affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate inflamed attention would hee listen vnto the Word of Life! how would his heart breake and bleed within him, and fall asunder in his brest, like drops of water, to heare Gods iust wrath and holy indignation thundred out and threatned against sinne! With what insatiable grasping and deare imbracement would he labour to lay hold vpon <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> and his gracious promises? In a word, he would think, that in demonstration of thankefulnesse for Gods fauour, might hee be so happy as to haue it, the spending of euery moment of all that great body of time, which lies betweene the Creation and the worlds end, if hee might liue so long, in as holy, pure, strict, precise, heauenly manner, as euer did the most mortified Martyr vpon earth, were farre too little. Shall we then triflingly passe and play away the time that is so precious? And in my supposition, the damned soule should bee sure of an houre: But none of vs can possibly purchase securitie for very one moment, after I haue spoken
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:6825:90"/>
this word. The time present is our onely time; wee haue no more power and command ouer the time to come, then ouer the time past. Euen the next minute thou mayest be cut off by the stroake of death from all further time of repentance, acceptation, and grace for euer. Nay, yet further, were it possible that any vncomfortable passion were incident to a glorified Saint in heauen, he would be sorry and transported with extreme anger and indignation against himselfe; That hee was not a more greedy ingrosser, as it were, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouer of time, for doing excellently vpon earth; and that euery houre after his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion was not crowned with some rarer and more remarkable exploit; with some more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and noble seruice, for the glorifying of that most boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and euer-blessed God, who hath now honoured him with such vnspeakeable glory, and that Crowne of ioyes, so infinitely transcendent to the vtmost expectation of the most enlarged heart. Howsoeuer therefore men of this world, for the most part, except they be continually exercised in variety of pleasing imployments, and still entertained with fresh successions of new pleasures, are sore troubled with time, and tediously perplext how to passe it; which is the reason that they deuise so many passe-times; with much sollicitous and sensuall forecast, plot and proiect to themselues afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, many and many a merry meeting, idle visitations, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings, mutuall entertainments of meere complement and vanitie, iouiall reuellings, as they call them, &amp;c. that they chaine together, as it were, by the Art of Epicurisme and with linkes of liberty, continued occasions of company kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and good-fellow meetings, from the one end of the weeke to the other: (For solitarinesse and selfe-conuersing, is a very torturing racke, and the tide-time of melancholy, to the waking consciences of gracelesse and guilty men.) Though, I say, this bee the custome and carriage of Satans Reuellers; yet all Christians ought to haue time in deare and high esteeme, in euery moment whereof should they lay downe ten thousand liues for His sake that pardons their sinnes; and also doe him all the glorious seruice of all, both

the militant and Triumphant Saints, it were infinitely too little for his loue. Wherefore no marueile though well-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised and watchfull, they feele themselues rather pincht with want, then prest with plenty of her golden offers and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to doe good, and bee euer addrest to entertaine and welcome euery houre with speciall attendance, as a gracious Indulgence of his patient loue, and long-suffering, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to doe him yet more honour, (for which cause alone they long to liue) before they goe downe into the pit and be seene no more. And they should be so farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid of solitarinesse, as to hold their time alone, the only time for sweetest contemplations, heauenly commerce, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer conuersing and communion with God.</p>
            <p>3. We that are earthly Angels by the noblenesse of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, though by voluntarie degeneration incarnate deuils, were put into, and planted within the compasse and comforts of this great and curious <hi>Frame</hi> round about vs, the goodly Workmanship of Gods owne Almightie hand, wherein we haue the Sunne to serue vs; and wee of this Kingdome by matchlesse and incomparable fauour, the heauenly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling beames of the Sunne of righteousnesse, to shine vpon vs through his glorious Gospel, I say, we were placed in this world, not to serue our owne turnes, to please our owne hearts, to follow our own wayes, to eate, drinke, and sleepe; to temporize, reuell, or roote in the earth; to play the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, Libertines, Machiauelians; to climbe into high roomes, by all meanes lawfull and vnlawfull; by briberie, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, flatterie, base insinuations, following the times; or some fouler meanes, and thereto domineere and tyrannize: In a word, to serue the deuill for a few and euill dayes, to die, and so to be damned. No, no, a nobler taske and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent end is appointed and apportioned for the Prince and principallest of all earthly creatures.

And yet for all this, many of vs, while wee yet abode in the darknesse and damnation of our naturall state, spent many yeeres, some twenty, some thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, some perhaps fortie, wholly vpon hell, in base and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed courses, quite crosse to the end of our Creation. All that time (a misery to be lamented euen with teares of blood) was vtterly cast away vpon the kingdome of darkenesse, fearefully lost vpon our owne lusts, sinfull fashions, and <hi>pride of life;</hi> slauishly and wofully wasted in the deuils seruice. Nay, all that while, abominable and beastly wretches that wee were, wee set our selues with sensuall rage, against the very face of heauen, lay in actuall high Treason, and bore Armes in open Rebellion against that dreadfull Maiestie, which might most iustly euery moment of that wofull time haue arrested vs with death, arraigned vs at the Barre of his Iustice, and throwne vs down into hell. What manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons then I pray you ought wee to be, in the short remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of those few and euill dayes which are behind? Euen to imploy and improoue the vtmost possibilitie of all our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acquired and gracious parts, our credit, calling, outward state, all our power, means, occasions, aduantages, to win and worke out glory vnto God, enlargement of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, confusion to the deuils dominion, conuersion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, comfort vnto our owne poore soules against our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding houre. A fellow that hath loytered a great part of the day in his iourney, or businesse, and yet must needes reach home and finish his taske, will toile and sweat at it towards night, double his paines, and put all his strength vnto it: so we hauing not only been slacke in our businesse about Gods seruice, and slow in the way to heauen, but euen for many

            <p>And as consideration of former time cursedly misspent; so a fore-conceit also of dreadfull times to come, may iustly cause vs to make much of, and husband well euery moment wee haue presently in our hands; for treasuring vp an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly hoard of grace, comfort, patience, and courage, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the euill day.

As yet, perhaps, the Almighty is with vs, his prouidence protects our habitations, no remarkable affliction hath taken hold vpon vs; so that there is no mourning, or spectacles of miseries in our families; no crying, <hi>O my father Abraham, and O my sonne Isaac; O my sonne Absalom, my sonne, my sonne, Absalom; O Absalom, my sonne, my sonne!</hi> And these houses of flesh, it may be, wherein wee dwell for a few and euill dayes, are as yet in reasonable good repaire; and it is euery way with vs, as it was with <hi>Iob</hi> in the dayes of his youth, when he washed his steps with butter, and the rockes powred him out riuers of oyle; yet wee may build vpon it, as a Principle which neuer failed sinfull mortalitie, that dayes of danger and distresse will haue their turne and time also. Sorrow and sicknesse, perplexitie and feare, temptation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, trouble of conscience, the destroying Sword, a fierie triall, striuing vnto blood; <hi>Marian</hi> times of most abhorred memory, or some dreadfull visitation in one kinde or other, may seize vpon vs, we know not how soone.

A serious fore-conceit of the vnconceiueable comfort of the one; and how cold the other will strike vnto our hearts, might make vs easily grow into blessed <hi>Bradfords</hi> care and practise this way, of whom it is reported, That he counted that houre not well spent, wherein he did not some good; either with his pen, study, or in exhorting others, &amp;c. and not to rush vpon recreations vnseasonably, without necessity and warrantable calling.</p>
            <p>5. The holiest hearts of the most worthy Saints are wofully haunted with too many distractions and violent intrusion of idle, vaine, and impertinent thoughts, euen in holy duties, religious exercises, and solemne vse of the ordinances: which without extraordinarie watchfulnesse, and wrastling on their parts, would vtterly bereaue and robbe them of all the sweetnesse, power and profit of those blessed meanes, and by little and little quite transforme them into forme and perfunctorinesse. If in the best then and heauenliest businesses, the vanity of our owne mindes, and malice of the Deuill presse vpon vs with such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie and restlesse assaults; with what furious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous incursions and vastations of conscience are they like to oppresse vs in our idle houres, ill spent time, and

pursuit of pleasures? Consideration whereof, me thinkes, should cause Christians, who alone are truely sensible of the interruption and discontinuance of their sweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and societie with Christ, and smart many times for the estrangement of their thoughts and affections from God: onely to haue recourse to recreations in case of true neede; for necessitie, I say, and seasonably, euen as they vse physicke; so may they expect Gods gracious protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the hurtfull preuailing of those sensuall distempers and licentious ranging of their thoughts, which are wont to enrage and empoyson the mindes and affections of carnall men, all the while: and to make account so often as they are haled by the cunning ensnarement of old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, the tyrannie of former custome, or vnmortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yeeldingnesse of their owne deceitfull hearts, to immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and excesse in this kinde; so often to expose their hearts by Gods iust permission, as a prey to temptation and vanitie.

The intolerable bitternesse of the contrary; I meane, spirituall horrour, which, we see, sometimes by wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, doth enrage the guilty consciences of some forlorne wretches, with such restlesse furies, and vnutterable anguish, that at length, (extremest, I know not whether madnesse or cruelty!) they lay violent and villanous hands vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, In which case, such an hell vpon earth is horrour of conscience, they care not a button for the sweetnesse of life, the rufull cries of their owne deare children, the heauy lookes of their yoke-fellowes, the abhorred infamy they bring vpon their owne names, families, kindred, buriall, posteritie.

            <p>3. The differences betweene spirituall and carnall ioy: in respect,</p>
            <p>1. Of Lastingnesse. A spiritually merry heart is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall feast, saith <hi>Salomon;</hi> whereas <hi>the ioy of the hypocrite is but for a moment. Iob</hi> chap. 20. 5. Carnall ioy is like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, spirituall like the light of the Sunne. While the Play lasts, the sensualist laughs; but hee falls into his dumps when all is done. The Drunkard is merry, whilest hee reuels it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his pot-companions in the Ale-house; but when he comes home, there is many times wofull worke. Whilest the Gamester is at play, he is well enough pleased; but when hee hath made away all, hee is ready to make away himselfe also. A cunning and prosperous Worldling, I confesse, by Gods permission may patch together his pleasures all his life long: but at furthest, at death comes the deadly and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting dampe: whereas hee that walkes with God, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and comfortable all the day; and death is the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breake to him of euerlasting brightnesse.

But godly ioy is like the light of the Sunne, which though it may for a time bee ouercast with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6825:95"/>
clouds of temptations, mists of troubles, and persecutions, darknesse of melancholy; yet it ordinarily breakes out againe with more sweetnesse and splendour, when the storme is ouer: but howsoeuer, it hath euer the Sunne of righteousnesse, and Fountaine of all comfort, so resident and rooted in the heart, that not all the darknesse and gates of Hell shall euer be able to displant or distaine it, no more then a mortall man can pull the Sunne out of his Sphere, or put out his glorious eye.</p>
            <p>2. Of puritie. The edge and rellish of carnall ioy, is euer much rebated and imbittered with many sowre sauces, and enuenomed mixtures; impatiencie of delay, difficulty and danger in attainment, vnanswerablenesse to fore-conceits and expectation, many secret terrours, fretting iealousies, discontented indignations against their discontinuance and vanishing, &amp;c. And besides, those three ensuing indiuiduall stings, which to an illightned conscience as inseparably and sensibly dogge them at the heeles, as a shadow the body in the Sun-shine; cut the very throat, and burst the heart of all worldly pleasures. 1. One of them is, as it were, naturall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately attending all earthly mirth; more melancholy and heauy-heartednesse afterward. For as the Riuers of sweete water runne their course to die in the salt sea; so the hony of all earthly pleasure, euer endeth in the gall of griefe. Voluptuousnesse euen in her dearest minions, ordinarily expires with anguish and anger that it is gone. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie flashes of sensuall delight, are like the light of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which leaue at the cloze a noisome vexing snuffe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.<note place="margin">Extrema ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is cleare in <hi>Haman,</hi> though hee was encompassed and crowned with much vndeserued and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie precedency and pompe; yet this one little thing, to wit, because <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not bow the knee, and doe reuerence vnto him at the Kings gate, did vtterly marre and dissweeten all the other excellencies and extraordinarinesse of the Kings fauour: See Hester, Chap. 5.

It is, as it were, the amiable splendour and sparkle of that <hi>white Stone</hi> in the Reuelation, Chap. 2. 17. which only shines vpon heauenly hearts, with delight vnspeakable &amp; glorious: For seate and certainty; It is engrauen by the Finger of God with an heauenly Sun-beame, as it were, shining from the face of Christ in the very center of the heart; which not all the powers of darknesse or hellish mists can finally dimme or dispell; the world neither giue nor take from vs, neither man, nor deuill, nor shadow of death euer raze or roote out.

            <p>Which sith it is so, that spirituall ioy is such an vnualuable Iewell, and carnall so cursed a vanity; let euery Christian bee exceedingly carefull, not to suffer the froth and filth of this, to staine or lessen the glory and sweetnesse of the other. But if he once perceiue any company or kind of recreation begin to steale away his heart from communion and comfort in his God; let him abandon it as a canker and cut-throate of his spirituall happinesse; and euer prize and preferre the ioy of the soule, delights of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> refreshings of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, infinitely before all worldly pleasures, carnall

            <p>Thus much of recreations.</p>
            <p>II. Let me adde a word or two of visitations. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall visitations of vnsanctified great Ones, without iust occasion and a warrantable Calling; besides, sinfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of precious time, are many times vnhappy occasions to embarke, especially yeelding natures, in some base and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>t</hi> may serue as a remarkeable instance for this purpose. Vpon a time, hee came downe to see <hi>Ahab</hi> King of Israel, by way of Courtly visitation. And though hee was equall vnto him in the crowned Maiestie of a King, and a good man; yet traines and insinuations by Royall entertainments, and a Princely feast premised, as it appeares in the storie, hee was cunningly c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>tcht and cast into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation and societie of an vnhappy warre: whereby with a dishonourable precipitation, he plunged himselfe both into spirituall miseries, and temporall mischiefe, both hurt his conscience, and hazarded his life. For the first, 1. Hee sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely and rashly promised aide vnto <hi>Ahab,</hi> whom the Lord hated, before hee knew Gods will in the point from the mouth of the Prophet. 2. When faithfull <hi>Michaiah</hi> had deliuered the truth, and acquainted them with the minde of God; he notwithstanding went on with the businesse. 3. He did not appeare on the Prophets side, and in his defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the imperious insolency of that false flattering <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah;</hi> or the mercilesse tyrannie of <hi>Ahab;</hi> who sent him to prison for telling him the truth. Foule aspersions vpon so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a King! For the second, by the cruell cunning of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-hearted <hi>Ahab,</hi> hee exposed himselfe both to the en-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred and concurrent fury of the whole Syrian Armie; (one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon a penitent eiaculation, his life was rescued miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously from that extremest danger) and also to the wrath of God, for helping the vngodly, and louing them that hared

            <p>Mistake me not: I purpose not in this passage to censure or disgrace any warrantable ceremonie &amp; solemnities of State; mutuall entercourse of noble deportment amongst Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeres; ciuill exchange of faire &amp; amiable behauiour one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another; any charitable offices of humanity, or Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an passages of courtesie and loue: but the idle, formall, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering vanities, Hypocrisies, disguisements of those many needlesse, fruitlesse and endlesse salutations, complements, visitations, entertainments, affected and acted by such vaine people, who are extremely troubled how to be rid of time. A commoditie of high account with all those, who are sensible and mindfull of their last account: Euery moment whereof ought in the meane time to bee crowned with fruitfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement, by all those that truely feare God.

In such a case it is not vncomely for <hi>Paul,</hi> to trauaile from Arabia to Ierusalem to visit <hi>Peter,</hi> Galat. 1 18. Or the <hi>Queene of the South,</hi> from the vttermost parts of the earth, to see <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1. Kings 10. 1. But I would not haue glistering folly, guilded rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sacrificed vnto with so much flatterie and counterfeit crouching. For why should silken dung bee so adored, and golden damnation deified? Now the reasons why such visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as well as recreations may many times prooue snares to entangle vs in sinne, damps to dull our forwardnesse; or one way or other breede and bring vpon vs some spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all miseries, are such as these:</p>
            <p>1. Great men without grace, ordinarily make vse of all others for their owne aduantage. With an imperious policie and a kinde of <hi>Machiauelian</hi> Alchymy, they secretly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisibly conuert, dispose and manage the agency, abilities, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:6825:101"/>
seruiceablenesse of their followers, visitants, adherents and dependants, to serue their owne turnes, to feede their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, further their priuate ends of profit, pleasure, rising, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, or some other choise carnall contentment and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant worldly delight. They haue their portion in this life, and their heauen here; therefore they labour to make their earthly Paradise as full of pleasures, as possibly they can. Their owne sensuall couetous and ambitious hearts are the centers, wherein the lines and leuell of all their plots, policies, and proiects doe concurre, and meete; and to which they conduct and direct the officiousnesse, pliablenesse, and seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall seruices of all those with whom they hold any kinde of correspondence or entercourse.</p>
            <p>2. Such exercises of Courtly vanities, sleeuelesse errands, idle businesse, are Satans chiefest and choysest seasons for the suggestion of temptations, and too successefull discharge of his fiery darts. Hee hath ordinarily more power ouer men, and is much likelier to preuaile, when he findes them idle or ill occupied; then when they are busied with humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sinceritie in religious duties, or the necessarie workes of a lawfull Calling. In our best and holyest imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hee is indeed most eager against vs; but at times of idlenesse and exercises of vanity, hee is commonly most suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull. In Gods businesses, the honest executions of our Calling, and seasonable Christian recreations, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect vpon good ground, and with hopefull comfort, Gods protection, the ordinarie assistance of his blessed Spirit; harmlesnesse from the creatures; Satans restraint; some good measure of mortifying helpe against the rebellious stirrings of our owne corruptions, and such other blessings promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in such cases. But if men will needs be idle or imployed in vanity, they iustly bereaue themselues of all these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable protections and priuiledges. For it is iust with God, at such times that Hee should withdraw from them His owne protecting hand, restraine the gracious influences of that holy Spirit, and let loose against them with indignation, Satan, the creatures, and their owne corruptions, which is a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:6825:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very grieuous cut to a tender and waking conscience.</p>
            <p>3. The presence and protestations, the intimations and motions of men in high place, mingled with an affected fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar communication of themselues, and plausible neglect of all formall solemnities &amp; austerities of state, vpon purpose to insinuate sooner, and more suttlely; are many times very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to preuaile with, and perswade especially inferiours. For they are apt when they are so assaulted: 1. To conceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues highly honoured, when those condescend and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to intreate and be beholding, who might in other cases command, nay, and perhaps vpon a point of aduantage, and pang of displeasure, quite crush and cashier them. 2. To hold it a conuenient policy in these dayes of the raigne of iniquity and selfe-loue, when <hi>Iudgement is turned backward, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice stands a farre off; when truth is falne in the street, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cannot goe,</hi> as the Prophet speakes, to gratifie and demerit such mighty Ones, as may shelter and protect them from all stormes of violence, oppressions and wrong; nay and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by their countenance procure them a great deale of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and esteeme; if not obseruance and awfulnesse from those amongst whom they liue. 3. To call to mind out of too many wofull experiences, that in the frownes and angry foreheads of great men, are infolded many times many secret complots of cunning cruelty, and plausible malice: which when time serues, fall full heauy vpon the hearts and heads of inferiours, which are not in all poinis pliable to their humours. And out of such carnall considerations as these, by a rash vnaduised yeeldingnesse, they too often plunge themselues hand ouer head into vnworthy engagements, and become instruments of ill offices; the basenesse and iniquitie whereof doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in cold blood strike full cold vnto their hearts; and leaues a gash and grieuous wound in their consciences, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Christian reputations.</p>
            <p>4. At such entertainments and tables of Great men, not friends to the truth; thou wilt be ready to <hi>vomit thy morsels,</hi>

Nay, besides the resolution of thy iudgement, that in such a case thou wouldest farre rather haue stayed at home with a dinner of greene hearbs, then to haue thine eares so grated, and heart grieued all the while at a great table; euen in nature thou shalt fare worse. For thy iust indignation, discontentment and sadnesse vpon such ground, will naturally contract thine heart, thicken thy blood, chill thy spirits; that naturall heare will faint and faile in the ordinary current and course of concoction. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile then though thou be readier to vomit thy morsels, then to reioyce in those high entertainments or variety of messes, which are dissweetened with such distastfull and bitter mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

For the first; out of the ingenuous simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and honesty of thy heart, thou wilt returne reall, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, affectionate demonstrations of thankfulnesse, for meere
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:6825:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dissembled formall ceremonies of entertainment and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. For the other; thou shalt be so farre from finding a free and comfortable vent and entertainment to any good talke; that if thou meddle that way, thou marrest all the mirth. Mention of heauenly things, our last account, the life to come, iudgements against sinne, priuiledges of the Saints, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the holy Ones, &amp;c. which might sweetly season, and as it were, sanctifie their meeting, and those good creatures of God they so plentifully enioy; would presently cast all the company into dumps of melancholy. The Word of God, writ vpon the wall in the very height and ruffe of their greatest iollitie and reuelling, did make the heart, ioynts and knees of that mighty King <hi>Belshazzer</hi> to tremble, as the leaues of the forrest when they are shaken with the winde. How often may we obserue many goodly and gracious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses buried in the bosomes of men of vnderstanding and worth, placed below, by reason of the domineering talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuenesse, and imperious ignorance of some silken Idoll sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the head of the table? Horses, and Hounds &amp; Hawks, deuoure full often and eate vp not onely spirituall and holy, but euen all morall and manly talke.</p>
            <p>For the more conuenient declining and preuention of any ensnarement and inconuenience in this kinde; let mee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Christian such cautions and considerations as these:</p>
            <p>1. Euer before thou enter out of thy doores, vpon any occasion, businesse, iourney, visitation; weigh well with due deliberation, in the ballance of an holy wisedome, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, concurrents, company, probabilitie of all euents, and consequents on both sides; of staying at home, or going abroad; visiting this or that friend; vndertaking that or the other businesse; and euer constantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and resolue that way; which in all likelyhood will bring most glory vnto God, good vnto others, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto thine owne conscience. Let it onely bee the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full libertie of hopelesse worldlings, to waste their time and labour; (for the needlesse expence of euery moment of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6825:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one, and motion of the other, they must very shortly be full dearely accountable at Gods strict Tribunall) in those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent vagaries and idle visitations, which haue no other motiue, but a desire to be rid of time, and to feede a gadding and restlesse humor; no other end, but vanity or vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; no issue, but temptation, and greater disabilitie to good duties. But let euery wisely resolute and truly iudicious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian disdaine, howsoeuer worldly wisdome deride it, to step ouer his threshold without a warrantable Calling, aime at some honest end, probable foresight of some good to come thereon, honour to God, furtherance of some good cause, good vnto our brethren, discharge of some dutie of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, performance of Christian offices, of charitie, humanitie, naturall affection, mutuall comforting, confirming, refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and building vp one another in our <hi>most holy faith,</hi> and the like. Otherwise hee shall bee in great danger to returne home farre worse, then when he went out; laden both with more personall guiltinesse, and accessarinesse to others sinne; bleeding with some fresh bruise of conscience, by falling scandalously, or failing in some Christian dutie; growne into a further disacquaintance and estrangement from God; deepelier sunke, perhaps, into some sinfull societie, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall conformities with men of this World.</p>

It is so also in the present point of visitations.</p>
            <p>2. Although the Apostle, 1.

It is a foule signe of a false heart, and a fellow, that at length will certainely fall away; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, entertaine, and enioy with equall patience and delight the Worlds Fauourites, and Gods Friends: to bee as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, open-handed, and open-housed to a good-fellow, as to a gracious man. Euery true-hearted <hi>Nathaneel</hi> rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and well aduised, cannot chuse but apprehend, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and feele a vast and vnualuable difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the sweete heauenly communion, and confident communication of heart-secrets with faithfull fruitfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and the irkesome intrusions, vexing vaine-glorious tediousnesse, and frothy conferences of carnall men. If any of Gods children therefore, at any time be disposed to take any allowance and encouragement from this place, to inuite, or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:6825:104"/>
visit knowne enemies to the puritie of Religion, or power of godlinesse; let him cast his eye also vpon those cases and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may make it comfortable. They are such as these: 1. Their saluation. 2. Thine owne safety.</p>
            <p>1. For the first, bee sure to propose vnto thy selfe their spirituall good, as thine onely aime, or at least, principall end; and in the sinceritie and singlenesse of thine heart, to seeke indeed the saluation of their soules. Wee haue <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> himselfe a precedent in this case, Matth. 9. 10, 11, 12. Hee suffered with patience, Publicans and sinners to presse into his company, and did eate and drinke with them, vpon purpose, to heale their soules, and helpe them out of Hell. But his pure and sacred soule was endowed with an infinite impossibilitie of receiuing any touch, or tainture from those wicked Ones, with whom hee conuersed; whereas, wormes and wretches that we are! if we watch not extraordinarily, and stand stoutly vpon our guard, wee are farre likelier to be peruerted by them, then they conuerted by vs: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at such times it concernes vs much, to recollect and quicken vp all the powers of our soules, and spirituall forces, with speciall addresse and resolution to preserue and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, all we can, the honour, truth, and seruants of God from all staine, disparagement and vnworthy censure. Let vs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and looke to bring as much wisdome and courage, to confront and countermine; as the Deuils Proctors, cunning and malice, to vndermine &amp; affront the Kingdome of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and glory of Christianitie. It is lawfull and laudable for the Phisicions of the bodie, to visit sometimes such pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, as are infected with contagious diseases, to cure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them: so that according to the Rules of their Art, they arme themselues with preseruatiues and counterpoysons, to preuent &amp; repell the noysomnes of the aire, and noxious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors: so it may not prooue vnseasonable for spiritual Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be drawn sometimes out of a desire of doing good, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the company of those, who are wofully ouerrun with the leprosie of sinne, and haue, as it were, the plague-sore of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous life running vpon them; so that they bee fore-armed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6825:104"/>
with prayer, premeditation, watchfulnesse, &amp;c. to purifie and preserue their owne soules from spirituall infection.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, in case of thine owne safetie; but so, that in so doing, thy sincere heart be not conscious vnto it selfe, of slauish distrust, false feares, preiudice of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, reliance vpon the arme of flesh, &amp;c. but that it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and approoue vpon good ground, and out of an holy wisdome, the present occasion, whether of inuitation or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation, as a comfortable meanes offered by Gods good hand to mitigate the malice, and mollifie the hearts of those which might doe thee a mischiefe. It was the saying of a wise man, that he would rather haue a Dogge to fawne vpon him, then barke at him; and barke at him onely, then bite him. Whereby hee intimated thus much, as I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; that Gods children should not out of an austere, sowre, vnwarrantable retirednesse, exasperate and enrage vnnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the too much already alienated affections of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary-minded; but so farre as they may, without wound of conscience, staine of their innocencie, or imputation of spirituall cowardlinesse, obserue them with such common offices of humanitie, which may dis-infierce and keepe them, if not hearty friends, yet at least (which in these corruptest and angry times we hold a degree of happinesse) moderate and ingenuous enemies. <hi>Isaac</hi> may be an instance in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond case, who for a more confident securing of himselfe, and comfortable settling of his peace, inuited <hi>Abimelech</hi> and his followers to a Feast, Gen. 26. 30. To the same purpose, <hi>Iacob</hi> sent a present to <hi>Esau,</hi> Genes. 32. 20. and promised to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit him at <hi>Seir,</hi> Genes. 33. 14. But now at such times, and in such company, thou hadst need put on a great deale of courage and patience, wisedome and watchfulnesse; and warily decline two obuious errours, &amp; dangerous extremes; furious zeale, and saint-hearted silence; of which see before, pag. 119.</p>
            <p>3. Doe not so distaine thy worth and worthy hopes; discouer not such extreme weakenesse and true basenesse of minde: resemble not so neere the fearefull folly of obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:6825:105"/>
and vaine-glorious worldlings; as to suffer the eye and excellencie of thine heauenly Spirit, to be any whit dazeled or dulled with formall affected glistering of outward glory; as to hunt with fawning terrour, after the transitory fauour of worldly greatnesse, to adore worthlesse Magnificoes, and the worlds Minions with vndeserued flattering attributions; and with ambitious affectation, to contend for their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and vncomfortable correspondence with them. The greatest man without vertue and grace, though neuer so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously enriched with humane felicities, is but as a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasse hung ouer with iewels; a very spectacle of commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to euery spirituall eye; euen as that body is, which adorned with a goodly feature, and many other admirable beauties, yet wanteth eye-sight, the comfort of life; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it walkes in perpetuall darkenesse and desperate danger. Goodnesse, though attended with contempt and disgrace, is incomparably more amiable in the eye of an honest <hi>Cato;</hi> much more of an holy Christian, then all the vaine-glorious boisterous representations of any greatnesse or pompe. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable and remarkable to this purpose, was the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and resolution of that holy Prophet, 2. Kings 3. 14. <hi>As the Lord of hosts liueth, before whom I stand, Surely were it not that I regard the presence of Iehoshaphat the King of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, I would not looke toward thee, nor see thee.</hi> Miserable then is the vanity and vaine-glorious slauery of such as with great eagernesse and impotency hunt so ambitiously after high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances, and hold it a strange happinesse to insinuate into the bosome of the worlds Fauourites; though it be by base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, bribery, an vniuersall obsequiousnesse, and vile accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations. They, many times with vaunting intimation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to others, proudly applaud and please themselues for their accesse, countenance, and entertainement with Great men; as though it argued in them some rare extraordinary suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie and worth: when as perhaps it is their owne flattering insinuations and intrusion; their instrumentall agencie and imployment in some ill offices, lewd seruices, which brings them into such request and acceptation. But let such know,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:6825:105"/>
it is a thousand times more comfort and true credit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with Christian loue and armes of grace, into the heart and affections of a good man; then to be entertained with greatest brauery and worldly applause, into grace and fauour with the greatest gracelesse One vpon earth. For alas, when a man hath done all he can to please the humours of vngodly great Ones, by an vnconscionable satisfaction of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall desires; and to gratifie them, hath vnhappily grieued his owne conscience; hee can at last, when Gods dreadfull visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and flaming vengeance shall seize vpon him for that sinne, looke for no better reward and reply, than that cold comfort and cutting answere, which <hi>Iudas</hi> in the extremity of his anguish and horrour receiued from the High Priests and Elders, Matth. 27. 4. That cursed man came vnto them, ready, out of the rage of his vexed conscience, to teare his traiterous heart out of his body with his own bloody hands, and threw the thirty pieces of siluer amongst them, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>I haue sinned, in that I haue betrayed the innocent blood.</hi> But what recompence doe they returne for his imployment in villany, to serue their turne? Their reply is, <hi>What is that to vs? See thou to that.</hi> And such a man shall certainely in the day of distresse, bee enforced to take vp some rufull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, proportionable to <hi>Wolseyes</hi> heauy groane; <hi>Had I beene as carefull to serue the God of heauen, as my great Master on earth, He had neuer left me in my gray haires.</hi> And wee see in the meane time, fauour is deceitfull and transitory euen in priuate men; much more in great personages: The volubility of whose nature is soone glutted; and very variable for kinds of satisfaction. A thousand experiences in all Stories and times teach vs; how irregular, and many times retrograde the reuolutions of highest fauours runne. They haue their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxysmes and declinations, and euer at length their most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine expiration and euerlasting period.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, consciousnesse of hauing held an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained fruitfull correspondence and communion with Gods people; the onely <hi>excellent Ones,</hi> by all neerest and dearest engagements and Obligations of a profitable and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6825:106"/>
fellowship in the Gospell, and mutuall entercourse of godly conference, heauenly counsell, spirituall encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, consideration one of another, confirmation in grace, and well-grounded testification of meeting together in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, will incomparably more refresh the trembling heart of a dying man, than if he had been crowned all his life long, with the Imperiall glory of all earthly kingdomes. And in the meane time there is nothing in this world to be admired, but the illustrious splendour of heauenly graces, shed and shining from Gods mercifull Throne, by his sanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, into the soules of the Saints. Neither any thing so to bee desired, no such prerogatiue and Paradise in this vale of teares; as a mutuall communicating of their diuine bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the sweete ioy issuing thence, a very glimpse and earnest of euerlasting glory, to the humble hearts one of another.</p>
            <p>4. When thou visitest others, or thy selfe inuitest them; take notice euer before-hand, with as punctuall and special suruey, as thou canst possibly; of their humours, dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, carriages, opinions, and behauiours; and thereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate and prepare conuenient and seasonable matter; whereby thou maist more successefully addresse and apply thy selfe with all meekenesse of wisedome and patient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to insinuate, interpose, argue, answere, reprooue, reply, and so demeane thy selfe in thy whole discourse, that through thy default, neither the glory of God, the honour of his Truth, the reputation of Christianitie, or thine owne conscience, receiue any indignitie, disgrace, diminution or wound. Would Christians take this counsell, hold this course; they would at such times, not so often depart with spirituall discontent, and so smitten with consciousnesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, of their silence, omissions, cowardlinesse, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitablenesse in company. For want of care and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this point, countrey people meet many times in their Conuenticles of goodfellowship, at Ale-houses, Bake-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Gossippings, as they call them, &amp;c. as at a common Mart of Tale-telling, back-byting, disgracing their neighbours,

Were such meetings mingled and seasoned with gracious talke, (and all our talke ought <hi>alwayes to be with grace,</hi> Coloss. 4. 6.) with holy conferences, and helping one another towards heauen; with planting and preseruing Christian loue, and kinde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections one towards another, it were an happy thing: but while there is nothing but ribald and rotten communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sowing many times much seed of bitternesse and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning against their brethren, in the earas of one another, and a cursed sacrifice, as it were, of spitefull and slanderous tongues, offered vp vnto Satan; such miserable meetings are fitter for Pagans, then Professors of Religion; for the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story

of hell, then for the communion of Saints. Neither are higher places and great Feasts free from such froth and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent villanies of the tongue: Because there the most hold it a point of precisenesse, to make conscience of their conference, say to themselues, <hi>Our lips are our owne, who is Lord ouer vs?</hi> Psal. 12. 4. labour more to furnish themselues before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hand with complementall phrases, formes of flattery, flourishes of wit, variety of iests, and other vaine glorious ostentations of courtly ornaments, then with any one word of the Word of God, world to come, or the way to heauen. They, I say, therefore, too often vnworthily dishonour such meetings with much vnnoble deportment in their discourse. Besides other deformities and indignities, how seldome shall we finde great Tables and solemne Feasts, without that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Musicke,</hi> mentioned, Lament. 3. 63? But oh, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely vnworthy is it a man of honour and worth, to suffer with patience, any roguish Fiddler, scurrill Iester, or stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall sonne of Belial, to fall foule vpon those men, the truest Nobles vpon earth, Psal. 16. 3! Of whom, and the time is at hand, euen the proudest of them all, repenting and groning for anguish of spirit, will say, nay with hideous yellings roare out: <hi>These were they whom we had sometimes in derision, and a Prouerbe of reproch.

            </p>
            <p>For conclusion, let me aduise and forewarne with as great earnestnesse and heartinesse as I can possibly, all Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that as they tender and preferre infinitely a pure heart, an heauenly minde, that vnualuable Iewell of a peaceable conscience, and that sweetest life, walking with their God, before a world of gold; they would watch ouer themselues very extraordinarily, and with singular care and heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in the vse and enioyment of things lawfull in their owne nature; yet by our corruption, capable of inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and excesse, such as are meate, drinke, sleepe, apparell, marriage, visitations, recreations, &amp;c. For moe, saith a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Diuine, <hi>perish with preposterous following of lawfull things, then by vnlawfull courses.</hi> Soft sands swallow moe ships, then hard rockes split asunder. How soeuer, sure I am, Christians are in more danger of being spiritually vndone by a slie infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation and ensnarement of licentiousnesse and immodera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in such lawfull things; then by the grosse assault of foule sinnes, and temptations to doe notoriously. For,</p>
            <p>1. A sanctified heart will generously rise, and resist with resolution against the inuasion and grieflinesse of any worke of darkenesse; which by its enormity wastes the conscience; as adultery, murther, swearing, prophaning of the Lords Day, vsury, bribery, speculatiue wantonnesse, idlenesse, &amp;c. which it may too often be insensibly seized vpon, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by an excessiue sinfull delight, in things vnsinfull in themselues; yet empoysoned vnto vs, by the venome of our
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:6825:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
owne ouer-eager vnmortified affections. and that without any great remorse or reclamation.</p>
            <p>2. Wee finde too often by wofull experience, that some who hauing giuen their names to Religion at first, with great forwardnesse and heate; yet afterward not so much foild by grosse relapse into notorious sinnes; as surfetting with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious excesse, in the abuse of lawfull things, and drinking too deepe of worldly pleasures, vnder a colour of Christian liberty and conuenient recreations, fall fearefully into a dead sleepe of carnall security, and cursed forgetting of God, at least, for a time, vntill they be reuiued and quickned by the inquisitiue hand of some piercing Ministry, the smart of some outward heauy crosse, or wrath of God vpon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; if they fall not quite away.</p>
            <p>3. Things not sinfull in their right vse, and offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with vnsuspected representation of harmelesnesse and allowance, without extraordinary watchfulnesse and heed, doe more easily lime our earthly rauenous affections; farre sooner ensnare and deceiue; insensibly draw and drowne vs in many scandalous excesses and estrangements from God, before we be aware.</p>
            <p>Thus much also of naturall actions.</p>
            <p>IIII. Now concerning ciuill affaires, and dealings in the world: That thou mayest settle and keepe thine heart and hands in an holy temper, and vntainted; without wound, wrong-doing, or any vncomfortable entanglement:</p>
            <p>1. Euer in all their bargaines, contracts, couenants, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, negotiations, mutuall entercourse of any kinde of commerce with others, represent seriously and solemnely to the eye of thy best iudgement aud deepest confideration, that royall Principle, <hi>Doe as thou wouldest be done by.</hi> In a fellow-feeling reall conceit, put thy selfe into the place, and impartially put on the person of the party with whom thou art to deale. Weigh well all the circumstances, conditions, couenants, inconueniences, consequents, and passages of the whole businesse; and then returning to thy selfe, deale out, and proportion vnto him, that measure in euery particular,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:6825:114"/>
which thou wouldest bee willing, vpon good ground and sound reason, to receiue at the hands of another, if thou wert in his case. This is the summe of the Law and the Prophets, for seruing our brethren in loue, prest vpon vs by the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> himselfe. Mat. 7. 12. <hi>All things whatsoeuer yee would that men should doe to you, doe yee euen so to them.</hi> Which, if it were as effectually: and feelingly taken to heart, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, as it is ordinarily talked of and pretended; it would not onely cut off, and preuent all cruelties, oppressions, grinding the faces of the poore, all coozening, vndermining, ouer-reaching, defrauding, defaming, &amp;c. but also stirre vp and quicken our affections, with a compassionate liuely touch, to a mutable exercise and exchange of all offices of humanity, kindnesse, and loue in all kinds.</p>
            <p>But that you may vnderstand this rule a right; conceiue, that when wee counsell men to doe vnto others, as they would bee dealt with themselues; It is not to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, of any irregular, passionate, exorbitant will: but that which is grounded vpon right reason, guided by a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied conscience, ordered and illightened by grace and Gods Truth.</p>
            <p>And I the rather refresh your memories with the true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of this point, that you may cleerely see the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse and vanity of the Vsurers cunning cauill, but of cruell consequence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> I deale, saith the Vsurer, as I would be dealt with, and doe as I would bee done by: and therefore all that while I hope I doe no wrong: I would willingly pay tenne in the hundreth, if I had neede, and then why may I not take so?</p>
            <p>To which, I answere:</p>
            <p>1. That Royall Rule, Doe as thou wouldest be done by, must be vnderstood and expounded, as I intimated before, according to the grounds of a good conscience, dictates of right reason, and directions of a iust and rectified will; not out of the mists and miseries of a depraued and exorbitant iudgement. Otherwise, <hi>Abimelech, Saul,</hi> and other of that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:6825:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
desperate ranke and resolution, might conclude, that it were lawfull for them to kill other men, because they were willing to be killed themselues. See Iudges 9. 54. 1. Sam. 31. 4. for they might say, they did but as they would bee done by. It would also follow very absurdly; the Magistrate being in the malefactors case, would gladly be pardoned, therefore he must pardon the malefactor: Some sonne of <hi>Belial</hi> would be content villanously to prostitute his wife whom he cares not for himselfe, to others; therefore he may abuse another mans wife whom he loues better. These, and the like abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and absurd consequents, demonstrate the vanitie of the Vsurers inference, and that <hi>Christs</hi> rule is not so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but restrainable to that will, which is orderly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly guided by the light of Nature and Gods Law.</p>
            <p>2. Wee must then haue recourse to this generall Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the second Table, and fetch light and direction thence; when wee haue no expresse and speciall word in Gods Booke; but the Scriptures haue cleerely and directly determined and resolued the point of Vsury.</p>
            <p>3. If the Vsurer were in the borrowers case, hee would not willingly, as hee pretends, giue tenne in the hundred. I meane, with an absolute and free will, but of force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, because without paying after that rate, he could not haue it. If a man would borrow vpon Vsury, to buy land, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse, forestall, or compasse some vnlawfull matter; that were a corrupt will, and no rule: But if his desire so to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row were iust and lawfull, as in some cases it may bee, then it is no entire will, but mixed and forced by some necessitie, for the auoyding of a greater euill; and therefore denied in the eye both of law and reason, to bee any will at all. He that would borrow, should haue need to borrow, for a needlesse desire is vnlawfull; and an ingenuous man who hath need to borrow, would not willingly borrow but for need, much lesse would hee pay Vsurie. Therefore the will of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, in this case, is either corrupt, or no will at all, and so consequently without the compasse of <hi>Christs</hi> rule.</p>
            <p>The will of the borrower in this case, is like the will of an
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6825:115"/>
honest Trauailer, in giuing his purse to an arrant thiefe; for feare hee should loose both purse and life. Is such a man willing, thinke you, to loose his mony? Or like the will of a man, whose house beeing on fire, plucks downe part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to saue the rest; willingly indeede as the case stands with him, yet not simply, but vpon necessity. So the borrowers will is not free, but forced; and so a will against will.</p>
            <p>2. With an infinite disdaine, and resolute contempt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre to get so much as one farthing all the daies of thy life, by any wicked meanes or wrong doing. Doe not plague thy present outward state, bee it little or much; neither em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poison it to thy posterity, by any addition vnto it; by vsury, bribery, symony, sacriledge, stealing, grinding the faces of the poore, oppression, lying, falsehoods, forswearings, ouer-reaching trickes of wit, coozening, cunning conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. Thereby thou shalt desperately fall into the reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hands of an angry God: diuine vengeance will dog thee hard, and continually at the heeles for thy destruction. Which is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably a greater plague then extremest beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and the bitterest confluence of all the most vexing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miseries in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let no man,</hi> faith <hi>Paul, goe beyond and defraud his brother in any matter, because that the Lord is the auenger of all such.</hi> 1. Thes. 46.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, A little ill got, naturally accompanied with Gods curse, may so empoyson thy whole inheritance and all the rest of thy goods, that it may prooue like a dead Fly in a boxe of precious ointment; a sparke of fire in the thatch; a strong incentiue to diuine iustice, not onely to eate vp all honest comfort in outward things, but also to consume and waste all thy wealth: Nay, and sith immoderate desire of enriching and raising his <note n="a" place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

world without stocke or seede. And therefore though the couetous caytife out of the hardnesse of his heart, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednesse of conscience, bee fearelesse and senselesse of the wrath of God, the wrong of his neighbour, and the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse of his owne soule; yet if he desire, as hee doth, with a raging vnsatiablenesse, like the graue, or hell, to thriue in his outward state, and prosper in the world; let him not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle so much as with a sticke, or a straw, a pin, or a point of another mans; neither at any time put his hand to any wicked way of getting, lest, beside the losse of his soule at last, and a world of miseries in the meane time, hee misse the very marke so eagerly aimed at; of making him and his great in the world. For hope of which hee is cursedly content to part with all true contentment in this life, and a Crowne of blisse in the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>For this purpose, and to perswade, and presse this point vnanswerably, let vs take a view in Gods Booke of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers waies, how he is wont in wrath to deale with wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers and vnconscionable dealers.</p>
            <p>It comes to passe, sometimes that the wicked worldling, insatiable earth-worme, God cursing his couetousnesse and cruelty, may see an end of his wealth euen in this world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, Ier. 17. 11. <hi>As the Partridge sitteth on egges, and hatcheth them not: so hee that gettethriches, and not by right, shall leaue them in the middest of his dayes, and at his end shall be a foole.</hi> Iob 20. 15, 28. <hi>Hee hath swallowed downe riches, and he shall vomit them vp againe: God shall cast them out of his belly. The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or it is no strange thing to see him prosper by vnconsei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onablenesse and craft, vsurious and other iniurious practises, all his life long; but then hauing scraped together his hoard of iniquity, with a great deale of carking, thoughtfulnesse, and selfe vexation; kept it with extreme feare, slauish di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust, and heart-gnawing iealousies; parted <note n="b" place="margin">Temporalium amor quantùm afficit, quum hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret possessio; tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm, quum sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahitur, vri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But howsoeuer, whether ill gotten goods perish or pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the owners hands, or his posteritie: sure I am, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable plague and iust vengeance of God cleaues insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably vnto his soule; and hunts that man to destruction, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he be, that enricheth himselfe by wicked and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, without timely repentance and true restitution, if he be able.</p>

            <p>And maruaile not, neither be mis-led, though thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue sometimes wicked worldlings themselues, their heires, and heires heires, to wallow also in that wealth which the Grandfathers got wrongfully.

and haue this wofull brand set vpon them by the Spirit of God, Psal. 17. 14. <hi>They are men of the world, and haue their portion in this life.</hi> But euer hold this as a terrible and true principle.

            <p>3. Thirdly, it is a ruled case and concurrent resolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Diuines: That if thou doest not restore, being able, whatsoeuer thou hast any waies got wrongfully, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly; thou canst haue neither well grounded assurance of vnfained <note n="*" place="margin">Without restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God accepts not your confession, nor yet your repentance. <hi>Hom. of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
               </note> repentance, nor true comfort of the pardon of that sinne.

            <p>How can he be said to repent soundly, that lies still soa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in his sinne, wittingly, and willingly? Now, whosoeuer keepes still in his hands any thing wickedly got, continues a wrong doer still; and therefore doth it not faithfully, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faineth repentance. Whereupon saith <hi>Austin,</hi> If a man<note place="margin">Si res aliena prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quam pec a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est, cùm reddi possit, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> redditur, non agitur poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, sed fingitun. <hi>Epist. 54 pag.</hi> 280.

               </note> restore not ill gotten goods being able, his repentance is not comfortable, but counterfeite.</p>
            <p>Dreadfull also is the doome of the said Father vpon all wrong-doers, <hi>The sinne is not remitted, except that which hath been vniustly taken be restored:</hi> Either in act, if thou be able; or at least in vnfained affection, if thy state be wasted.</p>
            <p>What a bedlam folly is it then, and cursed cruelty to thine<note place="margin">Effectu, <hi>or</hi> affectu.</note> owne soule; to heape vp those riches of iniquity, by base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and wrong, which thou must afterward restore in the sense I haue said, or else neuer enioy any comfortable assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a true conuersion or pardon of sinne? Were he not a foolish thiefe, that would keep his stollen goods both in the face of his accuser and Iudge? Though in the meane time thou conceale thy cunning conueiances from the discouery and doome of humane iustice; yet assure thy selfe, besides the secret grumbling of thy selfe-accusing conscience; the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:6825:117"/>
angry eye of God also sees cleerely, and will shortly most certainely reuenge.</p>
            <p>4. Almesdeeds, charitable erections of Colledges, Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalls, Free-Schooles, and other inferiour bountifull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions; when God inables by good meanes; the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of his Poore cry for reliefe, and the sanctified heart with affectionate sincerity, aimes at Gods glory; are sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smelling sacrifices with which God is well pleased, Philip. 4. 18. Heb. 13. 16. But if his slauish gifts, and good deedes, largesses, and liberalities in this kinde, be impoysoned with former fraud, oppression, and wrong; though it bee well that the Church of God sometimes, the backes and bellies of the poore bee better thereby; yet to the impenitent and not restoring vsurer himselfe, or any other wicked dealer, in respect of acceptation with God, and true comfort to his owne heart, they are no better then the cutting off of a Dogges necke, or the sacrifice of a foole. Ill gotten goods are for restitution, not for distribution.

Nay, it may be said in the sweetenesse of his mercy also, when he sees vs distracted, and as it were, desperately mad with making too much of any transitorie thing, so that our mind doth still runne and rest vpon it, as our onely heauen vpon earth; He snatches the edge toole out of our hands, lest we make away our selues spiritually; and withdrawes the beloued vanitie from before our eyes, lest we grow starke blind in the mysteries of Faith, and matters of Heauen, by too much gazing vpon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding beauty of any baser earthly obiect.</p>
            <p>Thus the immoderate partiall affection of Parents, may become many times occasionall and accessary to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely taking away of a sweete, faire and towardly child.

If thou dotest vpon a good wit, thou mayest be stricken with distraction: if vpon abundance of learning, or much worldly wisedome, thou mayest be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated, at least at some speciall times, when thou wouldest gladly doe the best; or in some important businesse, which most concernes thee: if vpon some highplace, thou mayst with <hi>Haman, Shebna,</hi> and thousands moe, be throwne down into the gulph of calamitie and woe, contempt and scorne: if vpon a faire house, it may be leuelled with the ground, by the flames of Gods wrath: if vpon a beautifull face, it may bee disfigured with the Poxe, or other deformities: if vpon a hoard of gold, it may be disperst by fire, robbery, desolations of warre: nay, if euen vpon thy graces with an ouerweening conceit of selfe-excellency, selfe-opinion, selfe-sufficiency; if they be onely generall graces, thou mayst bee quite stript of them; if sauing, thou mayst bee cast into a dampe and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a time, in respect of all comfort, sense, vse and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>he list. Now this very day, this same fellow, thus long suffered in his dissolute and riotous courses, hath in his drunken humour wickedly offered violence to his mother great with child, would haue violated his sister, hath killed his father, and wounded two of his sisters to death. O mightie domination of the Deuill! &amp;c.</hi> But I need not prosecute this point by further illustration out of strange Stories. Daily experience presents vnto our eyes and eares, the many wofull discomforts, vnkind requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales, and vnnaturall vsages, which Parents receiue at the hands of those children, which in their younger yeeres they made wanton with their loue, and vndiscreetly doted vpon. 2. Or in some other kind; for example: If thine heart be set vpon riches, God may iustly, and mercifully too, exercise, and afflict thee with his heauy hand; vpon thy body, with sicknesse; vpon thy conscience, with terror; vpon thy reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with disgrace, or the like, thereby to vnglue thy noble spirit from the dust, and rent it from grouelingnesse vpon the earth. If thou be ambitiously enamoured vpon honours and high roomes; after wasting thy wealth, wounding thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, wearying thy selfe with bribery, basenesse, and irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some waiting, thou mayest bee taken away vntimely in the very pursuite, or presently after the attainement of them, &amp;c. Thus it is not strange or extraordinary with God, to preuent, or take off our hearts from taking selfe-conceited pleasure or pride in any thing we enioy, by crossing and correcting vs in other kindes. Euen <hi>Paul,</hi> that blessed Saint and seruant of the Lord, lest his heart should be too much pleased, and puft vp with abundance of reuelations; he was vext and crost with his owne concupiscence, there was giuen to him <hi>a thorne in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him,</hi> 2. Cor. 12. 7. that is, as I conceiue, hee felt his originall corruption sharpened, and eneagered against him, and let loose in some sort vpon him: which is a terrible cut to a tender conscience.</p>
            <p>3. For the third, howsoeuer it fare with thee otherwise; if thou settle thine heart vpon any earthly thing with inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate desire and delight, thou shalt be sure to be haunted with a double curse: 1. The rage of vnsatiablenesse, vnsatisfiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6825:120"/>
2. That greatest plague, hardnesse of heart.</p>
            <p>1. The Father of Spirits hath inspired into our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall soules a large capacity, and such an infinite appetite, that no finite excellency, created comfort, or earthly thing can possibly fill. Gold, siluer, riches, honours, crownes, kingdomes, are no fit matter or adequate obiect, for such an immateriall and heauenly borne spirit, to repose and feed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with finall rest and full contentment. Nay, not this whole materiall world, were it beautified and set out with all the amiablenesse, splendour, and allurements, which the deuill by his iugling Alchymy put vpon it, when he presented it to the eye of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> Math. 4. 8. with addition of the star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Empyrean heauen, shining with all their admirable beauty and glorious inhabitants, could by any meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, satisfie, and content the irke some wandrings, vnlimited desire, and vast comprehensiuenesse of the soule: but it would still bee <note n="a" place="margin">Cor humanum in desiderio aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis non fixum, nunquam stabile potest esse, sed omni volubilitate volubilius, de alio in aliud transit, quaerens requiem, vbi non est.

O bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse depth, and dearest confluence of all ioyes, pleasures,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:6825:121"/>
sweetnesses, delights, vnconceiueable, vnutterable, infinite! This is the supreme end of our Creation and Redemption; the very flower, quintessence, and sinew, as it were, of our So ueraigne good. By this act of blessednesse, we are filled with all the fulnesse of God: He becomes vnto vs <hi>All in all;</hi> so that thereby we liue his very life, in purity, eternity, since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest pleasures, highest perfection; though not to the height of his infinitenesse; for wee are but creatures; yet in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our capacitie, and vtmost possibility, which is a feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie aboue measure, and past imagination. In these two acts thus exercised about an infinite Obiect, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, doth Blessednesse, essentially and formally consist: but principally in the fruition of God, by a full, immediate, and compleate communion with him, and most blessed partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of all his glory and All-sufficiency. And therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> and all his followers come short, in placing our highest blisse, onely in the act of the vnderstanding, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God. I am woont to expresse and illustrate it thus: though there be an infinite distance and disproportion in the things compared: It would mightily delight a man, really and in person, with ease and safetie to passe ouer and view the circuite of the whole earth, and all the wonders of the world; all the great cities, renowned men, magnificent courts, rich mines, spicie Ilands, Chrystall mountaines, coasts of Pearles, rockes of Diamond, &amp;c. of which Geographers write, and Trauailers talke: but if besides, as he passed along, he should haue sure and euerlasting possession giuen of them all, what an immeasurable materiall addition would it make vnto his speculatiue delight? And with what strange amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and admiration of his making for euer, and maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous happines, would it rauish his heart? Euen so proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, but aboue all degrees of comparison; though a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Ocean of endlesse sweetnes, and inexplicable ioy arise in the soule from the sight of God; yet this blissefull commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whereby we possesse and enioy him, in a neere, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vnspeakable maner; &amp; partake with him in all his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, perfections, and felicities, doth crowne, as it were, our
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:6825:121"/>
Crowne of glory, and actuate that heart-rauishing contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, with the very life of euerlasting life, and soule of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioyes and highest blisse. Thus, and in this manner doe the restlesse wanderings and infinite appetite of these aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sparkes of heauen, our immateriall and immortall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, come to finall rest and euerlasting repose: When at last they shall graspe in the armes of their desire, that chiefest Good, the most glorious Deitie, and bathe themselues free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully in that euer-during Welspring of Immortality and Life. But now set aside the fruition of this Obiect, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite both in excellency and endlesnesse, the onely aime and end of the soules endlesse aspirations: And though thou shouldest crowne a man compleately with the worth of this whole world, the admirable splendour of the Empyrean heauen, the beauty of a shining Sunne-like body, the rich and royall endowments inherent in a glorified soule, the sweetest company of Saints and Angels, the comfort of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yet his soule would still be full of emptinesse and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and vtterly to seeke for the surest Sanctuary, and supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest solace to settle her vnsatisfied longings vpon. Onely once admit it to the face of God, by Beatificall Vision, and to fruition of the most glorious and euer-blessed Trinity, by immediate communion, and so consequently to those Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of pleasures, and fulnesse of ioy flowing thence; and then presently, and neuer before, its infinite desire expires in the bosome of God, and it lyes, as it were, downe softly, with sweetest peace and full contentment, in the imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of euerlasting blisse. The other innumerable inestim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ioyes in heauen, are, I deny not, transcendent, and raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing: but they are but all accessories to this Principall, drops to this Ocean, glimpses to this Sunne. Well then, if this bee the onely way to the soules eternall welfare; then those vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy soules, which runne a contrary course, and seeke for satisfaction in any creature, or created comfort, stand deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly still vpon the racke of restlesse discontentment, and are iustly cursed with the gnawing rage of vnsatiablenesse: and must needs be so. For besides, 1. That the furious torrent

of our sensuall corruption, being once on foote after world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasures, and swelling by a continuall infusion of hellish poyson, doth with an impetuous headstrongnesse, beare and breake downe all bonds and bankes of moderation and stint, and will neuer be restrained from its vnsatiable rage, if God helpe not, vntil it be swallowed vp in the bottomlesse gulfe of misery and horrour: for it is the natiue property, or rather, poyson of inordinate affection, not onely to drinke deepe of sinfull delights, but to carouse, to be drunke; nay, to adde vnquenchable thirst vnto drunkennesse, sucking them in with fresh supply of endlesse greedinesse, as the Horse-leach corrupt blood, till it burst againe. 2. That the infinite desire of the soule confined to a creature, or any worldly comfort, is payned and pinched, as a foote wedged in a straight shooe; it being no competent or proportionable satisfaction to its expectation and large capacitie.

            <p>By the way, let me tell you, that this immoderate desire, inordinate delight which I speake of, glued to some speciall sensuall obiect, which naturall corruption singles out, and makes chiefest choice of, to follow and feed vpon, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test contentment and carnall sweetnesse, become the parents of euery mans bosome sinne.</p>
            <p>If it fall in loue with honours and greatnesse, it breeds and brings forth ambition, which is an vnquenchable thirst after visible glory, and a gluttonous hunting after high roomes. As it inhabiteth the highest and haughtiest spirits, and is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatiue and transcendent in its obiect and aspirations; so of all the stormy perturbations, which rent and rage in the heart of man, it is most tempestuous and desperate. Ventrous it is to climbe vp any staires of basenesse, bribery, blood; to tread vpon the ruines of the noblest innocency, vpon the mercilesse desolations of dearest friends and neerest kindred, to domineere for a while, though it be damned euerlastingly

It is victorious ouer all other affections, and masters euen the sensuality of lustfull pleasures; as appeares in the greatest Warriours and ancient Worthies amongst the Heathen, who tempted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitenesse and variety of choisest beauties, yet forbore that villany, not for conscience sake, and feare of God whom they knew not; but lest they should interrupt the course, and stop the current of their warlike reputation, ambitious designes, and atchiuements of state. But whatsoeuer other pestilent properties empoyson it, it neuer failes to ingender in the heart, which harbours it, as its proper Thunder-bolt, and blasting, feares, cares, iealousies, enuies, enraged thirst of rising still, impatiencie of competition, vncapablenesse of satiety, which is most for my purpose. For the proud and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious man <hi>enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee satisfied.</hi> Hab. 2. 5. Who can fill the bottomlesse pit of hell, or stop the vnsatiable iawes of death? neither can the greedie humour of an haughtie spirit, the aspiring inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of a boisterous <hi>Nimrod</hi> be possibly stayed or stinted; no not with the top and variety of highest honours, though hee should alone and absolutely be crowned with the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignitie of the whole earth, and command the felicities of this wide world.</p>
            <p>If it fall in loue with riches, it breeds and brings forth coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, the vilest, and basest of all the infections of the soule, in the most contemptible, and dunghill disposition. For this kyte-footed corruption wheresoeuer it seizeth, and domineeres, blasts, and banisheth all noblenesse of spirit, naturall affection, humanity, discretion, reason, wisedome, manlinesse, mutuall entertainements, entercourse of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and loue; and turnes all, euen the soule it selfe, into earth and mudde. It drawes by a cunning reserued basenesse, all occasions, circumstances, aduantages, witte, policy,

euen friends, and acquaintance; nay religion, conscience, and all to bee seruiceable, and contributary to a greedy wolfe, and raging gangren of hoarding vp Gold, and worldly pelfe. In a word, it makes a man with a Bedlam cruelty to contemne himselfe, body and soule, for a little transitory trash; wilfully to abandon both the comfortable enioyment of the short time of this present mortality, and all hope of the length of that blessed eternity to come. And as the obiect of it is most earthly, base, and incompetent, so of all other vile affections, it is most sottishly, and senselesly vnsatisfiable. For how is it possible that earth should feed or fill the immateriall, and heauen-borne spirit of a man? It can not be, and the Spirit of God hath said, it shall not be. Eccles. 5. 10. &amp; 4. 8. <hi>He that loueth siluer, shall not be satisfied with siluer. The eye is not satisfied with riches.</hi> Hence it is, that the deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and more eagerly the dropsie heart of the couetous man doth drinke of this golden streame, the more furiously still it is inflamed with vnsatiable thirst: nay certaine it is, that if he should purchase, and possesse a Monopoly of all the wealth in the world; were he able to empty the Westerne parts of Gold, and the East of all her Spices, and precious things; should hee enclose the whole face of the earth from one end of heauen to another, and heape vp his hoard to the starres; yet his heart would be as hungry after more riches, as if he had neuer a penny, and much more.</p>
            <p>If it fall in loue with beauty, and the swaggering brauery of good fellowship, it begets lust, and sensuality; which make their minions madde with bitternesse and malice, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the very least glimpse of holinesse, or any religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint; enrage them with mutuall fury, to engulfe themselues into the bottomelesse whirlepoole of sensuall pleasures, and so empoyson their hearts with a furious vnquenchable thirst after them, that they will neuer leaue their hold, and haunt, vntill they either bee broken with the hammer of the Word, or burst with the horror of despaire.

For proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their impatiency of being crost in their course of pleasures, is their rage in persecuting the godly. And therefore being resolute to liue and dye good fellowes, they also resolue from the same ground, to hold an euerlasting vnreconcileable opposition to the <hi>way which is called holy,</hi>

Let the world say what it will, to a mind truly generous, &amp; ennobled with grace, the absolutest concurrence, and quintessentiall exquisitenesse of beauty, gold, birth, wit, or what else besides may be found most remarkable and matchlesse in that sexe, should be nothing, nor hold scale with the lightest feather vpon any Ladies head, in respect of a gracious disposition &amp; godly heart. Religion and the feare of God, as it is generally the foundation of all humane felicitie; so must it in speciall be accounted the ground of al comfort and blisse, which man and wife desire to find in the enioying each of other. There was neuer any gold, or great friends; any beautie, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward brauery, which tied truly fast and comfortably any marriage knot. It is onely the golden linke, and noble tye of Christianitie and Grace, which hath the power and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to make so deare a bond louely, &amp; euerlasting; which can season and strengthen that neerest inseparable societie with true sweetnesse and immortalitie.</p>
            <p>2. Let coniugall loue warme thine heart, at least in some measure with affectionate contentment, and some more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall repose vpon the partie, as one with whom thou canst heartily and comfortably consort: for the husband, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents, and ordinary possibilities considered, ought to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his affections vpon his wife, as the fittest that the world could haue afforded him: and the wife should rest her heart vpon her husband, as the meetest for her, that could haue been found vnder the Sunne. By a constant entercourse of which mutuall contentment in each other, the husband will
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:6825:127"/>
be to the wife as <hi>a couering of her eyes,</hi> that she lift them not<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 16.</note> vp amorously vpon any man: and the wife to the husband, <hi>the pleasure of his eyes,</hi> that he may still looke vpon her with<note place="margin">Ezek. 24. 16.</note> sober and singular delight.

And methinks, that wife, child, or what other good thing is procured at Gods mercifull hand by prayer,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:6825:128"/>
should bring with it, euen in our sence and thankefull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, a thousand times more sweetnesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, then that which is cast vpon vs by Gods ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, without any suite at all, vnto his heauenly High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>4. Let the parties deale plainely and faithfully one with the other, in respect of their bodies, soules, and outward state. I meane it thus; That they should not deceiue and coozen one the other by a craftie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealement: of some foule disease, speciall deformity, naturall defect, &amp;c. in body; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, which they thinke in their consciences, and impartiall consideration, if it were their case, would breed intolerable distaste and discontentment: or of some secret maime and cracke in their outward state, which neither the other partie, or friends, do either expect, or suspect: For so they may bring a great deale of after-misery, and too late repentance vpon the match. For naturally we hate them which beguile vs. And a man or woman is most impatient of failing, and being disappointed of their hopes and expectations, in so great and waighty affaire as Marriage is. And therefore it were very conuenient, and much better to disclose the one vnto the other, the materiall infirmities and wants in either of their bodies or goods, though with hazzard of missing the match; rather then the one to obtaine the other, with guile, cunning, and after-discomfort. I said also, in respect of their soules; by which I meane; that for the time of Wooing onely, as they call it, they should not put on a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, flourish, and shew of Religion, conuersion, and grace; when in deed and truth, there is no such matter. For this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable imposture also, is sometimes villanously practised, to the infinite preiudice, and perpetuall hearts-griefe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded partie. And not onely some parties are cunning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, and faultie this way; but euen Christian friends are too often too forward, peremptory, and audacious, in giuing testimonies and assurances in such cases. Now this is the greatest guile, and most cursed coozenage of all; when one conceiues, by the present cunning carriage of the partie, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:6825:128"/>
partiall information of friends, that he or she hath met with a soule beautified with grace; whereas when it comes to the tryall, hath iust none acquaintance with God at all.</p>
            <p>Now I come vnto the second Point; A religious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable continuance in the Marriage-state. For the happy attainement whereof; let vs take notice of, and to heart; first, some common Duties, which are mutually to be performed on both sides.</p>
            <p>I. Louingnesse. Which is a drawing into action, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in exercise that habit of coniugall affection, Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall loue mentioned before. It is a sweet, louing, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhearted powring out of their hearts, with much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate dearenesse, into each others bosomes; in all passages, carriages, and behauiours, one towards another. This mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall melting-heartednesse, being preserued fresh and fruitfull, will infinitely sweeten and beautifie the Marriage state.</p>
            <p>For an vninterrupted preseruation of this amiable deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on both sides; let them consider,</p>
            <p>1. The wise hand of Gods gracious prouidence guided all the businesse, and brought it to passe. And he commands constancie in this louing &amp; lightsome carriage. Pro. 5. 18, 19. <hi>Reioyce with the wife of thy youth. Let her be as the louing Hind, and pleasant Roe, let her brests satisfie thee at all times, &amp; be thou rauished alwayes with her loue.</hi> See also Eph. 5. 25. Methinkes this charge from the holy Ghost, being often reuerently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, should euer beate backe and banish from both their hearts, all heart-rising and bitternesse; distaste, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection; all wicked wishes, that they had neuer met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they had neuer seene one anothers faces, &amp;c. When the knot is once tied, euery man should thinke his wife, and euery wife her husband, the fittest for him of any in the world. Otherwise, so often as he sees a better, he will wish that his choise were to make againe; &amp; so fall off from respect to this Commandement, and from kindnesse and loue to his owne. Which is an inexpiable disparagement to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and an execrable empoysoner of Marriage comforts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:6825:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. That by the power of the honourable Ordinance of Marriage, the two are made one. And therefore they ought to be as louingly and tenderly affected one vnto the other, as they would be to their owne flesh.</p>
            <p>3. The compassionate and melting compellations, which Christ and his Spouse exchange in the <hi>Canticles: My faire one, my sister, my loue, my Doue, my vndefiled, my welbeloued, the chiefe of ten thousand, &amp;c.</hi> whose chaste and feruent loue, that of married couples should resemble and imitate.</p>
            <p>4. That these mutuall expressions, and exercise of this matrimoniall loue, are very powerfull to preserue chastity and purenesse in body and spirit on both sides. It is noted of <hi>Isaac,</hi> that he loued <hi>Rebekah</hi> dearely; and this was a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall preseruatiue, that hee fell not to Polygamy or concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, as many of the Patriarkes did.</p>
            <p>II. Faithfulnesse. 1. In respect of the Marriage-Bed; which they ought on both sides to keepe inuiolable, vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and honourable. Wherein, if they transgresse, besides an whole hell of spirituall miseries, they strike at the very sinew, heart, and life of the Marriage Knot; and become liable (if the Magistrate should doe, as God commanded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his people) to the bloody stroke of a violent death. And therefore it behooues all that enter this state, to bee humbled, and repent for all former wantonnesse; or else, a thousand to one, it will breake out, either into a sensuall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate abuse of the Marriage; which the Fathers call, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with a mans owne wife; or else into a lustfull hanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after the <hi>strange woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In respect of domesticall affaires, and businesses of the family. The care and burthen whereof is common to them both. The Husband that hath a prodigall and slothfull wife, doth but draw water with a Siue, as the Heathen man said, and casts his labours into a bottomlesse sacke. And the wife that is ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>cht with an idle vnthristy Husband, drawes a Cart heauy laden through a sandy way, without a Horse. By which is intimated an impossibility of thriuing in the world, and prospering in their outward state.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:6825:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. In the concealement of each others secrets. It is a very vnnaturall and monstrous treachery, to publish one anothers faults and frailties, or any thing, which in hope of keeping counsell, they haue communicated one to another. They are ill birds, as they say, that defile their owne-nests; and franticke Bedlams that so throw dirt in each others faces.</p>
            <p>III. Patience. Which is as precious and needfull an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dutie, as I can possibly commend in this case, for comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conuersing together.</p>
            <p>For a more prepared and constant exercise whereof; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
            <p>1. That two Angels are not met together in a Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall state, but a sonne and daughter of <hi>Adam:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must looke for infirmities, frailties, imperfections, passions, and prouocations, on both sides.</p>
            <p>2. That it is a charge giuen to all; <hi>That the Sunne must not goe downe vpon their wrath:</hi> much more to Man and Wife lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together in the neerest bond.</p>
            <p>3. That there neuer did, nor euer will come any good, by the falling out of Man and Wife. Well may they thereby become ridiculous to their seruants, a by-word to their neighbours, Table-talke to the Countrey, troublers of their owne house, and as a continuall dropping one vnto another: but they shall neuer gaine by their mutuall hastinesse, passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and impatiencie. What good can come by a mans an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and indignation against his owne flesh? What prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous madnesse is it for them to grow strange, whom so many and perpetuall bands haue tyed so fast; and who without dearest and most intimate familiarity, can neither enioy ciuill contentment or peace of conscience? Suppose that the heart should fall out with the head, and deny vnto it, those spirits which become animall in the braine, and serue for exercise both of sence, and by consequent of the higher part of the soule; What would follow, but distemper, distraction, and madnes? Or that the head should fall out with the body; and thereupon restraine from it the influence of animall spirits, the instruments of the quickning and moouing it; What
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:6825:130"/>
would become of the head, when the body were dead? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable mischiefes and miseries fall out vpon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-state, by falling out, strangenesse, bitternesse, and angry reseruednesse betweene the parties.</p>
            <p>This grace then will be of excellent vse, and must be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised many wayes:</p>
            <p>1. In bearing with the wants and weakenesses, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and deformities of each other. And let the man, (for the woman is the weaker vessell) remember for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; how many faults, frailties, and falls; and how many times Christ remits and pardons to his Spouse the Church. And hee ought to loue his wife, as Christ doth the Church, Eph. 5. 25. The body doth not reiect the head, because it is bald, or but one eyed: The head rageth not against the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, because it is deformed or diseased, but doth rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole and sympathize.</p>
            <p>2. About crosse accidents in the family, losses in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state; going backward of businesses, &amp;c. They must not lay the fault one vpon another, to the breaking out into choler, impatiencie, and stamping; but both ioyne with blessed <hi>Iob,</hi> in that sweet and meeke submission to Gods pleasure: <hi>The Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken away:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In waiting for the conuersion of one another; if either prooue vnconuerted. In which case, be patient, pray, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Gods good time. We haue God himselfe a sweet Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for this purpose. See before, pag. 102. Or if the one be but a Babe in Christ, weake in Christianity; deale fairely, louingly, and meekely. Let our Lord Iesus his tender-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse to spirituall younglings, teach vs mercy this way. See Isa. 40. 11.</p>
            <p>IV. An holy care and conscience to preserue between themselues, (for there is a coniugall, as well as virginall and viduall chastity) the marriage bed vndefiled, and in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> and Christian purity. It ought by no meanes to be stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and dishonoured with sensuall excesses, wonton spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, foolish dalliance, and other vncleane incentiues of lust,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:6825:130"/>
which marriage should quench, not inflame. Euen in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, intemperate and vnbridled lust; immoderation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, is deemed both by ancient and moderne Diuines, no better then plaine adultery before God.</p>

            <p>I. To the Husband:</p>
            <p>1. Let him behaue himselfe as an head to the body, 1. Cor. 11. 3. Eph. 5. 23.</p>
            <p>1. The head is, as it were, the <note n="a" place="margin">Non immeritò capiti quasi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultori suo caetera membia famulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; &amp; circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt illud setuli gestamine sicut numen; atque in sublime locatum v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>hunt. <hi>Ambr. Hexam. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> glory and crowne of the body: So let the husband shine, and shew himselfe in a kind of eminencie, excellencie, and authority ouer the wife. To be an head, implies and imports a preeminence, superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and soueraignty, as appeares by the Apostles gradation, 1. Cor. 11. 3. Man is the womans head, Christ is mans head, God is Christs head. For procuring and preseruing which; Let the husband bee manly, graue, worthy; not light, vaine, contemptible: Let him not be bitter, wayward, passionate: Let him not bee base-minded, vicious, vaine glorious: Let him not bee a drunkard, a gamester, a good-fellow. Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutenesse, and a disordered life in the Man, doth much abate and diminish the wiues respectfulnesse and reuerence vnto him. Maiestie, authority, venerablenesse in any Superiour, is not any wayes more lessened or sooner lost, then by light behauiour, personall worthlesnesse, or vnworthy deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his place. Whereas true worth, goodnesse, grace, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from within, doth beget a more louing reuerence, and reuerent loue, then all outward formes of pompe and state; then any boysterousnesse, or big looks can possibly produce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:6825:131"/>2. The Head is the seate of vnderstanding, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, discretion, forecast. Out of which consideration; Let the husband stirre vp, quicken, and inlarge his manly spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to comprehend, and rightly conceiue all affaires, prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, occasions, offers, ingenuous deportment, and worthy vsages, which may any wayes procure and promote his wiues true contentment, honour, and happinesse. It is his necessary and noble charge, with a speciall and punctuall care, and casting about to prouide for her soule, body, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and credit; with all meekenesse and loue, to instruct and informe her in all passages of her duty, and procurements of her good.</p>
            <p>3. The Head indeed hath the precedency and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of noblest operations, and the soules diuinest acts, by the benefit of its natiue temper and constitution, seate of the sences, and other proper instruments fitted for such high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and challenge of that excellency; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the body, and other parts are animated and enlyued with the very same soule, both for substance, faculties, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, actiuenesse, euery way: So that if the foot, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, had an eare, an eye, an animall spirit, and an organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, as the Philosophers speake, apted for such functions, it would heare, and see, and vnderstand as well as the head. And therefore the head, by a naturall instinct, as it were, and sympathie, doth continually &amp; tenderly, with fresh successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a liuely and quickning influence, cherish, and refresh other parts as well as it selfe. The husband, by the benefit of a more manly body, tempered with naturall fitnesse for the soule to worke more nobly in; doth, or ought ordinarily outgoe the wife in largenesse of vnderstanding, height of courage, stayednesse of resolution, moderation of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dexterity to manage businesses, and other naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and abilities to doe more excellently; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, let him know that his wife hath as noble a soule as himselfe. <hi>Soules haue no sexes,</hi> as <note n="a" place="margin">Anima enim sex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> non habet. Sed ideo fortasse foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineum nomen accipit, quòd eam violentior aestus carnis angit. <hi>De virg. l.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith. In the better part they are both men. And if thy wiues soule were freed from the frailty of her sexe, it were as manly, as noble,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:6825:132"/>
as vnderstanding, and euery way as excellent as thine owne: Nay, and if it were possible for you to change bodies; hers would worke as manlily in thine, and thine as womanly in hers. Let the husband then bee so farre from insulting ouer, contemning, or vnderualuing his wiues worth, for the weakenesse of her sexe; that out of consideration that her soule is naturally euery way as good as his owne; onely the excellencie of its natiue operations, something damped, as it were, and disabled by the frailty of that weaker body, with which Gods wise prouidence hath clothed it vpon purpose, for a more conuenient and comfortable, but ingenuous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceablenes to his good; that, I say, he labour the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine and intreat her with all tendernesse and honour, to recompence, as it were, her suffering in this kinde for his sake.</p>
            <p>4. The Head is the well-spring of all quickning motion and sence, liuelinesse and lightsomenesse to the body. If the deriuation of animall spirits from the braine, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and intercepted for a while; the body would bee presently surprized with a sencelesse dampe and dead palsey. The wife for the husbands sake, hath forsaken her natiue home, fathers house, father, mother, and many comforts in that kind: And therefore good reason shee should expect now, and receiue from her Head; new matter, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued influence of lightheartednesse, comfortable enioying her selfe, and cheerefull walking. If hee to whose company and conditions shee is now so neerely and necessarily confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and, as it were, enchained, proue dogged, shee holds her selfe vtterly vndone for any outward contentment.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Let him dwell with her, according to knowledge.</hi> 1. Pet. 3. 7.</p>
            <p>1. By a wise discouery at the first, and timely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting himselfe with her disposition, affections, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, passions, imperfections; and thereupon with all holy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, apply and addresse himselfe in a faire and louing manner, to rectifie and reforme all hee can; and to beare the rest with patience, passing by it without passion and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:6825:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
still waiting vpon God by Prayer, in his good time, for a further and more full redresse and conformity. One of the rankest rootes of distastes and discontentment in the Marriage-state, is the neglect of a punctuall obseruation of each others properties; of taking the right measure of each others manners, vpon purpose, that with mutuall patience and forbearance, they may support each other in loue, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly beare one anothers burthens. Memorable is that speech, and may bee a fit medicine against marriage-iarres; which a reuerend man receiued from an husband, being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked how such a cholericke couple could so consort toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Thus,</hi> saith he, <hi>when her fit is vpon her, I yeeld to her, as Abraham did to Sara; and when my fit is vpon me, she yeelds to me: and so we neuer striue together, but asunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By a prouident, discreet, and patient ordering, guiding, and managing businesses abroad, and family af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; without that carking, impatiencie, preuention, and distrust of Gods prouidence; without that clamour, boyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse, and confusion, with which worldlings are woont to trouble their owne houses. It is incredible to consider the vast and vnualuable difference between the comforts, calme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and many sweet contentments of an houshold, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the patient wisedome of an heauenly-minded man: and the endlesse brawlings, bitter contestations about tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, disorders, domesticall hurlyburlies, &amp;c. which haunt that family, where a cholericke, couetous, and hairebrained husband doth domineere. This latter, is like the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the ayre, continually torne and rent with fresh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, thunders, and many tumultuous stirres, which rise at first from a thing of nothing; a thinne inuisible fume drawne out of the earth: So earthly things, vainer then the most vanishing vapour, doe ordinarily raise in such Nource<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of disquietnesse and noise, a world of needlesse troubles, passionate distempers, and selfe-vexations. But the former is like the highest part of the aire, full of calmenesse, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, and constant light; the Sunne of righteousnesse shining still vpon it with the blessed beames of patience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:6825:133"/>
and spirituall noblenesse of minde; doth from time to time dissolue and driue away all mists of worldly mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, stormes of bitternesse and brawling, matter of such sencelesse and brainelesse molesting one another; and doth with a sweete and kindly heate refresh and support the heart, against all chollericke encounters and crosse accidents; by vertue of such heauenly and healing cordials as these, which were wont to calme and repell the most tempestuous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults vpon the afflicted Saints, Iob 1. 21. 1. Sam. 3. 18.</p>
            <p>3. But aboue all, by leading his wife in the way of life, and <hi>path, that is called Holy.</hi> This is the flower and crowne of all his skill, to be a blessed and manly guide vnto her, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards euerlasting happinesse. For want of this wisedome, and wil, many a poore soule lies bleeding vnto eternal death, vnder the bloody and mercilesse hand of an ignorant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, or Pharisaicall husband; which perhaps may haue knowledge enough and too much, to thriue in the world, to prosper in his outward state; to prouide for posterity; nay to oppresse, ouer-reach, and defraud his brother: But no wit, no vnderstanding, no braines at all, to teach, and tell his wife one foote of the right way to heauen: <hi>wise to do euill, as the Prophet speakes,</hi> Ier. 4. 22. <hi>But to doe good, no knowledge at all:</hi> No holy habit or heart to pray with her, to instruct, and incourage her in the great mystery and practise of godlinesse; to keepe the Sabbath holy, and daies of humiliation; to reade Scriptures, repeate Sermons, and conferre of good things with her, &amp;c. from which he is so farre; that although it be the strongest barre to keepe her from grace, and the bloody cut-throate of both their soules; he will needes perswade her that all this is too much precisenesse.

            <p>II. To the wife.</p>
            <p>1. Let her be in subiection to her head.</p>
            <p>1. By a reuerent and humble perswasion of his preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and authority ouer her, grounded and ingrauen in her resolution principally: 1. By vertue of diuine ordination, Gen. 3. 16. Ephe. 5. 24. Though 2. The very law of nature, 3. Her husbands headship, 4. Womanly infirmity may also bee powerfull motiues to this purpose. For if her heart begin to swell, and be lifted vp with an ouerweening conceit of a sufficiency aboue her sexe; so that she grow discontent, and impatient of contradiction and command, shee brings a world of vnnecessary misery and molestation into her owne house, and lies in a grand transgression and grieuous sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the institution and honour of the marriage-state. It is no <note n="a" place="margin">Quòd si tu no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilissima es, mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus tuus aut no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilissimus fit per te, aut tu ignobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis per illum.</note> noblenesse of birth greatnesse of portion, nimblenesse of tongue, pregnancy of wit, or any other excellency inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to her sexe, which can giue her any right or priuiledge to seize vpon the soueraignty, and take the raines into her owne hands. Some seruants also may be wiser then their masters: some subiects more politicke then their Prince; but that giues them no warrant; nay, for all that, it were monstrous and vnnaturall villany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for any seruant thereupon to domineere; or priuate man to rush into a Royall Throne.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:6825:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
No sufficiency of gifts, or singularity of worth must iustle vs out of that ranke and station, wherein Gods wise proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and all-seeing wisedome hath placed vs. A man may bee a superiour in power and place, to his superiour in parts and personall endowments. No pretence then or plea on the womans part, can possibly procure any dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against God and nature, of vnwomanly domineering and deposing her head.</p>
            <p>2. By an hearty and cheerefull submission: 1. To all his lawfull and honest dictates and directions: For her personall behauiour and carriage; that it may be fashioned and addrest, with an ingenuous and louing acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modation of her selfe to doe him all the honour, and giue him all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment she can possibly with good conscience: for edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, ordering and disposing her children, seruants, and other domesticall affaires (wherein notwithstanding there are some passages, more proper and natiue to her sexe, in which, except she be witlesse, gracelesse, and strangely weake, it will be very vnmanly, dishonourable and vnworthy for him to be too medling, prying and pragmaticall:) But aboue all, for guiding her aright in the sweete and glorious path of Christianity, that after their neerest, and dearest comfort, and communion in the best things and spirituall blessings, which onely can allay the smart of al crosse accidents, &amp; swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the bitternesse of a few &amp; euill daies in this vale of teares, they may for euer be crowned together in heauen. 2. To all his reasonable, and Religious restraints: not onely from wicked haunts, and customes, sinfull fashions, and passions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the Spouse, for Christs sake, soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and loue, doth deny her selfe, her owne reason, and wisedome, her naturall wit, and wilfulnesse, her passions, pleasures, and profits, her ease and liberty, &amp;c.

Let her bee an helper, Genesis 2. 18. and doe him good all the dayes of her life, at all times, vpon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, in all estates; of aduersity, or prosperity; acceptation, or disgrace; sicknesse, or health; youth, or old age, &amp;c. and that, with kindnesse and constancy. A most memorable,<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 12. Lib. 2. De Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anâ foem. p. 360.</note> and famous patterne for this purpose is recorded by <hi>Uiues.</hi> A yong, tender and beautifull maid was matched (as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) to a man stricken in yeeres: whom, after shee found to haue a very fulsome and diseased body; yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of sence and conscience, as it seemes, that now by Gods prouidence she was become his wife; she most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily digested with incredible patience and contentment, the languishing, and lothsomnesse of an husband continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally visited and vexed with variety and new successions of most irkesome and contagious diseases. And though friends and Physicions aduised her by no meanes to come neere him, for feare of danger and infection; yet for all this, shee pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by, with a louing disdaine and contempt, these vnkinde disswasions, plied him still night and day with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tendernesse and care; with obsequiousnesse and serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all sorts, aboue her strength and ability, or possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Author saith: had not her dearest coniugall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on supplied and supported her weake body, with fresh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of vigor and vnweariednesse. Shee was to him friends, physicion, husband, Nurse. These are nothing: She was Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, daughter, euery thing, any thing, to doe him good any manner of way. Nay, had there bin one exquisite quintessence of tendernesse, deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:6825:135"/>
affectionatenesse, and loue collected and extracted from all these; it would hardly haue matched her merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and melting affections towards him. In case of want, by reason of extraordinary expence, and excessiue charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; she sold her Rings, chaynes, and richest attire; she emptied her cupbord of plate, her cabinet of chiefest and choycest Iewels, to doe him good. And when hee was dead, and friends came about her rather to congratulate her happie riddance, then to bewaile her widdowhood; shee did not onely deprecate and abhorre all speeches tending that way: but protested if it were possible, she would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly redeeme her husbands life, with the losse of her fiue dearest children. And though as yet, the flower, and prime of her beautifullest and best time was not expired; yet she strongly resolued against a second match, because, said she, I shall not finde a second <hi>Ualdaura;</hi> (for so her husband was called.) Whence it appeares, that this worthy woman was wedded to her husbands soule; not to his body: no infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or deformity whereof could coole or weaken the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and feruency of her loue. Such choyse as this, were the way to make wiues neuer weary of their husbands. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as affections fastened onely on a mans outside, are subiect to the tedious misery of inconstancy and change, and torture of many wicked and impossible wishes, according to the vanity and vexation of its transitory obiect.

to forecast, contriue and manage, as her more proper and particular charge, household affaires, and businesses within dore, as they say. For which, see a right noble glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious patterne, Prou. 31. For the pride, vanity, idlenesse and luxury of these last times, wherein there is so much hell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth; such an impetuous raigne and rage of sinne in all sorts, hath transported also that sexe into many monstrous degenerations: So that our great women in these daies would bee very loth to worke after this sample, though set by the holy Ghost himselfe: Yet heretofore right Noble Princesses and daughters of mighty Kings, made conscience of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling, and disdayned not to put their hands to huswifery. See Gen. 18. 6. And 27. 14. 2. Sam. 13. 8.</p>
            <p>But aboue all, let here be assistant to him in setting vp, and forward the rich and Royall trade of grace; in erecting and establishing Christs glorious Kingdome, both in their owne hearts, and in their house. This is that <hi>one neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary thing,</hi> without which their family is but Satans semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and a nurcery for hell. And therefore let her be so far from drawing a contrary way (a cursed villany of some wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wiues abroad in the world) or dead-heartednesse this way, which is the graue of all spirituall graces, that, in case of negligence &amp; slacknesse, she should labor by all wise, modest, seasonable insinuations, to stirre vp and quicken her husband to constancy and seruency in religious exercises of prayer, reading, catechizing, conference, daies of humiliation, and other household holy duties. As the two greater lights of Heauen doe gouerne this great world with their naturall: so let the husband and wife guide the little world of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, with the spirituall light of diuine knowledge and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. When the Sunne is present in our firmament, the Moone out of a sence, as it were, of a naturall reuerence to the fountaine of all her beauty and light, doth vaile her splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and retire her beames. But when he is departed to the other Hemisphaere, she shewes her selfe, and shines as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse amongst the lesser lights. When the husband is at home, let the wife onely, if need be, serue as a louing remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:6825:136"/>
to him, to keepe his turnes and times of illightning and informing the ignorant, darke and earthy hearts of their people. But in his absence comes her course, when her graces of knowledge and prayer, &amp;c. ought to shew forth themselues, and shine vpon them, to preserue them from coldnesse, and that dreadfull curse which hangs ouer the head of those that know not God, and shall certainely fall vpon those Families that call not on his Name. See Ierem. 10. 25.</p>
            <p>For conclusion of the point, &amp; crowning of the marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state with sound and lasting comfort in the meane time, and with euerlasting peace &amp; pleasures at last: Let man and wife ioyntly labour to sweeten and sanctifie their mutuall carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, both common and seuerall duties each to other, with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and constant meeting together in prayer.

Lastly, when vpon all occasions, in all companies, by all meanes, it hath done all the good it can, yet let it still retaine that constant propertie of all Heauenly Graces, an edge, and eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to doe more good still, and rather want matter and meanes, then readinesse and resolution to propagate it selfe. And this way now may the poorest Christians bee plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in workes of mercy, and enrich the richest with spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all almes.

            <p>And therefore in a second place, I infinitely desire and intreate, (and this is that which in this point I would spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially presse and perswade with deepest impression) that euery one which hath giuen his name vnto Christ, rich or poore, according to his power and proportion, would with singular care and conscience addresse himselfe to a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, affectionate, and constant discharge of this much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured dutie of almes-giuing in this kinde also, properly so called.</p>
            <p>1. For we are bound to abound in this grace also. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Cor. 8. 7. (<hi>As yee abound in euery thing, in faith, &amp;c.</hi>) <hi>see that you abound in this grace also.</hi> There is no religious Professour of any reputation, vpon good ground with the Church of God, but takes to heart, and desires to bee exact in all commanded Christian duties euery day, as Prayer, reading Scriptures, &amp;c. Vpon thy secret then, and solitarie reuise and suruey of the day past, call thy selfe to a strict account; as for others so concerning this dutie also, of doing good <hi>vnto all men, especially vnto them who are of the houshold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 10. (for the discharge of this dutie ought also to bee daily; if thy abilitie will beare, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the poore shall require: <hi>In the morning sowe thy seed, and in the euening withhold not thy hand. Giue a portion to seuen, and also to eight,</hi> Eccles. 11. 6, 2.) and let the sense and consciousnesse of any omission, neglect, or sloth in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, wound thy conscience also, humble thy soule, and quicken thine heart, with new life of resolution, and more liuely endeuour to mend euery morning; and perfume, as it were, thine euery dayes walking with God, and this sweet smelling sacrifice also of mercifulnesse, bounty, and loue, Phil. 4. 18. Let this duty likewise with the rest, fall within the compass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:6825:140"/>
grosse neglect of any one Christian dutie, in its season, of which the conscience is, or may be conuinced, may iustly dampe and dead the lightsome and fruitfull performance of all the rest. For example: A willing knowne omission of priuate Prayer, or set reading the Word euery day, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept and restraine the sweet influence of Gods woonted refreshing mercy, and the fructifying beames of his pleased countenance from thine heart, in the vse of all the other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: an affected idlenesse, and dis-imployment of any one grace in the soule, when seasonable occasion calleth for improouement, may blast the comfortable exercise and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible comfort of all the rest. For example: If thou suffer thy patience ordinarily to sleepe, when thy disauowed passions begin to breake in vpon thee like a torrent, and heate thine heart with their swelling poyson; or when some crosse doth nettle thy desire of ease; no maruaile though thou finde a faintnesse also to seize vpon thy faith, brotherly kindnesse, loue, zeale, ioy, and peace in beleeuing, &amp;c. Why then, when thou feelest thine inward man to begin to languish, and the whole body of Christianitie, to grow, as it were, towards a consumption; amongst other inquisitions, why doest thou not also feare out of a godly iealousie, and labour to finde out, whether the coldnesse of thy charity, and too much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of releeuing the poore members of Iesus Christ, may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion thy spirituall dampe? It is the duty and property of euery true-hearted <hi>Nathaneel,</hi> as to haue respect to all Gods Commandements, Psal. 119. 6. so, though they cannot in perfection and height, yet with truth and sincere endeauour, to haue respect to a conscionable vse of all the ordinances; to the performance of all holy duties, and exercise of all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces in their due seasons.</p>
            <p>2. If the world hath locked vp thine heart, and congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the bowels of thy compassions towards the poore; let the blaze of thine outward profession shine neuer so faire,<note place="margin">As I heartily loue the amiable face of tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:6825:140"/>
to amuse weaker Christians with some affected straines, and artificiall feruency in Prayer (for by the meere power, or rather poyson of hypocrisie and vaineglory, a man may pray sometimes to the admiration of others, especially lesse iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, hauing cunningly collected the most moouing passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for that purpose, from the best-gifted in that kinde, and then giuing an enforced action and life vnto them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie, as some in other cases act other mens inuentions to the life.) I say, for all this, if the holy heate of brotherly loue doth not warme thine heart, and vpon occasion worke affectionately and effectually, I dare say, thou art rotten at the heart-roote, there is no true loue of God in thee, no grace, no hope of saluation. Let that terrible and flaming place against all couetous Pharises, 1. Ioh. 3. 17. dissolue thy frozen-heartednesse this way, and enlarge the bowels of pitie towards the poore brethren of Christ Iesus, or else neuer looke hereafter to looke him in the face with comfort, or to finde mercy at that Day. Marke it well, and meditate vpon it: <hi>Whoso hath this worlds good, and seeth his brother hath need, and shutteth vp his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But aboue all other motiues of mercifulnesse to the poore, which in the Booke of God are very many, and most quickening; methinkes that argument which <hi>Paul</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to this purpose, 2.

And yet wee see in the meane time, our gracious God beares patiently with these many and prodigious prouocations. Though hee be armed with his owne vnresistable omnipotency; haue euer in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines all the Angels of Heauen, all the creatures vpon Earth, all the Deuils in Hell; nay, the very hands and consciences of such stubborne Rebels, to be the instruments and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of his iust wrath vpon their sinne: yet doth hee sweetly and fairely temper, and moderate his indignation, to see if the riches of his goodnesse and forbearance, and long-suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, will leade them to repentance.

Their narrow watching ouer his wayes to take him trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and prying into all passages of his life, vpon purpose to disgrace his profession, should make him walk more precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and to hold a continuall counter-watch ouer all his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that hee giue no iust cause of offence, or any true matter of cauill or calumniation.

Their hitting him in the teeth with the reproch of his former sinnes, should serue as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer vnto him, to reuise and renew more effectually and feelingly the great worke of his first repentance; and to open afresh a fountaine of penitent teares, or at least of new griefe, hee can grieue no more, for those particular sinnes, which any dogged <hi>Shimei,</hi> or slanderous <hi>Doeg</hi> brings into his mind vpon such occasion. For it is the woont of ignorant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Gods holy wayes, to charge vpon his children, euen with much bitternesse and insultation, the faults and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of their vnregenerate time. Though God Almighty hath buried them for euer in his mercy; yet they will neuer suffer them to dye out of their malice.

And in their grasping of worldly goods, they care not a button for conscience, make no account at all of that most certaine strict account at Gods dreadfull Tribunall: but only how to carry matters smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plausibly in the eyes of men, and dawbe ouer their vniust dealings, with close conueyances, and trickes of wit.</p>
            <p>I goe not about heere to Apologize for any vncharitable counterfeits, or those most odious outside-Christians, who put on the glory of an Angell in outward profession, that they may play the deuils more vnobseruedly, in Vsurious practises, oppressions, and vnconscionable griping; weare a cloake of zeale, in conformitie to the externall formes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the first Table, vpon purpose to couer their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and inhumanitie, in vndermining and ouer-reaching their brethren, and to prey the more inuisibly vpon the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of those whom they deceiue by <hi>Seeming.</hi>

            <p>But yet I must tell you, that many times, euen some of Gods owne best Children are full falsly and fouly charged, by foule-mouthed worldlings themselues, with worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, couetousnesse, and imputations of that nature; who by Gods mercy, are so farre from doting vpon earth, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding glory thereof, that in their retired &amp; aduised thoughts, they would not loose the loue and light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and testimonie of a good conscience, to winne the whole world: they would not exchange their comforts of godlinesse, and interest in a Crowne of life, for ten thousand worlds, were they all turned into one inualuable Pearle: They feele themselues incomparably more comforted and kindly refreshed at the heart roote, with one thought of heauen, and that endlesse ioyfull rest aboue, through all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, then with a world of earthly contemplations, though

               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:6825:147"/>Thus many times an imputation of worldlinesse, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartednesse, vnhospitalitie, &amp;c. is layd vpon Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, without all cause, truth, or conscience; occasioned, as I conceiue, (for I desire to discouer vnto you a depth of Satans malice in this point,) partly from the parties accusing and slandering; partly from the parties accused and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Occasions ministred by prophane men, are such as these:</p>
            <p>1. First, They many times, when they finde their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences disquieted, their former courses controlled, their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall humours crossed and contradicted, and themselues much diseased and disturbed in the securefull pursuit of their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall pleasures, by the searching power of a conscionable Ministerie: or when they plainely see that their vnzealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, lukewarmnesse, and formalitie in Religion, is censured and condemned by the forwardnesse, and zealous carriage and conuersation of the Saints, they seeke by all meanes, and labour might and maine, to bee meete with those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters which so vexe them with their faithfull Preaching; and those godly Christians, which silently disgrace them with their gracious life and zealous exercise of Christianitie. And therefore sith many times, by Gods goodnesse, they cannot finde any visible or conspicuous matter or miscarriage, to charge them with truely; because the Saints lie not in grosse and notorious sinnes, such as are swearing, drunkennesse, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vncleannesse, Sabbath-breaking, idlenesse, the vanities of goodfellowship, &amp;c. as themselues are woont; therefore, I say, they audaciously diue into their hearts with vnhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed censures, and lay vnto their charges those inuisible er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which none can see but Gods All-seeing Eye; &amp; from which they cannot be cleered and acquit, but onely by their owne consciences, and his highest Tribunall. So that they take order that such imputations, though groundlesse and false; yet shall be sure to cleaue to the good name of Gods Children as certainely without redresse or remedie, as they were deuised without truth or charitie. Wee may see this cleerely in the present point, and the slander of hypocrisie,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:6825:147"/>
which is also the ordinarie portion of the best, from men of the world. When prophane opposites vnto grace pry curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously into all the wayes of Gods Child, and can finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so faulty in his outward carriage, or reprooueable in the ordinarie course of his life, as they expect and desire; yet, left they should not shew themselues the right children of Satan, the Accuser of the Brethren; they will be medling one way or other; they will bee nibling at his good name, with some such speeches as these: Well, well, though he be an excellent Pulpit man, or a forward Professour, yet is hee not so, and so? is not hee as well giuen vnto, and greedy of the world as other men? When they heare other men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his zeale and forwardnesse in Profession, these will be casting out such malicious doubts as these; Goe too, my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, I feare me all is not gold that glisters. Now how is it possible, or by what outward witnesses or compurgators may the Christian cleere and discharge himselfe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of worldlinesse and hypocrisie; sith the one lyes in the greedy affections of the minde, and the other lurkes in the hidden corners of the heart? The purity and secrets of which, none can truely see and censure, but the Searcher of all hearts. Were a man accused of Adulterie, Drunkennesse, or such visible notoriousnesse, there might be meanes found for the manifestation of his innocencie, by an exact scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of time, place, and other circumstances. But this is the malicious and pestilent policie of Satan and his agents, when they see that the Saints, by the mercies of God, are free from those grosse sinnes and notorious corruptions, which ordinarily raigne in the children of darknesse; they spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and cunningly lay vnto their charge, imputations of such nature, from the which, though they bee free, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not free themselues; and though they bee cleere, yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the malice of men, and inuisiblenesse of the matter, it will neuer so appeare; vntill the brightnesse of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bring foorth their righteousnesse as the light, and their iudgement as the noone-day; and of which they haue none other ground in the world but this, because themselues are
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:6825:148"/>
such. For put a prophane worldling to prooue the slander of worldlinesse and hypocrisie, which he puts vpon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and he will be able to giue you neither probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor wise word to purpose. And no marueile; for let the matter come to examining, and hee shall finde, that man which hee so miscensures, to bee, both faithfull towards God, and conscionable towards man in all his wayes: Not onely innocent from oppression, corruption, wrongfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and all vnlawfull wayes of getting; but also in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner, with a most compassionate tendernesse and loue, right dearely affected to euery true-hearted <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neel,</hi> and the whole houshold of faith; (which no vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man can possibly bee; and which is the truest and noblest issue of sanctified charitie) Nay, and besides, not any wayes wanting (though it stand not with the policy of prophanenesse to acknowledge it) in other charitable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages with spirituall discretion, to any truly distressed and miserable. And therefore there is no ground in the world left for such gracelesse lyes, but onely this: Carnall world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings carue conditions to other men, out of the crookednesse of their owne nature; and cunningly put on the policie of Cutpurses; who in throngs at Faires and markets, call vpon others to beware of Curpurses, that themselues being truly so, may with lesse suspition and obseruation, diue into the pockets and purses of true men. Many there are, who being themselues truely worldly, and hypocrites indeed, call Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians so, that the maske of their villanous hypocrisies may bee lesse marked; and themselues roote in earthlinesse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they reach the very bottome of hell, and no man regard them.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, if a man would bee irreligious and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable, it is a very easie thing to grow rich and into repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the world. If once hee so farre harden his heart, seare his conscience, and abandon the feare of God; that hee resolues without remorse or shame, to defraud, dissemble, bribe, oppresse, put to Vsury, serue the time, make vse of all men for his owne turne, to cloake crueltie with conscience,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:6825:148"/>
pretend friendship, when he purposes to deale like a Turke: In a word, to plot and practise any lewd deuice or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encelesse course, for his aduantage and rising; I doe not see how such a fellow, in these griping dayes and times of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, should escape wealth, preferment, and respect in the world. And as it is easie for fellowes of such ill conscience to thriue, and wicked men to grow wealthy; so methinkes it is no great matter for such to make sometimes very goodly showes to the world, of bountifulnesse, and liberall profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in feasts, entertainments, and larger doles to the poore, out of their superfluities, and heapes of ill-gotten goods. But herein (though it bee well, that such goods doe good vnto some) they are like vnto theeues, who hauing robbed some rich Merchant, and taken hundreths from him, do scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heere and there by the way, some small pieces of siluer to the poore. But this is a very poore mends for their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse bloodshed and lawlesse robberies: This is, as they say, to rob <hi>Peter,</hi> and cloath <hi>Paul.</hi> Thus many great men keepe great houses; and that is well: it is fit, Greatnesse should be accompanied with franknesse; but alas, they grinde the faces of the poore, and eate the flesh of Gods people, to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their hospitalitie. So some Ministers heape liuing vpon liuing, that so they may be enabled and furnished to purchase a great name by keeping a great house; but alas, they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their port and estate with the price of the precious blood of soules, and feed the greedy humour of their Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaicall goodfellowship, with the fearefull Gangrene of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bloodshed. So others may bee sometimes good vnto the poore, and bountifull, as they say, in their own houses: but alas, they marre all their almes-giuing, by vnlawfull get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and turne that, which of it selfe is one of those sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 16.</note> with which God is highly pleased, into <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 61. 8.</note> abomination and sinne vnto themselues. A goodly matter, sure, to scatter heere and there, now and then, some few drops of charitable deuotions; whereas they haue many huge and headlong torrents of gaine and goods comming in dayly; by oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, violence, mercilesse inclosure, deuouring widowes
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:6825:149"/>
houses, selling the poore for old shooes, rackings, enhansings, gripings, vsuries, immoderate takings, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, prophane hypocrites are commonly Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call in their almesgiuing; affect, and pursue obseruation, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie, vaine-glorious ostentations in their contributions of charitie. Their forefathers the Pharises, when they gaue their almes, made a Trumpet to bee sounded before them; So these fellowes, their followers, and succeeding Actors vpon the same Stage of hypocrisie, lest their good deeds should die in the distribution, and bee obscurely buried in the bellies of the poore, they also get vnto themselues a kinde of talebearing Trumpetters too. They cunningly obserue those opportunities, and single out such obiects of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration, and charitable deuotions, whereby they may soonest, and most compendiously purchase a name of being good to the poore, and haue their bountifull disposition blazed abroad, with most circumstances, best aduantages, and partiall enlargements. And thus it is a very easie thing for a Pharise to bee famous in this kinde: for sith hee giues more for commendation, then for conscience; far more for praise amongst men, then out of a true-hearted compassion to the party; he dares dispence with a good conscience, and take liberty vnto himselfe to place his good turnes there, where there is best possibilitie of being most spoke of, and greatest hope of the richest returne of applause and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that such an one ordinarily in his open-heartednesse, and charitable distributions, hath a speciall eye and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those that flatter him to his face; and are like to prooue the loudest trumpets of his bountifulnesse abroad where they come. And hee is so farre from a right and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable apprehension of due circumstances, difference of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and those spirituall discretions, obseruable and necessary in such Christian exercises of loue; and from the practise of the Apostles precept, Galat. 6. 10. <hi>Doe good vnto all men, but especially to them which are of the houshold of faith:</hi> that hee would rather afford his helping hand for the reliefe &amp; raising vp of a decayed goodfellow, then of a distressed Christian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:6825:149"/>4. Fourthly, though carnall men bee so couetous, and hold-fast of earthly contentments, that they would rather loose their precious soules euerlastingly, then leaue them: yet if it might bee, if they were possibly compatible, they would giue any thing in the world; both to serue and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themselues in the wayes of vanitie, and after to saue their soules in the day of wrath; both to partake of the pleasures of the present, and to be secured from the vengeance that is to come. What would not the great Ones of the world giue, to purchase two Heauens; one here, and another in the other world? What would not sensuall worldlings part with, to redeeme their sinnes, if they might haue a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to continue in sinne? to liue the life of vanity and lust, and after to die the death of the Righteous, and to receiue their crowne? In such cases in their sober considerations (so that their present temporall happinesse sustaine no hazard, or diminution; nor the delights of their sweete sinne, any disturbance) they would not stand vpon any worldly good; though it were <hi>a thousand Rammes, or ten thousand Riuers of Oyle:</hi> Nay, they would giue their <hi>first-borne for their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions;</hi> euen <hi>the fruit of their bodies for the sinne of their soules.</hi> Many there are which may bee easily perswaded, and can well finde in their hearts, to giue any thing towards the seruice of God, and saluation of their soules; saue themselues; I meane, their hearts and affections, which the world and their darling-pleasures haue principally possest. Hence now it is, that many rich Ones and men of the world, being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise very guilty, and obnoxious in many respects, are very willing and well content many times to contribute bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to good vses, and to make good shew of liberalitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poore; that thereby lesse notice may bee taken of their other notoriousnesse; and with some kinde of hope, so to couer and conceale many grosse corruptions from the wrath of God, and the worlds censure. For I know not how, there is an inbred opinion and conceit seated in the hearts of naturall men and Papists, that almes-deeds, and such workes of charitie make amends for other miscariages, though foule,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:6825:150"/>
and scandalous; and be pleasing to Almightie God, though the parties fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they proceed, be polluted with secret impurities and raigning sinnes. Sith therefore they perswade their hearts, that charitable deuotions &amp; distributions haue some power, as it were, somewhat to appease diuine wrath, and to satisfie for other sinful exorbitancies and aberrations; and see plainely that it is the most compendious way to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase a great deale of credit in these cold &amp; compassionlesse times; and the onely obiect to diuert the eyes of the greater from the obseruation of their other faults: I say therefore, they open their hearts the more liberally, and enlarge their bowels to greater bountifulnesse; which otherwise their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse would keepe shut. Thus, many, to diminish the horrour and markeablenesse of their vnmortified lusts and open lewdnesse, exercise a good art without a good heart.</p>
            <p>Occasions from the parties slandered, are such as these:</p>
            <p>1. Christians, of all men in the world, are the speciall markes and ordinary obiects, vpon which are discharged and exercised all kindes of malice and mischiefe: not onely the empoisoned arrowes of spitefull tongues, the sword of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, the flames of crueltie; but also many lesser and lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markt vexations, as wrongs, oppressions, mercilesnesse, and many vnconscionable vsages. Prophane men being seated in high roomes, or besotted with the worlds fauours and flatteries, doe many times, out of their pride and malice, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contemptuously roule downe as from aloft, indignities, insolencies, many hard and heauy inhumanities, and iniusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon Gods Children, as a number of neglected vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. So that as the Prophet speakes; <hi>Hee that refraineth from euill, maketh himselfe a prey.</hi> Hee that by the mercies of God breakes out of the bonds of Satan, into the blessings and blessed estate of grace, shall for euer after, not onely be furiously persecuted by the rage of hell, and malice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenes; but also lie more open to the insultations, wrongs and oppressions of his aduersaries, and trecherous insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of false friends. Sith therfore Christians, by reason of their patience, the worlds discountenance, disaffection of great
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:6825:150"/>
Ones, their own resolute disallowance of all indirect courses, of any base, and vnconscionable aduantage, are many times mightily hackt vpon, and opprest by the greedy policies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilations, and encroachments of boysterous worldlings, and causelesse opposites: and not onely so, but sometimes also cunningly, &amp; insensibly preyed vpon euen by profest friends: (For there are a kinde of men, which putting on for the time, the glory of an Angell, mixe themselues with Gods people, and presse into their company, onely because they see and finde them to bee such, as from whom, by reason of the singlenesse and simplicitie of their heartts, the vnsuspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of their charitie, the equity and conscionablenesse of their dealing, in these coozening, supplanting, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining dayes, they may the most fairely and easily sucke out the greatest aduantage:) I say therefore, sith Gods children are most subiect both to the wrongs of open enemies, &amp; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation of seeming friends, they are many times not so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in outward things, or strong in their worldly state, to make such a flourish in dispersing their superfluities, as those men which get without conscience, and disburse without spirituall discretion.</p>
            <p>2. A Christian dare not for his life so farre enlarge his conscience, as to gaine by any vnwarrantable meanes, or vnconscionable course, as oppression, corruption, coozening, violence, lying, vniust dealing, &amp;c. and therefore in this griping, and greedy age, in the highest noonetide of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or rather darkest midnight of the workes of darknesse (though outward want bee infinitely counteruailed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort) hee doth not commonly come to that excesse, and superfluitie of temporall things, which many times worldlings with wider consciences, easily and immeasurably ingrosse. The largest consciences in these last &amp; worst dayes, are the onely deuourers, and swallowers downe of worldly wealth. A religious resolution to saue a mans soule, (more is the pitie!) is many times a notable curbe to keepe him from growing rich, and into reputation with the world. Gods blessings euen in temporall things, I deny not, are sometimes
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:6825:151"/>
very plentifully vpon the right owners, Gods owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and both heauenly and earthly happinesse haue beene wreathed together by the mercifull hand of God, and set vpon their heads: but if wee looke vpon the common cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses holden in the world that way; and in all forecast of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reason, hee is likeliest to grow rich and rise, who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to damne his soule. In ordinary conceit of prophane policie, and apprehensions of worldly wisdome, <hi>Ioseph</hi> mist<note place="margin">Gen. 39.</note> a great deale of earthly contentment, and in a precise humour put from him much possibilitie of preferment, by not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the impure sollicitations of his wanton Mistris. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah,</hi> in not iumping with the foure hundred false prophets,<note place="margin">1. King. chap. 22.</note> in their lying flatterie to please the two Kings: <hi>Ionathan,</hi> in not ioyning with his father <hi>Saul,</hi> for the preuention and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion<note place="margin">1. Sam. 20. 31, 32.</note> of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Had a sensuall worldling beene in <hi>Iosephs</hi> case, an vnsanctified Minister in <hi>Micaiahs,</hi> an ambitious <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom</hi> in <hi>Ionathans,</hi> assuredly they had all yeelded to the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall temptations. The conscience of an vnregenerate man will marueilously stretch it selfe, and grant out very large dispensations, especially when any speciall glory, profit or pleasure of the world is in pursuit and possibilitie. It was so in all ages, and at this day many a good man, many times, of great spirit, worth, and vnderstanding, sits obscurely in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low roome, and is kept vnder in meane estate by the worlds oppressions, because he dare not displease God, or enlarge his conscience proportionably to the vast gulfe of the times corruptions. This is the very true reason why folly is set in so great excellency, and sinceritie seated in the low place: why so many seruants are on horsebacke, and so many Princes walking as seruants on the ground. Sith therefore the Christian is happily restrained by the checks and tendernesse of a good conscience, from all vnwarrantable meanes, and vnconscionable courses of getting; though his bowels bee most compassionate, his heart heated with true charitie, and his desires enlarged to doe good vnto all, and all the good he can; yet he is many times kept short, by reason of his short pittance, from those outward reall expressions, and effects of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:6825:151"/>
charitie, to which his tender-hearted zealous affection is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, truely inflamed; and from those more bountifull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions and liberalities, which rich worldlings may, out of the tythe, nay, the thousandth part of their ill gotten goods, plentifully performe.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Christians know themselues bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to a carefull prouision for their Families; to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and faithfulnesse in their callings; from all vnnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie expences, and the prodigall effusions of goodfellowship, from ambitious affectation of applause, and vaineglory, by Pharisaicall ostentations: and therefore to the greedy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of carnall eyes, and vndiscerning spirits of vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which want no malice to mistake, or cunning to apprehend any shadow or shew of any seeming aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the disgrace of good men; they seeme, and are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censured to hold vpon the world, to feede vpon earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindednesse, not to bee so open-hearted, good-natur'd, and charitably affected as other good fellowes, as they call them, which make no such profession of purity, and precisenesse. And this misconceit of Gods children is made more passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by the prophane plausiblenesse of vaineglorious world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. It is sooner, and more easily entertained; because vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionable men take any compendious course of growing rich; which their couetous humour suggests vnto them; and by allowance and exercise of vnlawfull meanes of getting, bring in many times great store of wealth with much ease; and therefore neede not toyle so in their trades, or follow the businesses of their proper callings with such attention and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnesse. And if at any time they resolue to be more boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and liberall, they commonly make choyce of those times, places, persons, and other circumstances, whereby (as they thinke) their good natures may be most noted, and their names grow greatest for extraordinarie kindnesse and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowship.</p>
            <p>4. The Christian doth encline, and enlarge the bowels of his speciall compassion towards the necessities of the Saints, and conueyes the noblest issues, and effects of his inflamed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:6825:152"/>
charitie, into the bosome of Gods child. And indeed hee is so prest by the commandement; <hi>Doe good vnto all men, but especially vnto them who are of the houshold of Faith.</hi> And there was neuer more need: For howsoeuer worldlings may bee bountifull one to another, and exercise many mutuall offices of kindnesse and carnall loue among themselues; yet for the most part, they are very vncompassionate, straitlaced and hard-hearted toward distressed Christians. Nay, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, they are rather ready to combine and contribute their malices, policies and purses, to throw them downe lower in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to outward want and misery; then to put to their helping hands for their recouery, comfort, and enlargement; though it were in their sufferings for Gods cause, and testimony of a good conscience. So that, as Christian distresses are the principall obiect of the Christians compassion and bounty: So worldlings are onely heartily kind and openhearted to the men of the World. Now, that you may rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the point, you must conceiue, that the good deeds and commendable parts of an vnregenerate man, are euer carried more boisterously and with greater noyse, are entertained of the World with a farre more general applause and notice, then the godly actions and diuine Graces of Gods children. <hi>The World deales with men in this case,</hi> saith a worthy Diuine,<note place="margin">Greenham.</note> 
               <hi>as it deales with Witches and Physicions; the Witch, though shee faile in twenty things, yet if she doe some one thing aright, though it be but small, the world loueth, and commendeth her for a good and wise woman. But the Physicion, if hee worke sixe hundred cures; yet if, through the waywardnesse of his Patient, or for the punishment of his Patients sinne, he faile but in one, that one faile doth more turne to his discredit, then his manifold, goodly and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cures doe get him praise. In this manner,</hi> saith hee, <hi>doth the world deale with men: If a worldly man haue but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

               <hi>gift of strength, of speech, or of comelinesse, he shall be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praised, and counted a goodly man, though he be an Idolater, or a prophane person; and though hee swimme and flow ouer in all manner of vices: But let the child of God bee truely zealous in true Religion, let him bee honest and holy in conuersation, yet</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:6825:152"/>
               <hi>if there be but one infirmitie in him, or if he haue through weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse fallen into some one sinne, that one infirmitie against which he striueth, or that one sinne for which he is grieued, shall drowne all the Graces of God in him, bee they neuer so great, and the World will account him a most wicked man.</hi> It is iust so in this particular: A prophane man many times by some one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall markable act of bounty and contribution, or for some few seasonable ostentations of good fellowship, and kinde nature, gets the start and precedency in opinion and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the World, from many a gracious Christian; who beares in his bosome a constant habituall tender-heartednes to all true necessities, and as occasion shall exact, opens his heart, his hands, and his house most ioyfully and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, to refresh and comfort the needfull exigents of any true-hearted <hi>Nathaneel.</hi> And the Worldling doth the rather, and more easily carry it, because in the dispersing of his doles and largesses, hee many times makes choise of such tale-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Trumpetters, who knowing his Pharisaicall humour, are likeliest to blaze his bounty most abroad in the World; whereas the Christian singles out specially for such purposes the distressed Saints, from whom hee expects no more but a secret and silent blessing of God in their hearts, for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse conueyed vnto them by such an Instrument.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue discouered vnto you a mysterie of Satans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and the cunning despitefulnesse of prophane men, who labour many times out of pure malice, &amp; wilfull mistakings, to fasten vpon Gods children, imputations of worldlinesse, hard-heartednesse, cruell dealing, and such like.</p>
            <p>The occasions, as I haue largely told you, are such as these.</p>
            <p>Vpon the Worldlings part:</p>
            <p>1. His hearty desire to disgrace Christians, whom, sith by the Grace of God, hee finds free from open grosse sinnes, presently growes to such speeches as these: Why, but are not such and such giuen to the world, as well as other men? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. He dare enlarge his conscience to courses of vnlawfull
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:6825:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
getting; and therefore it is more easie for him to open his hand now and then to some boysterous flourishes of liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindednesse; especially sith thereby hee hopes to repaire his reputation for his other indirections.</p>
            <p>3. He is commonly Pharisaicall in an ambitious exercise, and more publike acting of his deeds of charitie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatsoeuer hee doth that way, is for the most part car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried abroad with speciall and remarkable noyse and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
            <p>4. He would gladly still the cryings of his guilty consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and seeme to himselfe to redeeme the sinnes of his soule, by a more bountifull disbursement of outward things.</p>
            <p>Vpon the Christians part:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He is most subiect to wrongs and weakenings in his outward state; both by the violent encroachments of profest opposites, and couetous insinuations of false friends.</item>
               <item>2. He dare not for any gold, or good, vndertake any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable and scandalous course of gaining.</item>
               <item>3. He finds himselfe bound in conscience, to faithfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in his Calling, and Christian prouision for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</item>
               <item>4. He spends the best and most of his bounty and charitie vpon the houshold of Faith.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But in this point, as I said before, I apologize for none but those, whom their owne consciences, and the mercifull Tribunall of God doe acquite. Let Christians looke vnto it; the World is very watchfull, and greedy with great curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ositie and cunning, to apprehend the least shadow of any occasions, for the blaspheming of the wayes of God, and the disgracing of his children. And therefore euer and anon you shall heare the spirit of prophanenesse crying out, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining: You see these fellowes, which make such show of forwardnesse and puritie, what they are: none so couetous; none so vncharitable; none so vnmercifull, and cruell in their dealings as they; none so hard-hearted to the poore, &amp;c. Now although such bitter speeches as these, are often the meere euaporations of pure malice, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

ground in the world, but onely from the gall of gracelesse men: yet let all those which truely feare God, take heed how they giue iust occasion thereunto. Assuredly it were farre better for him, whosoeuer he be, that a milstone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the Sea; then that by the continuance of his cruell and vnconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealings in the world, he should minister iust occasion to any rayling <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> to reuile the seruants of the Liuing God, or to slander that holy Profession. Me thinkes, this one preseruatiue should be powerfull enough, to keepe the heart of euery Christian from doting vpon the world, or suffering it to bee possessed thereof. It is this: Euery Christian by a fruitfull faith, may bee assured of a Crowne of life, either by assurance of adherence, or euidence; or both. Now if but once a day hee should take a serious suruay of the glory, euerlastingnesse, and vnutterable excellencies of that Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Crowne; me thinkes it were able so to dull the edge, and dissolue the drossinesse of all earthly desires; that they should neuer more be able to heate, or harden his heart with immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate or delightfull repose vpon the vexing vanities of any worldly thing. I say it againe; Me thinkes, if a man doe but once a day cast the eye of his Faith vpon that Crowne of life; which our deare Redeemer holds for vs in his hand, ready to set vpon our heads when we shall be dissolued from this vale of teares; the goodly glory thereof should be able to dispell these mists of fading vanities, and hurtfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>umes of honours, riches, and earthly pleasures; which this great dunghill of the World, heated by the fire of mens inordinate lusts, doth euaporate and interpose betwixt the sight of their soules, and the blisse of Heauen.</p>
            <p>Worldlinesse, earthly-mindednesse, couetousnesse, doth infinitely vnbecome an heire of Heauen. Be fired then, and frighted from all inclinations and bent that way, by such considerations as these:</p>
            <p>1. It is a most base and dunghill distemper, which eates vp, not onely all Religion and honestie, manlinesse and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, naturall affection and discretion; but euen humanity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

and friendlinesse: So that a man had almost as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse with a Caniball for any ingenuous and conscionable dealing, as with a truely couetous caitife.</p>
            <p>2. Shall the immortall comprehensiuenesse of the diuine and excellent Soule, which is able to peruse and passe ouer Heauen and Earth in a moment; is capable of the mystery of Christ, and the eternall vision of God; be vnworthily confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a piece of ground, an heape of white and yellow clay? A vile imprisonment, and inexpiable wrong to so noble a Nature!</p>
            <p>3. It is a deuouring Gangrene, an insatiable Wolfe; which the more it hath, euer the more hungry it is. It is as fire which encreaseth by that nourishment which is giuen vnto it. The barren wombe, the Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>4. All Gods blessed ones in all ages, embracing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of life in the armes of their faith, willingly confessed themselues to bee pilgrims and strangers here vpon earth, looking for a Citie in another Country, <hi>which hath foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whose builder and maker is God.</hi> And good reason, besides Religion, that they should grow into such resolutions; for all things here below are full of transitorinesse, mortality and change; <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity:</hi> but aboue, is constancy and eternitie of all excellencies, perfections and pleasures. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that thou shalt haue there a Body brighter then the Sunne, a Soule replenished with vnutterable delights, the glorious company of Christ Iesus, Angels, Saints, Christian Friends; the vision and fruition of God, blessed for euer, wherein consists the Crowne and Life of all celestiall ioyes; I say, to say nothing of these, but euen the space of one foot vpon the pauement of the Empyrean Heauen, is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more worth, then the great Body of the whole Earth, were it all turned into Gold, and beset with as many vnualu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Pearles, as it is now with piles of Grasse.</p>
            <p>5. Nature, saith a meere Moralist, seemeth in the first birth of Gold, and wombe from whence it proceedeth, after a sort to haue presaged the misery of those that are in loue with it. For it hath so ordered the matter, that in those Countries where it groweth, there growes with it neither Grasse, nor Plant, nor any thing, that is worth any thing: as giuing vs to vnderstand thereby, that in those minds where the desire of this metall growes, there cannot remaine so much as a sparke of true honour and vertue.</p>
            <p>6. God is not onely a Father, but also All-sufficient: Why<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 8, 9. Gen. 17. 1.</note> shouldest thou then feare want, that fearest him? He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides euery day for millions of Fowles; Will Hee then bee wanting to a Man, to a Christian, to His owne Child? Christ himselfe pressing reasons to this purpose, tells vs, that our heauenly Father cloathes the Lilly aboue <hi>Solomons</hi> Royalty,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 25, &amp;c.</note> and feedes the Fowles of the aire, which neither sow, nor reape, nor gather into barnes. What a cursed vaile then of base distrust darkens thine hard heart, that thou shouldest either carke, or deale vnconscionably?</p>
            <p>7. One two houres fire will disperse, and consume the hoard of an hundred yeeres heaping together. And where art thou then? Thine heart then is seized vpon at once, with vnutterable anguish, and the very horror of Hell, for the losse of thine Heauen vpon Earth; and with cryes of blood, and furies of conscience, for thy couetous, cruell, vsurious, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious courses for many yeeres. Thus many a worldling spins a faire thread to strangle himselfe both temporally and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p>8. The Sunne is a very glorious and contented creature; and yet it harbours no golden Mine in its faire and refulgent Body.

Heauen, the chiefe and Royall Seate of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is empty of these treasures, there grow no Minerals; the Veine of siluer and gold is not to be found there.

Before I can seasonably and preparedly fall vpon the first, to instruct punctually, and arme the Christian against it, with whom I principally deale in this whole discourse: giue mee leaue to discouer a mysterie of spirituall Selfe-deceit; by which Satan sits presumptuously in the darkned minds, and deluded imaginations of those, whom with his cunning and malice he hood winkes, and hardens to their endlesse confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Many thousands euen vnder the meanes, and in this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mid-day of the Gospell, are groundlesly conceited, that they are right, when as in truth and triall, they are rotten at the heart roote; that they are sure of Heauen, when they are as yet most certainely of the family of Hell. Neither is this any strange thing: so deluded were the <hi>foolish Virgins,</hi> Mat. 25. 11, 12. and so are all such outside Christians: <hi>Those,</hi> Luk. 13. 26, 27. and so are all, who stand onely on the worke wrought, &amp; bare taske of religious duties, without the power of inward holinesse: <hi>The yong man</hi> in the Gospell, Mat. 19. 20. with that generation, Prou. 30. 12.

            <p>And yet some sorts of vnregenerate men are here to bee excepted from this generall deluge of selfe-delusion; who lye not so grossely inwrapped in the iuggling mists of the deuils Angelicall glory. Not that they are better then those delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Ones, or haue any good assurance vpon sound vndecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grounds of their spirituall well-being, (for such an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble true perswasion, is confined only to true Conuerts) but it happens by accident, that by reason either of the extreme villany of their liues, or desperate positions of their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian doctrine, they see cleare reasons stand like an armed man in their conuinced consciences; that if they continue in their forlorne courses, they cannot possibly be saued; or faine reasons, &amp; coine distinctions, vpon purpose to exclude all fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any infallible certainty of saluation. They are such as these:</p>

            <p>3. Other sonnes of <hi>Belial;</hi> whose hearts by their obstinate wallowing in the worke of darkenesse, hardening their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads by their impudent vallanies against the face of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; and with their owne soule-murthering hands, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crueltie pressing an hot iron vpon their consciences, are growne at length into such a prodigious Rocke; that though<note place="margin">See Rom. 1. 32.</note> they know themselues to be posting towards the pit of Hell, yet they are senselesse, and fearelesse of that fiery dungeon.</p>
            <p>4. Those, who being conuinced of the truth, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Gospell, and approouing in their iudgement and conscience, the power and practise of it, as the onely way to euerlasting blisse; but then reflecting their carnall eyes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the furious entisings of their darling sinnes, and by the touchstone of sense comparing the pleasures of these, which they presently graspe, with the spirituall strictnesse, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised ioyes of the other; stand infinitely vnresolued, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately obstinate, by no meanes, vpon no termes to leaue the present sensuall ioyes of their earthly paradise: but rather choose euen in their cold blood, to turne their backes vpon God blessed for euer, his holy truth, seruice, seruants, and all the glory in the World to come.

            <p>6. Nay further, some out of a Pharisaicall pretence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and modesty; but in truth, from the secret suggestion of a guilty conscience, which ministers vnto them more then matter enough of true and iust doubting, are notable wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for Papisticall doubting.<note place="margin">

            <p>Thus you see, some there are also, who doe not assure themselues of future happinesse, either vpon true or false grounds. Yet I am perswaded, the greatest part of those who liue within the sound of the Gospell, are ordinarily confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent without cause, and secure of their saluation; when as in truth &amp; triall They haue no surer interest or better claime to the kingdome of heauen, then the foolish Virgins, and the rest of that deluded ranke, which I mentioned a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Let a Minister of some great Congregation, wherein there are very few Professors, which is no hard thing to find, and where there is no profession, especially the Gospell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peaceably preached, there can ordinarily be no power of Christianity; shewes there may be, indeed without substance; but not the power of godlinesse, without visible appearance; as appeares in the Preparatiues: I say, let him interrogate, and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:6825:158"/>
aske the rest of his people one after another, bee they hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreths or thousands, what conceits they hold of themselues for the world to come? what they thinke will become of them after this life? what their present iudgement is of their spirituall estate? And I thinke he shall scarce meet with any, who will not in some kinde or other discouer some ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse confidence of his wellbeing that way. Their answer ordinarily would be to this purpose: <hi>We thanke God, we haue</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iust like the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, Luke 18. 11.</note>

Yea, would they say, with all our hearts, else it were pittie we should liue. When as, God knowes, it is neither so nor so: their poore frozen flinty hearts, neuer yet melted before the Ministery of the Word; were neuer truely touched with remorse for their innumerable sinnes; neuer warmed with any sauing worke of the holy Ghost; but euer thus farre, meere strangers to the mysterie of Christ. (Those that are true of heart, are not woont to contest for the integrity, but euer to complaine of the naughtinesse and vntowardnesse of their hearts.)

time demanded of those many thousands besides, what they conceiued of themselues for saluation: doe you not thinke he would haue found them all well conceited of themselues? Would not they with much bitternesse and heate, haue exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated his censure, as too peremptory and vnmercifull, and beene ready to retort: Howsoeuer you dote vpon the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples you draw after you, and onely approoue and applaud the <hi>Ioanites:</hi> (for so they were called, because his name was <hi>Iohn:</hi>) yet we hope to doe as well as they, and come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as soone as the precisest of those you haue in so high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme.</p>
            <p>Heere then let me a little illighten and open in a word, as I promised, the Mystery of this spirituall Selfe-deceit.</p>
            <p>For which purpose know, that Satan first discouers in our corrupt nature and crooked dispositions, a very pregnant ground, whereupon to practise this notable imposture, I meane, the originall poyson of naturall presumption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are all apt to bee fearelesse and sencelesse of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent spirituall misery; and hand ouer-head to catch at any vaine shadow of counterfeit confidence for our future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: Secondly, hee obserues in the partie he intends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, the most plausible matter, and selfe-pleasing apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which may make the fittest <hi>medium</hi> to mis-inferre a false conclusion for his spirituall safety: Lastly, by some flashes of his personated Angelicall light, he sets vpon it the glimmering flourish of a presumptuous impression, and so seales vp the deceiued soule, with the spirit of slumber and groundlesse security.</p>
            <p>Now the insufficient matter, rotten grounds, false <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,</hi> as we call them in the Schooles, which Satan by his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry doth cunningly and cruelly abuse, to cast many thousands into a pleasing golden dreame of imaginary spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall safetie, and Selfe-deceit; and into a fooles Paradise of a soule-coozening conclusion, are such as these:</p>
            <p>1. Measuring a mans selfe by himselfe: himselfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps formerly, grosly ignorant, and notoriously lewd: by himselfe now growne ciuill, &amp; somewhat illuminated with
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:6825:159"/>
diuine knowledge: but yet neither holy, nor euer truely humbled.</p>
            <p>2. Comparing himselfe with others, who are Satans out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious reuellers, in respect of his morall moderation, and something more ciuill carriage.</p>
            <p>3. Arguing Gods speciall loue and sauing fauour, from his outward prosperous state, and blessings in temporall things. So the fatting Oxe might thinke with himselfe, I shall surely liue; because I feed in this greene rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
            <p>4. Concluding from crosses, that hee is a <hi>sonne,</hi> and not a <hi>bastard;</hi> that he hath his punishment heere, as they say, &amp;c. whereas they are but the iust effects of Gods secret curse, blowing vpon his counsels, dealings, and vndertakings; for his couetousnesse, vnconscionablenesse, hatred to bee refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and except hee truly turne in the meane time, will prooue the very foretastes, and pieces, as it were, of hellish torments.</p>
            <p>5. Sometimes, nothing but selfeloue serues the deuils turne, to locke vp a carnall heart in this security and cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse confidence; especially in some extremely ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who easily beleeue that which they desire: and haue no other ground of their going to heauen, but because they would haue it so.</p>
            <p>6. Common conceits and corrupt Notions, compounded of grosse ignorance, and Popish folly; that a mans good meanings, and good doings, as they ignorantly speake; nay, and as some haue said, his day-labour will helpe him to heauen, and serue his turne for saluation. And if any of these sottish cauillers be questioned, &amp; challenged for the vnsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his spirituall state; he will be ready, with absurd rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and irkesome clamour, to breake out into such brags as these: What tell you mee of these high points, or trouble mee with this new learning?

            <p>7. The worke of Gods restraining Spirit: Which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by its power and terrour, keepes in, and confines a mans inward corruption, that it breakes not out into such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen outrages and outward villanies, as in some other wicked Ones: And that for the good and quiet of his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or some other secret ends seene, and seeming good to his heauenly Highnesse.

            <p>8. Education in a religious family, thus: Some in such a place, being onely outwardly warmed with the heate of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercises about them; and by custome, and for company, growne conformable to religious duties with some content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; depart thence with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Many great men, and great Schollers, more is the pitie, are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poysoned with this conceit; they are selfe conceited, that if they be zealous Patrones, and protectours of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

they are safe enough for saluation; though, alas! they be meere strangers, nay, too many times opposites to the power and practise thereof.</p>

Thus when it is many times the infirmity, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, or deformity of nature, or at best, but the naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a better complexion, that dis-inclines and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables him from the acting of some grosser euils; hee fondly conceiues, that it is the power and soueraignetie of grace, which makes the difference betwixt himselfe and other sons of Belial, who by natures impetuousnesse, are more prone and prouoked thereunto.</p>
            <p>11. The heartlesse effects of slauish feare, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will curbe some kinde of men from committing some notorious sinnes, and spurre them forward to the outward performance of some holy duties; yet they, not marking the motiues, manner, or end; nor taking to heart at all the grosse exorbitancy of any of them, but onely eying the worke wrought; may causlesly bee too well conceited of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and so coozen their owne soules. But let no true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted <hi>Nathaneel</hi> heere mistake: I know some of Gods dearest Children, who make conscience of all sinne, and to please God in all things, yet in darkenesse of their melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, or heate of temptation, may feare all is naught with them; because they feare they doe all for slauish feare. But their feares, iealousies, hearty complaints, and holy desires to the contrary, may minister comfort enough, if they will be counselled, vntill they come out of temptation.</p>
            <p>12. Euen the blessed Word of God, misunderstood, and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:6825:160"/>
wretchedly abused to the deuils aduantage, and damnation of mens soules. For instance: Some sucke poyson out of that heauenly flower, Rom. 10. 13. <hi>Whosoeuer shall call vpon the name of the Lord, shall be saued:</hi> collecting, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thence, that if they can say, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> though they bee meere strangers to the life of Grace; yet they shall liue for euer. But such should know, that euery one who in that sauing sence calleth vpon the Name of the Lord, <hi>must depart from iniquity,</hi> 2. Tim. 2. 19. and must sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly beleeue, Rom. 10. 14. Now such a fruitfull faith euer purifies the heart, Acts 15. 9. and is inseparably attended with a glorious traine of heauenly graces, <hi>vertue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godlinesse, brotherly kindnesse, charity,</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7. I haue heard with mine owne eares, that place, Rom. 12. 1. sottishly peruerted, to the maintenance of lukewarmenesse, coldnesse in Religion, and goodfellowship: When purity in heart, holinesse of life, vniuersall obedience, and other requisites to saluation haue beene pressed; it hath beene replyed in good earnest: I pray you, why are you so hote? what needs all this? what needs so much adoe, when a reasonable thing will serue the turne? Is it not said, which is your <hi>reasonable seruice?</hi> Now I often wonder what such men as these meane, who are Proctors and pleaders for this Leodicean reserued mediocritie and politike moderation in matters of heauen? what worship and seruice they would proportion out for the All-powerfull God? Doth any man of braine conceiue, that the mighty dreadfull Lord, and Iudge of all the world, who offers vnto vs by the Ministerie, in the meane time, his owne deare Sonne, with all the rich purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his hearts blood; and would giue vs the full fruition of himselfe heereafter, with all the glory and endlesse felicities aboue, will be bobd off (if I may so speake) with an heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse formall outwardnesse, with a cold rotten carkasse of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? It cannot be: He is a Spirit, and must be <hi>worshipped in Spirit and truth.</hi> If men will needs harden themselues in bitternesse and blasphemies, against the purity and power of godlinesse; if they will still browbeate and beare downe their

See Luke 13. 24. Rom. 12. 11. Eph. 5. 15. Matth. 5. 29, 30. &amp; 11. 12. 1. Cor. 9. 24. 1. Thes. 5. 22. Phil. 1. 10.</p>
            <p>13. A bare speculatiue opposition, and verball contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the corruptions of the times and controuerted cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. For I doubt there are some, who seeing some of Gods dearest Children, both godly Ministers, and other Christians, onely out of tendernesse of conscience, stand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolued about these latter; are too well perswaded of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues spiritually, for a meere boystrous masterlike parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with them in that particular; when as they haue no part at all in their holy graces and humble sanctification.</p>
            <p>14. An ouerheady furious zeale in will-worship, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious formes, and selfe-conceited seruices: As in <hi>Paul,</hi> yet vnconuerted, and many ignorant Papists, not so exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Antichristian Schoole-points: in the pursuite of some religious distempers and spirituall exorbitancies, bred onely in some phantasticall braine, giuen ouer, for hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible pride, to strong delusion; yet tendered with many holy pretences, and representations of highest perfection; nay, sometimes seconded with strange reuelations and raptures, the meere iugglings of the deuils Angelicall glory in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike, or otherwise deluded imaginations: and so Satan can put a <hi>Familist</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist</hi> euen into a trance of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary ioy.</p>
            <p>15. Serious meditation vpon that quickning passage of Christs holy Sermon, of the fewnesse of those which shall be<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 14.</note> saued, should properly and naturally keene our desires and endeauours to a singular constant contention after an holy strictnesse, forwardnesse, and fruitfulnesse in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good worke, and all the waies of God; that wee might bee sure to bee in the number of those few: yet by accident
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:6825:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it may confirme some kind of men not so notorious, vnder the meanes, yet vnconuerted, in a false perswasion of their good estate to Godward, and that thus: Some there may be of larger capacity, and more vnderstanding, who out of a contemplation of that great vniuersall deluge of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme, Paganisme, Iudaisme, and Infidelity, which at this day doth fearefully ouerflow the face of the Earth; scarce the fifth part whereof now professeth Christ: and also out of a neerer consideration of the state of Christendome, wherein Popery, that foule sinke and <hi>Hydra</hi> of all heresies; besides too many other exorbitant giddy deuiations from the sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and analogie of true Religion, and the path which is truly called Holy, mightily preuaile, and damnably empoyson in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable soules: and which is yet more, feeing so many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those who professe Christ truly, I meane, in respect of doctrine, notoriously lewd, and prophanely naught; so many Atheists, Drunkards, Scorners, Swearers, Worldlings, &amp;c. And then after this prospect and suruey abroad, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a partiall eye vpon themselues, and their owne wayes; and finding themselues in the bosome of the Church, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill men; thinke verily out of their extreme blindnesse and spirituall folly, that Heauen would be vnfurnished, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, if they should be excluded; and that it were a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the mercies of God, to ranke and arraigne them amongst Turks and Pagans at that last great Day. But if to their ciuill honesty, they adde a formall profession; why, then they thinke, they haue a great deale of wrong, if saluation be denied them: then already in conceit they knock &amp; bounce, as it were, at the Gates of heauen for entrance, with great boldnesse and confidence like the foolish Virgins, Matth. 25. 11. and <hi>those,</hi> Matth. 7. 22. and with the <hi>Pharise,</hi> giue God thanks for their good estate to Himward. Alas, poore soules! Let no man deceiue you with vaine words, neither delude your owne soules with idle fancies.

Mark. 6. 20. Luk. 13. 26. and 18. 11, 12. Matth. 12. 53. &amp; 25. 1, &amp;c. Heb. 6. 4, 5. 2. Pet. 2. 20, 22.</p>
            <p>Now these and the like, are the vnsound, seeming, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient grounds whereupon the Deuill workes; and doth easily, by the aide of naturall presumption, and his owne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall flashes, insinuate, and inferre his soule-coozening conclusions, and cunningly infuse the poyson of spirituall selfe-deceit thus, or in the like manner: (I will giue instance onely in the last; he is woont also proportionably from the rest, to conclude such groundlesse confidence, and false per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of a good estate towards God.)</p>
            <p>Whosoeuer doth with some penitent remorse tremble vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reuenging wrath of God for sin, and out of that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror confesseth and maketh restitution: (and yet so did <hi>Iudas,</hi> Mat. 27.) Whosoeuer reuerenceth a godly Minister, heares him gladly, and doth many things after his doctrine: (and yet so did <hi>Herod,</hi> Mark. 6. 20.) Whosoeuer doth hold conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in profession with the best, &amp;c. (and yet so did the foolish Virgins, Mat. 25.) Whosoeuer is an hearer of the Word, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:6825:162"/>
that with quicknesse, and receiues it with ioy: (and yet so doth the stony ground, Matth. 13. 20.) Whosoeuer is able to disclaime grosse sinnes, giues euery man his due, fasteth, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and giueth almes: (and yet so did the Pharise, Luk. 18. 11. 12. Matth. 6. 1.) Whosoeuer is illightned, tastes of the heauenly gift, &amp;c. (and yet such may afterward fall away ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerably, Heb. 6. &amp;c.) is sure enough to be saued at last.</p>
            <p>But I, may the deluded Pharise, and formall Professor say, finde and feele all, or most, or many of these in my selfe: (For what any vnregenerate man hath heretofore attained, it is not impossible, but that any now, or hereafter, may attaine the same.)</p>
            <p>Therefore doth hee conclude falsely out of Satans Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, I am safe enough for saluation.</p>
            <p>And in all this, Satan, lest hee should be wanting to his, labours by a lying resemblance, to imitate the worke of the holy Ghost, in the hearts of the faithfull. For that which the Deuill, putting on the glory of an Angell of light, puts vpon his followers in this kinde falsely and groundlessely; That the blessed Spirit performes to those, who are true of heart truely, and vpon good ground.</p>
            <p>For it is not the vniuersalitie, and excellencie of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ciuill, meerely morall, politicke, and learned endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and sufficiencies: but aboue and besides all these, a supernaturall, heauenly, and speciall worke of the Spirit, sanctifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all for Gods glorious seruice. It is not a bare taske of holy duties, religious exercises, presence at the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances outwardly performed: but the soule, as it were, of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace, animating and informing them with spirituall life, reuerent heartinesse, and fruitful improouement. It is not the glistering blaze of a visible forward profession of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but the power of godlinesse, and sincere practise of workes of iustice, mercy and truth. It is not a generall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Spirit, the Spirit onely of illumination, or lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest speculatiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehensions of sacred knowledge: but an humble, fruitfull, experimental skill, and dexterity in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Christ, and of walking humbly with our God; which
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:6825:163"/>
doth soundly comfort the heart of a man spiritually wise, about assurance of his happy estate to Godward. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true Christian, when he would refresh his spirits with the sweet contemplation of his spirituall safety, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table being in a gracious state, causeth his sincere conscience to answer in truth to such like interrogatories, as those which I haue proposed for triall in such a case, in my Discourse of true happinesse, pag. 85. &amp;c. Reuiew the place, and ponder well vpon them. He ordinarily hath recourse vnto, and runs ouer in his mind with an humble rauishing commemoration, the heauenly footsteps, and mighty works of the holy Ghost in his conuersion; speciall watchfulnesse ouer his wayes; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere-heartednesse, holy strictnesse, and sanctified singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in his conuersation; which as they are peculiar to Gods people, so are the mysteries and strange things to the best vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man; and that thus, or in the like manner:</p>
            <p>Blessed be God, saith hee within himselfe, that euer it was so, yet so it was: The holy Ministery of the Word sanctified, and guided particularly for that purpose by the finger of God, happily seized vpon mee, while I did yet abide in the armes of darkenesse, and the Deuils snares, a most polluted, carnall, abominable wretch; and effectually exercised its sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power vpon my soule, both by the workings of the Law, and of the Gospell. It was first as an hammer to my<note place="margin">Ier. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>1. It first opened the booke of my conscience, wherein I read with a most heauy heart, ready to fall asunder, euen like drops of water, for horror of the sight; the execrable abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of my youth; the innumerable swarmes of lewd and lawlesse thoughts, that all my life long had stained mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts with strange pollutions; the continuall wicked walking of my tongue; the cursed prophanation of Gods blessed Sabbaths, Sacraments, and all the meanes of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I euer meddled with. In a word, all the hels, sinkes and Sodoms of lusts and sinne, of vanities and villanies I had
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:6825:163"/>
remorselesly wallowed in euer since I was borne, I say, I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<note place="margin">Workings of the Law.</note> vpon all these engrauen by Gods angry hand vpon the face of my conscience, in bloody and burning lines. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in a second place, it opened vpon mee the Armory of Gods flaming wrath, and fiery indignations; nay, and the very mouth of hell, ready to empty themselues, and execute their vtmost vpon mine amazed, and guilty soule.</p>
            <p>In these restlesse, and raging perplexities, wherewith my poore soule was extremely scorched, and parched with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent paine; His wrath, who is <hi>a consuming fire,</hi> wringing<note place="margin">Workings of the Gospell.</note> my very heart-strings with vnspeakeable anguish; <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> blessed for euer, was lifted vp vnto me in the Gospell, as an Antitype to the erecting of the brazen Serpent in the Wildernesse. In whom dying and bleeding vpon the Crosse, I beheld an infinite treasurie of mercy and loue; a boundlesse and bottomelesse sea of tender-heartednesse, and pitie; a whole heauen of sweetnesse, peace and spirituall pleasures. Whereupon there sprung vp and was inkindled in mine heart, an extreme thirst, ardent desires, vehement longings after that soueraigne sauing blood, which alone could ease my grieued soule, and turne my foulest sinnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whitest snow. So that in the case I then was, had I had in full taste, and sole command, the pleasures, profits, ioyes and glory of many worlds, willingly would I haue parted with them all: and had I had a thousand liues, freely would I haue layd them all downe; nay, with all mine heart would I haue beene content to haue lyen for a season in the very flames of Hell, to haue had the present horrour of my confounded spirit comforted from heauen; and my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thirst allayed and a little cooled, but with one drop of Christs precious blood; the darknesse, desolations of my wofull heart refresht, and reuiued, but with the least glimpse of Gods fauourable countenance. The edge, &amp; eagernesse of which inflamed affections, made me cast about with infinite care how to compasse so deare a comfort. Then came into my minde, (the holy Spirit being my mercifull Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,) those many melting compassionate inuitations, more
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:6825:164"/>
warming, and welcome to my heauy heart, then many gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den worlds, more delicious then delight it selfe, Matth. 11. 28. Reu. 21. 6. Ioh. 7. 37. Isa. 55. 1. &amp; 57. 15, 16. Ezek. 18. 30, 31, 32. &amp; 33. 11. So that at last, O blessed worke of faith! staying my selfe, and resting my sinking soule vpon <hi>the Rocke of eternity,</hi> and the impregnable truth of these sweetest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, sealed with the blood of the Lord Iesus, and as sure as God himselfe, I threw my selfe into the mercifull and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious armes of my crucified Lord; with this resolution, and reply to all terrors and temptations to the contrary; that if I must needs be cast away, they shall teare, and rent me from the tender bowels of Gods dearest compassions, vpon which I haue cast my selfe: If they will haue me to hell, they shall pull and hale me from the bleeding wounds of my blessed Redeemer, to which my soule is fled. Whereupon I found, and felt (and I blesse God infinitely, and will through all eternity, that euer it was so,) conueied, and deriued vpon me from my blessed Iesus, the welspring of immortality and life, a quickening influence of his mighty Spirit, and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigour of sauing grace, wherby I became a new man, quite changed, new created. By this vitall moouing, and incuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it were, of the Spirit of Christ vpon the face of my soule, all things became new: mine heart, affections, thoughts, words, actions, delights, desires, sorrowes, soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, &amp;c. <hi>Old things passed away, behold, all things become new.</hi>

Not temporary only,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:6825:164"/>
such as that, Matth. 12. 43. 2. Pet. 2. 20, 22. when a man discontinues, and surceases from the outward practise, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of all grosse sinnes for a time: out of terrour; suddaine fright from some Sonne of thunder; or vpon triall, whether by his owne strength, hee be able to endure, and digest a diuorce from his darling pleasure; and the holy wayes of those who walk towards heauen, without too much discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; (for without too sore a crush to his carnall heart, hee could be content to looke after a crowne of life, and I wite him not.) Or for some other by-end. But because his heart was not honest and good, neither did the Word take an humble roote in it, nor himselfe resolue vpon a sincere, generall and constant selfe-deniall at first, hee falls againe vpon his former vomit, and againe wallowes in the myre of his sensuall pleasures, with more rage and resolution then before. 5. Nor partiall, where there may bee an outward reformation in the most things; but yet there is still retained a secret resolued reseruation of an impenitent, intire enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the delights, and full sweetnesse of the bosome sinne; which is vtterly incompatible, and cannot possibly consist with a truly religious and regenerate state. I say, my change (I onely, and infinitely magnifie, admire, and adore the free grace and loue of my most holy, and euer blessed God for it) was not onely morall, formall, mentall, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, or partiall, in the sence I haue said: but vniuersall, both in respect of the subiect and obiect, as they say; without all reseruations, exceptions, sensuall distinctions, Pharisaicall imposture, partialities, hypocrisies, selfe-delusion. For my teachers haue told me by the touchstone of his pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truth: That euery true change is of the whole man, from the whole seruice of Satan, to the liuing God, in sincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his whole Law, in the whole course of our liues. That it is discernable, and differenced from all partiall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, hollow, halfe-conuersions: By 1. Integrity of change: I meane, in all parts and powers of spirit, soule and body: in the vnderstanding, iudgement, memory, consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: in the will, affections, desires, thoughts: in the eyes,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:6825:165"/>
eares, tongue, hands, feet: for euen as they were members of the body before imployed wholly for Satan and sensualitie; so now are they also become instruments of righteousnesse vnto God. God begets no monsters, as they say: a child new-borne hath all the parts of a man, though not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his growth: So a new-borne babe in Christ is throughly, and vniuersally changed; though not yet a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man in Christ. 2. Sinceritie of change: as well in heart, and inwards parts, as in life and outward carriage. <hi>O Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 4. 14.</note> saith the Prophet, <hi>wash thine heart from wickednesse, that thou mayest be saued: how long shall thy vaine thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> No externall priuiledges of Religion, though neuer so glorious; no exactnesse of the worke wrought; no Pharisaicall formes of deuotion; no outward behauiour, be it neuer so blamelesse; no cost or contributions in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, will serue the turne, without sincerity of heart. <hi>Though a man should come before the Lord with thousands of Rammes, or tenne thousands of riuers of oyle: should be giue his first-borne for his transgression, the fruit of his body, for the sinne of his soule: should he bestow all his goods to feede the poore, and giue his body to be burned:</hi> were he able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend within his braine the whole Booke of God, and with the largenesse of his vnderstanding deuoure all that holy sence: should hee eate, and drinke vp at the Lords Table, all the sanctified Bread and Wine; were hee plunged ouer head and eares in the Water of Baptisme: nay, if it were possible, washed outwardly from top to toe in the precious blood of Christ; yet all this were more then all in vaine, and vtterly vnauaileable, without vprightnesse of the heart, and puritie in the inward parts. 3. Spirituall growth. Vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men at the best, grow but in the generalities, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, deuout representations, and temporary forwardnesse of formal Christianity. Which is like the growth of corne on the house top; or the seed springing out of the stony ground; but the honest and good heart bringeth forth fruit with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Spirituall stuntings there may bee, and standings at a stay for a time. But as good corne in a good soyle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:6825:165"/>
refreshed after a binding drought with a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d-showre, springs vp faster, and more freshly: so it is with the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Christian, after a dampe in grace; to which he may sometimes be subiect. For being rowzed and awaked out of such a state, by the quickening voice of a piercing ministery; the cutting sting of an heauy crosse, or some other speciall hand of God, he layes hold vpon the Kingdome of Christ with more holy violence then before, and labours afterward, by the helpe of God, to repaire his former spirituall decay, with double diligence in watchfulnesse, zeale, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly-mindednesse. Progresse in Christianitie is resembled to the thriuing of a Child; which may fall into sicknesse; but<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 2, 3.</note> it many times prooues a growing ague: To a man in a<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13, 14.</note> race, who may stumble, and fall; but after his rising takes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer footing, and runnes faster: To the ascending of the Sunne<note place="margin">Prou. 4. 18.</note> towards midday, which may be ouercast with a cloud; but after hee hath recouered a cleare sky, shines more brightly and sweetely. 4.

Hee that would soundly comfort his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science with the true testimony of a true Conuert, must at the first giuing his name vnto Christ, and vpon his proclaiming Warre, and entering the lists against Satan, sound with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart, the depth of that fundamentall principle of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, and Christs own holy rule: <hi>If any man shall come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 16. 24. Mar. 8. 34. Luk. 9. 23. &amp; 14. 33.</note> 
               <hi>me, let him deny himselfe, &amp;c.</hi> Assoone as hee resignes vp himselfe to this Royall seruice vnder the colours of the Lord Iesus, he must presently in our Sauiours sence, make ouer all his interest in liberty, life, liuelihood, all earthly pleasures and treasures, without any reseruation, or he will certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faint, and fall off in the day of battaile. The necessitie of this rule and resolution, is intimated vnto vs in two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, Luk. 14. 28, 31. A man that will build, must count the cost beforehand, and make sure of meanes to defray the charge. Otherwise to beginne, and not able to make an end; were but to lay a ground-worke of his disgrace and scorne, in the losse of his cost and paines. A Prince which would wisely make Warre, must first haue a true triall of his owne,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:6825:166"/>
and dexterity to discouer his enemies strength; otherwise to bid him battaile, were but to incense him more, and thrust a title into his hands, to defeate him of all hee hath. Hee that seriously sets himselfe to seeke God in truth, and to saue his soule indeed, must cast vp his reckonings before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, what will be required at his hands, and consult with his owne heart, whether willing to forgoe all such content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hopes, pleasures, preferments, worldly comforts which are incompatible with a good conscience, and the path that is called holy: and to endure all those troubles; and indignities from the angry world, which ordinarily are wont to crowne the heads of all Christs Souldiers; else most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely he will shrinke in the wetting. Hee must resolue by the inuincible noblenesse of his Christian courage, to digest the hate and opposition of dearest friends, neerest kindred; the raylings, and reproaches of men most abiect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, in respect of those whom they reuile: he must bee content to become <hi>the drunkards song,</hi> table-talk <hi>to those that</hi>

            <p>Now besides my blessed change thus qualified, and this glorious worke of the Holy Ghost vpon my soule; by the helpe of God, I haue stood at the staues end with the darling pleasure and minion delight of my former damned time euer since I was new borne: I haue euer since made conscience of all sinne, and to performe all holy duties: I haue had respect to all Gods Commandements, and all his Ordinances: I haue loued dearely my blessed Lord, and all things that belong vnto him; His Titles, Attributes, creatures, workes of Iustice and Mercy; His Word, Sacraments, Sabbaths, Ministers, Seruices, Children, Presence, Corrections, Comming: I haue since delighted in the Saints, <hi>the onely excellent Ones vpon</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 16. 3.</note> 
               <hi>earth,</hi> whom I heartily hated before: I haue dayly, with as great earnestnesse and feruency, as my poore dull heart could possibly, complained, and cryed vnto my God in Prayer
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:6825:166"/>
against mine owne sinnes, passionate distempers, rebellious risings, the malice of Satan, the allurements of the world, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the times, the cruelties of strange iniections and horrible temptations, my many and often faylings, frailties, and imperfections. Vpon due and impartiall examination, I haue happily ridde mine hands of all that consuming pelfe, which any way crept into mine estate, by wicked &amp; wrongful meanes in the dayes of mine iniquitie. (For scarce any man in the state of nature, but deales falsly in one kind or other.) I haue desired and endeauoured to adorne my profession, as well with workes of iustice, mercy, and truth, as by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of pietie: <hi>Herein I haue exercised my selfe, to haue</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 24. 16.</note> 
               <hi>alwayes a good conscience, void of offence, toward God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in all these passages and particulars, both of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion and conuersation, had I onely reposed vpon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act, and rested in the worke wrought, I had vtterly fainted, and beene quite vndone in the day of aduersitie. But truth of heart was the touchstone, and sinceritie is the sinew of all my assurance and comfort this way.</p>
            <p>I haue beene, I confesse, yet full sore against my will, and the hearty desire of my soule, haunted, and hindred in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thorow the pangs of my new birth, and managing my Christian businesses; with the violent intrusion, and insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mixture of many imperfections, distractions, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wants, weakenesses, infirmities, and faylings; priuie pride, secret hypocrisie, distrusts, and deadnesse of mine owne naughty heart. I was much wanting, by reason of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall rebellion of mine hard heart, to those workings of the Law and Gospell mentioned before. I haue come farre short of that sorrow for sinne, which I desired, and of that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindednesse in performing holy duties which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. But then I haue from time to time grieued, and groaned vnder those too many frailties and defects, as vnder an heauy burthen. I haue many a time bitterly bewailed them in secret: they haue made mee walke more humbly before my God, and towards men. I haue continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:6825:167"/>
heartily against them at the Throne of Grace. I haue sincerely desired, and endeauoured after all those meanes which might restraine and mortifie them, and made consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to discouer and decline their vnwelcome insinuations, and so I haue gone on still in the <hi>holy Path,</hi> with sincerity of heart, and in obedience vnto God; still vpholding mine heart with consideration of the sweet and mercifull disposition of my dearest heauenly Father, who euer, if the heart be vpright and truely humble, <hi>takes the will for the deed; and accepts vs</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 12.</note> 
               <hi>according to that which we haue, and not according to that which we haue not.</hi> And therefore I am most sure (neither, by the helpe of God, shall all the deuils in hell driue me from this hold) that they are all buried for euer in the righteous and meritorious blood of my blessed Sauiour. And so I hold vp my head still against all contradiction of carnall reason, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall distrust, Satans cruell suggestions; being well assured: That hearty humiliation, and grieuing vnder weakenesse in well-doing, is as true a fruit of sanctification, and marke of true conuersion; as spirituall abilitie to doe well. It is not so much the muchnesse and quantitie, as the truth of grace, not so much the exactnesse of the outward act in performing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, as sincerity of heart, which qualifies a broken hart, for comfort in the promises of life, and assurance of Gods loue. Though I know well, there was neuer any who tasted truely grace, but hee sincerely thirsted and endeauoured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more. Neuer did any man well in the worship and serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, who did not bewaile his wants and faylings therein, and truely desire and labour to doe better. It is the propertie of Pharises and formall professours, to conceiue that they are spiritually rich enough already, and haue need<note place="margin">Reuel. 3. 17.</note> of nothing: but the better the Christian is, the more sensible hee is, and heartily complaining of his spirituall pouertie, naughty heart, and manifold imperfections.</p>
            <p>Heere now then may wee see in this Discourse of the true Conuert, comforting himselfe in the point of his spirituall estate; other kind of stuffe, sincere matter, sounder grounds, more speciall workings of the holy Ghost; then any one of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:6825:167"/>
the fore-mentioned deluded Ones was euer practically and experimentally acquainted with. Neither is this all. The true Christian hath yet more noble, immediate, and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue euidences, to strengthen his heart in the assurance of Gods euerlasting loue vnto him through Christ, and present possession of his fauour. For (with submission to better iudgements, and the spirit of the Prophets) I conceiue that a sanctified man may be assured of his spirituall safety, and sound estate to Godwards diuers wayes.</p>

Hee doth not say, that we know Gods gifts; but that we know the gifts that God hath giuen vnto vs. See further to this point and purpose, 1. Ioh. 5. 13. 2. Tim. 1. 12.

For such an assurance is intimated, Psal. 22. 1. &amp; 42. 5, 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 43. 5. For instance: many a faithfull soule, making conscience of all sinne, sincerely following the best things, resolued without reseruation to doe or suffer any thing for Christ, would giue a world to be sensibly assured of Gods fauour, and fully perswaded that his sinnes were pardoned. By reason of the want of sence and feeling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hee slauishly languishes vpon the racke of tormenting feares and terrours, vtterly without all cause; neither onely so, but thereby also gratifying the deuill, dishonouring Gods free mercy; disabling himselfe for a comfortable discharge of both his callings; and that which he little thinkes on, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the sinne of not receiuing comfort, and of not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his owne proper legacie which Christ left him, Ioh. 14. 27. For in the meane time his heart doth cleaue vnto Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to the surest rocke. Hee cries, and longs after him, and would not part with him for all the world: Hee would infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely rather haue his body rent from his soule, then his soule from his Sauiour. Aske his affection and resolution this way; and for all his feares and sorrowes, he will tell you, that he will still rest and relye vpon his Lord, and euer-bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Redeemer, let him doe with him as hee please; hee will trust in him, though he kill him. Now the internall vision, consciousnesse, reflexed act, that I may speake in the phrase of the Schooles, of this sincere adherence vnto Christ, and those exceeding precious promises of life, sealed with his Blood, might, and ought to assure him of the euerlasting safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:6825:169"/>
and happinesse of his soule; and so by consequent, to comfort him infinitely more, then if hee had the Crowne of the whole worlds soueraigntie set vpon his head. Iustifying faith, which giues infallible interest to eternall life, is not (to<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 36.</note> speake properly and punctually) to be assured of pardon; but to trust wholly vpon the mercy of God through Christ, for pardon. If there arise question in thy fearefull heart about thy spirituall state; sence and feeling is no substantiall ground whereon to build, being a separable accident to the graces of saluation; but the truth and tender heartednesse of Christ, in the promises which can neuer faile, being as sure as God himselfe. If some wrangling fellow should lay claime vnto thy land, thou wouldest not in such a case and controuersie consult with an ignorant neighbour; hee perhaps out of his weakenesse and want of skill, might raise doubts and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers where there were none, and put thee into a greater fright; but thou wouldest haue recourse to some learned at the Law, who vnderstandingly searching and surueying thine Euidences, and finding no flaw, would put thee out of all feare. When in time of temptation thou art terrified and affrighted with renewed scruples and distractions about thy spirituall well-being; doe not in any wise aduise with carnall reason, which is starke blinde in the mystery of Christ; much lesse with that <hi>euill One,</hi> who is a sworne enemy to thy soule, and father of lyes. They may tell thee, thou hast no sence, no feeling, therefore all is naught: but <hi>to the Word, and to the Testimonie;</hi> let thy trembling heart cleaue to the impregnable truth of those sweetest promises; Matth. 11. 28. Reuel. 21. 6. Ioh. 7. 37. Isa. 55. 1, &amp;c. and thou art safe for euer. For a more full impression of this comfortable point, I would haue you to refresh your memories with a reuise of those foure estates of faith, which I haue heretofore distinguished, vpon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for the weakest Christians sake; and know, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexed act of the lowest degree and least measure then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, might vpon good ground, if hee doe not wilfully and wickedly refuse to be comforted, fill his fearefull spirit as full with vnspeakeable glorious ioy, as the Sunne is of light,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:6825:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the sea of waters. These things laid together and well weighed, may confect a precious and soueraigne Antidote, against the slauish terrours, causelesse feares, and heauy wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of many which are true of heart, distressed in conscience about their spirituall state: who while they labour, and long with insatiable greedinesse (and I blame them not) for a sensible assurance, and feeling apprehension of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; doe too much neglect and disregard that comfort which their faith might affoord them vpon good ground, in that, notwithstanding their present distracting amazements and perplexity of spirit, they are able still to commit their soules vnto Christ, as a faithfull Redeemer, and their <hi>euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this point, I haue let some passages fall by the way, which may serue to discouer and dissolue the vanity and weakenesse of that <hi>Dilemma,</hi> wherein <hi>Bellarmine</hi> playes the wilfull egregious Sophister: it runs thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Protestants teach,</hi> saith he, <hi>that a man is iustified by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bell. de notis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae, cap. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sect. Sectarij no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri temporis.]</note> 
               <hi>faith, whereby he perswadeth himselfe, that he is iust.</hi> Now then he reasoneth thus: <hi>When I begin to beleeue that I am iust, I am either iust or vniust. If iust, then I am not iustified by faith, by which I beleeue my selfe to bee iust, because this faith is after my iustification. If vniust, then this faith is false, and so a man should be iustified by a lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this horned Argument wee answer thus: There are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry acts of speciall faith: for my purpose at this time, take notice of two.</p>
            <p>1. A fiduciall assent, resting vpon the merit of Christ, an affiance, dependance, adherence, reliance, or if there bee any other word expressing that act of an humbled soule, whereby it casteth and reposeth it selfe onely vpon Gods promise in Christ, for the obtaining of remission of sinnes, and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life. In this act, the poore soule illightened and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with sight and sence of its sinne and misery, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an infinite impossibility of satisfying God for the one, or freeing it selfe from the other, by any meanes or merit in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or earth; but onely by the propitiatory mediation of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:6825:170"/>
Iesus Christ: it throwes it selfe into his armes, grasping fast about him, hides it selfe in the clifts of this Rocke, from the stormes of Gods fiercest and fiery indignation, apprehends in him plentifull redemption, and all-sufficiencie of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore plyes him with strong cryes and teares for mercy; bespeakes him in all termes of confidence and affiance: <hi>My Lord, and my God, my hope, my fortresse, my rocke, my strength, my saluation;</hi> saue me, or I sinke; hold mee fast, or I am lost for euer. You may see sometimes a little infant, vpon apprehension and approach of some sudden danger, how heartily and hastily it runnes into the mothers armes for succour and safety: euen so a truely wounded soule, pursued by the terrours of the Law, and frighted with the dreadfull sight of Gods frowning countenance, flyes with speed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bosome of its blessed Redeemer, clings inseparably vnto his bleeding wounds for euerlasting protection; and there rests vpon the freenesse of his Loue, merit of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and truth of his Promise, as vpon a Rocke of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, neuer to bee remooued: not the concurrent rage of all the Deuils in hell, or powers of darknesse, being euer able to make a diuorce. By this act wee are accepted for iust before the Throne of Grace, for Christs sake and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>2. An act of certification, which quickned by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, when God pleaseth for his own glory and good of his Child, reflecteth vpon the soule with a comfortable assurance that we are already in the armes of Christ, and His for euer. The least glimpse whereof, a true heart would not exchange for all the Kingdomes vpon earth. The first act makes vs iust: The second findes vs iust; and so certifies truely; not by a lye, as lying companions, and Satans Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters calumniate. It is the saying of an excellent Diuine, both for depth of learning and height of Holinesse, <hi>To beleeue</hi>

               <hi>that my sinnes are now pardoned, and that I am saued: this is not the first act of faith, but followes when now a man doth see himselfe to be iustified in Christ.</hi>

            <p>By the certainty of internall vision, whereby we as cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see our faith, as our <hi>life, will, thought, knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the forecited place of <hi>Austin.</hi> In his opinion, I say, Faith is as visible to the internall eye of a sanctified mind, as is a mans life and will: Nay, &amp; we are woont to discerne with a more eager eye and obseruation a Stranger, then an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Domestick.

It is proportionably so in this present point; I meane, betweene my regenerate illight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conscience and Satan. Nay, in this case, should all the Deuils in Hell sweare the contrary, did carnall reason, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall distrust, or any other aduersary power cauill and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict with neuer such irksome tediousnesse; yet by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, I will not withstand that heauenly light standing in my conscience like an armed man: <hi>I will neuer take away mine innocency from my selfe, vntill I die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how do you know, that you truly beleeue? We may know, perhaps, that we haue some kind of faith, but not that we haue the true liuely faith, which will serue the turne for saluation.</p>
            <p>I answer: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids vs try, and prooue our selues whether we haue that Faith, by which Christ dwelleth in our

hearts, which is the faith of such as are accepted with God, 2. Cor. 13. 5. Now it were strange, if the blessed Spirit should bid vs examine and search for that, which could not possibly be found out.</p>
            <p>Againe, if a man cannot be certaine, that he beleeues with all his heart, that is, truly and sincerely; <hi>Philips</hi> interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> Act. 8. 37. had beene in vaine, and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs reply rash and vnaduised.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> So thousands amongst vs, by the false spectacles of presumption, making the bridge of Gods mercy broader then it is, and larger then his truth, which confines it onely to broken hearts; are wofully deluded, and ready euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be drowned in the dungeon of fire and brimstone: must therefore those few who are sincerely humbled for their sinnes, truly beleeue, and vpon good ground haue part in it, be also deceiued? Because mad men, and men asleepe, know not well that they are asleepe, and rage; must therefore men truly waking, and wise, not know certainely they are awake, and in their wits? The common people generally conceiue of the Sunnes magnitude, that it is not past a foote round; must therefore the certainetie of knowledge, that it is many times bigger then the Earth, be denied to the skilfull Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer? Some men dreame that they are rich, tumble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues amongst their golden heapes, and it is not so indeed when they awake; doth no man therefore certainely know whether he be rich or no?</p>

            <p>But there may be in the hypocrite, an exact outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and obedience:</p>
            <p>I answer: true it is, that for the outside and carkasse, as it were, the workes of vnsactified men, may be like to those of the godly, but they are without the soule, life and spirit; which is in the worke of a true beleeuer; to which he is no lesse priuy in his heart, then to the outward worke which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth thorow his hands.

Mighty and remarkeable was the worke of the Spirit this way vpon the heart of that Noble Martyr, <hi>Robert Glouer,</hi> vpon the first sight and representation of the Stake (so sweetely seasonable is God in all his refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.) For two or three dayes before his death, hee was full heauily oppressed with the spirituall miseries of a dead heart, and spirituall desertion. In which time no doubt hee cried mightily vnto God, and often reflected the eye of his renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conscience vpon a truly, beleeuing, penitent, humble, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heauenly heart; resolued to sacrifice its warmest blood in the mercilesse fire, for the testimony of <hi>Iesus;</hi> and yet no comfort would come. But in the very nicke and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full time, as you may see in the Story, the blessed Spirit did suddenly shine into his darke and desolate soule, with the glorious beames of his owne immediate comfort, and so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly filled it with such ouerflowing Riuers of spirituall ioyes, that no doubt they mightily abated and quencht the rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fury of those Popish flames, wherein hee sweetely fell asleepe. It was a speciall and immediate springing of the holy Ghost in his heart, which made Master <hi>Peacock,</hi> after many dayes of extremest horrour, professe, that <hi>The ioy which be felt in his conscience, was incredible.</hi> We feele and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by daily experience, that Satan doth immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; and shall not the <hi>blessed Spirit,</hi> after his holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly manner, immediately also suggest sometimes?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> To let passe at this time, that which some worthy Diuines presse in this poynt, that such places as these, Psalm. 103. 3. Esa. 43. 32. Rom. 10. 9. Gal. 2. 20. &amp;c. intimate and imply such a particular proposition immediately: I answer that it is deduced by euident consequence out of the Word. For from such generall promises and propositions as these; <hi>He that beleeueth on the Sonne, hath euerlasting life,</hi> Ioh. 3. 36. <hi>Whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes,</hi> Act. 10. 43. <hi>And by him all that beleeue, are iustified from all things, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 13. 39, &amp;c. follow by good consequence, these particulars: <hi>Paul, Peter, Luther, Caluin, Beza, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> or any other particular man beleeuing in him, receiues remission of sinnes; is iustified; hath eternall life. Euen as it followeth directly and infallibly, euery man is a reasonable creature; therefore <hi>Iohn, Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. is endewed with reason.</p>
            <p>Though no word saith expressely and immediately; Thou <hi>Thomas</hi> beleeuing, shalt be saued; yet the same word which saith, Euery one beleeuing, hath eternall life, saith also; Thou <hi>Thomas</hi> beleeuing, hast eternall life, or shalt be saued. As on the contrary, this vniuersall, <hi>He that beleeueth not the Sonne,</hi>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:6825:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> includeth vertually, consequently, infallibly, as though they were writ in it, these particulars: <hi>Iudas, Bellarmine,</hi> or <hi>Bonner,</hi> &amp;c. not beleeuing, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. Otherwise, if the generall did not thus sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and comprehend euery particular; and an vniuersall proposition all subordinate singular propositions vnder it; the Law, <hi>Thou shalt not kill: thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not beare false witnesse against thy neighbour;</hi> would not belong to <hi>Faux</hi> blowing vp the Parliament: to this or that Priest polluting himselfe in hearing confession; to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> lying voluminously; because its no where expressely writ; Thou <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shalt not beare false witnesse against thy neighbour. Thou shaueling, beware of selfe pollution. Thou <hi>Faux</hi> shalt not teare in pieces the Royall limbs of the Lords Anointed.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Thomas</hi> beleeuing, be not bound to be assured of his saluation out of the generall promise; except it were said somewhere in Scripture; That <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> by name should be saued; it would follow that these particular men, were not bound to be honest men; or to feare God; because it is no where said in the Word; that <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> ought to be honest men; or are commanded to feare God, but onely in the generall.</p>
            <p>In a word, let the Iesuite tell mee, whether out of the Word, he be infallibly certaine that his body shall rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at the last Day: He dare not for his heart deny it. And I pray you, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> tell me, where it is particularly and expressely said in Scripture; That the body of <hi>Robert Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> shall rise againe at the last Day? All particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible assurance in this kinde, springs out of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall proposition and promise that <hi>All shall rise,</hi> 1. Cor. 15, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. That heart which doth sweetly enioy the Paradise of a true testimony, and well grounded perswasion; that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently liues the life of grace, and immortality; is sincerely affected and inflamed with a reuerent loue, and insatiable

dayes of humiliation, bookes of best rellish to a spirituall taste, &amp;c. But now on the contrary side, his presumptuous confidence and groundlesse conceit, lyes in the Pharises bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some with much quietnesse and security; without doubting, difficulty, contradiction, or any such adoe. The reason is, his carnall heart is well enough content, and meddles not, because it still feedes vpon the delights of his darling sinne, without disturbance. Satan is too subtill to interpose, tempt or interrupt, in such a case. For he well knoweth that his foundation is falsehood, his hope of heauen but a golden dreame; and therefore in policy he holds his peace, that hee may hold him the faster.</p>
            <p>Take notice by the way; that, that very thing which makes many a truehearted Christian to doubt of himselfe, and of the soundnesse of his spirituall state, should put him out of all doubt; euen often exercise with doubts, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, multiplyed attempts against his faith, and assurance of Gods loue; prayed against, humbly resisted, and opposed with cleauing vnto the tenderheartednes of Christ, &amp; truth of his promises, though for the present he hath little or no feeling; no such ioy and peace in so beleeuing: And that very thing vpon which the deluded Ones doe build, and many times boast themselues; to wit, that they are vntroubled, vntempted, in point of faith, and pretended assurance; may returne an infallible remonstrance to their own consciences, that they are certainely deceiued. For doubtlesse, that faith which is neuer assaulted with doubting, is but a fancy. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly that assurance which is euer secure, is but a dreame. Many a Pharise stands by the bedside of the sincere Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, visited with affliction of conscience, and many heauy temptations; secretly and sinfully pleasing himselfe in the vnblessed calmenesse of a groundlesse confidence, and in his freedome from such terrors and spirituall troubles: when as himselfe is like an Oxe fatting in the greene pastures of impunity and outward prosperity for the day of slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But the afflicted party is as precious gold, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Lords refining furnace, that hee may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

            <p>4.

The testimony of the Spirit is euer attended with the Spirit of prayer. That glorious glimpse shining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soule, and assuring it of saluation, is so sweete, so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, so rauishing; so transcendent and incomparably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all earthly ioy, that it warmes the spirit of a man with quickning life &amp; liberty, to powre out it selfe in the presence of his Lord and his God, before the Throne of Grace: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in more hearty triumphant, and as it were, winged prayers: at other times, in those which are more faint and cold, yet edged with infinite desires, that they were more feruent, and therefore by the way, as it were, mingled and perfumed with the soueraigne &amp; satisfactory incense in the<note place="margin">Reuel. 3. 4.</note> Golden Censer, which the Angell of the Couenant holds in his hand, are graciously accepted of him, which by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and title of highest honour, is stiled the <hi>Hearer of</hi>

But now on the other side; euery deluded Pharise is a meere stranger to the power of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. His presumption and groundlesse confidence, is but a weede which will grow of its owne accord; and therefore is not sensible of any necessity, neither feeles any want of constant prayer from a broken heart; vniuersall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or the holy precisenesse of the Saints to support it.</p>
            <p>5 An assurance of Gods Loue vpon sure ground, doth mightily quicken, keene, and spurre forward the ingenuous Christian to more holinesse, hatred of sinne, resolution in

            <p>6. The blessed Spirit is woont to spring in our hearts, with heauenly refreshing, and his sweetest testimonie; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at such times as these: When wee retire and recollect our selues to conuerse with God in a more solemne and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary manner; opening our consciences, breaking our hearts, and powring out our soules into his bosome: when wee are preparedly and fruitfully exercised in the ordinances: in our innocent patient sufferings, for good causes and conscience sake: when we feele that wee haue conquered or well curbed some corruption, by the power of Prayer; in the beleeuing contemplation and reuise of our change, and the infallible markes thereof: when we meditate effectually vpon the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse depth of Gods free loue vnto vs, with which hee hath loued vs <hi>from euerlasting to euerlasting:</hi> vpon dayes of humiliation, &amp;c. But that other counterfeit flash keepes a deluded Pharise in a fooles Paradise continually; he is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:6825:178"/>
at all times alike peremptory in the point of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. You shall not take him any weeke in the yeere, any day in the weeke, any houre in the day, without a bold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, and protestation, if neede be, That he hopes to bee saued as well as the precisest. Hee is as confident this way, when he is cauilling against the purity of the Saints and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlinesse; as when he is the deepest in his Pharisaicall deuotions.</p>
            <p>7. The presumption of the Pharise is ordinarily at the height, in his height of outward prosperity; and when Gods Candle shineth faireliest vpon his head with worldly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. But the perswasion of the Christian, is for the most part then strongest, when the world most frowneth vpon him for his forwardnesse; and in heate of persecution.</p>
            <p>8. Those that are deluded with a groundlesse confidence, haue ordinarily beene so conceited of themselues, euer since they may remember, or had any thoughts of heauen; and that without consciousnesse of any conuersion, change, or supernaturall sauing worke vpon their soules at all. For though the deuill seales it with more security vpon their hearts, by his counterfeit Angelicall glory; yet hee findes matter enough in our corrupt nature, ministred originally for such a golden dreame, and imaginary castle in the aire. But the testimony of the Spirit, and that other true perswasion is supernaturall, and neuer felt before conuersion; nor euer to be found but in a regenerate soule. I doubt not, but many Christians to their singular comfort &amp; further assurance, can tell their experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of both: Their bold peremptory ill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded presumption in their vnregenerate time: and their now true, kindly, sweet perswasion, so much enuied and assaulted by Satan accompanying their conuersion.</p>
            <p>9. Naturall presumption, guilded ouer with the deuils delusion, euer shrinkes in the wetting. Troubles of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, fiery tryals, heauy crosses, the face of the Prince of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, disastrous and dismall times, dissolue it into nothing. But the oher true testimony holds out like armour of proofe, against thickest haileshot of all aduersary power: Nay, it is
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6825:178"/>
woont to shine and shew it selfe with vnited vigor and more lightsomnesse within; in the greatest dampe of outward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts, and most confusions abroad.</p>
            <p>10. The Christian can giue sound reasons for his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the point of assurance; from his conuersion, holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, loue of the brethren, vniuersal obedience, &amp;c. those meanes I mentioned before proper to the Child of God. But put the Pharise to prooue in this case, and perhaps hee will not bee able to say so much as his formall deluded brother, Luk. 18. 11, 12. Sure I am, all that hee can produce for that purpose, being tryed by the Touchstone of Gods Truth, will prooue too light and inconsequent. Reuise the false <hi>mediums</hi> and insufficient grounds discouered before, and you shall perceiue, that none of them can possibly inferre a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conclusion.</p>
            <p>11. The <hi>Laodicean</hi> longs farre more for gold, then growth in grace; thinkes himselfe already rich enough in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that he hath attained that very temper which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise man should rest vpon, without any more medling; that if hee should stirre forward, he should be too precise; if he should grow any worse, he should be too prophane; and therefore concludes, <hi>I haue need of nothing.</hi> But the illighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christian, hauing truely tasted of the assurance of Gods loue; is infinitely greedy of growing in grace, of conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring corruptions, of neerer communion with his <hi>Christ,</hi> of doing his God all the most glorious sincere seruice hee can possibly, before hee goe downe into the pit, and be seene no more. His performances, by the grace of God, are many, his endeauours moe, but his desires endlesse, and euer <note n="a" place="margin">Semper tibi dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliceas quod es, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thus hauing premised a discouery of spiritual self-deceit, whereby many so ouervalew themselues, in point of their spiritual estate, that they conceiue they are very right, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth and tryall, they are starke rotten at the root: Their case herein, is like that mans, who lying fast asleepe vpon the edge of a steepe Rocke, dreames merrily of Crownes,

Kingdomes, and the very confluence of all earthly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; conceiuing that hee wallowes himselfe in the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of all worldly felicities; but vpon the sudden star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for ioy, breakes his necke, and tumbles into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Sea. They are lulled asleepe by the deluding charmes of the Deuill, vpon their beds of presumptuous se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, all their life long, dreaming of no danger at all, but euer confident their case is good enough to God-ward: but their consciences being awaked vpon their beds of death, or at farthest, at Gods Tribunall, they are suddenly swallowed vp of despaire, and drowned in euerlasting perdition. I come now to forewarne and forearme the true Christian, that with all watchfulnesse and constancie, hee would euer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to preuent and defeate the secret assaults and insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that white Deuill, as a worthy Diuine calls it, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall pride. A guilded poyson, which Satan, that cunning <hi>Alchymist</hi> and hellish Spider, doth first extract out of the very sweetest and fairest flowers in <hi>Christs</hi> Garden; I meane, the most holy vertues and heauenly gifts emplanted in his Childrens hearts; and then thereby so enuenomes and blasts them, that they lose not onely their owne natiue splendour and gracefulnesse, but also their fruitfull communication to others, and comfortable acceptation with God. I say, when he sees a man extraordinarily enriched with spirituall graces, hee seekes might and maine to make him swell with priuy pride; and to puffe him vp with an ouerweening conceit of his owne worth; that so the Christian himselfe may want the comfort of them; his brethren, the fruit of them; and God, the glory of them. When the strong man can no longer keepe goodnesse out of the soule, but the holy Ghost with a mercifull violence breakes in vpon him and dwels there; his next endeauour is, to abuse euen Grace it selfe, as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy instrument, to weaken and wound it selfe: nay, so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till is he, and endlesse in his attempts, that if he cannot make a man proud of any thing else, hee will labour to make him<note place="margin">Saepè homo de ipso vanae gloriae contemptu vaniùs gloriatur. <hi>August.

in the sanctified soule, I haue discouered in my <hi>Discourse of true happinesse, page</hi> 25. and there made tender of some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosiues and counterpoysons against it. To which at this time I adde these:</p>
            <p>When thou beginnest with an ouerweening conceit to admire thy selfe immoderately &amp; aboue that which is meet, cast thine eye,</p>
            <p>1. Vpon the purity and piercing of Gods all-seeing Eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ten thousand times brighter then the Sunne, and purer then purity it selfe; which sees sinne to be infinitely more sinfull and loathsome then thou canst possibly: whereby His holy Iustice is incensed with infinite indignation, and vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able seueritie against it. Witnesse the turning into Deuils, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable destruction, and euerlasting downefall of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glorious creatures, the top and masterpiece, as it were, of all Gods handyworke, shining once so fairely in the highest heauen, and neerest vnto his Emperiall Throne: The curse which fell vpon <hi>Adam</hi> and all his posterity, for eating the forbidden fruit: The confusions which came vpon the first world by the flood: The burning of Sodom with fire and brimstone from heauen; The fearefull reiection of his owne ancient people: The horrours of a guilty enraged consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is a hell vpon earth, and damnation aboue ground: The euerlasting fire which is prepared for repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate men and angels, &amp;c. Neither doth this brightest Eye onely see all thy sinnes in their natiue foulenesse, but also in their truest number. Thou perhaps, for want of more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eye-salue, beholdest them but as starres in a gloomie euening: but assure thy selfe He sees them, as moates in the Sunne, and as Starres in the clearest winters midnight. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes, this mortifying meditation should rather make thee grow into further detestation of sinne, then admiration of thy selfe.</p>
            <p>2. Vpon the incomprehensible perfections and absolute purenesse of Gods most holy nature: the splendour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth dazle the clearest eyes of the brightest Seraphims;<note place="margin">Isa. 6. 2.</note> doth drowne, as it were, all Angelicall glory; as the Sunnes

Were the Sunne which is made all of brightnesse, and the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>springing fountaine of fresh shining beames, presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that vnapproachable Light which besets Gods sacred Throne; it would vanish away, as a darkesome moate and lumpe of vanity. Where then would a fraile sinfull man in a house of flesh appeare? <hi>Behold,</hi> saith <hi>Iob, hee put no trust in his seruants; and his Angels hee charged with folly: how much lesse on them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the Moth,</hi> chap. 4. 18, 19. <hi>Behold, he putteth no trust in his Saints; yea, the heauens are not cleare in his sight: how much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquitie like water?</hi> chap. 15. 15, 16. <hi>Behold euen to the Moone, and it shineth not, yea, the starres are not pure in his sight: how much lesse man, that is a Worme: and the sonne of man which is a Worme?</hi> chap. 25. 5, 6.

            <p>3. Vpon the cleere Cristall of Gods pure Law, which can discouer vnto thee the least spot that euer stained so much as any one of thy thoughts; shines with that perfect light, that it would guide aright euery step which thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest in the <hi>way</hi> which is <hi>called Holy,</hi> and is of that latitude for prohibition of sinne, and leading to purity and exact pleasing of God: that though <hi>wee may see an end of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>

Onely I aduise, when thou setst thy selfe thus solemnely to rip vp thy conscience, and ransacke thy heart to the roote, to bring it downe and into the dust, for increase of humiliation and lowlinesse in thine owne eyes: as thou holdest out in the one hand the cleare Cristall of Gods pure Law, to discouer the crookednesse of thy vile naturall disposition, the villanies and skarlet abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of thine vnregenerate time, the daily spots &amp; staines which light vpon thy soule, &amp;c. hold out also in the other hand, or rather lay hold vpon Christ Iesus by the hand of faith, hanging, bleeding, and dying vpon the Crosse, for

Keepe in a readinesse, and in fresh remembrance such considerations and cooling cards, as it were, as these; when thy heart begins to swell vaine-gloriously: That thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thine hand in that fire-worke, which blew vp all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; I meane, in <hi>Adams</hi> transgression, that brought forth such a bloody sea of sinne and sorrow into the World; such a world of miseries and mischiefes vpon all the sonnes and daughters of <hi>Adam;</hi> all tortures vpon earth, and torments in Hell thorow all eternity: That thou camest into this world,

a sinke, a Sodom, a very hell of all filth and impuritie; of all corruption and crookednesse, euen a little Deuill for darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and damnation: That thou wofully lost and mis-spentst many yeeres, perhaps the best of thy time, strength of youth, flowre of thy age in Satans seruice, and vpon thy owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable lusts: That now vpon thy conuersion, the meere worke of Gods free grace, thou being honored with part in Christs Passion, with the presence of the blessed Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in thee, with the highest aduancement of being Gods Fauourite, <hi>the dearely beloued of his soule;</hi> yet the best Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath<note place="margin">Ier. 12. 7.</note> that thou passest ouer, the holyest duty that thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formest, is distained and distempered with so many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, distractions, frailties, and failings: That while thou yet inhabitest a house of flesh, thou hast inherent in thy bowels, secret seeds, and inbred inclinations to all sinne, (Blesse the sanctifying Spirit for thy priuiledge and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation) euen to Atheisme, selfe-murder, Sodomy, despairing of Gods mercy, familiarity with wicked spirits, sinne against the Holy Ghost, &amp;c. That whereas thousands about thee goe on in their sinnes, and perish euerlastingly, thy selfe, it may bee, before thy change worse then most of them; yet now beeing sanctified, thou mayest bee assured, thy name was writ in Heauen, from all eternitie; and therefore from euerlasting thou layest in the bosome of Gods loue, and from the same euerlasting had the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> set apart to shead his blood in the fulnesse of time, for the saluation of thy soule; and haue patience but a little, and euerlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing shall come from the presence of the Lord: thou shalt shine as the brightnesse of the firmament for euer and euer. And in all this <hi>who made thee to differ?</hi> Thou wast framed of the same mould, made, as it were, of the same cloth, onely the sheeres going betweene, with those that perish: It was onely Gods free grace, the <hi>good pleasure of his will.</hi> These and the like considerations layde toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, should infinitely rather mooue thee with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reuerence to adore the bottomlesse depth of Gods free loue vnto thee; then conceitedly to magnifie thy selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

thy brethren, or proudly insult ouer those <hi>that are without;</hi> to praise thy God with a neuer satisfied admiration of his vnconceiueable bounty, then to plague thy soule, and, as it were, empoyson thy graces with an humour of pride.</p>
            <p>6. Thou must shortly bee strictly accountable at the iust Tribunall of God, for the vse and imployment of all the good things hee hath giuen vnto thee; of thy life and euery moment of it; of thy goods and euery farthing of them; of euery word thou euer spokest; of euery thought that euer sprung out of thy heart; of euery Sermon thou euer heardst; of euery Sabbath thou hast solemnized; of euery line thou hast writ; of euery glance of thine eye; of euery iourney thou hast made, &amp;c. of thy wit, memory, learning; of thy strength, courage, credit; of thine honour, power, and high place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In a word, of euery benefit or any good thing in any kinde thou euer receiuedst from the bountifull and blessed hand of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. And the moe and more excellent and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary endowments, and gracious indulgences haue beene vouchsafed thee from the euer-springing Fountaine of all good; the more exactly must thou bee answerable, and in proportion accountable for more. Wherefore, sith the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of saluation incomparably excell and outshine all other humane abilities; all excellencies of nature, art, policie, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or what else can bee named admirable in the eyes of men; God lookes that wee should keepe those heauenly Iewels especially, orient, bright and shining; communicate them most frankely and abundantly to our brethren; and with all watchfulnesse and wisdome vpon all opportunities, imploy them to our Masters greatest and most glorious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. Now there is nothing more hinders the fruitfull improouement of them then Pride: Nothing makes them more passable and profitable then Humility. A proud man puft vp with an opinion of his good parts, doth ordinarily, out of an itching ambitious humour, single out such seasons for discouerie of himselfe, and ostentation of his gifts; when hee may winne most applause from men, and shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:6825:182"/>
vaine-gloriously; and thereupon is more rare, dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and reserued in exercising his talent. But a downeright humble Christian is in this kinde vnreseruedly and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently for all places, times, and persons; where, and when he may bring glory vnto God, good vnto others, comfort to his owne soule in discharging a good conscience. He dares not for his heart, either out of humour, or for feare he should make himselfe too cheape, as they say, or any other vaine respect, conceale any thing in his heart or braine, were it the highest straine of his heauenly skill, or any experimentall secret in the <hi>mysterie of Christ,</hi> from the meanest Christian, could hee wisely and seasonably thereby doe him any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good. Let vs therefore infinitely abhorre, by filthy vaine-glory, to staine the glory, and blast the fruitfulnesse of our graces; but rather with all humilitie and watchfulnesse obserue and apprehend all the wayes, occasions and callings, whereby wee may glorifie God most with them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue them best for our Lords aduantage; that so we may giue vp our account at the great and vniuersall Audite, with more fauour, and enter more comfortably into our Masters ioy.</p>
            <p>7. Let the feare and foresight of the many fearefull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and much ill that certainely followes, and is euer found where this white Diuell, spirituall pride, haunts, hunt it out of thy heart, and keepe a continuall narrow watch against all its slie insinuations. Besides that it plagues the soule that harbours it, with many spirituall miseries, distempers, disac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God (for Hee is euer most familiar with those who are most humble) Pharisaicall swellings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations of furious zeale, and the like; it euer prooues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of pestilent consequence and preiudice to the common state of goodnesse, to the honour and acceptation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie. 1. A truely proud professour, puffed vp with his gifts and supposed sufficiencies; which wickedly aimes more at vaineglory, then glorifying God; at his owne praise, then profiting others, is for the most part very irkesome, tedious and burdensome to the company of humble, wise, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:6825:183"/>
Christians. For ordinarily hee is ouertalkatiue, swift to speake, and too full of words; farre more forward to ouer-rule and domineere, in opposing, moderating, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, then <hi>seuen men that can render a reason.</hi> An itching hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour after applause, and of carrying away the credit, for abilitie to discourse, and eminencie aboue others, puts him on too often to powre out himselfe indiscreetly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently in all companies, to presse and obtrude vpon others with much verball importunitie, and vnconquerable stifnesse, his master-like conceits, without due respect or sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable obseruation of the humble abilities and sufficiencies of by-standers, &amp; that many times when he hath neither cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, fitnes, efficacy of matter, or power of the <hi>holy Ghost.</hi> And if a man doe not presently vpon the bare and first proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, accord and accommodate his iudgement to euery cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of whatsoeuer he holds, and square exactly to his Oracles; hee begins to shake the head as though hee were a lost man, and is ready, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> to excommunicate him out of his conscience. I speake not thus, to stop the current of comfortable talk, edifying discourse, and fruitful conference, in any true-hearted <hi>Nathaneels.</hi> There is infinitely more need to stirre them vp, and quicken them to more forwardnesse and foorth-putting this way at Christian meetings: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to intimate the vaine-glorious, empty, opinionatiue tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katiuenesse of such as are possessed with this white Diuell. 2. Such an One also is woont to be too austere, censorious, sowre, and imperious in his cariage towards those which are without; whereby he becommeth; both a stumbling blocke to them in their way to Christianity; and brings also an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, scandalous, false aspersion vpon the wayes of God, and yoke of Christ, as though they were harsh, heauy, and vnpleasant; when as they are most sweet, easie and amiable. I know full well, there is not the wisest, holiest, humblest, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetest Christian aliue, can so possibly beare and behaue himselfe; but prophanenesse will plague him with slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous imputations of any kinde. Iesus Christ our Master was not free this way; which of his seruants then can, dare, or
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:6825:183"/>
will expect and desire exemption? Blessed bee God, that our good names are oyled, so that the inke will not sticke which is cast vpon them. There is scarce a religious Professor, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of resolution and spirit to bee found, but some men of the world will charge him with surlinesse and pride. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many times, not only the imputation is misgrounded, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, misse-imputed, fastened vpon him for the most part, by reason of his 1. inconformity to the courses of the world, and corruptions of the times, 2. vnsociablenesse with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane men, 3. resolution and vndauntednesse in good causes, 4. innocency and independency, which beget boldnesse and brauenesse of minde, &amp;c. but also those fellowes themselues, who so slander him; because their consciences were neuer illightened with sight, sence, and acknowledgement of the foulenesse of sinne, their own vilenesse, the exactnesse of Gods Law, purity of his most holy Nature, seueritie and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his Iudgements; cannot possibly chuse but be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly proud. Yet for all this, I would aduise all those who haue in earnest giuen their names to <hi>Christ;</hi> that they would walke warily, and so demeane themselues, that they giue no iust offence in this kinde. For when they haue tryed both wayes, they shall finde, that mercifulnesse and meekenesse to those which are without; humilitie and humanitie; affable, courteous, and louing deportment; and so becomming <hi>all</hi>

God in his iust iudgement giues ouer such an<note place="margin">The euer-good conceit, and selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening opinion, man hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, is the Nurse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother of the falsest opinions, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and particular.</note> One sometimes to santasticall opinions, odde and absurd te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, swaruing brainelessely and senselessely from the holy harmony of confessions, and our blessed pure Orthodoxe Articles of Religion; the truth whereof, euery honest Man, if need required, ought to seale with his bloud: which when superficialnesse, and its ordinary consort, selfeconceitednesse,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:6825:184"/>
haue vnhappily brought forth, by the midwifery of a kind of spirituall wantonnesse; be they neuer so monstrous and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen, yet some giddy heads will hearken and hanker after them; so that many times many weake, vngrounded, vnsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble young beginners in Profession, are limed, and wofully entangled, as wee see too often in our chiefest Citie, whence ensues an incredible deale of preiudice, hurt and hindrance, euen to the common state of goodnesse; to the honour and acceptation of Christianitie. For thereupon is raised a cry in all conuenticles of good fellowship, and consistories of worldly wisdome: That these forward professours will all turne phantasticall, Familists, Anabaptists, Arrians, any thing. Which cry awakes the eye of State-iealousie; and so by an vnworthy consequent, drawes vpon those who are true of heart, euen Gods best seruants, and the Kings best sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, discountenance, suspicions, if not molestations; vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily, causelesly. For so might yee roote vp your Rose-trees, because a worme sometimes breeds in the sweetest bud. So might yee extinguish Monarchies from the face of the earth, because they sometimes degenerate into tyrannies. So might yee conceiue ill of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, because <hi>Iudas</hi> prooued naught, &amp;c. 2. Sometime hee suffers him to fall into some grosse sinne, in the face of the World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the watchfull eye of scornefull enemies; the infamy and scandall whereof, being once on wing, flye abroad as swift as the Eagles of the Heauens, ouer a whole Countrey, ouer a Kingdome; the Deuils and their drunken trumpetters are speedy Dromedaries to carry such newes: and this concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cry resounds from all places with much wicked triumph and insultation: <hi>You see now what these professors are;</hi> One so famous for his forwardnesse, is fallen into such a grosse sinne, and so notoriously; <hi>They are euen all alike,</hi> &amp;c. Which by accident, and in the euent redounds too often, to the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piable disgrace of our holy profession, the strengthening of the stubborne, the staggering of the strong, the stunting of those which are comming on, the hindering of the weake, the hardning of the wicked, the chaining of the scorner, farre

            <p>I conclude the whole point, and a good part of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the words of an excellent Writer, not much altered.

Yet all humane affections and endowments, wherein due reuerence to God is wanting, are no better then obscure clouds, hindring the influence of that blessed Light, which clarifies the soule of man, and predisposeth it vnto the brightnesse of eternall felicitie. So that insolent ioy and ouerweening which a man in the pride of his vaine imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conceiueth of his owne worth, doth aboue all other passions blast our minds, as it were, with lightning, and make vs reflect our thoughts vpon our owne seeming inherent goodnesse; forgetting the whilest Him, to whom we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for our very Being: and besides, it blowes vpon our gifts with such a malignant humour, that they also become vnfruitfull, and vnprofitable to others.</p>
            <p>Thus much concerning the first extreme and errour in managing our spirituall estate, to wit, a proud ouerprizing of our owne graces with a conceited ouer-weening selfe-esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

Let vs come vnto his death; from the ineuitable stroake whereof, all the Gold and Pearle of East and West can no more redeeme him, then can an handfull of dust; and there he shall find despaire and horrour, like two euening Wolues, enraged with hellish hunger; ready to teare his soule in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when there is none to help.

               <hi>haue my measure; and therefore sure of glory.</hi> It is strange then, that any true-hearted <hi>Nathanael</hi> hauing such good ground of reioycing; sinning in that he doth not reioyce; and ioy being so sweet and welcome a guest to the heart of man; should weare out a few and wretched dayes in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie heauinesse, and sinfull sadnesse; whereby he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dishonours Gods free loue; hinders others from the wayes of life; hurts full sore his owne soule, and onely gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies Satan.</p>
            <p>3. It is a constant marke of euery regenerate man, to make conscience of all Gods Commandements, Psal. 119. 6, Now the holy Ghost doth not onely in many seuerall places giue vs charge to reioyce, but is very earnest vpon vs in this poynt: Nay, doth so often double and treble with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary emphasis and elegant gradation, his entreatie and importunitie in the same place. <hi>Let the Saints,</hi> saith he, <hi>be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with glory,</hi> Psal. 149. 5. <hi>Let all those that seeke thee, reioyce and be glad in thee,</hi> Psal. 40. 16. <hi>Reioyce in the Lord, O ye righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> Psalm. 33. 1. <hi>Reioyce euermore,</hi> 1.

               <hi>yee that are vpright in heart,</hi> Psal. 32. 11. It is not an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or indifferent thing, as some may suppose, to reioyce, or to be sad. But a comfortable commandement is sweetly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon vs, by the fountaine of all comfort, <hi>to reioyce;</hi> and we breake a commandement, if we reioyce not. And therefore we are bound in conscience to shake our selues from the dust, to plucke vp our spirits, to expostulate and bee angry with our hearts, if they grow heauy as <hi>Dauid</hi> did: <hi>Why art thou cast downe, O my soule, and why art thou disquieted within mee?</hi> For wee must answer as well for not reioycing, as for not praying: for breaking this commandement, <hi>Reioyce euermore;</hi> as that other, <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> (I know full well there are difference and degrees in sinne.)</p>

For this spirituall Christian ioy, is a delicious motion of the minde, stirred vp by the holy Ghost, from the presence and possession of Christ Iesus our Soueraigne God, dwelling in the soule by faith; whereby the heart is extraordinarily ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished and refreshed with a sweet, holy, vnspeakeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Now, saith he, if it be so; I must tell you, I find and feele no such sensible grasping of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> in the armes of my faith, or assured possession of him, that I dare admit of this ioy, or meddle with it.</p>
            <p>But know, that in the time of thy spirituall infancy, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, desertions, and other dampes and deiections of soule especially; let thy feeling or acknowledgement be what it will; thou dost most certainely enioy the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> euen<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If thou rightly temper, and well weigh euen thy sorest sorrow, and the very bleeding of thy heart for sinne; it should bee so farre from damping the lightsomnesse of thy spirit, that it ought to open vnto thee a well-spring of purest ioy. For the penitent melting of our affections, and kindly mourning ouer Him, whom we haue pierced with our sinnes, argues infallibly, and sweetely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures the presence and sanctifying power of the holy Spirit. And what greater comfort, or sweeter delight, then that which ariseth from a well grounded euidence, that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all comfort dwels in our soules? Such teares as burst out of a heart opprest with griefe for sinne, are like an April showre, which though it wet a little, yet it begets a great deale of sweetnesse in the herbes, flowers, and fruits of the earth. As euen in laughing the heart of the wicked is sorrowfull: so contrarily euen in such mourning, the heart of the true penitent is lightsome and comfortable. For habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ioy may not onely consist with actuall sorrow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily: but also euen actuall ioy with actuall sorrow. This is no strange thing in other cases; when wee see a good man persecuted for a good cause, stand to it nobly; wee grieue for his troubles, but reioyce in his resolution and vndauntednes.

               <hi>for vs, therefore let vs keepe the Feast,</hi> 1. Cor. 5. 7.</p>
            <p>The sweetnesse and excellency of this Feast, is notably set out and amplified by 1. the beautifull garments wee put on and weare, when we are admitted vnto it: 2. The matter, and magnificent prouision: 3. The musicke: 4. The franke and bountifull entertainment and plenty: 5. The extraordinarie pompe and princelinesse.</p>
            <p>1. For the first, meditate ioyfully vpon that rich attire, and those Royall attributes, glorifying and crowning Christs blessed Spouse, with most admirable and rauishing beauty, Cant. 6. 10. <hi>Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, faire as the Moone, pure as the Sunne, terrible as an army with Banners?</hi> And know, that all the essentiall glory and faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which is to be found in the whole Church, the <hi>Woman</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 12. 1.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>As the morning.</hi>] 1. The morning springs out of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test darknesse; the night is most darke, as they say, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day: the illuminated soule arises out of the most dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and damned graue of ignorance and sinne. 2. The beauty of the morning is principally seene in her <note n="*" place="margin">

The glory of the morning after its first peeping in the East, spreads fairer and fairer in all beauty and brightnesse, vntill the mid-day, and full illustration of the World: Grace in the soule, after the first plantation, growes stronger and stronger, shines fairer and fairer, vntil it set in the bottomlesse Ocean of endlesse Glory. See Prou. 4. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faire as the Moone</hi>] 1. The Moone receiues all her light and lustre from the Sunne: all the graces, holinesse, inherent righteousnesse, shining in a sanctified soule, are the image and impressions of the Sunne of righteousnesse. 2. The
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:6825:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Moone hath some spots in her face; but yet is a very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creature by her borrowed light. The Christian is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what blacke with the remnants of originall corruption, and by reason of his vnauoideable frailties and imperfections; but yet <hi>comely as the curtaines of Salomon,</hi> by the glory of his new creation and gracious beames that shine vpon his soule from the face of Christ. 3. The further the Moone is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the Sunne; the fairer she is, and fuller of light: The more an humble soule, vpon sight of that holy Maiestie and purest eye, ten thousand times brighter then the Sun, which cannot look on iniquitie; doth retire with lowliest thoughts into himselfe, to abhorre himselfe in dust and ashes, as most vile, and farre worthier to be throwne into the lowest dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of the kingdome of darknesse, then to bee honoured with the loue and light of his countenance; is more <note n="a" place="margin">Tantò vnaquae<expan>

               <hi>Fure as the Sunne</hi>] The Moone shadowes out inherent fairenesse; the Sunne resembles and represents our imputed puritie: So that this Royall Robe, the Sunne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the vnspotted Iustice of Iesus Christ, doth glorifie the soule: 1. With an entire vnstained beautie: our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent holinesse hath some spots and staines of imperfection like the Moone; but that imputed for our iustification, is much more spotlesse and orient then the Sunne. 2 Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally: Wee are washed as it were, from top to toe in the blood of Christ, and couered wholly with his perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. 3.

For the beauty and amiablenesse of an holy soule, inflames the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Sonne of God, with an extraordinarie pang of spirituall feruent loue, Cant. 4. 9. whereas not all the glory of the world, though represented to his eye with the fairest lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre, and in the most refined forme, could moue him euer a whit, Matth, 4. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Plato</hi> was wont to say, if morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues could be seene with the outward eye; they would stirre vp in the heart extraordinary flames of admiration and loue: what vnspeakeable rauishments then would Christian gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces enkindle, were they visible to the carnall eyes? They would be able to make Persecutors, Professors; to turne euen Drunkards into Puritans, as they call them; the most sensuall Epicure, into a mortified Saint.</p>

fatnesse, of most refined and purified wines; which shadow vnto vs, spirituall delicacies, those golden dainties, digd out of the rich myne of the mysterie of Christ, by the hand of Faith, in the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Communion of Saints, solemne humiliations, sweet Soliloquies, solitary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with our God, feeling forethought of infinite ioyes thorow eternity, &amp;c. Euery circumstance breathes out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but sweetnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this mountaine.</hi>] It is dressed in Mount Zion, <hi>The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of beautie, The ioy of the whole earth, The glory of all Lands;</hi> which represents vnto vs, by way of shadow and type, the ouerflowing glory of the Christian Church; the very Heauen of all humane societies; our onely Sunne in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour world; which though so much maligned, yet were it remooued, there would bee a little hell vpon earth; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left, but a darke Midnight of villany and horror, for incarnate Deuils to domineere in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees; of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</hi>] Hereby is intimated the matter of the Feast, and Royall prouision, amplified with extraordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Emphasis</hi> of words, elegancy of phrase, and iteration of the same sence, with variety of expression; which also argues its excellency.

The marrow of the fatnesse; as if a man should say, the spirit of the quintessence, the Diamond of the Ring, the sparkle of the Diamond, &amp;c. And yet all this comes infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly short of what the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> would shadow and shew vnto vs by the most sumptuous materials of earthly Feasts.

               </gap>. The secret and sacred delight of those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine dainties intended here by the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> being vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious, doth infinitely transcend the possibility of all creatures to contribute, and the capacity of the largest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vnderstanding to conceiue. So must be construed, as a worthy Diuine sayes truly, that Text, 1 Cor. 2. <hi>Not of the ioyes of heauen, which heere the spirituall man himselfe cannot tell what they shall bee; but of the Gospels ioy, of the Wine and Fatlings ready prepared, and now reuealed to the Beleeuer by the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the third. Heare the voice of sweetenesse and peace, Esa. 27. 2. <hi>Sing vnto her: A Vineyard of red Wine. Sing</hi>] sounds nothing but ioy, lightsomnesse, and mirth: <hi>Unto her</hi>] the sexe of more amiablenesse, tendernesse, and loue. <hi>A Vineyard</hi>] Vineyards, Orchards, Gardens, and such inclosed Plots, are, as it were, the flowers, starres, and Paradises of the earth. <hi>Of Wine</hi>] as though the Vine-trees of this Inclosure brought not foorth the grosser and vncrushed Grapes; but more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, the refined and pure blood of the Grape. <hi>Red</hi>] The most generous sparkling delicious wine. A Vineyard is, as it were, the Diamond of the Ring; wine, the sparkle; red, the splendour of the sparkle: all excellencies, sweetenes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, transcendencies; where God opens &amp; expresses his heart and loue to his Church, or any of his Chosen.</p>
            <p>For the fourth. Let thy faith peruse with enlarged Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, those precious passages of gracious inuitation and bountifull entertainement, Mat. 22. 3, 4. Isa. 55. 1, 2. Pro. 9. 2, 3. Cant. 2. 3, 4. <hi>Thou shalt sucke and be satisfied euen with the brests of consolations.</hi> Thy dearest and most glorious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is clothed with the Sunne, treads vpon the<note place="margin">Reu. 12. 1.</note>

            <p>For the fifth. It is compared to a wedding Feast, and that<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> of a Kings sonne; which is woont to be honoured and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with height and variety of all magnificence and Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie; ioy and triumph, mirth and musicke. When an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled soule is first made sure to the Sonne of God; the ioyfull harmony of all good hearts that heare of it, and the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant <hi>Halleluiahs</hi> of the blessed Angels in heauen, concurre in consort, as it were, of congratulation, for so happy a match; in gladnesse and ioy for so holy a change. This Feast begins at thy first betrothing; when thou receiuing a Ring, as it were, beset with fiue precious stones: 1. Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 19, 20.</note> 2. Iudgement. 3. Louing kindnesse. 4. Mercies. 5. Faithfulnesse. It is afterward continued with many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious passages of loue and sweetest entertainements on both sides, euen in this life; as appeares in <hi>Solomons</hi> Spirituall Loue-song. It shall at last be crowned with an euerlasting Iubilee, and pleasures moe then the Starres of the firmament in number; when the Lambe receiues his wife into his nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and dearest embracements; euen into full possession of the most blessed, neuer-ending Kingdome of heauen; bought for her, full dearely, with his owne hearts blood. Then, our Feast of grace ends in the endlesse fruition of Glory. How merry then ought wee to be in the meane time, who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and enrighted to this gracious and glorious Feast? Of expressing which to the life, the finest fare and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite delicates of all earthly feasts, come as farre short, as the dull earth comes short of the glistering heauen; a grosse mortall body of the preciousnesse of an euerliuing soule: An inch of time, of the length of eternity.

            <p>6. As thou doest honour Gods Iustice, in trembling at his threats, and throwing thy selfe into the dust, as extremely vile, and fewell for hell vnder his mighty hand, and the piercing Maiesty of his pure Word; representing clearely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy conscience, and pressing terribly vpon it, the hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all thy lusts, iniquities, abominable prouocations of the eyes of his glory and diuine indignation flaming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: so when thou findest and feelest thy heart truly wounded by the sword of the Spirit, with remorse and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for thy sinnes, weary with the heauy weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of them, possessed with sincere hatred and lothing of euery euill way; thou oughtest, and are bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and by the commandement of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods truth in his promises of mercy, by throwing thy selfe into the blessed armes, and bleeding embracements of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> dying vpon the Crosse; in whom they are all, <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> with much assurance and peace; with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable and glorious ioy. And the rather, because the speciall season and onely opportunity of thy magnifying and honouring the sweet influence of Gods dearest mercies, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-heartednesse, and truth vpon humble soules, through the precious promises of <hi>life,</hi> is in this life. In the world to come they shall all bee accomplished vpon thee to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, and crowned with a cleere vision and full fruition of that euer-blessed and most glorious Maiesty. Then faith for euer expires; and we see face to face.</p>
            <p>These things being so, and most sure; let euery true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted <hi>Nathaneel</hi> be heartily intreated, nay, iustly charged in the name of Iesus Christ, by the blessed Spirit, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all comfort; as hee will answer it at the glorious Throne of Mercy, erected in heauen vpon purpose to make him euerlastingly merry, that hee henceforth most reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and for euer cast out of his conscience, sprinkled with the Blood of the Lambe, and out of the Kingdome of Christ, ouerflowing with Peace and Ioy, now comfortably establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

And leauing such <hi>Harpies</hi> as these, and heart-eaters, onely to the grumbling and guilty consciences of all those that hate to be reformed, and Satans slaues, as their proper fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; let him with an holy violence against the deuils cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell assaults and contradictions of his owne distrustfull heart, and with a cheerefull spirit, lay hold vpon his iust inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and euerlasting portion, purchased for him by the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and painefull sufferings of the Sonne of God; euen floods and fresh successions of sweetest ioyes, shed and showred downe continually from the Throne of Grace vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his vpright heart, in great abundance; if hee will but onely vouchsafe to open the doore by the hand of faith, that the blessed beames of such lightsomnesse and comfort, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the face of Christ, may come in. Let his soule, full fairely arayed with its heauenly roabes, to which, the beauty of the morning, brightnesse of the Moone, and glory of the Sunne are but a shadow; and listning sweetly to that melodious Song, composed all of Peace and Ioy, Pleasures and Pardon of finne, which the mercy of God makes in the eare of its faith; fall to, and fill it selfe at the Wedding Feast of the Kings Sonne, with those euer-spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riuers of spirituall refreshing, out of the bottomlesse depth of Gods free loue reuealed in the mysterie of Christ, by the ministery of the Word and Sacramentall grace; as with marrow and fatnesse: Let it sucke aboundantly, and be satisfied with the brests of euerlasting consolations.

Mount Zion, inexpugnable, and vnshaken with the most fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious incursions of the floods and tempests of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubles, pressures, and persecutions. Let all those mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and most abhorred iniections, filthy temptations, and fiery darts, pointed with the very malice of hell, ordinarily offered to the imagination of the best, bee resolutely repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the shield of faith, and retorted as dung vpon the Tempters face. Let all vngodly oppositions from man or deuill, or fearefull distrust be but as so many proud and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling waues, dashing against a mighty Rocke; which the<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 25.</note> more boisterously they beate vpon it, the more are they bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and turned into a vaine foame and froth.</p>
            <p>But to descend with thee more punctually to some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: Tell mee truly, thou which hast giuen thy name to <hi>Christ</hi> in truth; what it is that troubles thee? what is it that still detaines thine heauy heart, in the chaines and fetters of horrour and sadnesse; and lockes it vp so long from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and entertainement of spirituall lightsomenesse and ioy? And if I bee not able to confront and confound it, by some well-grounded counter-comfort and Antidote, out of the Oracle of truth; if I be not able to discouer it to bee a selfe-created crosse; and to dissolue it into an imaginary and groundlesse fancie, by the light of the Word; then walke heauily still. Onely beleeue the Prophets, and thou shalt prosper. Thou must then bee contented to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled by the faithfull Physicions of thy soule; who can shew vnto <hi>man his vprightnesse,</hi> and are <hi>instructed vnto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen;</hi> especially fetching all their prescriptions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and counterpoysons, out of the rich Treasurie of the Booke of Life:</p>
            <p>Thou must learne;</p>
            <p>1. To put a difference betweene nullity of grace, and imperfection of grace. Many good soules desire sincerely that their hearts were broken in pieces, and bled at the root, for their many and hainous sinnes; grieuing much, that they can grieue no more: They hunger and thirst for Christs
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:6825:199"/>
righteousnesse, more then for the wealth of the whole world: They groane mightily in spirit for Gods fauour, pardon of sinne, power ouer their corruptions, ability to pray better, &amp;c. But yet because they feele not that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sensible smart and anguish of heart in lamenting their former life, as they desire; because they haue not their wished ioy and peace in beleeuing; because they cannot now pray as feruently and feelingly as they, perhaps, were formerly woont; not with that freedome and heartinesse as they would: in a word, because they are yet but <hi>smoaking flaxe,</hi> and <hi>bruised reedes,</hi> not full shining lampes, and strong Pillars in the House of God; they will needs haue all to be nought. Whereby they (I will not say belie the Spirit) but most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily deny, and in their conceites nullifie his already wonderfull glorious worke vpon their soules; to their, I know not how great spirituall hurt and hinderance. For such intolerable vnthankefulnesse may bee iustly punished, and paide home with longer detainement, vpon the Racke of distrustfull slauish feare, and vnder the bondage of Legall terrours. It is a speciall point then of spirituall wisedome, and of singular consequence for the soules quiet and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; to discerne weakenesse of grace from want of grace. <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> declaring in his heauenly Sermon who are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> doth not instance in the perfections, excellencies, and heights of Christianity; though all that are true of heart, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely pray for, and presse after them: but in the least and lowest degrees; lest the <hi>smoking flaxe</hi> should bee quenched, and <hi>bruised reedes</hi> bee broken. He doeth not say; Blessed are the stong in Faith; the full assured: Blessed are those that take on for their sinnes, as for their onely sonne, and for their first borne: but, <hi>Blessed are they which doe hunger and thirst after righteousnesse: Blessed are the poore in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Not alwayes to make sence and feeling the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone for the truth of thy spirituall state. A man in a swoone or a sleepe feeles not his life, and yet is a liuing man. It is one
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:6825:200"/>
thing to haue grace, another to feele grace. One thing the life of faith, another the life of sence.</p>
            <p>3. Not to disgrace thy owne graces, by casting thine eye too deiectedly vpon other Christians perfections and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedencies. Let it not fare with thee in this case, as it doth with one gazing too much vpon the Sunne; who looking downewards againe, can see iust nothing, whereas before he cleerely discerned all colours about him. Looke vpon them for imitation and quickning, not for slauish deiection and selfe-blinding.</p>
            <p>4. To acknowledge and expect, that heauenly graces, as Faith, &amp;c. while they inhabite these earthly houses, ebbe and flow, waxe and wane, faint and flourish; by reason of the combate betweene the flesh and the Spirit. So that if a man should tell mee; that he hath euer prayed alike, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out temptation, or dampes, without any sence at any time of deadnesse or spirituall distempers; that he hath euer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued alike, without those doubts and scruples, that faintnesse and feare, of which most Christians so much complaine; I durst confidently reply, that then he neuer either prayed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, or beleeued sauingly. The Fathers <note n="a" place="margin">Luna ipsa, quâ propheticis ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis species ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae figuratur, cùm primùm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surgens in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struas reparatur aetates: tenebris noctis abscondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: paulat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Here then hee wofully failes and forgets himselfe in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull vnder-prizing Gods incomprehensible greatnesse, Almightie mercy, vnlimited liberalitie and freenesse of his loue. He is in this case, not so much to consider, what is fit for him to receiue, as conuenient for the ability and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of so great and good a God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the mighty Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth to giue; who, as I told you before vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion, doth all things like Himselfe. If hee build, he makes a world. If he be angry with the world, hee sends a floud ouer the face of the whole earth. If hee goes out with the Armies of the Saints, hee makes the Sunne stand still, the Starres to fight, the Seas to swallow vp the most dreadfull <hi>Armadoes.</hi> If hee loue; the precious hearts blood of his owne Sonne is not too deare. If he deliuer any man, Hee puls him out of the hand of the Prince of darknesse;

and frees him from euerlasting flames. If any become his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite through <hi>Christs</hi> mediation, He wil make him a King, giue him a Paradise, and set a Crowne of eternitie vpon his head. Earthly Princes at their pleasures ennoble those they loue, with Dukedomes, Marquesdomes, Earledomes. What then, doe you thinke, shall be done vnto the man, whom the King of Heauen desires, and delights to honour? Let vs then, I say, in such cases, consider not so much what is fit for vs silly wormes to receiue; as for so great a God to bestow. If wee can once bring hearts bruised and broken with the burden of our sinnes, bleeding and weeping vnto his <hi>Mercy-seate;</hi> Hee will thinke all the meritorious sufferings of his Sonne; all the promises in his Booke; all the comforts of his Spirit; all the pleasures in his Kingdome little enough for vs. If wee looke vpon our selues, sinful wretches, we might iustly feare the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremest torments, fiercest flames, and lowest dungeon in hell, infinitely rather then expect a Kingdome.

And why shouldest thou, being such an one, be so vnmannerly and vnthankfull, nay, so vnnecessarily cruell to thine owne heauy heart, as not to open the euerlasting doore of thy soule by the key of Faith, to let the King of glory knocking with his hand of mercy, come in, and crowne it with grace and glory, with comfort and euerlasting peace?</p>

Whence it is, that the Prophet inuiting his people to repentance, Esa. 55. 7. by assuring them of Gods sweet, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and gracious disposition, lest any too fearefull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected spirit vndervaluing Gods mercy, should thinke thus within it selfe: Bee it so: yet alas, my sinnes are so many, and such a sonne of <hi>Belial</hi> haue I been, and so endlesly prouoked the glory of his pure eye, that I can expect no mercy: the pollutions of my youth haue been so prodigious and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that I haue no face to presse vnto his Throne of Grace; &amp;c. God himselfe doth there purposely preuent the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and speaking to our capacitie, which cannot comprehend infinity, replyes to this sence: Oh say not so! Stay all such despairefull thoughts; doe not cast the incomprehensiblenes of my mercy, in the narrow mould of thy finite shallow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite: doe not so vnworthily abridge and confine the vnli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and boundlesse compassion of the mighty Lord of Heauen and Earth: <hi>For my thoughts are not your thoughts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>neither are your wayes my wayes: For as the Heauens are higher then the earth, so are my wayes higher then your wayes, and my thoughts then your thoughts.</hi> Many a bruised reede would not
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:6825:203"/>
exchange the comfort, which the weakest faith may extract out of this sweetest place, for all the Kingdomes of the earth. For he saith not, that his wayes and thoughts of knowledge and wisdome; but his wayes and thoughts of mercy, are as farre aboue ours, as the Heauens are aboue the Earth: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as himselfe is aboue man, which is, infinitely. But take notice by the way, that the mercies of God doe exercise this infinite vnresistable power onely in truly humbled beleeuing soules; heartily hating, and sincerely set against all sinne. I say so, lest any <hi>impenitent</hi> should peruert this precious point, or trample vpon this Pearle. For as in such a soule no sinnes either for number or notoriousnesse, can possibly withstand, or stand before Gods infinite mercies: so not one drop of all those infinite merceis belongs vnto any that goes on wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and delightfully, hating to bee reformed in any one knowne sinne, or that he might know, and wilfully forbeares to bee informed. As the vnualuable blood of Christ turnes the very scarlet sinnes of the truly broken beleeuing heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whitest snow; so it will neuer wash away the least sinfull staine, from the proud heart of any vnhumbled Pharise. Let none therefore that goes on still in his trespasses, take vp any vaine confidence, or mis-grounded conclusion of false com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from hence, by misconceiuing thus: Is it so, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitenesse of Gods mercy cannot bee resisted by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or multitude of sinnes, being euer finite both in their number and nature? how is it possible then that I should misse of those infinites mercies? Why may not I comfortably hope, that my sinnes also shall be swallowed vp in that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse Sea? I will tell thee why. As the power of God, though it be infinite, yet is limited by his will: so the mercies of God, though they bee infinite, are regulated by his truth. He is able to make millions of Worlds moe, but yet wee see, his Will was but to create one. His mercies transcend with immeasurable distance, the height of Heauen, and depth of Hell, and are indeed, as Himselfe, infinite: but his Truth hath told vs, that none shall haue part in them, but those alone
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:6825:203"/>
who repent and beleeue. Gods Truth reuealed in his Word, must euer confine the current of his compassions, and is the touchstone to try and qualifie those, to whom his mercies belong. See then what kind of people are partakers of Gods infinite mercies, by the testimony of that Word of Truth, by which we must be iudged at the last Day, Prou. 28. 13. Luke 4. 18. Isai. 61. 1, 2, 3. Psal. 15. Ezek. 18. 21. Psal. 147. 3. Isai. 55. 7. Psal. 34. 18. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in the cited place; <hi>Hee that confesseth and forsaketh his sinnes, shall haue mercy.</hi> How then can he expect any mercy, who takes them not to heart, but lyes in them still?</p>
            <p>III. Of the pardonablenesse of my other sinnes, saith another, I could bee reasonably well perswaded; but alas, there is one aboue all the rest, which now vpon discouery and remorse, I finde to be full of ranke and hellish poyson; of such a deepe and damnable die; to haue strooke so desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the dayes of my lewdnesse, at the very face of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and farre deepelier into the heart of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> then the speare that pierced him, bleeding vpon the Crosse; and thereupon at this present, stares in the eye of my newly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and wounded conscience, with such horror and griesli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that I feare mee, diuine iustice will thinke it fitter, to haue this most loathsome, inexpiable staine, rather at length fired out of my soule with euerlasting flames; (if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that eternall fire could expiate the sinfull staines of any impenitent damned soule) then to bee fairely washed away in the meane time with His blood, whom I so cruelly and cursedly pierced with it. Oh! this is it that lies now vpon my heart like a mountaine of Lead, farre heauier then Heauen and Earth, and enchaines it with inexplicable terrour to the dust and place of Dragons. This alone stings desperately; keepes mee from Christ, and cuts mee off from all hope of Heauen. I am afraid, my wilfull wallowing in it heretofore, hath so reprobated my mind, seared my conscience, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened my heart, that I shall neuer be able to repent with any hope of pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:6825:204"/>And why so? Is this sinne of thine greater, then <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sehs</hi> familiaritie with wicked spirits? Then <hi>Pauls</hi> drinking vp the blood of Saints? Then any of theirs in that blacke Bill, 1.
