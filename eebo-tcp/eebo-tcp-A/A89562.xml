            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The like uſage my ſelf have lately met with in ſome degree, for being affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with a deep cold and diſtillation from my head upon my lungs, and ſome feveriſh diſtempers, my learned, loving and carefull Phyſitian, finding that the too importune viſits of my many loving friends, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned too much ſpeech, and thereby too much expence of ſpirits, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to remove to the houſe of my Noble Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> where I ſhould have more ayre, and leſſe company: hereupon a report was immediately ſpread about the City that I was diſtracted, and in my rage conſtantly cried out, I was damned for appearing in, and adhering to the Parliament and Kingdom in this defenſive warre: which when I firſt heard, I looked upon as a calumny invented by ſome ſimple adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary (though malicious enough to my perſon and miniſtry) who finding it the readieſt way to reproach me betook himſelf to this. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obſerving how ſtudiouſly it was maintained, how laboriouſly propagated, how handed from Court to City, from City to Countrey, from England to forraign parts, <hi>Mercurius Aulicus</hi> printed it, and a great Officer of State having ſent it into other Kingdoms with his letters, aſſuring the truth of it, and that not nine dayes, no not a month

did allay it, I then perceived the plot was not ſo much to diſgrace me, (for alas who am I that they ſhould trouble themſelves ſo much about me) but through me to wound the cauſe, in which my poore labours have been engaged. This rumour it ſeemes yet lives, and (as your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confirmes) encreaſes; from my going down into the Countrey they have taken occaſion not only to report me diſtracted, but dead, yea that I died crying our of my appearing in this cauſe; and this is ſo confidently reported by ſome, that it is almoſt as confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by others; even thouſands, you ſay, which makes you earneſtly to preſſe me to write unto you, whether I have not (at leaſt) changed my former judgement about our defenſive armes, and this not (as you profeſſed) to ſatisfie your ſelfe, but that you might have ſomething under my owne hand to ſhew for the ſatisfaction of others. Sir, your ancient love to me, and preſent deſires to vindicate me from theſe aſperſions, but eſpecially your care that the publike cauſe might not ſuffer, doe all command me to be your ſervant in this thing.</p>
            <p>I know it will ſatisfie you, that I ſolemnly proteſt unto you, that in all theſe fourteen weeks keeping in, I never had an houres ſickneſſe, nor loſt a nights ſleep, nor had any diſtemper in my head, nor ſaw any cauſe of ſorrow for my adhering to the Parliaments cauſe but eſteem it a great honour and mercy from God, that he ſhould move his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency my Lord, to require my ſervice in this great expedition; and that I have even therefore exactly followed the Doctors preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, out of an earneſt deſire to be ſitted for my work, that I might returne to my moſt Honoured Lord, being fully reſolved, if God ſay Amen to it, never to give it over, untill either there be an end of that work, or an end of my dayes. This I think will ſatisfie you, and it is poſſibly as much as you deſire for the ſatisfaction of others, to have this under my hand. Take this concerning the cauſe, and concerning the report ſpread of me, what <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid (of thoſe above mentioned) concerning himſelfe; <hi>fateor &amp; teſtor hâc meâ manu, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>But ſince your love hath compelled me to put pen to paper, I ſhall compell you to read the largeſt letter that ever I wrote, being reſolved to give you a full account both of my ground and warrant of entring
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123864:3"/>
upon my office, and how farre I am from changing my judgement upon the preſent view of things.</p>
            <p>When his <hi>Excellency</hi> vouchſafed to require my ſervice (for, God knows, I offered not my ſelfe in this great work) there were but two queſtions (beſide my care to walk aright in my miniſtry) for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be reſolved in. <hi>Firſt,</hi> whether upon ſuppoſall of the truth of the Parliament votes. <hi>viz.</hi> That his Majeſty ſeduced by wicked Councell, did levie warre againſt the Parliament; the Scripture did warrant them to take up defenſive armes. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the Parliament was not miſinformed about ſuch his Majeſties purpoſe, and practice. The firſt is a mear queſtion in Divinity. <hi>viz. Whether a people, eſpecially the repreſentative body of a State, may (after all humble Remonſtrances) defend themſelves againſt the unlawfull violence of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magiſtrate, or his Inſtruments, Endeavouring (and that in matters of great moment) to deprive them of their lawfull liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second is a queſtion mearly of matter of fact.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, Before the beginning of theſe unhappy differences, I had both learned, and taught to this purpoſe. Firſt, that it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods will, that in all Countreys (eſpecially when and where the people are numerous) Magiſtracie be ſet up, with a ſufficiencie of power and authority to rule for the publike good; and that, even among them who are under the ſcepter of Chriſt, againſt the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſis.</hi> Secondly, that among the divers kinds of lawfull governments, <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> no one of them is ſo appointed of God, as to exclude the other from being a lawfull government. Thirdly, That the bounds and limits of the Magiſtrates lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of commanding, and the ſubjects neceſſary obeying, muſt be ſound, and taken out of the ſeverall Lawes, Cuſtoms, and Conſtitutions of thoſe ſeverall States, and Commonwealths: There are ſcarce two formes (eſpecially of Regall government, in the world) but they differ one from the other, and that in matters of moment. Now I ſay, what the power of Magiſtrates in one Countrey differs from the power of Magiſtrates in another Countrey, and how the duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects differs in each, muſt be found only in the lawes of the reſpective places: that no mans right muſt be detained from him, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould have rendred to him the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and <hi>all people</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:123864:4"/>
the things that are their <hi>own,</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>lawes of all Nations</hi> doe determine. But whether (for inſtance in <hi>England</hi>) Shipmoney be the <hi>Kings</hi> right, and ſo to be yeelded, or denyed; whether this houſe or inheritance be this or the other pretenders to it, muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by any law, but by the law of <hi>England;</hi> goe therefore to the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and learned <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and from them alone you ſhall learn what is the <hi>Prerogative of the Prince,</hi> and both the <hi>Duty, and Liberty of the Subject.</hi> But then fourthly comes in Religion or the command of God, and binds the conſciences of Magiſtrates to rule, and of Subjects to obey, according to thoſe Lawes. And fifthly, (in particular) of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it requires theſe four things. Firſt, to render to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, next under God the <hi>greatest fear, and honour,</hi> as being Gods vicegerents, as having the greateſt beames of his authority put upon them, and therefore called Gods, and all of them the children of the moſt High. Secondly, <hi>Loyalty</hi> to their perſons, and office, that is, <hi>obedience</hi> according to law, and <hi>patient ſubjection,</hi> when we cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively obey, willingly for conſcience ſake to ſubmit to the penalty of the laws, when for conſcience ſake we cannot obſerve the lawes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thirdly, <hi>maintenance</hi> with payment of all lawfull Cuſtoms, Tributes, and impoſitions. Fourthly, all manner of <hi>ſupplications, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Interceſsions, and giving of thanks,</hi> their uſefullneſſe being great, their temptations many, their fall (like that of great Cedars) the cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many, and the ſhaking of the earth round about them, and all this we owe, not only to the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>Supream,</hi> but in proportion to all <hi>inferior Governors, who are ſent by God alſo for the puniſhment of evill doers, and for the praiſe of them that doe well, they being all the miniſters of God for our good, and this is the firſt Commandement with promiſe.</hi> But ſixthly, if our Governours (whether ſupream, or inferior) leave to rule according to law, and ſet up their own will contrary to law; there is no word of God acquitting them from ſin in Gods ſight, but ſeverely threatening them for abuſing his name, which they bear; nor any word binding the conſciences of their ſubjects <hi>therein</hi> to yeeld them any <hi>active obedience.</hi> Thus farre we have all ſides agreeing in all the particulars, except only a few Court flatterers, who (and that eſpecially of late) have endeavoured to cry up Monarchy, as the only ordinance of God, for the Government of States; as if the other

men will allow me, if the King <hi>pretend Law</hi> in any thing I may <hi>try it out</hi> with him, and not when he or his Inſtruments come with open <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:</hi> If the King will <hi>ſue</hi> mee, and by pretence of <hi>Law</hi> ſeek to take away my <hi>coat,</hi> my <hi>houſe,</hi> my <hi>land,</hi> I may <hi>defend</hi> theſe from him with all the <hi>ſtrength of Law</hi> I can, but if he come with <hi>armed violence</hi> to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my <hi>liberty, life, religion,</hi> I muſt yeeld up theſe without making <hi>any reſiſtance:</hi> I may ſecure that which I have nothing but <hi>lex terrae</hi> to plead my propriety in, viz. <hi>my money,</hi> which I may give away, and in the mean time my <hi>liberty, life, religion,</hi> which are mine <hi>by the lawes of God and man,</hi> I may not ſecure with a good conſcience. True it is, if in caſe it do (upon circumſtances duly weighed) appeare that our rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from our right, and not reſiſting wrong, will tend to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a greater and a more generall good, or the preventing of a greater and more generall evill, it is agreeable to right reaſon, and our Saviours rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 39. that we ſhould both <hi>remit</hi> of our right, and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> to wrong, whether ſued or unſued, whether to ſuperiours or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, or equals.

               </gap>, ſuch an abſurdity as you ſhall ſeldom meet with.</p>
            <p>But give me leave to weigh it a little further; if the Subjects defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves by Armes againſt the violence of oppreſſing Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and their inſtruments be unlawfull, either it muſt be becauſe their Prince hath by <hi>conquest ſpoyled them</hi> of that liberty which God and nature gave them at the firſt. Or ſecondly, becauſe they or their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors having ſubmitted by <hi>covenant and conſent</hi> to him to be their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Ruler according to Law, they muſt therefore bee interpreted to have yeelded up all their liberty ſo farre as to bee now unable with a good conſcience to defend themſelves againſt his violence though contrary to Law. Or thirdly, becauſe <hi>God hath lifted up Princes ſo far</hi> above all mortall men, that all hands are by him bound from daring to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p>The firſt I finde not many pleading, that peoples being <hi>conquerd,</hi> makes it unlawfull for them to defend themſelves againſt the unjuſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences of their conqueror or his ſucceſſors: Moſt of them grant, that the peoples right is to <hi>deſigne the perſon of their Prince.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is the moſt abſurd reaſoning in the world, that becauſe a ſtrong

robber hath over powerd mee in my houſe, in conſcience I am tyed to be his ſervant or ſlave for ever. Becauſe <hi>Eglon</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3.</note> hath mightily oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> for eighteen yeares, it is unlawfull for them to ſhake off his yoak when they are able to reſiſt him: Certainly, whatever of mine ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes by violence from me, let him keep it never ſo long, it is but <hi>Continuata injuria,</hi> a continued wrong, till I conſent to his hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; And all reaſon allowes me to recover it again as ſoon as I can. And I fear not to ſay, that had <hi>William</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Conquerour</hi> taken and held this Crowne only by his ſword, and ruled over the Nation only by force, and all his ſucceſſors to this day had <hi>no other</hi> claim to it, all the reaſon in the world would allow us to redeem our ſelves from that yoak, if we were able.</p>
            <p>But though the ſword begin the Conqueſt, yet many times the <hi>Conſent of the people</hi> comes in, and makes their <hi>Conquerour</hi> their <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King;</hi> and then ſo farre as by Covenant or Lawes, they agree to be under him for the publike ſafety and good, they are bound up from <hi>any reſiſtance.</hi> But that their parting with <hi>ſome</hi> of their liberty for the publike good ſhould (upon the uſurpation of him whom they have truſted) deprive them of that liberty which they <hi>never parted with,</hi> is moſt abhorring to reaſon. Suppoſe a free man indents with another to be his ſervant in ſome ingenious employment, as, ſuppoſe to attend upon his perſon; and expreſly indents that his maſter ſhall not have power to command him to rub his horſe heels, or fill his dung-cart, or the like; If now this maſter ſhall uſurp, and command him to ſuch ſordid employment, and by force ſeek to compell him to them, ſome ſhew of reaſon (at leaſt) there would be for the ſervant to plead that his <hi>master</hi> had <hi>forfeited all his power</hi> over him, and that he was free from his ſervice, and might goe ſeek another maſter; but no colour of reaſon that the <hi>ſervant</hi> hath now <hi>forfeited that immunity from ſordid</hi> and drudgery works that he firſt covenanted, and muſt thenceforth lie at his maſters feet, as wholly proſtitute to all his Imperious humours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, can it be imagined, by reaſon that a people ſubmitting to a <hi>lawfull government,</hi> ſhould thereby be neceſſitated to that which may overthrow the <hi>end</hi> of all government, that is, <hi>inability</hi> to provide for their common ſafety. That whereas when they were free and under no government at all, they might by the law of nature defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123864:6"/>
againſt injury: now having ſubmitted, though upon good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, they are utterly diſabled to defend themſelves if he that ſhould be their Protector, would prove their Murtherer: If he who both in himſelfe and inſtruments ſhould be only for the puniſhment of evill and the praiſe of them that doe well, will goe, or ſend, or ſuffer a company of theeves or murtherers to goe in his name, and ſpoile and deſtroy them that do well: can their being ſubjects (in reaſon) deprive them of their defence allowed them by the law of nature? yea were they not guilty of ſelfe-murther in ſuffering ſuch a thing? For inſtance, ſome of our Hiſtorians relate of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he was tranſported with ſo deep a hatred againſt his Nobles and Commons, that he ſent an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Miramumalin,</hi> entituled the great King of <hi>Africa, Morocco,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> wherein he offered to render unto him his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to hold the ſame from him by tribute as his Soveraigne Lord, to forgoe the Chriſtian faith (which he held vaine) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that of Mahomet; like enough ſome Court-Chaplaine (may be the Clerk that went on the errand) might warrantize the Kings conſcience, and tell him, that it was <hi>the more ſhame for them who profeſt the Chriſtian Religion, to compell him to it.</hi> But whether the King did lawfully or not, is not our queſtion, but whether the ſubjects might lawfully have reſiſted that attempt of his, and have ſtood for their Religion, Lives, and Liberty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, is it not quite contrary to reaſon, that whereas Kings and Rulers nothing differing by nature from their meaneſt ſubjects, were at firſt conſtituted, and are ſtill continued for the protection, welfare, benefit, yea and ſervice of the people; and who therefore ſhould value their prerogatives, ſcepters, and lives no further then they may advance the publike good, yet if they degenerate, and will be deſtroyers, the people ſhould ſuffer all to be ſpoyled, as if Kingdoms and people had been created by God for the will, pleaſure, profit, yea and luſts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As if a Pilot purpoſely appointed for the ſafe wafting over of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who inſtead thereof will daſh the ſhip againſt the rocks: Or a <hi>Generall</hi> purpoſely choſen (and to whom the ſouldiers have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſworne) for the ſafety of the whole Army, ſhould yet turne the Cannon mouth upon his own ſouldiers, or deliver them all up into the hands of the enemy: the paſſengers and ſouldiers, yea the officers in

the ſhip, and Councell of warre in the Army, ſhould be morally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from doing any thing to prevent their own apparant deſtruction. By this reaſon the Biſhop of <hi>Burgeu</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Baſil</hi> proved the Councell to be above the Pope, and a Kingdom above the King, and ſaid they were but flatterers who taught otherwiſe.<note place="margin">Acts and Monum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And fourthly, doth not right reaſon as much abhorre this, that whereas Princes are the <hi>publike fathers,</hi> and the people owe them the duty of <hi>children,</hi> that theſe children ſhould be prohibited from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their publike fathers from the <hi>greateſt evils:</hi> If our naturall father through ignorance or diſtemper ſhould go into a peſt-houſe, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might by force fetch him out; or if in a raging paſſion go about to kill himſelf, wife, children, or any others, their children may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme them, yea we are tied not to ſuffer <hi>friend</hi> or <hi>foe</hi> to incurre the guilt of rapine or blood, if it lie in our power to hinder it; and (ſpeak to my reaſon) what evill have Princes deſerved, that if they go about to murder themſelves, ſubjects, and children, not any of their people, no not the whole body politick ſhould have power to reſtrain them.</p>

               </note> And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable it is, that becauſe the Biſhops and Clergie of thoſe times ſaw the Princes go about to take down their pride, they were ever the moſt forward to juſtifie the proceeding of the State; and I ſuſpect, in caſe the Tables were turned, and we had a King endeavouring <hi>to take downe the Biſhops, to take away Pluralities, Non-Reſidents,</hi> &amp;c. and a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeeking to maintain them, the world would hear another Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from many of them, who now crie out, that all our defence is damnable.</p>
            <p>But leſt I might be thought not to have weighed the Scripture and reaſons of both ſides equally, I will give you a further account what my thoughts were and are concerning the Scriptures uſually pleaded againſt this reſiſtance, and the reaſons deduced from them. The <hi>ſtrongeſt hold</hi> they pretend to, is built upon <hi>Romans</hi> 13. 1. &amp;c. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 13, 14.<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

to reſiſt let them ſeek another anſwer, in the mean time theſe Texts tie not thoſe from reſiſting (by their own anſwer who have not tyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I appeal to their own judgements, whether theſe Texts forbid <hi>all forcible</hi> reſiſtance; Suppoſe a Prince in his rage ſhould go about to kill himſelfe, or runne ſome innocent man thorow with his ſword, might no man take the ſword out of his hand? and if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a <hi>private man</hi> to diſ-arme him of the weapons wherewith he would kill <hi>one,</hi> may not the State take ſuch weapons out of his or the hands of his Inſtruments, wherewith they goe about to <hi>deſtroy all.</hi> Thirdly, both Texts lay the ſame charge for ſubjection to inferiour Magiſtrates, who likewiſe have their authoritie from God, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Superiour: As our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Pilate,</hi> who was but a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,</hi> thou couldſt have no <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And may no reſiſtance be made againſt the unjuſt violence of inferiour Officers; if there may, it is ſufficient; ſure I am, the Texts have not one word to allow the one and prohibite the other. Fourthly, what one ſyllable in either of theſe Texts ſo much as looks towards the forbidding of a people <hi>to reſiſt Tyrannie,</hi> but onely that we reſiſt not the Magiſtrates in the rightfull exerciſe of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given them by God: the Texts ſpeak not of their <hi>perſons,</hi> but of their <hi>power;</hi> not of their <hi>dictates,</hi> but of their <hi>legall commands;</hi> no more of <hi>Kings</hi> than of an higher Power in an <hi>Ariſtocracie</hi> or <hi>Democracie,</hi> bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all perſons to ſubject themſelves to that Power and Authoritie which in the ſeverall places where they live is the <hi>Higheſt or Supreme power.</hi>

            <p>And indeed the caſe is ſo cleer, that moſt of them who cry down defenſive Arms, though they uſe ſuch Scriptures and Arguments to work upon the conſciences of people, yet when they come to diſpute

            <p>And therefore now I leave the caſe of Divinitie, and ſhall more briefly give you an account what ſatisfied me in the ſecond, I mean <hi>matter of fact,</hi> that His Majeſtie being ſeduced by wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell did leavie war againſt the Parliament: My <hi>great evidence</hi> was, the Parliament judged ſo; the judgement of a Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was never queſtioned till now by a people of <hi>England:</hi> all Patents, Charters, Commiſſions, Grants, Proclamations, and Writs of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> receive their judgement, and are often repealed and made null by a Parliament: all controverſies betwixt the King and Subject receive their finall determination in the Parliament; the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all other Courts are ratified or nullified by a Parliament. I have heard ſome wiſe men ſay, that a Parliament in <hi>England</hi> (like <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirituall man) judgeth all, and it ſelf is judged of none, and therefore if I ſhould give you no other account of my entring upon my Office in the Armie (which was not to fight, nor meddle in the Councell of War, but onely to teach them how to behave themſelves according to the Word, that God might be with them) ſhould I (I ſay) give no other account but the determination of that wiſe aſſembly, I ſhould be acquitted by indifferent men. But although I had learned that no diſhonourable thing ſhould be imagined of that Honourable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, yet I held it my dutie not to yeeld blinde obedience, or go by an implicite Faith, but ſearch whether the things were ſo, and the rather becauſe both ſides have appealed to heaven to that God, who no doubt in due time will clear the righteous cauſe: And upon my ſearch theſe things were quickly apparent.</p>

It was very cleare that the perſons too much prevailing with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had long before this Parliament a deſigne for overthrowing our Lawes, enſlaving our Liberties, and altering our Religion, and it had ſo far prevailed that we were <hi>tantùm non</hi> ſwallowed up, and when through the good Providence of God, this Parliament was called, and many hopes conceived that now his Majeſty ſeeing the miſchiefe of adhering to ſuch ill Counſellors, would for the time to come be wholly guided by the great Councell of his Kingdome, alas it ſoone appeared that the ſame kinde of Counſellors were ſtill moſt prevayling, inſomuch that (ſoone after the pacification with <hi>Scotland</hi>) the <hi>Northerne</hi> Army ſhould have beene brought up to <hi>London,</hi> as appeares by the very Oaths of ſome who ſhould have acted it, a thing then thought ſo pernicious, that not onely the chiefe actors fled beyond the Seas, but many reall Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers earneſtly ſolicited their friends in both Houſes, that this our in excuſable error might be paſſed over, and now to begin upon a new ſcore. But that which made me the more ſuſpect their prevailing with his Majeſty was, that the horrid Rebellion broken out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Rebels pretending His Majeſties and the Queens Commiſſion for their warrant, it was at leaſt three moneths after, before they were proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Traytors, and when it was done no Copies of the Proclamations to be got for love or money; whereas when the <hi>Scots</hi> were proclaimed Rebels and Traytors, it muſt ſpeedily be publiſhed in all the Churches of <hi>England.</hi> I muſt acknowledge this made me to think that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had juſt cauſe to be jealous of great danger. But when His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty returned from <hi>Scotland,</hi> diſcharged the guard which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had ſet for their owne ſafety, &amp; an other denied except under the charge of the Queenes Chamber-lain, and His Majeſty himſelfe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained divers Captaines as a ſupernumerary guard at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> went to the Houſe of Commons after that manner to demand the five members to be delivered unto Him; The Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> (now Generall of the Armie of Papiſts in the <hi>North</hi>) ſent to <hi>Hull,</hi> attempting to ſeize it and the Magazine there, His Majeſty according to the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> Letters retiring from the Parliament to a place of ſtrength, and the Queene go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond Sea to rayſe a party there; I muſt have ſhut my eyes if I had not ſeene danger, and thouſands of thouſands would have thought he Parliament altogether ſenceleſſe if they had not importuned His
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:123864:14"/>
Majeſty (as they did) to ſettle the <hi>Militia,</hi> all former ſettlings of it by Commiſſions of Lievtenancy being confeſſedly voyd: His Majeſty refuſing this in that manner as they thought neceſſary for ſecurity, they Voted the putting of it into the hands of perſons whom they thought the State might confide in (though alas many of them ſince have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to us how vaine is our hope in man,) And ſecured the Town of <hi>Hull</hi> and the Magazine there: ſoone after this His Majeſty in the <hi>North</hi> ſeiſed <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> and under the name of a guard begun to raiſe an Army; all this was done before the Parliament Voted that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſeduced by wicked councell, &amp;c. And when His Majeſties Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was more encreaſed, hee then declared that hee was reſolved by ſtrength to recover <hi>Hull</hi> and the magazine and to ſuppreſſe the <hi>Militia:</hi> After this indeed the Parliament began to make vigorous preparations by their propoſitions for Plate, Money, Horſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This being the true progreſſe and ſtate of the buſines, I ſaw cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all along, the Kingdome and Parliament were in danger, that it was therefore neceſſary to have the <hi>Militia</hi> and Navy in ſafe hands, which His Majeſty alſo acknowledged; That he refuſed to ſettle it for a time in the way they conceived neceſſary, and that by the judgement of both Houſes when they were full, they had power by the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Lawes of the Kingdome to ſettle it eſpecially for a time upon His Majeſties refuſall; That His Majeſty rayſed force, and declared it was to ſuppreſſe the <hi>Militia,</hi> and recover <hi>Hull</hi> and the magazine is as cleare, and made pregnant preparations both at home and beyond the Seas: And the civill Lawyers ſay that pregnant preparations are the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a War. The onely Queſtion remaining was, whether the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did juſtly in ordering the <hi>Militia,</hi> and ſecuring the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine and Navy, in a confeſſed time of danger upon ſuch His Majeſties refuſall.</p>
            <p>What the Kings power and prerogative, and what the Parliaments power was for ſecuring the <hi>Militia</hi> in time of danger according to the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> was out of my profeſſion, and in great part above my skill; But certainly unleſſe I was bound rather to believe the Votes of the Papiſts and other Delinquents about his Majeſty, who hitherto had prevailed to bring upon us all the miſeries that wee have laine under, then the Votes and Judgements of the higheſt Court of Judicature in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:123864:14"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> (which ſo far as I have heard was never by Common Law or Statute Law preſumed to be guilty of, or charged with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Kings prerogative, or the Lawes and Liberties of the Subjects untill now, and who have given us ſo much evidence of their wiſdome, watchfulneſſe and faithfulneſſe) I was bound to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under their Teſtimony, and ſo conſequently that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was ſeduced, &amp;c. And ſurely if men who ſerve upon <hi>Juſtice</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People, party</hi> and <hi>party,</hi> in matters of <hi>life or State,</hi> may <hi>reſt</hi> in the <hi>reſolution</hi> of the <hi>learned Iudges</hi> that this, or that is <hi>Law</hi> when themſelves know it not: well might I <hi>reſt</hi> in the <hi>judgement and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of that Court,</hi> which is the <hi>Iudge of all the Iudicatures</hi> in the Land. And in caſe I were unſatisfied to whom ſhould I appeale in whoſe judgement I might more ſafely reſt, eſpecially when I ſaw their Vote agreeable to that which is the ſupreame Law of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, namely, that <hi>Publique ſafety is the higheſt and deepeſt Law,</hi> and that it is requiſite that <hi>every State have a power in time of danger to preſerve it ſelfe from ruine?</hi> and no Law of <hi>England</hi> more known, then that the Parliament is the higheſt Court from whence there is no appeale. This ſatisfaction I had then, and ſince by the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Remonſtrances of the Parliament concerning theſe Military matters, and by other Bookes lately publiſhed, it is moſt apparent that they have not uſurped upon His Majeſties Prerogative, but what they have done is agreeable to the practiſe of former Parliaments, In putting the <hi>Militia,</hi> Forts and Navy into ſafe hands in theſe times of danger; And that it was therefore lawfull for them, yea, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to take up theſe defenſive Armes, and conſequently to call in for ſupply from all ſuch who ſhould ſhare with them in the benefit of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and to diſable ſuch from hurting them who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded: I ſpend no time to anſwer the Objections that ſome make, that His Majeſty could not tarry at <hi>LONDON</hi> with ſafety of His Perſon, that the Lords and Commons that are with Him, were driven away by popular Tumults, and could not enjoy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Votes, &amp;c.

               <hi>mee</hi> to owne this Cauſe; you deſire to know <hi>whether I ſee not yet reaſon to repent of what I have done, I confeſſe</hi> I never undertooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but I ſaw cauſe to repent of my miſcariage through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which cleaves to mee, and great cauſe I have to bewaile my many failings in this great Worke, but for the Worke it ſelfe, I as ſolemnely <hi>profeſſe,</hi> I never ſaw cauſe to repent of my appearing in it; the Cauſe is a right Cauſe, the Cauſe of God, my call to it, a cleare call, and though the Worke prove harder and longer then at firſt it was thought, yet the Cauſe is farre clearer then at the firſt,</p>
            <p>The Worke indeed is <hi>harder</hi> then I expected, for whoever could have believed he ſhould have ſeen in <hi>England</hi> ſo many Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons even after their ſolemne Proteſtation, to <hi>defend the Priviledge of Parliament,</hi> And their own Vote; that His Majeſty ſeduced by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed councell intended War againſt the Parliament, ſo ſhamefully to betray the truſt committed to them? ſo many of the Proteſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion joyning with an Army of Papiſts (under pretence of mantain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proteſtant Religion againſt a Proteſtant Parliament) to fight themſelves into popery? ſo many unworthy Gentlemen fight to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a Parliament, and thereby fight themſelves and poſterity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſlavery? ſo many Papiſts in Armes contrary to ſo <hi>many knowne Lawer,</hi> and armed with Commiſſion, to diſarme Proteſtants contrary to their <hi>knowne Liberties,</hi> and the Proteſtants who exceed their number an hundred fold not to riſe as one man to ſubdue them? And who would have believed that he ſhould have ſeen after all this an Army rayſed by the Parliament in ſuch an <hi>extremity,</hi> for ſuch an <hi>end,</hi> (having <hi>haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded their lives,</hi> undergon all theſe <hi>hardſhips,</hi> performed all theſe <hi>ſervices,</hi> and whoſe untimely disbanding may prove our irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ruine) ſtrai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> intentions of the Parliament and alſo of their adverſaries. For the Parliament, multitudes would not believe, but that they had further aimes then their own and the publique ſafety, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it not to depoſe His Majeſty, yet by force of Armes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

him to that which is not fit for a King to yeild to; But now by their frequent petitioning of His Majeſty eſpecially by the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of their late Propoſitions and Inſtructions, wherein they deſire a preſent disbanding of all Armes, even before any other bills were paſt, and were willing to have the Ports, Forts and Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, &amp;c Of the Kingdome reſigned up into His Majeſties hands, provided onely that in theſe times of danger they might, <hi>Pro bac vice,</hi> be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of ſuch as the State might confide in; The ſincerity of their intentions are now ſo plaine, that I think <hi>Malignity</hi> it ſelf cannot but be convinced of them.</p>
            <p>And the intentions of the contrary councells are as plaine, their mask now falling off, and their deſigne more then ever diſcovered to be the overthrow of Parliament, liberty, Lawes and Religion. For at firſt we had Declarations to preſerve all the juſt priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but now we ſee men proclaimed Traytors for executing the Commands of the two Houſes, and the two Houſes themſelves, if not in direct, yet in equivalent tearmes proclaimed Traytors, yea denyed to be a Parliament, becauſe His Majeſty withdrawes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and after multitudes of Petitions refuſes to returne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of their Members have deſerted them, and are protected by His Majeſty from the Houſes who have ſent for them. Yea, they are required to recall their Votes as illegall, and that ſuch as they have fined and impriſoned may bring their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to be tried in an inferiour Court. Yea, people provoked to ſcorne them, and thereupon multitudes not fearing to trample upon, and caſt as vile ſcorne and contemptunjuſtly upon that thrice-honorable Court, as ever was caſt juſtly upon the Commiſſaries Courts.</p>
            <p>We have heretofore been aſſured that the knowne Lawes of the Land ſhould be the onely rule of government: but (to name no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtances) now we ſee the Commiſſion of <hi>Array</hi> to be juſtified to be Law, which the Parliament hath not only declared, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, and the Countries (where ever it hath prevailed) found, to be the utter deſtruction of all the Lawes made for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects liberty.</p>
            <p>Heretofore Proclamations were put out that no Papiſts ſhould be entertained into His Majeſties Army, becauſe the reſolution was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:123864:16"/>
to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion; But now we ſee them armed, and armed with Commiſſion, and Proteſtant Doctors in their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings juſtifying it, and being armed dare profeſſe their Religion publiquely, ſet up their maſſe in the ſecond City of the Kingdome, cutting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> pieces, and burning Bibles, and as multitudes of reports come from beyond the Seas, (and the ſupplies that come from thence confirme it) all the Papiſts in Chriſtendome contributing to this War as to the Catholique cauſe. Heretofore the Liberty of the Subject ſeemed to be ſtood for, yea defended againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, (as if it were poſſible the repreſentative body ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave it ſelfe) and in the meane time while theſe things are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hundreds, yea thouſands of his Majeſties Subjects plundred with His Majeſties Proclamations againſt plundering, in the hands of diverſe of the plunderers. And their perſons led away in Ropes and Chaines like <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallyſlaves, and many caſt into Priſons and Dungeons only for detending themſelves againſt robbers and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers abuſing His Majeſties Name: where their Jaylours uſe them worſe then the <hi>Turkes</hi> doe their Chriſtian ſlaves, or one that hath any thing of man in him could uſe a dog.</p>
            <p>And when all theſe things are <hi>now</hi> done, the Parliament not only ſitting, but having ſo much ſtrength in the Field, what can we expect when theſe men have prevailed, when at the putting on of their harneſſe their uſuall language is nothing but blaſphemy againſt God, (not to be mentioned,) and againſt His people calling all that adhere to his and the Kingdoms Cauſe, Parliament dogs, and Parliament rogues? what language will you expect to heare if once they come triumphantly to put it off? If while the event is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine they cut us out ſuch kinde of Lawes, Liberties, and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-priviledges as theſe are, if God for our ſinnes ſell us into their hands, thinke if you can, what Lawes, Liberties, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-priviledges our poſteritie ſhall finde Recorded in our bloud; for our ſelves alas, <hi>who ſhall live when God doth this,</hi> nay <hi>who would deſire to live?</hi> I would rather with holy <hi>Auſtin</hi> make it my humble ſuite to that God whoſe are the iſſues of life and death, that he would rather take mee from the Earth, then let mee live to ſee His deare Church, and my native Countrey delivered
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:123864:16"/>
into the hands of ſuch Blaſphemous, and barbarous Men.</p>
            <p>So that in ſtead of repenting and withdrawing from the Worke, I could wiſh that my voyce were able to reach into every corner of the Kingdome, and that I could awaken all people to ſee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and miſery that is flowing in upon them. That every ſoule might be quickened up to make his owne, and helpe to make <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> bleeding, dying <hi>Englands</hi> peace with God, and every one who hath any intereſt in Heaven to cry mightily unto that God in whoſe hand the hearts of Kings are, and who rules in the Kingdomes of men, that the power of our God might be great towards us, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away theſe imminent calamities, and turning the heart of our King towards His great and faithfull Councell, and reſcuing Him out of the hands of this Generation of men who delight in blood. Our God hath nor yet ſayd, pray not for this people, but if the Lord ſay he hath no delight in us, Righteous art thou O Lord, and juſt are all thy judgements: onely let us not be acceſſary to our own deſtruction, and the deſtruction of ſo flouriſhing a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; let us not through our covetouſneſſe or cowardize, ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love or ſloth, betray our Lawes, Liberties, Lives, Religion into the hands of men from whoſe hands, we befoole our ſelves if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more mercy, or leſſe miſery, then the poore Chriſtians of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> found with the <hi>Turkes,</hi> when thankes to their owne niggardlineſſe (O let it never be ſo with <hi>England</hi>) they fell into their hands. Oh let us labour to prevent their Swords thruſting into our bodies, and their Swords into our Soules, let our God doe with us what he will, let us doe what we ſhould, and while we have any money in our purſes, any blood in our veines, or any ſpirits in us, devote all to the maintenance of this rightfull cauſe, and if we periſh, we periſh.</p>
            <p>Nor doe I feare to be for this condemned by any right diſcerning man as an incendiary to a Civill War, I know the miſeries of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill War: Warre is the ſevereſt of all Gods judgements, and Civill War the cruelleſt of all Warres, where is the greateſt hatred, the deepeſt treachery, the moſt unnaturall butcheries, where the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther murders the ſonne, the ſonne the Father, the brother em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues his hands in his brothers blood, and whoever gaines, all are
