         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But being called from my ſtudies by urgent occaſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the impreſsion of this 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon the Creed was neare finiſhed, I am conſtrained to publiſh it in a leſſer volume, then I firſt intended it, though (I take it) in as many lines, or more words then either of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Bookes upon the ſame argument, to wit, the knowledge of Chriſt, and of him crucified, doe
<pb facs="tcp:7904:6"/>
containe. The matter is not great, and ſo much the leſſe, becauſe I have ready <hi>(in adverſariis)</hi> divers Sermons, or ſhort Treatiſes as appendices or appertinences to all theſe three Books, <hi>reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi> &amp; to another intitled <hi>Chriſts anſwer to Iohns diſciples,</hi> or an Introduction to the knowledge of Chriſt &amp;c. to be publiſhed as ſoone as God ſhall be pleaſed to grant me ability, and opportunity. Other three Bookes I have in like readineſſe for the Preſſe, to wit, the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of Comments upon the Creede, or a treatiſe of the naturall mans ſervitude to ſinne, and of that poore remnant of Free-will which is left in the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they be regenerated in Chriſt by the ſpirit, together with directions for the right uſe or imployment of Free-will, after our Baptiſme, for the accompliſhment, or rather for performance of the conditions on our parts required, that mortification may be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in us by the ſpirit of God. The next of the three Bookes promiſed is the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Booke of theſe Commentaries containing a treatiſe upon the Articles of Chriſts comming to judgement, of the Reſurrection of the dead, &amp; of the Life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, which is the finall ſetence which at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

to Iudgement ſhall paſſe upon all men, as well upon them which have bin long dead, as thoſe that ſhall be found alive at his comming. The laſt Booke of theſe Comments containes the ſecond part of a treatiſe heretofore begun, and in part publiſhed, concerning the Articles of the holy Catholique Church; of the Communion of Saints, and the Forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. What I here promiſe or may occaſion the Readers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially young students in divinity, to expect, ſhall by Gods aſſiſtance be ſhortly or in good time performed, either by myſelfe or by my Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: unto whoſe diſpoſalls, I am not likely to leave much; ſcarce any thing elſe beſides Books and Papers.</p>

                  <p>3 But in offering gifts and ſacrifices out of true compaſſion towards his people, in making Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Attonement for them, our high Prieſt did and doth farre exceed all legall Prieſts, all other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſpirituall Governours. <hi>In all things</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle) <hi>it became him to be made like unto his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that hee might be a mercifull and a faithfull high Prieſt in things concerning God, that hee might make reconciliation for the ſinnes of his people. For in that he ſuffered and was tempted, hee is able to ſuccour them that are tempted. Heb.</hi> 2. 17. All his ſufferings and temptations were requiſite for his Qualification<note place="margin">Of this point ſee more at large in the 3 book of theſe commentaries upon the creed Sect. 2. cap. 6.</note> to his Prieſtly function, which was to be mercifull and compaſſionate towards ſinners: more compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate towards all ſorts of ſinners, then any one ſinner could be either towards himſelfe or others; Becauſe he had more full and deeper experience of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7904:18"/>
the wages due to ſinne, than any ſinners in this life can have. Hence ſaith our Apoſtle in the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceding to theſe now in handling, <hi>Though he were the Sonne yet learned he obedience by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> As he was the Sonne of God he knew all things, could learne nothing; yet as the ſonne of man, or as man deſign'd for our high Prieſt, he had a ſenſible experience of the paines and puniſhments due to ſinne, and of the unknowne ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the ſecond death, which as he was God hee could not have, and which as man, unleſſe hee had beene the Sonne of God withall, he could not have borne. The obedience which he learned by ſuffering (as was obſerved before) was paſſive not active. And his unſpeakable patience (even while hee ſuffered theſe grievous and unknowne paines and terrours) is mentioned by our Apoſtle as a part of his Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <hi>v. 7.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7904:19"/>
their worth and learning I ſpeake it,) very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and inconſiderately. For firſt, that ejaculation of our Saviour upon the Croſſe, though uttered with a loud voice or cry, beares rather the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a complaint or expoſtulation, then of a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prayer or ſupplication, (if we take it in the literall ſenſe) as if it had been extorted from the extremitie of paine which he then ſuffered. The truth is, it was neither a Praier nor complaint, but <hi>merateſſera,</hi> a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or watch-word to his Auditours or Spectatours to rally their tumultuous diſordered thoughts. And if they had taken their former indignities done unto him on the Croſſe, and his admirable patience in ſuffering them without murmure or complaint, into ſerious conſideration, they might have diſeerned that this was the man or promiſed Meſſias, whoſe ſufferings the Pſalmiſt did deſcribe, and by his owne ſufferings in part repreſent. For our Saviour uttered not theſe words of the 22 <hi>Pſalme</hi> untill all the other paſſages in the ſame <hi>Pſalme</hi> were ocularly exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and fulfilled in him.</p>
                  <p>2 Secondly, we never read, nor have we any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſuſpect, but reaſons pregnant to deny that our Saviour did ever deprecate the death of the Croſſe; or could be daunted with any indignities which the Iews could doe unto him, either by word or fact: either by themſelves or their Aſſociates. And for this reaſon (as hath been obſerved before,) when<note place="margin">In the 8 book of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. <hi>par.</hi> 3.</note>

had been the more provident of the two, if his Maſter had uttered the former words either by way of Prayer or complaint.

                  <p>4 The Apoſtles words containe a full expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Pſalmiſts ſpeech, or rather a record of the fulfilling of his prophecy. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Save me from the Lyons mouth, for thou hast heard,</hi> that is, <hi>thou haſt delivered me from the hornes of the Vnicorne.</hi> God had delivered his Sonne (whoſe part in all his ſufferings this Pſalmiſt did reſpectively act, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent) from the firſt temptation in the wilderneſſe; and now he prayes he would deliver him from this farre greater temptation in the Garden, (when the whole hoaſt of darkneſſe had inviron'd him) with ſtrong cryes and teares, <hi>Father if it be' poſsible let this Cup paſse from me!</hi> And ſo <hi>S.

                     </gap>ttely removed from him. And after this houre was ended wee doe not read, nor is there any circumſtance in holy writ to enduce ſo much as a conjecture that he ſtood in fear of any evill that could befall him by the Iewes or Roman Souldiers, <hi>but moſt patiently</hi> (as our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7904:21"/>
ſpeaks) <hi>endured the Croſſe and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> Of what kind ſoever the paines which hee ſuffered in the Garden were (a point in the former Book diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed at large) the ſuffering of them was neither neceſſary, or requiſite, for making ſatisfaction to God the Father for the ſinnes of the world. For ſuch ſatisfaction was abundantly made by the meere death of the Croſſe. Yet were theſe his unknowne, or unexperienced ſufferings in the Garden, either neceſſary, or moſt expedient for his Qualification and Conſecration to his everlaſting Prieſthood, that he might be a mercifull and faithfull high Prieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to compaſſionate and ſuccour all ſuch as are in any kind tempted. Briefly, ſeeing one ſpeciall part of his Prieſthood is to make interceſſion and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for us in all our diſtreſſes, it was in the wiſdome of God expedient that he ſhould haue juſt occaſion to offer up prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong cryes for himſelfe. And in aſmuch as theſe his ſupplications were heard of his Father, we have aſſurance that he will not ceaſe to make interceſſion for us, untill God grant us deliverance from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſo we pray unto him in ſuch feare and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as he in his agony did unto his Father. He will in this caſe doe for us as he deſired his Father to doe for him.</p>
                  <p>5 It ſeemeth the Conſecration of legall high Prieſts, ſo long as they accurately obſerved the rites and manner preſcribed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> did one way or other coſt them ſo deare that no man which duly weighed the charge laid upon them would be very ambitious of the office. Hence ſaith our Apoſtle,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7904:21"/>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>No man taketh this honour unto himſelfe but he that is called of God as Aaron was:</hi> So likewiſe Chriſt tooke not to himſelf this honour to be made an high Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my ſonne, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> put this charge or honour upon him; againſt his will queſtionleſſe, as man, albeit hee moſt obediently ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his Fathers will, becauſe hee had taken the forme of a Servant upon him. His Conſecration we may ſafely avouch coſt him dearer then the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of all the legall Prieſts that had been before him; or of all the Chriſtian Biſhops, or Prelates which have lived ſince did or doth them, whether ſeverally or joyntly. Never did any man utter thoſe words ſo truly and ſincerely, <hi>Epiſcopari nolo,</hi> as hee did, or pray ſo earneſtly, that the charge of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration might be mitigated whilſt hee was in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony. But how deare ſoever his Conſecration coſt him, the coſts and charges of it though altogether unknown to us, were recompenced by the purchaſe which he gained by it: For, as it followeth, being thus conſecrated, he became the Author of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſalvation to all that obey him, and their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was and is as pleaſant to him; as his ſufferings whereby he was conſecrated, were for the preſent diſtaſtfull.</p>

No; whatſoever elſe was required for his Qualification, there could be no true and perfect Conſecration to his Prieſthood without a Sacrifice, without a bloody Sacrifice.

If no Prieſt at all,</q> what had hee to doe to offer any Sacrifice, eſpecially a bloody one? For this was a ſervice ſo peculiar to the legall Prieſts which were

the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that it was ſacriledge for the ſonnes of <hi>David,</hi> For the greateſt Kings of Iudah to attempt it. If you will ſay then he was a Prieſt, you muſt acknowledge him either to have beene a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> or after the order of <hi>Aaron:</hi> If you ſay hee was a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> you plainly contradict this Apoſtle whom you acknowledge to be the great Teacher of you Gentiles; for he ſaith <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 14. of this Epiſtle, <hi>It is evident that our Lord ſprang out of Iudah, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Tribe Moſes ſpake nothing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Prieſthood.</hi> And againe <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 4. hee ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>2 Was he then whilſt hee lived here on earth, a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and by this title authorized to offer ſacrifice? This I preſume you dare not avouch. For <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a Prieſt according to <hi>endleſſe life;</hi> his Prieſthood was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall everlaſting Prieſthood.

                  <p>3 Theſe objections I confeſſe could hardly be anſwered, if wee ſhould grant what many moderne Divines out of incogitancy have taught, or taken u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon truſt without further examination, to wit, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7904:23"/>
the eternall Sonne of God our Lord and Saviour was an high Prieſt from eternitie, or an high Prieſt from his birth as man, or from his Baptiſme when hee was anointed by the holy Ghoſt unto his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall function, or whilſt he was upon the Croſſe. But not granting this, (as wee have no reaſon to admit any branch of it,) the anſwer to the former objection is clear and eaſie: Betwixt a Prieſt compleat, or actually conſecrated, and no Prieſt at all, <hi>datur medium participationis;</hi> there is a meane <q>or third eſtate or condition, to wit, a Prieſt in <hi>fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> though not in <hi>facto,</hi> or a Prieſt <hi>inter conſecran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> that is, in the <hi>interims</hi> of his Conſecration before hee be actually and compleatly conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</q> Such a man, or rather ſuch a Prieſt was <hi>Aaron</hi> during the firſt ſixe or ſeven dayes of his Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet dare no Iew avouch that after the firſt or ſecond day of his ſeparation from common men, he was no more then an ordinary man, no Prieſt at all; nor that on the ſeaventh day he was a Prieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually conſecrated, but as yet in his Conſecration. He was not till the eight day qualified to offer up Sacrifices unto God, but had peculiar Sacrifices offered for his Conſecration by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4 Briefly then, the Sacrifice of the Sonne of God upon the Croſſe, whether we conſider it as of fered by himſelfe, or by his Father, (as it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid in Scripture to be offered by both,) was the abſolute accompliſhment of all legall Sacrifices or ſervices Aaronicall. And yet but an intermediate (though an eſpeciall) part of his Conſecration to the Prieſthood after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> not

the <hi>ultimum eſse</hi> or accompliſhment of it. It was not <hi>terminated</hi> till the day of his Reſurrection from the dead.

After which day death hath no more dominion over him, but <hi>Hee</hi> ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power over death and the powers of darkneſſe, that neither can annoy, or aſſault him. And from this day, and not before doth his endleſſe everlaſting Prieſthood <hi>commence.</hi> And being thus actually conſecrated by his Reſurrection from the dead, that is, made both Lord and Chriſt, hee is become the Author of everlaſting ſalvation, which was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Point.</p>

                  <p>The later diſtinction is very dangerous; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer impertinently unneceſſary: for if by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind we once come to underſtand ſome of all ſorts of men, we ſhall commit no new error, but only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſame; if by the whole world which God the Father is ſaid to have created, wee underſtand only ſome portion of every principall part of this univerſe, as ſome portion of the heavens, ſome of the ſtarres, ſome part of the earth, ſome of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſome part of theayre, ſome of every ſort of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable or living things, but not abſolutely all. The other diſtiction of <hi>ſufficientèr</hi> and <hi>efficientèr,</hi> falls under the <hi>common error</hi> of moſt moderne Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſts or <note n="a" place="margin">If they had ſaid Chriſt was the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all men, or had merited ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all, not the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient working cauſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all, but only to ſuch as obey him faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they had come nearer the truth.</note> Divines, which is, to take upon them to divide things which in their nature are indiviſible, (as the Will of God, the Death of Chriſt, or the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of his ſufferings,) &amp; to leave other termes which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7904:27"/>
import matter diviſible, undiſtinguiſhed. Such is the terme or word <hi>Redemption</hi> paſſively taken, not as it is an act of God, or as it in his <hi>preſcience.</hi> For howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the will of God, or the value of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings be altogether indiviſible becauſe abſolutely infinite, yet of Redemption purchaſed for us by Chriſts bloody death and paſſion, there are (as you pleaſe to call them) ſeverall parts or degrees. Now <hi>that</hi> may be abſolutely true of ſome one, or more parts of degrees which is not true of all: The firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our Redemption purchaſed by Chriſt, was the payment of the ranſome for our ſinnes unto his Father, and our freedome from ſlavery by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over Satan. This part or theſe degrees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption are alike common to all mankind: Chriſt whether in his death upon the Croſſe, or in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the powers of darkneſſe in the Garden did ſuffer aſmuch for any one as for all. God was in him reconciling all men unto himſelfe. All were ſet free <hi>de iure</hi> from Satans ſervitude.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part or degree of Redemption is our actuall admiſſion into the Catholique Church: or (which is all one) our ſolemne calling to be the Sons of God. And this part of redemption is common to all who are baptized according to Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given to his Apoſtles and their Succeſſors to this purpoſe. Another part of our Redemption, whether that be altogether diſtinct from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or but a conſequent to it, is our actuall exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the rage or tyranny of ſinne within our ſelves whilſt we live here in the fleſh. And this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of redemption is proper only to thoſe, who
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7904:27"/>
though they live in the fleſh doe not live according to the fleſh, or the faſhions of the world; as having their <hi>hearts purified</hi> by a lively faith in Chriſts death. The laſt part or finall accompliſhment of our Redemption is the exemption of both body and ſoule from the powers of hell and death by Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection unto endleſſe glory, which is the everlaſting ſalvation here meant: And this is proper only unto ſuch as finally ſhall be ſayed by continuance in faith and obedience.

                  </p>
                  <p>2 The method of our preſent inquiry or ſearch into this grand myſterie muſt be this:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, who this <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was, according to whoſe order the Sonne of God was called to be a Prieſt? or how <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> whoſoever he were, did repreſent or ſhadow out the perſon of the Sonne of God?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wherein the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> did conſiſt? or wherein it differred from the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron?</hi> and what calling hee had to ſuch a Prieſthood?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what divine Deſignement, or calling the Sonne of God had to his everlaſting Prieſthood?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a parallel betweene the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> or other of his Succeſſors to this legall Prieſthood, and the Conſecration of the Sonne of God to his everlaſting Prieſthood prefigured or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed, not by <hi>Aaron</hi> or his Succeſſors, but by <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> before the Law was given.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the peculiar acts or exerciſes of the Sonne of God's everlaſting Prieſthood. This fift or laſt Point muſt be referred as an appendix unto the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Sonne of God's Aſcenſion, and his ſitting at the right hand of God the Father. All theſe are Points of good uſe, and worthy of deeper and better
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7904:29"/>
conſideration then they uſually are taken into, by moſt Interpreters of ſacred Writ, or Controverſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writers.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Queſtion only may ſeeme to be too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: And ſo perhaps it is indeed, if wee ſhould take upon us to determine the individualitie of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech's</hi> perſon, after whoſe order the Sonne of God was conſecrated or made a Prieſt. But on the other ſide it would be preſumptuous, abſolutly to deny this <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> to have been the ſame individuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom the later Iewes generally, and many late learned Chriſtian writers take him for. The greateſt difficulty in this Point ariſeth from the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Melchiſedech, Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Without father, without mother, without deſcent, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning of dayes, nor end of life, but made like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the Sonne of God, abideth a Prieſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 From this place ſome would peremptorily conclude that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> could be no mortal man, no ſonne of <hi>Adam;</hi> but either the holy Ghoſt or the ſonne of God then appearing to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude or likeneſſe of man.

                  <p>To wave or rather diſmiſſe their opinion, who think <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was the holy Ghoſt the third perſon in Trinitie, ſeeing it is but a conjecture of ſome few, who rather wave then proſecute it; Let us ſee what probabilitie there is, that this <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> ſhould be the eternal Word or Son of God

But was our high Prieſt, or could he have been at that time the true Sonne of God, and the God whoſe Sonne he was, not as truly then his Father as now he is? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> who apreared to <hi>Abraham</hi> at leaſt in the likeneſſe of man, and in the realitie of an high Prieſt, were no other perſon beſide the Sonne of God, it will concludently follow, that the Sonne of God was then an high Prieſt <hi>after the order of Melchiſedech;</hi> or more then ſo, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was the Sonne of God. How then ſaith our Apoſtle that the Sonne of God was made an high Prieſt by the word of the oath which was ſince the Law, and by vertue of this oath conſecrated for evermore, being (as the Author of this opinion ſuppoſeth) the Prieſt of the moſt high God long before the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: or if <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was then the true and only Son of God, how is it ſaid by our Apoſtle, <hi>Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 3. that he was <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, made like unto the Son of God? Was the Sonne of God made like unto himſelfe by taking the likeneſſe of man upon him? Or rather was the manhood or likeneſſe in which he appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> made like unto the Sonne of God? The former part or diviſion of this <hi>dilemma</hi> is improbable; The later altogether impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For that man, or that likeneſſe of man, who bleſſed <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14. had a beginning and an end of dayes; unleſſe the Author of this opinion will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7904:31"/>
maintaine that the manhood or likeneſſe of man, wherein the Sonne of God appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was coeternall to his perſon; was begotten of God, (not made) before all Worlds, and to continue uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him world without end. Both parts of this aſſertion reſpectively contradict two fundamentall Articles of our Creede: The one, that all things nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, whether viſible or inviſible were created of God by his Sonne, they had no being from eternity: The other, that the Sonne of God was made man of a woman in time, having no permanent body, or likeneſſe of man when he was ſo conceived: whence it is cleare that the <hi>Meichiſedech</hi> who bleſſed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was not the eternall Sonne of God; nor made like unto him for his eternitie by the body of man which he aſſumed or appeared in.</p>
                  <p>5 But it is not all one to refell other mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or interpretations of Divine oracles, and to maintaine our owne aſſertions, or (as the preſent occaſion requireth) to clear the forecited place. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>He</hi> (to wit, <hi>Melchiſedech) was made like unto the Sonne of God, being without father, without mother, without genealogie, without beginning or end of dayes.</hi> For there is an opinion or preſumed Doctrine which hath gotten ſo long poſſeſſion of many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Chaires, as will hardly brooke any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either from the Pulpit, or from private writers: The opinion is, that <hi>Melchiſedech being without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without mother &amp;c.</hi> was herein like unto the Sonne of God; or the Sonne of God like to him in that he hath no Father in earth, nor a mother in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But be the Authors of this opinion how great
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7904:31"/>
ſoever, their followers how many ſoever, both moſt acute; all the ſtrength which the wit of one can adde unto the authoritie of the other, is but as if they ſhould joyne hands or forces to take faſt hold on the ſheath or ſcabbard, having given the hilts of the ſword of the ſpirit into the hands of the Iew, who may at his pleaſure turne the points of our own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons upon us, unleſſe we learne to keepe them more warily, and handle them more skilfully then theſe men have done. For he that hath a Father in Heaven, may truly and abſolutely be ſaid to have a Father: For God is more truly our Father, then thoſe whom we call Fathers on earth. Hence ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Call no man father opon earth, for there is but one your Father which in Heaven. Math.</hi> 23. 9. Yet is this God more truly Chriſt's Father, then he is ours. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he that hath a true Mother on earth, may truly and abſolutely be ſaid to have a Mother; otherwiſe all of us ſhould be mother leſſe children from our birth; For none of us had an heavenly Mother, none of our Mothers were brought to bed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>6 It being then granted that our Saviour had a true Father in Heaven, and a true Mother on earth, he muſt needs in both reſpects be more unlike unto <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who (as our Apoſtle faith) <hi>was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out father or mother,</hi> then like unto him, in that he had no Mother in Heaven, no father on earth. Whence if wee ſhould maintaine this ſimilitude intended by our Apoſtle, to conſiſt either in whole, or part in Chriſt's being in this ſort without father or mother; the Iew might thus retort, <hi>argumento ad homines effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caci,</hi>

That we Chriſtians were a brood of monſters, and not the naturall offſpring of men and women, becauſe none of us have a man for his mother, none of us a woman for his father. Beſides, one of the two Propoſitions whereon they labour to build our faith by this croſſe device, is no ſound pillar, but a broken or craſed prop. For if Chriſt be truly ſtiled the Sonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> he had fathers on earth according to the fleſh, though not begotten by a carnall generation: nor was he the Sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> by carnall conception, yet truly her Sonne, and ſhee truly his Mother, and by conſequence <hi>Abraham</hi> as truly his Father.

                  <p>7 The moſt ancient Editions of <hi>Macrobius</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a jeſt of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> broken upon <hi>Herod</hi> for killing his Sonne at the ſame time that he butchered the Hebrew Infants; <hi>Mallem Herodis eſſe percum quam fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium.</hi> Some ancient Chriſtians to ſalve the truth of this narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being ſomewhat ſuſpicious, (becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> at that time had no knowne Sonne that was a child) have made the old Tyrant father of a young ſonne (ſuppoſed to be borne unto him by a ſecond wife of Iewiſh, if not of <hi>Davids</hi> progenie) which the age wherein hee lived, never laid unto his charge. Some later criticks better able to diſprove this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious broode, then apt to reforme that error in themſelves, which unreform'd in others did beget it, have not ſpared to charge their Bretheren (in time their fathers) with falſification of <hi>Macrobius</hi> his Text, as if the forecited paſſage had been inſerted by ſome ancient Chriſtians, as many verſes in Sibylla's ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have beene, unleſſe theſe and the like <hi>Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſses</hi> faile in their criticiſmes. But for <hi>Macrobius</hi> his text, it is without queſtion uncorrupt, and the Chriſtian Fathers free from that falſification of it, whereof late Criticks have accuſed them. The zeale of the ancient Fathers, and the cenſorious ſawcineſſe of later Criticks did alike overreach their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But this, as I ſaid, is a fault common to us, and to thoſe that are farre our betters. We maintaine our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7904:33"/>
owne poſittions, as if wee were waking: Wee peruſe good Authors, as if wee had never lookt upon them but in a ſlumber; yet what punie Logician but would ſcorne to ſwallow this fallacy in a dreame, <hi>Chaerilus fuit vir bonus, Chaerilus fuit poeta, ergo Chaerilus fuit bonus poeta: Chaerilus</hi> was a good man, and a Poet; therefore a good Poet. The forementioned criticall collection is in regard of its forme a like falſe and disjointed: only the matter of it is not ſo vulgar or palpable. The roote of the Criticks erronious cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was this; <hi>Herod</hi> killed the Syrian or Hebrew In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; amongſt theſe Infants hee killed his owne ſon, <hi>ergo,</hi> this ſonne of <hi>Herod</hi> when hee killed him was an Infant. That <hi>Herod</hi> about the ſame time wherein the fants of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Bethleem</hi> were by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſlaine, did out of his jealous feare command <hi>Antipater</hi> his turbulent ſonne to be put to death, no modern Critick ſhall be ever able to diſprove. That the killing of his owne ſonne (being come to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of age) with theſe Infants, doth better ſort with the analogy of Gods Iuſtice uſually manifeſted in the infatuation of Politicians, and with the literall ſenſe and character of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ieſt, (taking it as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius</hi> hath expreſſed it) then if hee had ſlaine the ſame party in his Infancy, ſhall <note n="*" place="margin">In a diquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (by way of Homily or ſermon upon the Epiphany) at what time &amp; from what place the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi or Wiſe men of the Eaſt came to Ieruſalem to adore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, whom they rightly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the King of the Iewes by birth.</note> elſwhere (by Gods aſſiſtance) be declared.</p>

Wee doe not, wee need not ſay ſo. The day is oftimes mentioned in the Scripture without any mention of the night. Yet to ſeeke after a myſticall ſenſe in all ſuch places, were to ſet our wits a wandring in a waking dream. But ſeeing in the Story of the worlds creation, wee find ſuch accurate and conſtant mention of the evening and morning making one day, untill all the works of the ſixe daies were accompliſhed, and no mention of any evening in the ſeaventh day which God did ſanctify for a day of reſt; wee may with the Ancients ſafely admit the firſt ſixe daies to be as a Map, or Calender of the ſixe ages of this tranſitory world, wherein there is a continuall viciſſitude of light and darkneſſe, no joy or pleaſure without ſorrow and griefe, for their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors and companions; and the Moſaicall deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>2 By perfect analogy to this and the like, not more myſticall then orthodoxall interpretation of Scripture, not merely authoriz'd by the Greeke or Latine Fathers, but preſuppos'd by our Apoſtle as unqueſtionable among the ancient Iewes, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our intended concluſion: What was that? That the omiſſion of every mans Genealogie, whoſe name or deeds are ſpecified in the ſacred Story, is alwayes a ſigne or token of ſome latent myſtery?

                  <p>3 It was the ſpeech of one man but is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true of all, <hi>Mortalis mortalem genui,</hi> and it is as neceſſarily and eſſentially true of God, <hi>Immortalis immortalem gignit.</hi> For ſeeing God is more eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more immutably immortall, more truly eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall then we are mortal; Then he which is as truly the Sonne of God, as we are the Sonnes of men or <hi>Adam,</hi> muſt needs be as abſolutely eternall as the Deitie or divine nature, or as God the Father himſelfe: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the generation ſhould be equivocall and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not univocall; as contrary to nature it ſelfe, and as prodigious, as for a mortall man to beget an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Sonne; as for a woman to conceive a God. And if there were no other places of Scripture (as God be praiſed there are plenty) to inferre the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute eternitie or eternall generation of the Sonne of God againſt the Arrian or other heretique, the very foundation of our Apoſtles ſimilitude between <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> and Chriſt in the Chapter following, doth clearly repreſent thus much to all that look not on it with Iewiſh ſpectacles.

                  <p>The ſecond, how the matter and manner of this bleſſing proves this <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> to be <hi>Sem.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:7904:36"/>2 But what kind of bleſſing did our Apoſtle meane? Verball only or by way of ſalutation? So the people may bleſſe their Prieſts; the worſt of men their godlieſt Prelates, and wretched'ſt beggers greateſt Kings; of ſuch kind of bleſſing the maxime undoubtedly affirmed by our Apoſtle, cannot be true. Of what bleſſing then is it moſt undoubtedly true: Of reall and ſolemne bleſſings authentiquely imparted <hi>ex officio,</hi> as when a Biſhop confirmeth children; or by way of bequeſt, as when the father beſtowes an heritage with his bleſſing upon the Son; As <hi>Abraham</hi> bleſſed <hi>Iſaac, Iſaac Iacob, Iacob Iuda</hi> and his Bretheren.</p>
                  <p>3 Whom then may we imagine this man ſhould be, which in this ſort bleſled <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was a man, than whom, there was none greater amongſt the Sonnes of men: none in his time (<hi>Melchiſedech</hi> only excepted) ſo great in the Church of God? No analogie either of ſacred rule, or of tenets joyntly maintained by the Engliſh and Romiſh Church (concerning the never interrupted Succeſſion of the true Church, or the miniſters in it) will ſuffer us to think this <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> ſhould be a Canaanite. For although we ought (perhaps) to be as farre from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying as from affirming that God had many choſen veſſels amongſt the ſonnes of <hi>Cham,</hi> yet is it no way probable, or to be affirmed that hee had any viſible Church amongſt them at that time whereof wee ſpeake; much leſſe any ſuch orthodoxall authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique high Prieſt as was <hi>ex officio</hi> to bleſſe <hi>him,</hi> with whom the everlaſting Covenant was to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: within whoſe family and poſterity the true and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7904:37"/>
viſible Church was to be confined almoſt two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares after. Nor doe we in ſaying thus, tie the Almightie (as ſome haply will accuſe us) to uſe no meanes but ordinary, in beſtowing his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bleſſings. But this we ſay, that where the manner of his <hi>calling</hi> is moſt extraordinary and miraculous, it is his pleaſure to uſe the ordinary meanes of lawfull miniſters for the ratification or declaring of his <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> at leaſt for the admiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the parties <hi>called</hi> unto the emoluments or prerogatives of their calling. <hi>Paul</hi> was plucked away from the Synagogue (as a ſappie branch from a dying tree) by the immediate and ſtrong hand of God; but to be ingrafted, or inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the true Church, which is the body of Chriſt by means ordinary and miniſteriall, by the hands of <hi>Ananias</hi> a civill and viſible member of Chriſts myſticall body.</p>
                  <p>4 In like manner we doe not deny that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gods calling <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Haran,</hi> and the matter of the bleſſings then promiſed to him, to have been both extraordinary; in which bleſſing not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee is to be inſtalled by <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> appointed as Gods Deputie, or Vicegerent (ſo the hebrew <hi>Cohen</hi> properly ſignifieth) to ratifie or ſeale the former promiſes unto him. The manner of the conveyance is formall and legall, ſuch as God ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily uſeth in like caſes. And by probable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence this <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> whoſoever he were, was a true principall member of the viſible Church, which at that time was no where on earth, but in <hi>Sem</hi> &amp; his poſteritie. Of thoſe Sonnes of <hi>Sem</hi> which are mentioned in <hi>Abraham's</hi> genealogy moſt were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7904:37"/>
dead; others (for ought we read, or by analogy can gather from what we have read) no way ſo fitly qualified for this ſervice as <hi>Sem</hi> himſelfe, who was then alive. For <hi>Sem</hi> had beene ſolemnly bleſſed by his father: And although hee be repreſented unto us in the fourth of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> under another name and ſhape then he receiv'd the bleſſing in, yet the holy ſpirit ſeemes to point him ſpeaking in his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive language, and ſolemnly beſtowing that bleſſing upon <hi>Abraham</hi> his ſonne which his father <hi>Noah</hi> had beſtowed on him. <hi>Bleſsed be the Lord God of Shem, and let Canaan be his ſervant! Gen.</hi> 4. The implication or importance is, as if hee had ſaid, <hi>Shem</hi> ſhall have cauſe to bleſſe the Lord his God for making him Lord of Canaan. This bleſſing or bequeſt wee know was to beare date aſwell in <hi>Shem's</hi> poſteritie as in himſelfe, but principally in his poſteritie. Now wee no where read of any conveyance or bequeſt of this bleſſing made by <hi>Shem</hi> unto his Succeſſors, beſides that ſolemne bleſſing which <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> (whom for this reaſon we ſuppoſe to have been <hi>Shem</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on <hi>Abraham.</hi> The tenor of his bequeſt, or conveyance is more expreſſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Bleſſed be Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God moſt high poſseſſor of Heaven and earth!</hi> This propheticall benediction implyes that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his poſterity ſhould have cauſe to bleſſe the Lord their God, for giving them poſſeſſion of that earth or land which was the type or pledge of their heavenly inheritance and poſſeſſions. This was the gaine of godlineſſe, that <hi>merces valde magna,</hi> to have the promiſe of this life, and of that which is to come. And as the land of promiſe or Kingdome of Canaan
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7904:38"/>
once poſſeſſed, was a true pledge or earneſt of their title to the heavenly kingdome; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> at the very time when <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> bleſſed him, received the pledges of his poſterities hopes unto that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall kingdome.</p>
                  <p>5 For albeit we utterly deny all ſacrifice of bread and wine, yet may wee not in oppoſition to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt affirme or maintaine that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Abraham</hi> and his followers, only with a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar or common refection. Theſe elements of bread and wine being confidered with the ſolemnitie of the bleſſing, have beſides the literall ſenſe, a ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall or myſticall importance and are thus farre; at leaſt ſacramentall, that they ſerved for earneſts to ſecure <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his poſterity ſhould quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and eate the good things of that pleaſant land wherein he was now a Sojourner. Briefly, <hi>Abraham</hi> in that ſacred banquet which the King of <hi>Salem</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited unto him, did (as we ſay) take <hi>levery de ſeiſin</hi> of the promiſed land &amp; (as it is probable) in that very place which God had deſtinated for the Metropolis of the kingdome, or at leaſt in that place where <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptize. And albeit <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> did (no doubt) derive the bleſſing beſtowed on <hi>Shem,</hi> or on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by <hi>Noah</hi> in more expreſſe termes unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> by inſpiration extraordinary and divine; yet <hi>Abraham</hi> at this time had afforded him a fit text or theame to make theſe extemporary expoſitions or declarations upon: Of all that had proceeded out of the loines of <hi>Shem,</hi> none as yet had ever given the like proofe of his likely hood to become Lord of Canaan as <hi>Abraham</hi> now had done, whom God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7904:38"/>
had enabled to <hi>right</hi> the King of Sodome and other Cananitiſh Kings not being able to <hi>right</hi> themſelves againſt forreigne uſurpers.</p>
                  <p>6 For any man of ordinary underſtanding that had been an Actor in the late warre (ſo happily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by <hi>Abraham</hi>) and a by-ſtander at <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech's</hi> bleſſing of him to have conjectured to this pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe, had been as eaſy and as warrantable as it was for the Iſraelites to <hi>divine</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be their Deliverer by the manner of his killing the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an which had contended with an Iſraelite. Now the holy Spirit ſeemes to taxe their dulneſſe for not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending this myſtery from the manner of <hi>Moſes</hi> fact.

                  <p>4 For albeit <hi>Abraham</hi> were a Prophet, and did exerciſe the function of a Prieſt within his owne family, or for ſome others, upon ſpeciall occaſions: albeit ſome of <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede were both Kings and Prophets; others both Prieſts and Prophets, yet none of them were both Kings and Prieſts; none of them anointed to theſe two functions. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> (though perhaps never ſolemnely anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to either function) was the only man which was by divine providence or heavenly calling, both a true King &amp; a Prieſt of the moſt high God.

                  <p>5 But <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was both King and Prieſt, a more Soveraigne King then <hi>Woldmarus</hi> was, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7904:44"/>
a greater high Prieſt then the Biſhop of Rome, or any other that have lived on earth, beſides the Son of God himſelfe, whoſe picture of ſhadoww he was. That this Sonne of God or Seede of <hi>Abraham</hi> which hee aſſumed ſhould be much greater then <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> King of <hi>Salem,</hi> is implyed in the manner of God's promiſed bleſſing unto <hi>Abraham</hi> being compared with the manner of <hi>Melchiſedech's</hi> bleſſing <hi>Abraham.</hi> For <hi>Abraham</hi> was bleſſed by <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> not in <hi>Melchiſedech's</hi> name, but in the name of the moſt high God whoſe Prieſt hee was; for he was bleſſed by him not in him; whereas in <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede all the Nations of the earth, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> as well as <hi>Abraham</hi> were to be bleſſed. Howbeit this promiſed ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> was no greater then <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in externall beautie, or prerogative royall till after his Reſurrection or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth. During the time of his humiliation He was rather deſtinated then conſecrated to be the Author or fountaine of bleſſedneſſe unto us. For as the Apoſtle argues <hi>Heb. 5. 8. Though hee were the Sonne, yet learned he obedience by the things which he ſuffered. And being conſecrated</hi> (to wit by his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings) <hi>became the Author of eternall ſalvation unto all that obey him. And is called of God</hi> (from the time of his Reſurrection or exalation) <hi>an high Priest after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> For from this time and not before, his royall Prieſthood did <hi>commence.</hi> So he ſaith to his Diſciples immediately after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>All power is given to mee in heaven and earth;</hi> power to bleſſe with the bleſſings of this life, and of the life to come. And being now after his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7904:45"/>
Conſecration to be enthroniz'd in his Kingdome &amp; royall Prieſthood, <hi>he lift up his hands and bleſsed his Diſciples, And it came to paſſe that as he bleſsed them be departed from them and was carried up into heaven, Lu.</hi> 24. 50. 51. Yet being there in body he continues with his Church here on earth by continuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his bleſſings unto the worlds end. That this part of his Prieſtly functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wit, his <hi>Authoritative, or Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique bleſsing</hi> doth follow his Reſurrection, our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle intimates <hi>Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 26. Yee are the children of the Prophets and of the Covenant which God hath made unto our father, ſaying to Abraham; Even in thy ſeede ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Firſt, <hi>unto you hath God raiſed up his Sonne Ieſus, and him he hath ſent to bleſſe you in turning every one of you from your iniquities.</hi> And againe, <hi>Christ hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us from the curſe of the Law being made a curſe for us, that the bleſsing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles, Galat.</hi> 3. 14. So that the Iewes were the firſt, but not the only parties intereſſed in the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wherewith God by <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> For in aſmuch as that bleſſing was the ſame bleſſing (though further ſpread, and better branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) wherewith God by <hi>Noah</hi> bleſſed <hi>Sem,</hi> we Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles the Sonnes of <hi>Iapheth</hi> were heires of it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. For though <hi>Shem</hi> be the firſt, <hi>Iaphet</hi> was in the ſcond place bleſſed with his Brother <hi>Shem. Gen. 9. 27. God perſwade</hi> Iaphet, <hi>that hee may dwell in the tents of</hi> Shem, <hi>and let Canaan be his ſervant.</hi> So that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> doth prefigure Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by his <hi>Authority</hi> to bleſſe in Gods name. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as it was applyed unto <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> is but a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7904:45"/>
ſhadow or ſurface only. <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him, but in the name of the moſt high God. But bleſſing as appliable to Chriſt is a <hi>ſolid,</hi> and hath its trinall dimenſion. Wee are bleſſed for him; we are bleſſed through him, wee are bleſſed by him; And which is the full iſſue or product of all three dimenſions, we ſhall be everlaſtingly bleſſed in him. For the firſt; we may not ſo much as beg any bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or good thing at God's hand, but for his ſake. Hence it is, that all our prayers are conceived in this forme, either expreſſely or implicitely, <hi>propter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita Ieſu Chriſti.</hi> Secondly of thoſe bleſſings which it pleaſeth God to grant for his ſake, wee may not entreat, no not expect their conveyance ſhould be made unto us by any other perſon or meanes then by <hi>him,</hi> and the vertue of his ſufferings. And for this reaſon it is, that we uſually conclude our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Per Ieſum Chriſtum Dominum noſtrum,</hi> through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord; not <hi>propter Ieſum Chriſtum: That</hi> is alway expreſſed or implyed in the body or beginning of the prayer. It was the intention of the Ancients to inſtruct us by thoſe two uſuall clauſes of our ſolemn prayers, that whatſoever we aske for Chriſt's ſake, wee cannot otherwiſe obtaine then through him. And though the Father be the firſt <hi>granter,</hi> yet the Sonne immediately beſtowes all bleſſings upon us, as the places of Scripture late al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, teſtify. God's bleſſings deſcend to us, only by him, that they may draw us unto <hi>him</hi> in whom only we are bleſſed. For that everlaſting happineſſe of the life to come formally conſiſts in our union with him, and cannot be manifeſted or imparted to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7904:46"/>
us but by the participation of his bleſſed preſence.</p>
                  <p>6 Will yee have a more particular map in what manner the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> deſcends upon us by this our high Prieſt? Then call to mind in what termes <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham.</hi> They were theſe, <hi>Bleſſed be</hi> Abraham <hi>of the moſt high God Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of heaven and earth, Melchiſedech</hi> (if the ſame be <hi>Shem</hi>) had by vertue of his Father <hi>Noah's</hi> bleſſings, a manifeſt right unto the land of Canaan, and had ſome part of it in poſſeſſion; and this right and title hee be queaths to <hi>Abraham.</hi> The chiefe matter of his bleſſing is, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie ſhould be Kings and Prieſts in that land; And albeit he were a Prieſt of the moſt high God, yet his Kingdome was of this world and in this world, though a type of the heavenly Kingdome. But our Saviour's Kingdome was not of this world, for ſince his Reſurrection he hath taken poſſeſſion of heaven as he is man, but in the right and title of the eternall Sonne of God. God the Father made all things by God the Sonne, whom hee hath made Heire of all things as man, which were made by him as God; not as an heire in his nonage, but as joynt Lord with his Father at whoſe right hand he is placed; ſo that as man he hath more full and more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate authoritie to diſpoſe of heaven than <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech</hi> had to diſpoſe of Canaan, for hee beſtowed that upon <hi>Abraham</hi> by way of prayer, as became a Prieſt of the moſt high God. But this our high Prieſt, who is alſo the moſt high God ſhall diſpoſe of heaven to his ſervants by royall ſentence and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as King. <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:7904:46"/>
                     <hi>that ſit on his right hand. Venite benedicti patris mei poſsidete vobis paratum regnum à conſtitutione mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, Come ye bleſſed of my Father poſſeſſe yee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome prepared for you from the foundations of the world!</hi> This is the accompliſhment of that bleſſing which <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> beſtowed upon <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the ſecond part of his benediction muſt be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting ſong of ſuch as are bleſſed in <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed. <hi>Bleſſed be the moſt high God, who hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our enemies into our hands: who hath enabled us to overcome the world, the Divell, and the fleſh!</hi> And though Chriſt our high Prieſt were the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> and of <hi>Abraham</hi> as man according to the fleſh; yet as man hee is the firſt begotten from the dead, and Father of the world to come. <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> himſelfe in reſpect of the everlaſting bleſſing is his Sonne, and muſt have his portion in it at the laſt day. For if all Nations, if every one of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is truly bleſſed, be bleſſed in <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> himſelfe muſt be bleſſed in him, not only by him: And therefore hee is that moſt high God, Poſſeſſor of heaven and earth, in whoſe name <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7 But to return to our Apoſtles next paſſage, <hi>He. 7. 11. &amp;c. If therefore perfection were by the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Prieſthood</hi> (for under it the people received the Law,) <hi>what further need was there that another Prieſt ſhould ariſe after the order of</hi> Melchiſedech, <hi>and not be called after the order of</hi> Aaron? <hi>For the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood being changed there is made of neceſsitie a change alſo of the Law.</hi> The full diſcuſſion of this twelfth verſe, becauſe it containes matter of Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

                  <p>2. The principall end or ſcope of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> (or whoſoever were the Author of this divine Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi>) was to prove that Chriſt Ieſus, whom the Iewes did crucify, was deſigned or deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by God to be a Prieſt not after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and declared to be ſo, deſign'd by God's oath to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was the firſt oath that God did vouchſafe to make, that is extant upon any ſacred record; though the contents of this firſt oath were more fully expreſt in his oath unto <hi>David.</hi> The tenor or impotance of both oaths, eſpecially of that unto <hi>David,</hi> are not any where mentioned or preſt upon the Iewes in any part of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7904:48"/>
the New Teſtament beſides in this Epiſtle; but in this Epiſtle very frequently: firſt in the place before cited <hi>Heb. 5. 10 Hee was called of God an high Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> But the preſſing of it further upon theſe <hi>Hebrewes</hi> our Apoſtle for the preſent, forbeares for their dulneſſe of hearing. <hi>v.</hi> 1. But though they were for the preſent unfit Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of ſuch an high myſtery yet were they not ſuch perpetually. The true reaſon why our Apoſtle ſaith the things he had to ſay of <hi>Melchiſedech were hard to be uttered or conceived by theſe hearers ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus affected,</hi> was not (as a late writer, before mentioned, conjectures) becauſe this <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> who met <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Sonne of God, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the likneſſe of man; For this was a point eaſy to be uttered, and eaſy to be conceived, if it had been any part of our Apoſtles meaning: But of what he had to ſay, and hath ſpoken at large in the 7 Chapter of this Epiſtle, theſe his Scholars were not capable, at leaſt (he ſaw) would not be attentive to his leſſon, untill he had given them a ſharpe though moderate correction, which he doth from the 12. <hi>v</hi> of the 5. Chapter, unto the 9. <hi>v.</hi> of the 6. Ready they were, as is evident from our Apoſtles admonition to revolt from the Chriſtian faith unto Iudaiſme, and to fall into that irremiſſible ſin which hee there deſcribes. Now to recall men prone to vice or ſinne there are but two wayes: The one by manifeſting the danger of the relapſe; the other by miniſtring comfort or aſſurance of happy ſucceſſe in that courſe of life which hath beene commended by the Phyſitians of their ſoules unto them. The dreadfull

Abraham, <hi>becauſe hee could ſweare by no greater, hee ſwore by himſelfe, ſaying, Surely bleſsing I will bleſſe thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee, And ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had patiently endured, he obtained the promiſe.</hi> So that patience in doing good workes to our loſſe, or in ſuffering wrongs from others, are good works or qualifications pre-required to our firm apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God's moſt free and gracious promiſes.</p>

ancient rule in ſome ſpecial &amp; rare caſes, rather cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborates then impaires the indefinite truth, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall validitie of it: Yet were not oaths <hi>aſsertory</hi> more authentique, or of more validitie in ancient times for ending Controverſies betwixt man and man, then oaths promiſſory (ſuch as God's oath in this place is) were for maintaining publique peace or confirming leagues betwixt Nation and Nation. The examples of heathen aſwell as of ſacred Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Generalls (ſo we would follow them) teach us not to retract any thing that we have ſworne unto, nor to delay performance of any thing which wee have promiſed by oath, albeit the conditions in ſome caſes prove ſuch in the iſſue, as wee would not have ſubſcribed unto them at any hand, had we knowne them; in others, ſuch as wee ought not to have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, (a Prince otherwiſe too raſh and furious in executing his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous deſignes) perceived that the <hi>Lampſaceni</hi> (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Rebells in his interpretation) had entertained <hi>Anaximenes</hi> his fathers old acquaintance to plead for their pardon, fearing that this ſmooth-tongued Orator (if hee ſhould permit him to ſpeak his minde at large,) might ſomewhat mitigate the rigorous ſentence pronounced againſt them, upon the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's firſt approach into his preſence takes a ſolemne oath by the Gods of Greece, that hee would doe quite contrary to whatſoever hee would requeſt on the behalfe of the <hi>Lampſaceni.</hi> Then ſaid <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> it will litle boote me to be long in my petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which in briefe ſhall be this; <q>That you would cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate their wives and children, deſtroy their City,

and ſet the Temples of their Gods on fire.</q> Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this boiſtrous King had ſtedfaſtly purpoſed to doe aſmuch as the Orator's words imply; and had interpoſed a ſolemne oath to confirme his purpoſe, yet his oath being by the Orators cunning retorted, his former reſolution did relent and yeeld unto the Orator's firſt intended ſerious requeſt. And in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this great Controverſy between this great Prince and his Rebellious Subjects or revolted Confederates, thus happily ended by a retorted or inverted oath, the Orator had an Olympick <hi>ſtatue</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to him by his Clients.<note place="margin">Pauſanias lib 6. hoc eſt Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acor. 2.</note>

But in aſmuch as an oath is the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bond in humane ſocietie, the breach of it is not only evil becauſe forbidden, but therefore forbidden becauſe in it ſelf ſo evil. Whence though it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to make any league with the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> being by Nation and Progeny Cananites, yet in aſmuch as they were men, the league once made with them being confirmed by oath might not be viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, or any of his Succeſſors.

                        <hi>Pauſanias</hi>) will eaſily grant that this <hi>Philip</hi> for his atchievements was the greateſt King which <hi>Macedon</hi> had either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after him: Of Princely vertues he had ſo many and ſo well mixed, as few Princes in any ages have enjoyed the like. What then did hee want why he might not be reputed in wiſe-mens cenſure a good Governour or Commander? On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that hee had his owne oath at too great command. His perjury did ſpoile his politick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whilſt they ſeemed moſt to proſper, and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the foundations of his intended Monarchy as faſt as he laid them; and which is worſt of all, his ſoule being infected with this foule ſinne did propagate the <hi>rot</hi> unto the fruit of his bodie: As he had often deluded his Gods, ſo the Oracle to revenge this quarrell deluded him. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death which hee expected the Oracle ſhould at his inſtance award upon the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> did ſeize upon himſelfe in his beſt yeares and amidſt his triumphant jollities. Immediately upon his death his infant Sonne by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was with his mother ſcorched to death in a veſſell of braſſe by the appointment of <hi>Olympias,</hi> unto whoſe crueltie another of his ſonnes by a former wife within few yeares after was ſacrificed. And as if their complaints and outcries againſt this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt execution of a womaniſh wrath had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, or authorized to bring downe God's more immediate judgments upon the remnant of <hi>Philip's</hi> ſeed or his grand-children, (which had

It is an excellent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphonema wherewith <hi>Pauſanias</hi> concludes his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe concerning <hi>Philip's</hi> perjury: <q>If <hi>Philip</hi> (ſaith he) when he laid his plots for erecting the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian Empire had ſaid the Delphick Oracle, given to <hi>Glaucus</hi> the <hi>Spartan,</hi> to his heart [<gap reason="foreign">

againſt one or other, ſo I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt him to admit the relation upon any other termes then as an Embleme of divine truth.</p>
                  <p>6 That which this Embleme repreſents as <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro ſimile,</hi> was remarkablely fulfilled in <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> and <hi>Zedechias:</hi> Both of them had deſerved death and depoſition for their other ſinnes; but that which moved the Lord to write theſe two principall ſtemmes of <hi>David</hi> childleſſe among the families of <hi>Iudah,</hi> was falſification of their oaths to <hi>Nehuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar. Zedekiah</hi> had God's ſpeciall promiſe that he and his houſe ſhould live, upon condition he would ſubmit himſelfe (as by oath he was bound) unto the King of <hi>Babel;</hi> but ſleighting his oath till time was paſt, and not ſubmitting himſelfe to <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> till he was <hi>caught,</hi> his ſonnes were ſlaine before his eyes. And no ſooner had this tragicall ſpectacle found entrance into his troubled ſoule, but the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes by which it entred were ſhut up; that ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no poſſibilitie of vent for griefe, it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect more vehemently upon his penſive heart, and be ſuch a perpetuall torment to his reſtleſſe fancie, as an eare-wig is to the braine into which ſhee hath crept. I will conclude theſe inſtances concerning oaths <hi>promiſſory</hi> with his verdict, who was able to make the induction good. <hi>Si quis omnem antiquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; bellorum memoriam ab ultimo principio repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat, profecto reperiet eorum qui pactas violarunt indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias, miſerrimos exitus &amp; civitatibus ac populis cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitoſiſsimos extitiſſe.

So much worſe was the ſpirit of this Roman Oracle then the ſpirit which guided the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle in the anſwer to <hi>Glaucus</hi> the Spartane before mentioned. The like diſpenſation of the Pope with an oath of <hi>Contract</hi> did ſet the rebellion in the North on foot, and was the cauſe of the calamity or miſery which<note place="margin">About the 10 of Queene E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth.</note> befell him and his family, who ſought for it and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Aſſociates.</p>

ſhould account them two ſinnes, or ſeveral branches of one ſinne; or whether were worſe utterly to deny the truth of God's being, or his omnipotency; or to produce him as a witneſſe or Countenancer of that which is untrue. The truth of God's Being and his Iuſtice being preſuppoſed or beleeved, it ſtands with reaſon what <hi>Bodin</hi> hath obſerved, <hi>That periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould bring forth deſtruction and calamitie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to publique ſtates or private families in greater plenty then any ſinne whatſoever.</hi> Other enormities alwayes deſerve God's wrath and in the iſſue bring it upon offenders, but perjury only is conceived and brought forth by ſolliciting or imploring God's wrath or vengeance upon ſuch as commit it. But ſome will here demand, What is all this which hath beene ſaid concerning the ſacred uſe of oaths amongſt men, and the plagues executed upon ſuch as violate thoſe ſacred oaths, to the oath which God interpoſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to their aſſurance which rely upon him? Much every way. For; the ſpeciall, if not the only reaſon why God's hand hath light ſo heavy upon all perjured perſons is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God himſelfe, who vouchſafed to ſweare to <hi>Abraham</hi> for our comfort, is ſo true in all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſo unpartiall in awarding luſtice that hee would not puniſh mens neglects or contempt of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oaths ſo ſeverely as uſually he doth, were he not beyond compariſon or comprehenſion more obſervant of his oath when he ſwears by himſelfe, then we are of our oaths which we take in his name. Briefly, albeit ſome in this age among the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Profeſſors of Chriſtianity eſcape his viſible
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7904:60"/>

Every one that hopes to be bleſſed with faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to be partaker of the bleſſing promiſed by oath unto him muſt in this particular be perfect as his heavenly Father is perfect. Every one that hath beene tainted with this foule finne how great a gainer ſoever hee be by it in worldly courſes muſt purge himſelfe from it by the ſolemn proper acts of faith, that is, by true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Almes deeds, and full Reſtitution of accurſed gaines to the parties whom he hath wronged: <hi>For</hi> (as our Apoſtle tells us) <hi>every one that hath this hope, that is, to be the Son of God with faithfull</hi> Abraham, <hi>muſt purifie himſelfe, as he is pure. 1.

upon <hi>Pythagora's</hi> morall rules are (to uſe the words of that learned French Civilian <hi>Tiraquel</hi>) moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
                  <p>2 Whilſt I reviſe theſe and the former obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the heathen, concerning oaths, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how exactly parallel they are to the ſacred rules of God's written Lawes and Caſes determined by divine Iuſtice, I cannot but reſume the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah's</hi> wiſh or prayer, <hi>Oh that my head were turned into a well or fountaine, that I might weepe day and night for the ſinnes of this people!</hi> And of this age wherein a man may more ſafely beleeve a Turke ſwearing by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or a canting Beggar by his <hi>Salomon,</hi> or a rude pit-man, or coale-worker by ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon a coale, then many witneſſes, who beare the name of Gentlemen and good Chriſtians, whilſt they ſweare in Courts of Iuſtice by the Lord God of their ſalvation, kiſſing the Booke wherein their intereſt in the promiſes made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and their hopes of the life to come, are contained. Nor is this the fault of falſe witneſſes only, but of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers or Interpreters, or of men in Authoritie, that a man may be ſworne out of his inheritance, out of his lively hood and good name by one uncatechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Clowne or Atheiſt, who neither knowes by whom, nor unto what he ſweares; ready at all times to lend that which he heares called an oath, unto his friend or brother in miſchiefe. An oath being a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of Religion, it were to be wiſhed it were never to be adminiſtred or exacted by ſuch as give more proofe to ſhew their authoritie and power in being enabled by humane Law to give it, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7904:61"/>
of their deſire or abilitie to inſtruct the party ſwearing unto what he ought, unto what he ought not to ſweare, or in any other principall point of Religion. Many caſes are often determined by one mans oath which are not poſſible to be proved by the oaths of any ten men living, though men of life and manners unſuſpected. And yet in caſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſwearing to his neighbour's utter undoing might be convicted of wilfull perjury, the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that the Law or Cuſtome affords him will prove much worſe then the diſeaſe it ſelfe; that is, beget a tedious ſuit in ſome coſtly Court. But neither did the primevall Church of God, nor the ancient Lawes of heathen Nations admit of any ſuch Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. Exceptions againſt lewd perſons or ſuſpected witneſſes were admitted before they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſweare: Or in caſe any were detected to ſwear falſly, the detection was without any great coſt; and the puniſhment ſevere and ſpeedy. In caſe a man had ſworne falſly againſt his neighbour in matter of<note place="margin">Vide Duare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu de Iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento.</note> debt, hee was, beſides other puniſhments, to pay as much as his neighbour ſhould have been damnified by his oath. In caſe of infamy and ſlander hee was adjudged to undergoe the ſame puniſhment which his oath, had it beene admitted, would have brought upon the party accuſed. If hee had ſworne againſt another in a matter capitall, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury was puniſhed with death, and ſo were falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, albeit they did ſweare or accuſe on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Prince or Emperour. One of the beſt Catechiſmes that I dare commend unto ſuch as have power to miniſter ſolemne oaths, or unto ſuch as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7904:61"/>
are bound to anſwer upon oath, or ready when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions require to interpoſe oaths voluntary, is the Comment of the fore-cited Philoſopher upon that golden verſe of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>

                  <p>God's oath at all time when it pleaſed him to ſweare, was a voluntarie oath; no Authoritie could exact it of him. But how free or voluntarie ſoever his oath to <hi>Abraham</hi> was, it was not <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> but interpoſed to ſome good uſe or purpoſe. The ſpeciall uſes or purpoſes of this firſt oath of God (which is upon record) comes in the next place to be diſcuſſed.</p>
                  <p>3 It is on all Sides agreed that the Article or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7904:62"/>
unto which God did ſweare, was of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and weight: For men ought not to make ſolemne oaths or proteſtations, but in ſuch caſes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are commanded to be holy as he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But can there be any caſe or buſineſſe betwixt God and man of ſo great conſequence, that his ſole word or meere promiſe might not ſuffice to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it? His word in it ſelfe no doubt is more firme and ſure, then all the oaths of men and Angels. It is therefore in the ſecond place preſumed or granted by all good Writers, that our Gracious God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this promiſe by oath <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> for the ſupport of mens infirmities, which too often mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the goodneſſe of God and the fidelitie of his promiſes by their owne notions of goodneſſe, or by their experience of ſuch fidelitie as is found in promiſes amongſt good men. But albeit wee may take ſurer hold of any mans word or promiſe, then of his indefinite overtures or inclinations to doe us good, yet a very honeſt mans word is no ſheate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anchor for a wiſe man to rely upon in a violent ſtorme. The <hi>feſt</hi> ſometimes may be ſure and firme when the cable is ſlender and weak: Or the cable very ſtrong, when the <hi>fest</hi> or Anchor-hold is ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. Hence ordinary promiſes or profeſſions of reall kindneſſes by a tacite or implicite conſent of moſt men, admit diverſe exceptions or diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof ſolemne oaths are uncapable. In what termes ſoever ordinary promiſes or profeſſions of kindneſſes be expreſſed, their tenour is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood or conſtrued with this <hi>Proviſo, Rebus ſic stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</hi> Vnexpected diſaſter, or rare miſchance, is in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7904:62"/>
common equitie a ſufficient releaſe for non perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that which was ſincerely promiſed upon probable hopes of better meanes or abilities; or at leaſt of the continuances of ſuch meanes as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had when hee made promiſe. Many men who will hardly ſtraine their oaths for their life, will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with their honeſt words, or good intentions, rather then ſubject themſelves to any incompenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worldly miſchiefe, or remedileſſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which may certainely follow upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of what they promiſed. For this reaſon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe man muſt be more wary to what he ſwears, then to what he promiſeth. For matter of promiſe concernes things temporall only, whereas hee that takes a ſolemne oath, doth ſequeſter his immortall ſoule and eſtate in the life to come, into the hands of the Almighty Iudge and Revenger of perjury. Hence was it that the noble Romane <hi>Regulus</hi> did chuſe rather to returne to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to endure all the tortures and paines that they could inflict upon him, then to violate the ſolemne oath which they adminiſtred unto him. And albeit the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> knew him to be a man for his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie and due obſervances of his promiſes, as juſt and righteous as <hi>Rome</hi> had any; a man more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true (if wee believe ancient hiſtories) then the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ordinarily were: yet out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion and politick obſeruance, they held it more ſafe to truſt to <hi>Regulus</hi> upon his oath, then upon his meere promiſe. No wiſe man or prudent Statiſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day, will truſt the beſt man living (over whoſe perſon or eſtate hee hath no command or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction)

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow God's oath to <hi>Abraham</hi> was an oath of league; a ſolemne confirmation of that Covenant which God had entred with <hi>Abraham</hi> at the Circumciſion of his Son <hi>Iſaac<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Wee may obſerve in the ſacred ſtory, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had firſt God's meere promiſe, and on that he faithfully relyed <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 13. 14. &amp;c. Afterwards, this promiſe grew into a ſolemne everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſigned on <hi>Abraham's</hi> part by the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of himſelfe, and his ſonne <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and afterwards confirmed on God's part by ſolemne oath; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſigned and ſealed by the bloody death of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne of God. For the Readers better conduct in the paſſages which follow, it will be requiſite firſt to entreate briefly of the nature of Covenants and Leagues. Secondly to diſplay the Evangelicall importances of the oath, by which this League was firſt confirmed and afterwards renewed. The word <hi>Covenant</hi> in our Engliſh, is ſometimes equivalent to that which the Latines call <hi>pactum,</hi> or <hi>conventum,</hi> to wit, any contract or bargaine, wherein there is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7904:63"/>
                     <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> ſomewhat given and ſomewhat taken. And in this ſenſe every Covenant or bargaine is an act of commutative Iuſtice, wherein there is <hi>ratio dati &amp; accepti,</hi> a mutual bond betweene the parties contracting upon ſome valuable conſiderations. A Covenant of this ranke there cannot any be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid or imagined betwixt God and meere man as <hi>Abraham</hi> was; for who can give any thing unto God which was not his owne before, by a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne right and more peculiar title then it is, or can be his that would take upon him to make God his Debtor by deede of gift. And for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon the acuteſt Schoolemen reſolve us, that commutative Iuſtice cannot be <hi>formally</hi> in God. But when wee read that Iuſtice is one of God's eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Attributes, or when we ſay that God is truly and <hi>formally</hi> Iuſt; this muſt be meant of diſtributive Iuſtice, the ballance of whoſe ſcales are <hi>poena</hi> and <hi>praemium,</hi> matter of puniſhment and matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For God as a juſt Iudge doth truly and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately render unto every man according unto all his wayes without any reſpect of any advantage gaine or profit that can redound unto him by mans doing good; but meerely out of his unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love unto mercy it ſelfe, unto bounty it ſelfe, or unto Iuſtice it ſelfe. But though there cannot be ſuch a <hi>Pactum</hi> or Covenant betweene God and man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe; as is a proper act of commutative Iuſtice wherein there is <hi>ratio dati &amp; accepti,</hi> (For <hi>Abraham</hi> had nothing to give unto God from whom hee had received all that hee had, and from whom hee did expect to receive his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7904:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom the very Covenant was to be eſtabled:) yet there may be betweene God and man, and there was betweene God and <hi>Abraham</hi> a true and proper Covenant in another ſenſe, that is, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Latines call <hi>foedus,</hi> a true or proper league of amitie or aſſociation. And thus the word in the originall, eſpecially in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 17. 7. is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p>2 This kind of League or Covenant may be of two ſorts, <hi>foedera iniqua quae victores victis dabant:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">* <hi>Inter alios commentato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in Iuſtinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vide victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Strigeliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in annum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num belli Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponnefiaci. p.</hi> 134.</note> Such as the Conquerors would give unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, which was alwayes upon unequall termes or conditions; and yet better for the conquered and weaker part to admit of, then to be altogether without league or ſecuritie for their ſafety or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Or they were <hi>foedera aequa,</hi> leagues entred upon equall termes or condition; ſuch as uſually are the leagues betweene neighbour-Kingdomes, free-States; or Soveraignties independent each on other, eſpecially if ſuch leagues be made when the one hath the other at no advantage: And theſe leagues were of two ſorts; either mutually defenſive only, or offenſive aſwell as defenſive, as the Greekes ſay, <gap reason="foreign">

Beſides this mutuall aid or aſſiſtance in times of warre, one ſpeciall end
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7904:64"/>
of leagues or aſſociation was, that one Country might be relieved in their want, or pleaſured in their proſperity with thoſe bleſſings wherewith o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abounded. This mutual intercourſ or exchange of commodities betweene Nation and Nation, is alway cut off, or much impaired in time of hoſtility or warre: <hi>Neither</hi> party can with ſecurity enjoy the good things which their owne land affords; much leſſe can they with ſafety be partakers of thoſe commodities wherewith God hath bleſſed their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. And in caſe it ſo fell out, that a people rich in money or merchandize, but deſtitute of corne or wine, or other ſuch neceſſaries, ſhould fall at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with thoſe who were accuſtomed to ſupply their wants; their eſtate in the middeſt of their wealth was but miſerable and would enforce them to ſeek peace upon termes unequall. So we read <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 20. <hi>When</hi> Herod <hi>was highly diſpleaſed with them of Tyre and Sidon</hi> (a people for wealth inferior to none) <hi>they came to him with one accord and having made</hi> Blaſtus <hi>the Kings Chamberlaine their friend, they deſired peace.</hi> What reaſon had they to become ſuitors for peace with <hi>him,</hi> againſt whom they had been able to have waged warre, whom perhaps they were able to out-match with number of men and weight of money? <hi>S. Luke</hi> gives the reaſon in the next verſe; <hi>Becauſe their Country was nouriſhed by Herod's Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 But infinitely more miſerable then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne eſtate of any one people can be in reſpect of the moſt potent and cruell Adverſary was the eſtate of all mankind, whilſt heaven and earth were at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7904:65"/>
For albeit God in mercy ſuffered his Sunne to riſe aſwell upon the unjuſt ſonnes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as upon <hi>Adam</hi> in his integritie, yet were all utterly deprived of all commerce with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of heaven: All were excluded from the tree of life without whoſe fruit, this bodily life which wee lead here on earth, even whilſt wee live in greateſt pleaſure or proſperitie, is but as a ſhort walke or progreſſe from the wombe unto the grave; as it were from a priſon to a place of torment or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Reaſon wee had to deſire peace of heaven, and to become humble Supplicants for the League or Covenant whereof God here preventeth <hi>Abraham:</hi> Reaſon wee had to have ſought this league, upon what termes or conditions ſoever.

It was in his power to have cut us off from all poſſibility of any league or amitie, ſave only with hell and death, which we and our Fathers had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for our confederates. And yet the conditions of this league wherewith God preventeth <hi>Abraham</hi> (for he ſought it at <hi>Abraham's</hi> hands, when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did not ſeeke it at his,) are conditions <hi>aequi faede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> It is made upon as good termes or conditions, as any league betweene free-ſtates and Kingdomes independent was ever proffered or performed.

How then doth God performe this promiſe unto <hi>Abraham?</hi> Not in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> or <hi>Iſaac's</hi> perſon, but in another ſeede of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> of whom that is expreſſely avouched <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. 16. 17. 18. which in the 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> was implicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or avouched of him as he was indefinitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede, or potentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>Abraham's</hi> perſon. <hi>In thee</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Abraham</hi> Gen. 22. 18.) <hi>ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſsed. By my ſelfe have I ſworne ſaith the ſame Lord God</hi> Chap. 22. 16. <hi>For becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not withheld thy Sonne, thine only Sonne, that in bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy Seede as the ſtarres in heaven, and as the ſand which is upon the Sea ſhore, &amp;c.

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:7904:66"/>
                     <hi>And in thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſsed, becauſe thou hast obeyed my voice.</hi> By <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> ſeede in this place hee meant not <hi>Iſaac</hi> with whom this Covenant was eſtabliſhed, but another ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and another ſonne of promiſe in whom this Covenant was to be accompliſhed. So our Apoſtle interprets this place. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeede were the promiſes made: He ſaith not and to his ſeedes as of many, but as of one, and to thy ſeede which is Chriſt,</hi> that is as truly the Sonne of God as the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is as truly and properly God as he is man. This inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of our Apoſtle is grounded upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſubject of the promiſe. For it is impoſſible that all the families of the earth, even <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe, and <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> who bleſſed <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be bleſſed either in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or in <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede, either indefinitely or univerſally taken; or in any ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was not as truly God as man; or who was not that moſt high God, in whoſe name <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham.</hi> In this ſeede, and by this ſeede, all the Nations are bleſſed that ſhall be bleſſed. And whatſoever bleſſings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man or people receive from God in <hi>him</hi> as hee is the Sonne of God, or for his merits; they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them by him, &amp; through him, as he is the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and ſonne of man. And in this ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> this Covenant here eſtabliſhed with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> ſhall be performed according to the ſtrict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie or utmoſt improvement of the words or clauſe of the confederacie, or league offenſive and and defenſive betweene God and <hi>Abraham.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

ſhall bleſſe this ſeede, ſhall be bleſſed of God Whoſoever ſhall curſe this ſeede, ſhall be accurſed by God; and not ſo only, but whomeſoever this ſeede ſhall bleſſe, them likewiſe God the Father ſhall bleſſe: Whomſoever this ſeed ſhall pronounce accurſed, they ſhall ſtand accurſed (without revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or appeale,) by God the Father: For God the Father hath tyed himſelfe to conformity of ſentence with this ſeede of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Vnto whom this ſeede (now made King and Prieſt, and placed at the right hand of God) ſhall award this ſentence (which he will award as Iudge to all that ſhall be placed on hisright hand,) <hi>Come yee bleſſeſsed of my Father inherite the Kingdome prepared for you from the Foundation of the World,</hi> they ſhall be bleſſed by God the Father with everlaſting and immortall bliſſe.

                     <hi>Xenophon</hi> likewiſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes another League betweene the Grecians and the people of <hi>Aſia</hi> concluded by the blood of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which they mutually killed. The Grecians dipped their ſwords, and the Aſiatickes their lances in the blood of the Sacrifices, (which were a bull, a beare, a wolfe and a ramme) being firſt mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a ſhield or target; as if they had ſought to have made peace betweene theſe offenſive weapons of warre by making them pledge each other in a common cup. For ſo the moſt ſolemne manner of plighting faith betwixt ſome Nations was, for the one to take up the ſame cup from the others hand, and to pledge him in it; or in caſe no cup or wine could be preſently had, they were to lick the duſt of the earth at each others hands.</p>
                  <p>2 The manner of ſolemnizing this preſent League betwixt God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> at the firſt draught of it, was much what the ſame with that which <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> reports of the Eaſterne Kings. It was ſolemnized on <hi>Abraham's</hi> part by the effuſion of his owne and his ſonne <hi>Iſaac's</hi> blood, and ſo continued through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the generations of their poſteritie by cutting off the fore-skin of their fleſh. And inaſmuch as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was the ſigne, or ſolemne ceremony of this mutuall League betweene God and <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede; it is neceſſarily implyed by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7904:68"/>
the tenour of the ſame mutuall Covenant, that God ſhould ſubſcribe or ſeale the League after the ſame manner, and receive the ſame ſigne of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his fleſh which <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeede hath done.</p>
                  <p>3 This Covenant which was firſt entred by Circumciſion, was afterwards renewed on God's part, as on <hi>Abraham's</hi> part by mutuall and ſolemne ſacrifice. The manner of God's treatie or proceſſe with <hi>Abraham</hi> in this Covenant is worthy of ſerious obſervation: And <hi>Abraham's</hi> demeanour in all this buſineſſe is the moſt lively patterne, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite rule for all our imitation who deſire the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of faith or hope concerning our preſent or future eſtate in this gracious League or Covenant. Though it be moſt true, (which hath been often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated before,) that no man can deſerve any thing at God's hand, becauſe no man can give him any thing which hee hath not received from him; ſeeing no man can beſtow upon God, or convey unto him any title, or right of propriety which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, which God had not, before man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from him, or enjoyed it by him: Yet if we be content ſincerely to renounce our owne title or intereſt in the Creatures which wee have received from him, or in our ſelves, (who are likewiſe his, whoſe very being is the free gift of his goodneſſe,) he ſtill rewards us for every ſuch ſervice, or act of our bounden duty, with a larger meaſure of his bountie, then any deſervings of man from man can pretend unto. And thus he rewarded <hi>Abraham</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <hi>in kind;</hi> alwaies according to the qualitie or
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7904:69"/>
ſpecificall nature of his worke or ſervice; but for quantity farre beyond all proportion of any gift or ſervice which <hi>Abraham</hi> could preſent unto his God; though it had beene the ſacrifice of himſelfe, or of his ſonne. The firſt remarkable ſervice which God expreſt or required of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was to forſake his kindred and his Fathers houſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1. And in lieu of that intereſt which <hi>Abraham</hi> renounced in theſe, (thoſe being not the ten thouſand part of the Country wherein he lived) God gives him a juſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or intereſt to the whole land of Canaan, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to make a mighty Nation of his ſeede; to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect more then one or two Kingdomes out of it. And yet all this is but the pledge or earneſt of a farre better patrimony prefigured by it, and bequeathed with it as an inheritance conveyed by delivery of the <hi>terrar.</hi> The ſpirituall bleſſing envailed under this great temporall bleſſing, was, that God would be a God unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeede, and that they ſhould be unto him a people.

The Prieſt betweene God and man was but one, and yet truly God and truly man; ſo truly one that we cannot ſay the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> or ſon of man did provide the ſacrifice, and the Sonne of God did offer it, but (which is more admirable and more indifferent) the fleſh of this ſacrifice was humane, or mans fleſh as truly and properly as ours is; and yet as truly and properly the fleſh of God, as ours is the fleſh of man.

of God by perſonall Vnion, or Property, by a more peculiar title, then the blood in our bodies can be ſaid ours.

The Queſtion now in han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with its deciſion depends much upon Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or received rules (whether of ancient heathen Iewes, or Chriſtians) What oath made either by the true and only God, or by the imaginary Gods of the heathen did import more then ameere promiſe or threatning.

                  <p>2 Albeit that which the Apoſtle ſaith of the God and Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt [<hi>that hee had no greater by whom hee could ſweare</hi>] could have no place, at leaſt ſuitable to the eſtimation of the Gods, by which the heathens did ſweare or call to witneſſe; yet when Iupiter the greateſt God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them was either provoked or voluntarily pleaſed to ſweare by ſuch parts of this univerſe as were conceived to be his coequalls, his full peeres if not his betters, it was generally preſumed or belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the doome or ſentence ſo pronounced (were it bliffull or diſmall) was irreverſible.

                  <p>3 With the Hebrew Rabbins this tradition or received rule concerning the importance of God's oath, is ſo authentique, as it makes them more peremptory in their reſolution for the expiration of

Yet can I not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe, nor conceive any ſuſpicion that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Iewiſh Rabbins ſhould take their hints for thus interpreting the fore-cited or any other place of Scripture, wherein God's oath is interpoſed, from the Divinitie of the heathen: Much leſſe did the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets or Philoſophers (who were the beſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines the heathens had) borrow their fancies or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures from the Iewiſh Rabbins who were their punies; nor were the Fathers of the Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church the Fathers or firſt Authors of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique rule or tradition. All of them rather were beholding to the ancient Hebrewes or to Moſaicall or Propheticall writings for ſuch prenotions or confuſed apprehenſions, as in this ſubject they had. The conſent of the ancient Chriſtian Writers or Fathers, the diligent Reader may find in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon thoſe places of Scriptures, wherein God's oath is mentioned; but eſpecially in their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:7904:74"/>4 That God doth repent him, either of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill which he denounceth, or of the good which he promiſeth, is a phraſe moſt uſuall in Scripture; the true and punctuall meaning of which phraſe is, that God did change or revoke either his ſentences of calamity, or of good which hee in both caſes truly intended, and irreſiſtibly meant to put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And all this hee might doe, and often did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any change or alteration in his will or intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but alwaies upon ſome change or alteration in the parties either truly intereſſed in his promiſes, or lyable to his heavy judgments: when the one party did change from good courſes to evill, hee was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably free to reverſe his promiſe, (as hee himſelfe ſomewhere ſpeaketh) to breake his Covenant. And when wicked men did turne from their wicked wayes, he was as free and more willing to reverſe ſentences of woe, not only threatned, but decreed againſt them. This freedome in God is perpetually preſumed or taken as granted by his Prophets, whenſoever the promiſe, decree, or Covenant is not revealed unto them with the ſeale of an Oath. But the ſentence whether for good or evill being revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under Oath, was in their judgment fully declared to be irreverſible. For this reaſon the Prophet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wiſhed the ſpeedy execution of plagues threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by God unto their owne Nation or kindred; as knowing it bootleſſe either to intreat God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, after his wrath againſt them was denounced by oath, or to ſollicite the fulfilling of his gracious promiſes towards their poſteritie, untill his wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſentences confirmed by oath were put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

In one and the ſame Chapter, it is ſaid oftner then once, that <hi>God did repent him of making Saul King of Iſrael:</hi> What is the reaſon?

                  <p>5 A true parallel to the hiſtory concerning the anointing and depoſition of <hi>Saul,</hi> had beene exhibi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted before by the ſame Prophet in the election and depoſition of <hi>Eli,</hi> who was poſſeſſed of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by legall title, under divine promiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and to his houſe.

was ſent unto him by the Man of God mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>v.</hi> the 27. The ſame ſentence or curſe upon him &amp; his houſe is afterwards denounced by <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> under oath, <hi>And the Lord ſaid to</hi> Samuel, <hi>behold I will doe a thing in Iſrael, at which, both the eares of e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>very one that heare it, ſhall tingle. And in that day I will performe againſt</hi> Eli, <hi>all things which I have ſpoken againſt his houſe; when I begin, I will alſo make and end. For I have told him that I will judge his houſe for ever for the iniquity that hee knoweth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſonnes made themſelves vile, and he reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not: And therefore I have ſworne unto the houſe of</hi> Elie, <hi>that the iniquity of</hi> Elie's <hi>houſe ſhall not be purged with ſacrifice, nor offering for ever. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes 13. 14. 15. &amp;c.</hi> Now when <hi>Samuel</hi> had imparted this fearefull ſentence unto <hi>Eli,</hi> being thereunto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, he replied no more then this, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth him good. v.</hi> 18. Had this meſſage beene delivered by that man of God which brought the former, not ratified by oath, unto this good old man though an impotent Governour, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would have ſleighted it, as 'tis probable he did the former, or have called the meſſenger's Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in queſtion. But this later and more terrible doome being delivered to him by a child, who for his maintenance and being, did depend upon him as upon his foſter-Father; by a child ſo farre from ſecular cunning, or ſophiſmes of corrupt Prieſts or Levites, that hee knew not the voice of the Lord from the voice of his Tutor, untill he was inſtructed by him; his Commiſſion was to <hi>Eli</hi> more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, and his meſſage both for matter and tenour
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7904:75"/>
more free from all ſuſpicion of impoſture. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwer of <hi>Eli</hi> is of the ſame alloy with <hi>Iob's</hi> reply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſad newes which his ſervants brought to him. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob</hi>) <hi>hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord Iob.</hi> 1. 21. Thus he ſpake after hee had ſeene himſelfe and his familie utterly undone for worldly ſubſtance, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all earthly contentment. <hi>Eli</hi> knew this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt him being denounced by oath, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and impoſſible to be reverſed, as if it had been already put in execution. For this reaſon (I take it) the old man did thinke upon a more ſubmiſſive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto <hi>Samuel,</hi> then he had vouchſafed unto the Man of God, who was ſent unto him upon the ſame errand. The humility and modeſty of his anſwer perſwades me that the fearefull ſentence denounced againſt him, did extend no further then to the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible depoſition of him and his family from the legall or temporarie Prieſthood, unto the poore and meane eſtate wherein his poſteritie after the diſaſter of his two ſonnes, were to live here on the earth.

But whatſoever the two immutable things in this place meant by our Apoſtle, were; it is evident that his oath was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed for the conſolation and comfort of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his poſteritie; ſo the Apoſtle tells us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely, <hi>v.</hi> 18. and 19. <hi>That by two immutable things in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, wee might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi> The ſheat Anchor of this ſtrong hope or conſolation is firſt the irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of the promiſe: Secondly, the immutabilitie of the bleſſing promiſed; of which it is impoſſible that any ſuch heire of promiſe as <hi>Abraham</hi> was when God vouchſafed thus to ſweare unto him, ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faile or come ſhort.

Every thing in ſacred dialect is called a LIE which is ſubject to mutability, hazard or change; or on which one too much relying may be deceived or fall into danger: So ſaith the <hi>Pſalmist,</hi>

                  <p>3 But in all theſe paſſages before cited, there is no intimation of God's Oath for the confirmation

of his promiſe unto <hi>David</hi> and his <hi>Seedes,</hi> but to his <hi>Seede.</hi> Yet this aſſurance unto his SEEDE we have in the 132 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> which was compoſed by <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, toward the later end of his reigne, or after he had brought the Arke of the Covenant unto Mount Sion, the place dedicated by this pious King for its perpetuall reſidence. It is a point to me very conſiderable, that as God did not confirme his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of bleſſing to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Oath, untill <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had yeelded up by faith his only ſonne <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ſo did he not give <hi>David</hi> aſſurance by Oath that the ſeede promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be his ſeede; or that this his ſeede ſhould be the high Prieſt of the heavenly Sanctuary, until <hi>David</hi> had firſt bound himſelfe by ſacred Oath to prepare a place for the Arke of the Covenant, an habitation for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God of <hi>Iacob: Lord remember</hi> David <hi>and all his afflictions,</hi> Pſalme 132. v. 1! <hi>How he ſware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the mighty God of Iacob; Surely I will not come into the Tabernacle of my houſe, nor goe up into my bed; I will not give ſleepe unto mine eyes, or ſlumber unto mine eye-lids, untill I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God of Iacob, &amp;c.</hi> This great ſervice thus conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, and devoted by the royall Prophet: the mighty Lord (who will not ſuffer a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given to a Prophet in the name of a Prophet to paſſe unrewarded,) doth abundantly recompence, not in generall only, or by equivalencie, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done <hi>Abraham's</hi> and <hi>Iſaac's</hi> obedience, in <hi>kind.</hi> Thus much is implied <hi>ver.</hi> the 11. <hi>The Lord hath ſworne in truth unto</hi> David, <hi>hee will not turne</hi>

The originall occaſion, whether of that <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> tentations to queſtion the truth of God's promiſes to <hi>David,</hi> or (which I rather think) of the general diſtruſt in the diſcontented multitude of thoſe times, which he did rather ſeek to repreſent then approve, was this; Either they did not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh at all, or elſe not ſo well as they ſhould, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7904:82"/>
the Articles unto which God did ſweare, and the Articles unto which he tied himſelfe by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe only. The later were alway conditionall or ſubject to a forfeiture or revocation upon the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour of the parties whoſe good it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. <hi>I have found</hi> David <hi>my ſervant, with my holy oile have I anointed him, with whom mine hand ſhall be eſtabliſhed, mine arme alſo ſhall strengthen him: The enemy ſhall not exact upon him, nor the ſonne of wickedneſse afflict him. v.</hi> 20. 21. 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this, no good Chriſtian can doubt, was literally and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually meant of the ſonne of <hi>Ieſſe.</hi> As litle queſtion there is of the 25. <hi>v.</hi> I <hi>will ſet his hand in the Sea, and his right hand alſo in the Rivers.</hi> This, according to the literal meaning, expreſſeth the extents or bounds of <hi>David's</hi> or <hi>Salomon's</hi> Kingdome here on earth: For that extended from the <hi>Sidonian</hi> ſea on the Weſt, unto the diuiſion of <hi>Euphrates</hi> (on the Eaſt) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diverſe channels.</p>
                  <p>5 But this promiſe with the bleſſing promiſed, whereof <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> were fully poſſeſt, was myſtically (as hath beene obſerved before) to be fulfilled in the ſeede of <hi>David</hi> promiſed by oath, whoſe Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> over this inferiour world reacheth from ſea to ſea, over all the rivers and corners of the earth. The 26. 27. 28. <hi>verſes</hi> fall under the ſame rule or line. But although it were a part and a principall part of the bleſſing promiſed to <hi>David,</hi> that the Meſſiah ſhould be his Seede or Sonne, yet were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Salomon,</hi> nor any other of <hi>David's</hi> ſonnes any part of that promiſe. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>His ſeede alſo will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the</hi>

                     <hi>dayes of heaven.</hi> Thus the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh as the Apoſtle interpreteth the like promiſe (or rather the ſame promiſe made before to <hi>Abraham</hi>) not of <hi>David's</hi> Seed as of many, but as of one Seed, which is Chriſt. The Apoſtles Interpretation of God's promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> (I am not ignorant) hath much perplexed ſome learned Interpreters; but (as was obſerved before) men better verſed in rules of Grammar then in myſteries of Divinitie. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impertinent diſcourſes for ſalving the truth, or ſupporting the ſtrength of the Apoſtles inferences we may oftimes read, and ſometimes heare. But the old maxime, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> holds more true in this caſe, then in the point whereto the Philoſopher applies it: <hi>A groundleſſe doubt can never produce a pertinent anſwer,</hi> or be capable of a firme and ſolid reſolution. Now the men which have queſtion'd the force of the Apoſtles inference, did only or ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider the grammaticall uſe of the word <hi>Seede;</hi> which although it be of the ſingular number, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a multiplicity of perſons. But the ground of our Apoſtles inference was from the matter or bleſſing promiſed, not from the grammaticall forme of words wherein it was expreſſed. He could not be ignorant, nor was hee incogitant that moſt promiſes made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeede, did literally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to all his poſteritie, eſpecially to <hi>Iſaac;</hi> yet hee very well knew and conſidered that the promiſe of that ſeede, wherein all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, could be extended to no more then one ſeede, who was the promiſed ſeede of the woman. And unto this ſeede alone (promiſed by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7904:83"/>

This the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh not of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> ſeed as of one, but of his ſeeds as of many. Nor is it any where ſaid, that any or all of their thrones ſhould endure as the dayes of heaven: For all <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> children, beſides that one <hi>ſeede,</hi> were by the Pſalmiſt's owne acknowledgment, lyable to ſuch viſitations or cenſures as the Lord of Lords doth paſſe on other Kings and Potentates, according to their demerits at his pleaſure.

                  <p>6 What then, had <hi>David</hi> and his ſonnes no prerogative above other Kings or Princes? Did God make promiſe of no more favour and grace to <hi>David</hi> and to his ordinary ſeed then he had done to <hi>Saul?</hi> If wee ſhould thus conclude, the tenour as well of prophecies as of God's promiſes to <hi>David</hi> would convince us of error, and the hiſtoricall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents would determine againſt us. For neither <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's</hi> Idolatrie, nor <hi>Rehoboam's</hi> Oppreſſion (which was equivalent to Idolatrie) a fooliſh ſonne of a wiſe Father, did utterly extinguiſh the promiſes

made to <hi>David</hi> and his Succeſſors, though <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> fooliſhly intending the oppreſſion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, did impaire the bleſſing promiſed. For after both theſe had beene gathered to their Fathers, the Lord in mercy and in memory of his Covenant with <hi>David</hi> did often repaire the ruines which ſuch unwiſe Kings, as <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and ſome of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were, had made in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up ſuch lights unto <hi>David</hi> as <hi>Aſa, Iehoſaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Ioſias</hi> were.

And yet the forfeiture of their preſent eſtate, or of their intereſt in the Covenant made to <hi>David</hi> and his ſeede, did reach no further then to their owne perſons, or to their ſeede according to carnall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as is moſt elegantly and punctually expreſt in the <hi>verſe</hi> immediately following. <hi>Nevertheleſse my loving kindneſſe will I not take from him</hi> (that is, from <hi>David nor ſuffer my faithfulneſse to faile: My Covenant will I not breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. v.</hi> 34.

Two points more there be which require a further review before we leave this <hi>Pſalm;</hi> as, firſt unto what former promiſes made to <hi>David</hi> in his life time, the oath twice mentioned by the Pſalmiſt, doth literally referre. Our later Engliſh in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine upon <hi>v.</hi> the 3. ſends the Reader an errand, (I muſt confeſſe not impertinent) unto the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned place of <hi>Samuel.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 11. Yet an errand which that place cannot fully diſpatch; for in that place there is no mention of an Oath. Both the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cited out of the 89 <hi>Pſalme</hi> literally referre unto the promiſe mentioned by <hi>Samuel;</hi> but as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Oath upon record <hi>Pſalme</hi> 132. which, it is evident was compoſed by <hi>David</hi> himſelfe a long time after the promiſe avouched by <hi>Nathan</hi> in the 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. and longer before the 89 <hi>Pſalme</hi> was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The next querie worthy the judicious Readers conſideration, is; what God's Oath <hi>by his holineſse,</hi> or as the LXX Interpreters have it <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in or by my holy one doth directly ſignify or collateral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly import. That God ſwearing by his holineſſe did directly and immediately ſweare by himſelfe is not controverſed; for the Oath for its ſubſtance and eſſentiall object is the very ſame with that Oath which he made to <hi>Abraham Geneſis</hi> 22. where it is ſaid, <hi>by my ſelfe have I ſworne;</hi> for God's holineſſe is himſelfe. But for the collaterall object of this one and the ſame Oath I referre the judicious and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Reader to <hi>Calvin's</hi> expoſition or reſolution of this doubt thus related by <hi>Coppen</hi> in his ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>11 If this annotation be true and othodoxall, that when God did ſweare by his holineſſe, he did by way of atteſtation call his Temple his holy place to witneſſe, I ſhould not underſtand the materiall Temple as then not founded in Ieruſalem, but that heavenly Sanctuary, or moſt holy place whereinto God's holy one, whom he would not ſuffer to ſee or feele corruption in the grave, was, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, to enter; and there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as our immortall Mediator and Interceſſor.

                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:7904:86"/>12 If the allegations hitherto mentioned cannot perſwade, I hope the authoritie and arguments of our Apoſtle will enforce the ingenuous Chtiſtian Reader to grant the maine concluſion in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe intended. The Concluſion is briefly this [However God's Promiſe made without an Oath be in the aſſertive ſence the very ſame with promiſes confirmed by Oath; yet in the charactericall ſence they much differ.] Meere promiſes are conditionall and reverſible; the bleſſings ſo promiſed, mutable or determinable by time; but God's Oath annexed to his Promiſes, is alway a character of irreverſibility, and of everlaſting immutability after the bleſſing promiſed be poſſeſſed, ſo farre as it concerns the life to come. Two places there are in the ſeventh <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> very pregnant to this purpoſe, and which doe ſufficiently authorize the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned prenotion or received rule for interpreting all the former places of Scripture alledged, as wee have done. For after many forcible reaſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his Auditors that there was no ſuch <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the Law or legall Prieſthood, as the Patriarchs and their godly fore-fathers did hope and wait for: And that there was a neceſſity that both the Law and Prieſthood ſhould be changed (which is the Subject of his diſcourſe from <hi>verſe</hi> the 10) hee pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſpecially upon this <hi>verſe, And in aſmuch as not without an Oath he was made Prieſt; for thoſe Prieſts were made without an Oath, but this with an Oath, by him that ſaid unto him, The Lord ſware and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of</hi> Melchiſedech, <hi>by ſo much was Ieſus made a ſurety</hi>

And what more could be ſaid (in the aſſertive ſence) of our high Prieſt? Or what argument can there be drawne from ſacred authority that the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhould not be, that the Prieſthood of the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> ſhould be everlaſting and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? The only ſure ground of this inference is <hi>that</hi> mentioned by our Apoſtle [<hi>becauſe</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſonnes were made Prieſts; were deſtinated and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to their function</hi> without an Oath, whereas the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> was deſtinated and aſſigned to his Prieſthood after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Oath interpoſed by him that ſaid, <hi>Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchiſedech;</hi> which words are three or foure times reiterated in this <hi>Chapter.</hi> The contents or importances of the Oath are moſt divinely expreſſed by the Apoſtle from <hi>v.</hi> 23. to the end of the <hi>Chapter. And they truly were many Prieſts, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death, but this man (or rather this Prieſt) becauſe he continueth for ever, hath an unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prieſthood, wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver liveth to make interceſsion for them, for ſuch an high Prieſt became us who is holy, harmleſſe, undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſeparate from ſinnes and higher then the heavens, who needeth not dayly as thoſe high Priests to offer up ſacrifice firſt for his owne ſinnes, and then for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for this he did once when hee offered up himſelfe.

that did publikely defend the Chriſtian faith: Another <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was the laſt Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> leaving the Empire to the diſpoſall of the Turke. <hi>Baldwin Compeere</hi> of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloigne</hi> in the conqueſt of the Holy land and after his death created King of Ieruſalem, eſtabliſhed this new King dome in peace which hee had wonne by warre: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the ſame name and race leaves the Holy land it ſelfe for a prey unto the ſuperſtitious <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan,</hi> not repoſſeſt ſince his death by any Chriſtian Prince.</p>
                  <p>2 Nor doe humane ſtories only (though many beſides theſe alleadged might be produced) afford us inſtances or obſervations in this ranke: The viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kingdome or Common-wealth of Iſrael (taking Iſrael for the whole race of <hi>Iacob</hi>) was firſt eſtabliſh't and ſetled in peace by <note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 13. 8.</note>

In the dayes of <hi>Hoſea</hi> the ſon of <hi>Elah</hi> did Iſrael (as oppoſed unto the Kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> that is tenne Tribes of twelve) utterly ceaſe to be a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Both King and people were led captives by <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manezar.</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> The Kingdome likewiſe or Common-wealth of <hi>Iudah</hi> did finally expire and determine under Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together through this peoples fault; hee never ceaſt to be a Saviour, a greater Saviour of his people then Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Nun</hi> had beene, for hee was <hi>Salus ipſa, Salvation it ſelfe.</hi> But his people was become ſo wicked, that ſalvation it ſelfe could not ſave them,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7904:88"/>
or preſerve their common-wealth from ruine. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit to ſpeake the truth, this Ieſus our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did rather tranſlate the Kindome of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>David</hi> from earth to heaven, then ſuffer it utterly to periſh. He ſtill remaines a King, and of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome there ſhall be no end; though his Kingdome be not of this world, nor over <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Iacob</hi> according to the fleſh, yet hee ſtill ruleth in <hi>Iacob</hi> unto the ends of the world, and ſo ſhall rule world without end. This tranſlation of the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> from earth to heaven, or this new erection of this heavenly Kingdome by Ieſus Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, was prefigured by onother Ieſus, as lively a Type or ſhadow of Chriſt as Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Nun</hi> had been.</p>
                  <p>3 For after <hi>Iudah</hi> through her riot and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy had procured her bane, as her ſiſter <hi>Samaria</hi> had done, and was carried for dead out of the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings wherein Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Nun</hi> had firſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her; the Lord in his all-foreſeeing providence, and in ſigne what was after to be accompliſhed and fulfilled concerning the Kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> would have another Ieſus, the ſonne of <hi>Iehoſedeck,</hi> to let <hi>Iudah</hi> after her recovery from captivity or civill death on her feet againe.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7904:89"/>
as King. In reſpect of their deliverance from <hi>Babel,</hi> or ſafe conduct in the way <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of Ieſus the high Prieſt, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had the precedency of Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Nun</hi> in reſpect of the peoples deliverance from Egypt. But as Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Nun</hi> was God's principall inſtrument in planting this people in the land of promiſe, ſo Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the high Prieſt the ſonne of <hi>Iehoſadeck</hi> is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Saviour of this people after their ſafe returne from <hi>Babel,</hi> into their native land; the principall type or ſhadow of Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour as he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by God to be the Author of everlaſting ſalvation. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> the chiefe Prince of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Iehoſadech</hi> the high Prieſt (and for his time the ſole ſucceſſor of <hi>Aaron</hi> in his office,) joyne both together, the one a lively type of Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> as he was King, the other a lively Type of Chriſt Ieſus as hee was ordained to be our high Prieſt in the building of the materiall Altar, which was to be erected unto the Lord in the City of Ieruſalem after their returne from Babylon. But whether of theſe two, to wit, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> or Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Iehoſedech Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's</hi> ſucceſſor, had precedency in this great worke of erecting the Altar unto God (the firſt worke of difficulty or moment to be undertaken by God's Servants upon their returne unto Ieruſalem the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God,) were hard to determine by any rule of ſacred <hi>heraldry. Ezra</hi> the ſcribe and ſacred hiſtorian of this buſineſſe gives Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>Iehoſedeck</hi> the precedency in ſtile, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Then ſtood up le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua the ſon of Iozadak and his brethren the Prieſts,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>4 Yet that Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>Ioſedech</hi> was the more illuſtrious and principall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Type of Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour and Redeemer as he is the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and founder of God's ſpirituall Temple, (Gods holy Catholique Church) is moſt apparent from the prophecies of <hi>Zachary,</hi> a Prophet in thoſe times extraordinarily rais'd up by God to encourage le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the high Prieſt and his fellow-Prieſts to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in building the materiall Temple in Ieruſalem, ſpecially if we compare <hi>Zachary</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> and part of <hi>Zachary</hi> the <hi>ſixt</hi> with the Prophecies of <hi>Ieremy, Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>verſe</hi> 33.

ſet out unto us as in a Map. <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. The whole <hi>Chapter,</hi> as alſo the 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> from the 6. <hi>verſe</hi> unto the end is worth our peruſall as moſt pertinent to this argument. Firſt <hi>Sathan,</hi> that is the adverſary of Ieſus the high Prieſt, waxed bold to reſiſt him in the building of the materiall Temple, being encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged thereunto partly becauſe the remnant of <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> then returning from captivity was but as a <hi>brand pluck't out of the fire,</hi> the light whereof in the eyes of <hi>Sathan</hi> their adverſary might eaſily have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed unleſſe the Lord had rebuked <hi>Sathan,</hi> as the Lord there by his Angell doth; and his rebuke was an Authentique prohibition. Secondly <hi>Sathan</hi> was the bolder to reſiſt this worke, becauſe Ieſus the high Prieſt appointed by God and encouraged by his Prophets for accompliſhing of it, was for his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſence but weake, and would quickely have beene daunted by his potent adverſary, unleſſe the Lord by his Angell had rebuked and prohibited him. Thus <hi>Sathan</hi> himſelfe in perſon reſiſted our Lord and Saviour after his baptiſme, when hee firſt begun to lay the foundation of his Church and to erect the Kingdome of God, being thereto embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by the weakneſſe of his bodily preſence and appearance in the faſhion of man and forme of a ſervant, untill the Lord himſelfe rebuked him (as the Angell in the name of the Lord did the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of of <hi>Ieſhua</hi>) ſaying, <hi>avoid Sathan, for 'tis written thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> And upon this rebuke <hi>Sathan</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately left him, and the Angels came and miniſtred unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 4. This is the Evangelicall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7904:90"/>
of the viſion which <hi>Zachary</hi> ſaw as in the type or map. <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 2. But here it will bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether the <hi>verſes</hi> following. <hi>v.</hi> 3. 4. which were literally &amp; hiſtorically meant of Ieſus the Son of <hi>Iehoſedech</hi> can be applied to Ieſus our high Prieſt, either according to the literall or myſticall ſenſe? <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>was cloathed with filthy garments and ſtood before the Angel, and hee anſwered and ſpake unto thoſe that ſtood before him ſaying, take away the filthy garments from him, and unto him he ſaid, Behold I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſse from thee, and I will cloath thee with change of rayment v.</hi> 4. Ieſus his outward habit or rayment, was ſordid and unſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Qualem decet exulis eſſe,</hi> Such as well became a man as yet <hi>retainer</hi> to the houſe of mourning, not fully abſolved from the houſe of his priſon, or not yet admitted unto the houſe of his freedome.</p>
                  <p>5 This Ieſus in this habit was a true picture of Ieſus our high Prieſt whilſt hee continued in the forme and conditiion of a ſervant, or whilſt arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the high Prieſts, or <hi>Pontius Pilat;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this eſtate he knew no ſin, yet as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith 2. <hi>Cor. Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> laſt. <hi>He was made ſinne for us that we might be made the rigteouſneſse of God in him.</hi> Hee is ſaid to be <hi>made ſinne</hi> for us, becauſe hee bare the puniſhment due to our ſinnes. And this ſinne or iniquity God did truly cauſe to paſſe from him, becauſe our ſinnes were never inherent in him, but made <hi>his</hi> by imputation only. The puniſhment likewiſe due unto our ſinnes did paſſe from him at his departure out of this world unto his Father. The new rayments wherewith Ieſus the high Prieſt was
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7904:91"/>
cloathed, are emblemes, or ſhadowes of that glory and immortality wherewith Ieſus our high Prieſt ſince his Reſurrection is inveſted. The faire Mitre, which was put upon Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>Iehozadeck's</hi> head, was the modell of the Crowne of <hi>David</hi> which was to flouriſh upon Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> head, as it is <hi>Pſalme</hi> 132. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>But upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhall his Crowne flouriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6 Briefly, the proteſtation which the Angell in the <hi>verſes</hi> following makes to Ieſus the Son of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech</hi> is but a renewing or repetition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which God had made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> concerning their ſeede. The tenour of God's promiſe here renewed or repeated unto Ieſus the high Prieſt is the <hi>ſame: And the Angell of the Lord proteſted unto Ieſhua,</hi> ſaying, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord of boaſts, if thou wilt walke in my wayes, and if thou wilt keepe my charge, then thou ſhalt alſo judge my houſe, and ſhalt alſo keepe my Courts, and I will give thee places to walk among theſe that ſtand by.</hi> Theſe words containe as ample a patent for the temporall or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Prieſthood unto Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>Ioſedech</hi> and his poſteritie, as <hi>David</hi> had for continuation of the temporall Kingdome in his race or progeny; both the promiſes and patents were conditionall. But that there ſhould ariſe an everlaſting Prieſt, as well as an everlaſting King, one in whom God's promiſes ſhould not be conditionall but <hi>yea and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that is, abſolute and irrefragable, the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> addes, <hi>Heare now O Ieſhua the high Prieſt, thou and thy fellowes that ſit before thee, for they are,</hi> what are they? <hi>monstrous perſons,</hi> ſaith our former
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7904:91"/>
Engliſh, or <hi>men wondred at</hi> ſaith the later; <hi>Viri por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendentes</hi> ſaith the vulgar. The Prophets meaning is that they are men ſet for types or ſignes of great matters to come. The word in the originall is the ſame. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Say I am your ſigne, like as I have done, ſo ſhall it be done unto them,</hi> that is, to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ieruſalem, and houſe of Iſrael; <hi>they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and goe into captivity.</hi> As <hi>Ezechiel</hi> his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging through the wall in the peoples ſight, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying forth his ſtuffe upon his ſhoulders in twilight, with his face covered, that hee ſhould not ſee the ground, was a ſigne or prognoſtication of <hi>Zedechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's</hi> ſtealth or flight from the Chaldeans army which beſieged him: So <hi>Ieſhua</hi> the high Prieſt, and all his fellowes in all this action or ſolemnity (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in laying the foundation of the Altar and Temple) were prognoſticke ſignes or prefigurations of Ieſus the everlaſting high Prieſt, and of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Temple, (the holy Catholique Church) which he was to build by the miniſtry of the Apoſtles. So it followeth, <hi>for behold I will bring forth my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the branch. For behold the ſtone that I have laid before</hi> Ieſhua, <hi>upon one ſtone ſhall be ſeven eyes, behold I will engrave the graving thereof, ſaith the Lord of hoaſts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>2 This place and the former are pregnant that the Servant of the Lord whoſe name was <hi>Zemah</hi> the Branch, whoſe office was to build up the Temple of God, ſhould be a Prieſt, and ſhould ſit upon his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7904:92"/>
Throne as Prieſt. But it cannot from either place be gathered; it is not ſo much as intimated that hee ſhould either be a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> or of the ſeede of <hi>Aaron</hi> as Ieſus, or <hi>Ioſhua</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Iehoſedech</hi> was. But as the Prophet affirmeth not, that hee was to be Prieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of <hi>Aaron</hi> or <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> ſo neither in plaine termes doth hee deny it: true, but as every Prophet of God ſpeakes nothing but the truth, ſo neither doth one of them ſpeake all the truth, or all that is requiſite for us to believe concerning Ieſus our Saviour. That the man whoſe name was the Branch, (the ſame party of whom <hi>Zachary</hi> here ſpeakes) ſhould not be of the ſeed of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Aaron</hi> is evident from the prophecy of <hi>Ieremiah. Ier.</hi> 23. 5. uttered more then ſeventy yeares before <hi>Zachary</hi> began to prophecy. <hi>Behold the dayes come ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto</hi> David <hi>a righteous Branch, and a King ſhall raigne and proſper, and ſhall execute judgment and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice upon the earth. In his dayes</hi> Iudah <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely; and this is his name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhall be called, the Lord our righteouſneſſe.</hi> It is plaine then out of the fore cited prophecy of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary,</hi> that God's ſervant the righteous Branch was to be a Prieſt: It is evident againe out of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> that he was to ſpring out of the ſeede of <hi>David,</hi> and to raigne as King over <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> had done. And theſe two put together will directly conclude, that this Branch of <hi>David</hi> was to be that ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> concerning whom the Lord had ſworne and would not repent, that hee ſhould be a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7904:93"/>
Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who was both King and Prieſt, and by interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the King of righteouſneſſe, and King of peace: both which titles are expreſſely given to this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God and Branch of <hi>David,</hi> the one by the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> the other by the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 But is it intimated or fore-told by either of them, that he ſhould be as truly <hi>David's</hi> Lord, as <hi>David's</hi> Sonne? Yes, <hi>Ieremy</hi> implies this in fuller termes then <hi>David</hi> himſelfe doth <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 110. for <hi>David</hi> ſaith, the Lord ſaid unto my Lord <hi>Adonai,</hi> not <hi>Iehovah,</hi> whereas the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> tells us that the ſupreame ſtyle or title of this Branch of <hi>David</hi> ſhould be not <hi>Adonai Tzadkenu,</hi> but <hi>Iehova Tzadkenu, Iehovah</hi> our righteouſneſſe: So that hee whom <hi>David</hi> in ſpirit calleth his Lord, was to be as eſſentially Lord and God; as he that <hi>ſaid</hi> unto him, <hi>ſit thou on my right hand, till</hi> I <hi>make thine enemies thy foot stoole.</hi> But was he according unto this name or title prefigured or fore-ſhadowed either by <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi> the Prince of <hi>Iudah,</hi> or by his aſſociate Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the high Prieſt in conducting Gods people from the land of their captivity into the land of promiſe? Yes there is not one title or attribute mentioned in either prophecy but it is fore-ſhadowed, either joyntly both by <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> &amp; Ieſus the high Prieſt, or ſeverally by one of them.</p>
                  <p>4 As he is the Branch of <hi>David</hi> fore-prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied by <hi>Eſaiah. Chap.</hi> 11. 1. (where to both theſe prophecies of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,) hee is more exquiſitely prefigured

Of this ranke or ſort of names is the name <hi>Iehoſadech</hi> as it was given unto the Father of Ieſus the high Prieſt, but this doth no way import that he was either <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> or a man more righteous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other high Prieſts had beene; and yet ſo called not by chance or out of vain oſtentation of his parents, but by divine inſtinct or appointment of God: Or whatſoever intent his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts might have in giving him this name, God did ſo direct their intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as he did <hi>Caiphas</hi> his ſpeech to be a kind of prophecy of what was to come. We may ſay of <hi>Iehoſadech</hi> as the Angell ſaid of Ieſus and his fellow-Prieſts, that hee was <hi>vir portendens,</hi> his very name and office did portend <hi>or bode</hi> that <hi>Iehovah</hi> himſelfe the righseous Lord ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our high Prieſt. And in as much as the Sonne of <hi>Iehoſadech</hi> was the firſt high Prieſt, the firſt of all the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> that was called Ieſus, that is, a Saviour, this likewiſe did portend or fore-ſhadow that the Saviour of God's people, the high Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> ſhould be the ſon not of <hi>David</hi> only but of <hi>Iebovah</hi> the righteous Lord, or Lord of righteouſneſſe. And if he were to be as truly the Sonne of <hi>Iehovah</hi> the righteous Lord, as he was to be the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> then que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe hee was to be as truely <hi>Iehovah,</hi> that is, as truly and eſſentially God, as hee is truly and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially man. For the relation betwixt the Father and the Sonne is much more ſtrict in the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then it can be amongſt men.</p>
                  <p>9 Amongſt men it will follow that if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

be a man, the Sonne muſt be a man; if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be mortall the Sonne muſt be mortall: but it will not follow that if the Father be a righteous or potent man, the Sonne likewiſe muſt be a righteous or potent man. The reaſon is becauſe they are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſubſtance. But in as much as the Sonne of God is of the ſame ſubſtance or eſſence with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will directly follow not only, that if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be God, the Sonne is God, but alſo that if the Father be Lord of righteouſneſſe, the Sonne alſo muſt be Lord of righteouſneſſe.

But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath fully anſwered this objection, if wee could as rightly apply his ſolution. <hi>All</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are not</hi> Iſrael <hi>that are called</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. Yet many are true Iſraelites indeed which are not ſo in name; <hi>Nor is he a Iew that is one outwardly, but that is one inwardly.</hi> The Apoſtle in the ſame place gives us to underſtand, that many are Iewes or of <hi>Iudah</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, which are not of <hi>Iudah</hi> outwardly, or ſo called by name. Whoſoever is inwardly or in heart that which the name of <hi>Iudah</hi> importeth, he is truly of <hi>Iudah,</hi> though not the ſeede of <hi>Iudah</hi> or of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> concerning the fleſh. Now the name of <hi>Iudah</hi> or Iew importeth as much as a confeſſor or true profeſſor of <hi>Abraham's</hi> faith, and every one is a true Iſraelite, that is ſo qualified as <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was, <hi>one in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile:</hi> unto all ſuch and only unto ſuch the Lord imputeth no ſinne: and all they unto whom the Lord imputeth no ſinne; all ſuch as truly confeſſe Chriſt to be the Sonne of God and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7904:97"/>
promiſed Branch of <hi>David</hi> are ſaved by him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be the ſomes of <hi>Iacob</hi> or of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Gentiles according to the fleſh. So that in concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ludah and all Iſrael according to the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this prophecy are ſaved by this Ieſus: for all of them dwell in ſafety, they are not become afraid of themſelves, but poſſeſſe their ſoules with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. To become Iewes or Iſraelites in this ſenſe is the firſt degree of ſalvation, and this degree they likewiſe have from Ieſus, through whom and in whom they are to expect the accompliſhment of their ſalvation. Chriſt then firſt ſaves us from our ſins that are inherent in us, or (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) hee firſt <hi>ſets us free from the Law of ſinne</hi> by the ſpirit of life which is in him, and finally exempts us from the wages of ſinne which is everlaſting death. And thus much is contained in that fore-cited pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 16. and in the <hi>cloſe</hi> and concluſion of that prophecie, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. concerning the ſaving of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the branch of <hi>David</hi> whoſe name or title is, The Lord our righteouſneſſe. <hi>Behold the dayes come ſaith the Lord that they ſhall no more ſay the Lord liveth which brought up the children of Iſrael out of the land of Egypt; but the Lord liveth which brought up, and which led the ſeede of the houſe of Iſrael out of the North country:</hi> The Hebrew phraſe <hi>Meeretz zaponah,</hi> according to the uſuall and ordinary rate of that language, ſignifies indeed from the North-land; yet the originall of this ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or importance of theſe words, was from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which the Iews, or ſuch as had their habitation neere unto the Aequinoctiall line, had; That thoſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7904:97"/>
parts of the world which were more remote from the Aequinoctiall or Southerne climes were hidden from the ſun, and were at leaſt in reſpect of <hi>their</hi> Country, lands of obſcurity and darkneſſe. The very prime and native ſignification of the originall words in the Prophet, rendred by our Engliſh <hi>from the North land or Country,</hi> is <hi>verbatim</hi> from the land of obſcurity or darkneſſe. And whatſoever the land of Chaldea (whereof Babylon was the chiefe City or Metropolis) was unto others, it was unto the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Iewes a country of darkneſſe, a land of obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the very ſhadow of death. And their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from it was a true type or ſhadow of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the region or land of darkneſſe it ſelfe. The full importance of the Evangellicall myſtery included in the fore-cited paſſage of the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> according to the moſt proper and moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite literall ſenſe is expounded unto us by our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>S. Paul. Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 12. 13. <hi>God the Father</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath made us meete to be partakers of the Saints in light, and hath delivered us from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkneſſe, and tranſlated us into the Kingdome of his dearly beloved Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 So that this part of <hi>Ieremie's</hi> prophecie. 23. 6. <hi>In his dayes Iudah</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall dwell in <hi>ſafety,</hi> muſt be fulfilled in every one of us more exquiſitely then it was in the whole remnant of <hi>Iudab</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> which returned in ſafety from Babylon the land of their captivity unto Ieruſalem, the place of their peace and reſt. Every one of us muſt be ſaved from the land of darkneſſe, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the Kingdome of light, before wee can
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7904:98"/>
be ſure of our ſalvation; before our election and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation can be made certaine unto us. For every one of us is by nature the child of wrath; every one of as as he is the ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> carries a Babel or maſſe of confuſion about with him, or rather lives in it as in a walking priſon. Every one of us is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to morethen Baby loniſh, to more then Egyptian ſlavery. Our very ſoules which are the light unto our bodies; our very minds which have the ſame place in our ſoules which <hi>Goſhen</hi> had in Egypt, are darkened or (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) are darkneſſe it ſelfe. Now to extract or draw us out of our ſelves, or out of that ſervitude unto finne in which wee were borne, or to bring us out of that darkneſſe which is within us, is a greater miracle a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable document of God's infinite power &amp; wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then the bringing of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Egypt, then the reſcuing of <hi>Iudah</hi> from the captivity of Babylon were. God did make the winde and waters his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to overthrow <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoaſt in the red ſea: he made his Angels miniſtring ſpirits to conduct <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their departure thence; but to draw us out of our ſelves, to extract our mindes and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from the dreggs of the fleſh, to tranſlate them from the powers of darkneſſe to the Kingdome of light, the miniſtry or ſervice of Angels or other creatures did not ſuffice. For accompliſhing this great worke the Sonne of God himſelfe became a Servant. Hee that was eſſentially <hi>Iehovah,</hi> God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did cloath himſelfe with ſalvation as with a garment, and became a Saviour not in the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of an Angell; not in our meere ſhape and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7904:100"/>
ceremonies; and chang'd into the Lords day: And the Lords day beſides the repreſentation of God's reſt from his workes of creation upon the Seventh day, containes a weekly commemoration of our Redemption from the bondage of finne and powers of darkneſſe (repreſented by the thraldome of Iſrael in Egypt) through the Reſurrection of our Lord and Redeemer. Againe, no ſolemnity in all the ſacred Calender of legall foaſts was more peremptorily enjoyned, or ſtrictly obſerved then the feaſt of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, or Attonement; yet was not this anniveriary feaſt ſo properly aboliſhed as accompliſhed or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by that one everlaſting attonement made once for all by the Sonne of God upon the Croſſe. For albeit that attonement in reſpect of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or offring, was but once made, yet the vertue or efficacy of it is not circumſcriptible by time, nor interruptible by any moment or inſtant of time. Though hee dyed but once to make ſatiſfaction for us, yet he liveth for ever to make interceſſion for us, and is a perpetuall propitiation for the ſinnes which we dayly and hourely commit, and for his ſake and through his propitiation, all our ſinnes, who truly beleeve in him, and ſupplicate unto him for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion ſhall be not in generall only but in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular freely pardoned. Not doth the abſolute ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting perfection of this attonement any way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite us Chriſtians to keepe a ſolemne commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the day whereon it was made once for all. But whether this commemoration were ordained or obſerved by the Apoſtles themſelves, or taken up by voluntary tacite conſent of the Church after
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7904:100"/>
the Apoſtles had finiſhed their pilgrimage here on earth, I dare not take upon mee to determine: But whether from this or that authority or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, moſt Chriſtians are ready to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Friday before Eaſter, &amp; acknowledge it to be a <hi>good day</hi> becauſe it is the Commemoration of our Saviour's <hi>Paſsion</hi> and attonement made by it. And albeit this humiliation were much more ritually and ſeverely obſerved by all of us then it is by ſome few, we ſhould not tranſgreſſe any Law of God, nor ſwerve from the analogie of Chriſtian faith, but rather accompliſh the true intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> for the ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the day of legall Attonement. The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our ſelves upon that day by faſting and Prayer is a like common and lawfull both to the Iew and Chriſtian, and the repreſentation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Chriſt's bloody Death upon that day by Communication of his Body and Blood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſacramentall ſignes and pledges, is rather an accompliſhment then an aboliſhment of the legall ſacrifices, or other ceremonies of the Prieſt's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> upon the tenth day of the month <hi>Tiſri.</hi> A commemoration of which day the moderne Iewes to this day celebrate with fooliſh and phantaſticke ceremonies, as by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of a <note n="*" place="margin">Vide.

For aſſoiling this or the like Querie about the uſe of words, eſpecially ſuch as are legall, I know no fitter diſtinction then that plaine maxime of the Schooles, <hi>Omne maius continet in ſe ſuum minus non formaliter tamen ſed eminenter: Every greater containeth the leſſe of the ſame kind, not formally but by way of eminencie.</hi> It were no branch of untruth to ſay that a quadrangle is two, and that a five-angled figure is three trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles; yet would it be a ſoleciſme to ſay the one were three triangles, and the other two triangles. If wee ſhould be directly demanded what manner of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure this or that were; the only true and punctuall anſwer muſt be that the one is formally a quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, the other a quinqangle. To deny any King of England for the time being to be Duke of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, would be cenſured for more then an errour or Logicall untruth; for ſince the annexion of that great Dukedome to the Crowne, every King of England hath had as juſt and full a Title to it, as to the Kingdome it ſelſe, or ancient Crown-lands. And yet if a Lawyer or other skilfull in drawing legall inſtruments ſhould in thoſe very Charters or dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the royall power grants, not as King of England, but as he is Duke of Lancaſter, enſtile him only thus, <hi>H.</hi> by the grace of God, Duke of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter &amp;c. doe give and grant to <hi>N.</hi> omitting his royall Titles, it would be a dangerous ſoleciſme in Law.

It is no ſinne to ſay that the Friday before Eaſter is the day of our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, or that the firſt day of the weeke on which Chriſt roſe from the dead is the Chriſtian Sabbath: but the more Evangelicall or royall Style is to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the one the Lords day rather then the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; and the other rather Good-Friday, or <hi>feria quinta in hebdomade ſancta</hi> (that is, the fift day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the precedent dominicall in the holy weeke) then the day of our Attonement.

                  <p>5 But ſeeing wee Chriſtians affirme that our high Prieſt did accompliſh the legall prieſthood and ſacrifices by his bloody ſacrifice upon the Croſſe, the Iew may object that however his ſatisfaction might be full for ſubſtance, yet it failed in congruity of circumſtances, and in particular for the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time. [<hi>O pus diei decenter fit in die ſuo;</hi>] E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very worke is then well done, then better done then otherwiſe it could be, when it is done in its owne time or proper day: If then Chriſt made full attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all our ſinnes by his owne ſacrifice upon the Croſſe, this ſacrifice had been offered in better ſeaſon upon the day of attonement which was the tenth day of the ſeventh month or September, then on that day wherein hee offered it, which was the fourteenth day of the firſt month, a day as farr dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in time from the day of attonement, as one fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivall day or ſolemnitie can be from another. The anſwer firſt in generall is that ſeeing our high prieſt was to offer but one bloody ſacrifice, and that one not oftner then once (for as his death ſo his ſacrifice was never to be reiterated) it was impoſſible hee ſhould offer this one ſacrifice (by which all legall ſacrifices and ſervices were to be accompliſhed) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame day, wherein all the ſacrifices which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7904:102"/>
did fore, ſhadow it were offered or performed. As impoſſible it was that this his only ſacrifice ſhould be offered at ſeverall times, as in ſeverall places. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moſt in the Romiſh Church ſeeme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch both parts of this impoſſibility, yet they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch it with this diſtinction or limitation that his bloody ſacrifice was but once offered, and that but in one place, at one and the ſame time. But of this (if God permit) hereafter. His bloody ſacrifice that Church doth grant was to be offered but once, and therefore but upon a ſpeciall day or ſolemne feaſt, which did fore-ſhadow it by the proper ſacrifice of that day. Now not only the annuall but all the dayly ſacrifices did fore-ſhadow this his bloody ``ſacrifice once offered for all: and all of them were ``accompliſhed by it. Reaſon, from theſe premiſſes ``may inſtruct us, how requiſite it was that he ſhould offer this ſacrifice at that time, or upon that day on which the principall ſacrifices of the Law, which moſt exquiſitely or moſt lively fore-ſhadowed it, were offered. The ſervices or ſacrifices of other feaſts were to attend or conjoyne themſelves to this. Now as Ieruſalem was the Metropolis of the Iewiſh Nation, the place wherein all the ſeede of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> whereſoever they dwelt were to preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to performe the ſolemnities and ſervices of their principall feaſts; ſo the Paſſeover was the Metropolis of their ſolemne feaſts: all other feaſts had ſpeciall reference unto it; It did point out the time as Ieruſalem did the place wherein all other le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſolemnities were to be accompliſhed. Seeing then our high Prieſt was to accompliſh as well the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices

of the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Albeit divers bloody ſacrifices were offered upon the feaſt of attonement, yet the principall and moſt publike ſolemnitie was the leading of the ſcape-goat into the wilderneſſe. <hi>Levit. 16. v. 20. 21. And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation and the Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ar, hee ſhall bring the live goat, and</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and conſeſſe over him all the iniquities of the children of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſsions in all their ſinnes, putting them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of the goat, and ſhall ſend them away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderneſſe.</hi> To accompliſh the myſtery of this ſervice our Saviour was led by the Spirit into the wilderneſſe immediately after his Baptiſme, bearing the iniquity of this people, even all the ſinnes which had been confeſſed by <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> at <hi>Iohn's</hi> baptiſme. And though he himſelfe needed not to be waſhed and baptized as being all cleane; yet, as heeſaith himſelfe, it became him to be conſecrated by baptiſme to this ſervice to fulfill all righteouſneſſe; and by fulfilling this part
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7904:103"/>
of righteouſneſſe in bearing the ſinnes, which this people had confeſſed, into the wilderneſſe hee made a fuller attonement for Ieruſalem &amp; Iudah then any high Prieſt before had made. That curſe wherewith <hi>Malachy</hi> had threatned the Lord would ſmite the earth or land of Iewry was for this time averted, by this his bloody ſervice.</p>
                  <p>6 But as our Saviour at the time of his baptiſme which was upon the day of attonement had fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the myſtery of the ſcape-goat; ſo hee was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the myſtery fore-ſhadowed by the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſacrifice of the paſchall Lambe. To this purpoſe <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt upon his returne from the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had prophecied <hi>behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world. Iohn.</hi> 1. 29. Hee had borne the iniquity of Ieruſalem and Iudah by his journey unto, by his faſting and watching in the wilderneſſe, and from this <hi>Iohn</hi> fore-ſaw he was to take away or beare (for ſo the originall may import) the iniquites or ſinnes of the world. He is called by <hi>Iohn</hi> and others the Lambe of God, for his innocent and ſpotleſſe life; yet not ſo much (if at all) with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Lambes offered in the dayly ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (which were altogether without ſpot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh) as with reference to the paſchal Lambe, which was to be the choiſeſt and fayreſt of the flock: and for this reaſon God in his wiſdome would have him ſacrificed at that feaſt or very time wherein the paſchall Lamb was ſtain, <hi>id est,</hi> upon the fourteenth of the firſt month <hi>inter duas veſperas betwixt the two evenings.</hi> Some think betwixt three of the clock, and the day-going or ſtarre-riſing. Out Saviour
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7904:104"/>
died a litle after three, and was brought in peace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his grave about the ſun-ſetting, and by reſt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall in it hath hallowed the houſes of death as the paſchall Lambe did the houſes of the Iſraelites wherein it was ſlain, and purchaſed our ſafety from the deſtroying Angell, even whilſt our bodies lodge within the land of darkneſſe or region of death. The congruity of time and other circumſtances between the ſacrifice of the paſchall Lambe and the ſacrifice of our high Prieſt are ſo manifeſt and ſo well known as they need no further comment.</p>
                  <p>7 The myſtery fore-ſhadowed by <hi>Iſrael's</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of Egypt (which firſt occaſioned the inſtitution of the Paſſeover) was ſo great that the Lord in memory of it did give the month wherein that deliverance was wrought, the preheminence of all the months in the year, whereas before that time the month of September, in which the feaſt of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement was celebrated, was for order of time or accompt the firſt, as being the ſeaſon according to the tradition of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and in all probability of reaſon, wherein the world was firſt created. And after the month of Abib had by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment got the preeminence of all other months; yet the month <hi>Tiſri,</hi> or September ſtill retaines the precedency in the civill accompt of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> for matters temporall or ſecular. The accompt of their yeares in matters of contract or bargaine, as of morgage or purchaſe was alwaies to be taken from Iubile to Iubile, or from one Sabbaticall or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth yeare to another. And the yeare of Iubile or Sabbaticall yeare did alwaies begin and end in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7904:104"/>
month of September. And as wee of this land have two accompts, the one from the yeare of the Lord, the other from the raigne of the King; ſo had the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> two accompts of the yeare more diſtinct and certaine then ours are. The one for matters civill or ſecular, according to which accompt September was the firſt month, and March the ſeventh month. The other for matters Eccleſiaſticall or ſpirituall, and according to this accompt the month of Abib or March was the firſt month, and September the ſeventh month. And becauſe matters ſpirituall, or belonging to the ſervice of God, or ſtate of his Church were the matters which God did principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect in the inſtitution of his Law, therefore the month Abib or March after this peoples delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Egypt, though not before, was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted the prime and principall month.</p>
                  <p>8 So then albeit the feaſt of Attonement, and the feaſt of the Paſſeover differ as much in reſpect of the diſtance of time as any two feaſts in the yeare can doe, as having juſt halfe a yeare betwixt them; yet for identity of ſeaſon, or congruity of other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances they agree the beſt. Both of them are in their kinds the firſt months, light and darkneſſe hold the ſame proportion in both. Both of them diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute day and night by equall ballance to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt's conception fell upon the feaſt of Attonement, and the ſolemnity of this feaſt was in diverſe reſpects accompliſhed by our Saviour at his Baptiſme or Conſecration to his propheticall function. Our Saviour's owne conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption was about the feaſt of the Paſſeover, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7904:105"/>
it was for congruity of time that hee ſhould fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the courſe of his mortall life, and accompliſh all the legall ſacrifices by the bloody ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon that day, at that time wherein hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the firſt beginning of life as man; fitting it was that he ſhould be conceived to life immortall in the wombe of the earth upon the ſame day, or at that time wherein he had firſt been conceived in the Virgins wombe to the miſeries and fraile eſtate of mortality. Briefly then in the alienation of prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, or precedency from September to March the tranſlation of the Attonement or Expiation from the one month or the other was included and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed. The month Abib was by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment made the firſt and principall month of the whole yeare with reference to this great worke of finall Attonement or Expiation which was to be wrought in it by the bloody ſacrifice of the high Prieſt, in which all other ſacrifices and ſolemnities had their end and finall accompliſhment. There was no legall feaſt of Attonement to be celebrated after it.</p>
                  <p>9 Againe for circumſtance of time it was moſt fitting and congiuous that the ſecond tabernacle ſhould be erected at the ſame time and ſeaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt tabernacle was erected, that the high Prieſt of the new teſtament or everlaſting taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſhould be conſecrated at the ſame ſeaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the high Prieſt of the Old Teſtament or earthly tabernacle was conſecrated. Now the firſt taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was erected and <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Prieſt thereof conſecrated in the firſt month Abib, as is apparent
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7904:105"/>
from <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. <hi>v.</hi> 2. The tabernacle was begun to be ſet up upon the firſt day of that month, and was twelve daies in erection. <hi>Aaron</hi> was ſeven daies in his Conſecration, but whether he was conſecrated in the firſt ſeven daies of the month, or whether his Conſecration begun from the eighth day and laſted to the fifteenth, is all one for congruity of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration of our high Prieſt. Sometimes it ſo falls out that the Evangelicall miſteries begin where the legall ſhadowes doe end, and are as it were uſhered in by them; ſome-times againe the miſteries fulfilled upon the ſame day wherein the legall ſervices or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, which fore-ſhadowed them, were, or ought to have been celebrated. But it is more then probable from many circumſtances, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. that <hi>Aaron's</hi> Conſecration did not begin till the ſeventh or eighth day of the month Abid, and ended the fourteenth or fifteenth.</p>

For in <hi>Aarons</hi> Conſecration there be many circumſtances which neceſſarily imply, preſuppoſe, or argue ſuch imperfections and defects either in <hi>Aaron's</hi> perſon, or in the ſacrifices or rites by which he was conſecrated, as may not ſo much as be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined in our high Prieſt, in his ſacrifice or any part of his ſervice: But rather theſe imperfections in <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:7904:106"/>
perſon, in his ſacrifice or Prieſthood, doe ſerve as <hi>foiles</hi> to ſet forth the excellent and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection of our high Prieſts perſon, of his ſacrifice, and of his Prieſthood. Firſt it was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or imperfection in <hi>Aaron's</hi> perſon, that hee ſhould ſtand in neede of a ſinne-offring, or of an offring of Attonement to make him capable of the dignity of legall Prieſthood, or of his Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it. This diſſimilitude betweene the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the high Prieſt of the Old Teſtament and the high Prieſt of the New is expreſt by our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 26. 27. <hi>For ſuch an high Prieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came us, who is holy, harmeleſse, undefiled, ſeperate from ſinners, and made higher then the heavens, who needeth not dayly as thoſe high Prieſts to offer up ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, first for his owne ſinnes and then for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: For this hee did once when hee offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 So farre was our high Prieſt from ſtanding in need of any ſinne-offring or ſacrifice for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that hee himſelfe became the full and perfect attonement for the ſinnes of the whole world, even the ſinne-offring for the high Prieſts themſelves which yearly made attonement for the people. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine 'twas a defect or imperfection in the ſacrifices by which <hi>Aaron</hi> was conſecrated in that they were more then one or of diverſe kinds; for of bloody ſacrifices there were three; a bullock for a ſinne-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring, and two Rammes, the one for a fire-offring or ſacrifice of reſt, the other the Ramme of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration or of filling the hand. It argues againe a greater defect in all theſe ſacrifices, whether you
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7904:107"/>
take them <hi>coniunctim</hi> or <hi>diviſim,</hi> in that they were to be often offered. And this defect or imperfection in the ſubſtance of theſe ſacrifices, or in the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, or his ſervice, the Lord ſought to recompence or ſupply by the perfection of the number of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times or ſolemnities in which they were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For theſe ſacrifices were to be offered ſeven times. <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes were to fill their hands ſeven dayes together before their Conſecration was accompliſhed. Our high Prieſt as he had no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice but one, to wit, the ſacrifice of himſelfe; ſo was he to offer this ſacrifice, or this ſacrifice was to be offered but once, either for his owne or for our Conſecration. And by this once offring of this one ſacrifice hee did fully and abſolutely accompliſh whatſoever was fore-ſhadowed by the full number of the legall ſacrifices or ſolemnities which were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron.</hi> For the number of ſeven is a full number, yea a number full of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and wherein the Spirit of God ſeemes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Herein then as hath been intimated before, the high Prieſt of the New Teſtament, and the high Prieſt of the Old exactly agree; that as the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the one, ſo the Conſecration of the other was to laſt ſeven dayes. <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes as you may read <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. were commanded to attend at the doore of the tabernacle ſeven dayes together. Our Saviour after his entrance into Ieruſalem did attend the Temple five dayes together teaching and inſtructing the people, and in curing the blind and lame which were brought unto him. Hee was more frequent and diligent in performing thoſe and the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7904:107"/>
like acts of mercy, then <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes were in offering ſacrifices or performing other legall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. And having purged the materiall Temple from brothery and merchandizing, reſtoring it to the uſe of prayer, which the high Prieſts of the Law had turned or ſuffered to be turned into a denne of theeves; having thus purged the Temple on the firſt or ſecond day of his Conſecration, and afterwards hallowed it by his Doctrine, by his preſence and exerciſe of holineſſe in it, hee went the ſixth day into his heavenly Sanctuary, into Paradiſe it ſelfe to purifie and ſanctifie it with his owne blood, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate it for us, as <hi>Moſes</hi> at <hi>Aaron's</hi> Conſecration did purifie and conſecrate the materiall Sanctuary and the Altar with the blood of Bullocks and of Rammes. Yet was not this Conſecration as yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed: the period or accompliſhing of it is from the moment of his Reſurrection or Reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſoule and body. As <hi>Aaron</hi> firſt, ſo every high Prieſt of the Law after him was to continue ſeven dayes in his Conſecration, that the ſeventh day or Sabbath might paſſe over him; becauſe no man, as they conceive, can be a compleat Prieſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a Sabbath have gone over his head. But the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord did never ſo exactly paſſe over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny high Prieſt in his Conſecratton as it did over the high Prieſt of the New Teſtament. However it were of <hi>Aaron's</hi> it was the laſt day of his Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it was to him indeed a Day of reſt, after ſix dayes of labour, of watching, praying, faſting, and after hee had accompliſhed the workes which his Father had ſent him to doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, by the torments of his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7904:108"/>
bloody ſactifice, and whatſoever paines he ſuffered upon the Croſſe. But after he had ſaid <hi>conſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>matum eſt,</hi> which was in the end of the ſixth day, in that day whereon God firſt had made man, and the Son of God had now redeemed man; his Conſecration was not yet conſummate, his body was to reſt the Seventh day in the grave: And his ſoule in bliſſe all the Sabbath or Seventh day, and after the heavenly Sanctuary had been thus hallowed by the reſt and preſence of his bleſſed ſoule in it on the Seventh day, his ſoule and body were reunited upon the firſt day in the morning, at that time when the light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be diſtinguiſhed from darkneſſe. And this was the time of the accompliſhment of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or of his admiſſion to the Prieſthood after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 So then to be ſeven dayes in Conſecration was no imperfection in <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Prieſthood, but rather a myſtery to be accompliſhed in the Conſecration of the Sonne of God. That <hi>Aaron ſhould have his hands filled ſeven dayes together</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> with the ſacrifices which were offered for him, was an argument as well of his owne perſonall imperfections as of the imperfections of his ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Howbe it the <hi>myſtery</hi> or <hi>morall</hi> implyed by the <hi>filling of the hand,</hi> was no point of imperfection; and for this reaſon was as exactly fulfilled in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> high Prieſt as in the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron.</hi> The <hi>morall</hi> implied by the <hi>filling of the hand,</hi> was to ſignifie that <hi>Aaron</hi> did not uſurp the dignity of Prieſthood, or take it up (as we ſay) at his owne hand, but was hereunto lawfully and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7904:108"/>
called by God, from whom hee had received whatſoever he had. The inference hence made by our Apoſtle is this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. 5. <hi>No man taketh this honour to himſelfe but he that is called of God as was</hi> Aaron: <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelfe to be made an high Priest, but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Sonne to day have I begotten thee.</hi> Hee that had thus ſaid unto him did likewiſe prepare or fit a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to him for his ſacrifice, hee did not fill his hand with ſacrifices or burnt offrings.</p>
                  <p>4. It was an imperfection likewiſe in <hi>Aaron's</hi> perſon or his ſacrifices or in both; his Conſecration it ſelfe was imperfect in that his Conſecration did not ſerve for the Conſecration of his ſonnes, or his Succeſſors: all of them were to have their ſeverall ſacrifices or other ſolemne rites of Conſecration. The perfection which this <hi>foil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> ſets forth in our high Prieſt and his Conſecration is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, <hi>that we are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified through the offering of the body of Ieſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> Hebr. 10. 10. <hi>Every Prieſt ſtandeth dayly miniſtring and offering oftimes the ſame ſacrifices which can never take away ſinnes; but this man</hi> (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Prieſt) <hi>after he had once offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, for ever ſate downe on the right hand of God, and henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footſtool. For by one offering he hath conſecrated for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> ver. 11. 12. 13.</p>
                  <p>5 As many as have reaped or hereafter ſhall reape any benefit, either from Gods's Oath to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> concerning his ſeede in whom all the Nations of the earth were to be bleſſed, or from the Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Oath to <hi>David</hi> concerning his ſon which

The Law (ſaith the Apoſtle) makes men high Prieſts which have infirmity, but the word of the Oath which was ſince the Law maketh the Sonne high Prieſt, who is conſecrated for evermore; and by this his Conſecration wee, even all the Iſrael of God are conſecrated by an everlaſting Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Ieſus Christ the firſt begotten of the dead, and Prince of the Kings of the earth hath waſhed us from our ſins in his owne Blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests</hi> (that is Prieſts after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi>) <hi>unto God and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> By this his Conſecration likewiſe to his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Prieſthood we are hallowed and conſecrated as Temples to our God, ſo ſaith <hi>S. Peter.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>To whom comming as to a living ſtone, diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed of men, but choſen of God and precious, yee alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpirituall houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up a ſpirituall ſacrifice, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>5 But to take the ſeverall bloody ſacrifices which were offered at the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes, into more particular conſideration; Albeit theſe ſacrifices were all imperfect, not only abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, or in reſpect of our high Prieſt's everlaſting ſacrifice, but even in reſpect of theſe ſpirituall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices mentioned by <hi>S.

The beſt and chiefeſt in the whole ranke of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall or Aaronicall ſacrifices; they are as ſo many <hi>lineaments</hi> pourtraying in part, or fore-ſhadowing that body or accompliſhment not of them only, but of all other ſacrifices. All meet in it as ſo many lines in their Center. The firſt bloody ſacrifice that was offered at the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> was a Bullock. The Prieſts might offer no other ſacrifice then this for their owne ſinne-offering, becauſe this was of all other the beſt, and yet in compariſon of this, ſaith the Pſalmiſt in the Perſon of this our high Prieſt in his affliction, <hi>I will praiſe the name of God with a ſong, and will magnifie him with thankſgiving, this al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His meaning was that this ſacrifice of thankſgiving ſhould be more acceptable unto God then the very beſt ſacrifice of the Law; and ſo it was, eſpecially whilſt offered by our high Prieſt, even when he offered his bloody ſacrifice upon the Croſſe, and after his enemies had given him vineger in his thirſt to drink.

It did in circumſtance at leaſt prefigure the Sacrifice of our high Prieſt after the ſame manner or in reſpect of the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that the annuall ſacrifices of Attonement did prefiure it; of which hereafter. Inaſmuch as the head and fleſh &amp;c. of the Bullock for ſinne-offering or Attonement for <hi>Aaron</hi> at his Conſecation, was to be offered or burnt without the campe, not to be burnt upon the Altar; It fell under the ſame Law,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7904:111"/>
and undergoes the ſame conſiderations which the annuall-Sacrifices in the feaſt of Attonement did. For ſo it is expreſſely commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 14. <hi>That the fleſh of the Bullock and his skinne ſhould be burnt without the Camp, becauſe it was a ſin-offering.</hi> Now it was an univerſall and peremptory Law that no fleſh of any Sacrifice, whoſe Blood was brought into the Sanctuary to make Attonement, ſhould be eaten by the Prieſts in the Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>2 It was againe a Law as peremptory, that the Prieſts, eſpecially the high Prieſts might, (that is, had power to) eat the fleſh of any Sacrifice whoſe Blood was not brought into the Sanctuary. For to this purpoſe <hi>Moſes Levit.</hi> 10. 17. expoſtulateth with <hi>Aaron's</hi> ſonnes which were left after the death of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu. Wherefore have yee not eaten the ſinne-offering in the holy place, for it is the holy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and it, (vz. the fleſh of the ſin-offring) he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you to beare the iniquity of the Congregation, to make Attonement for them before the Lord: Behold the Blood of it was not brought in, behold indeed you ſhould have eaten it in the holy place as I commanded you. Aaron</hi> in his Apologie for his ſonnes againſt this accuſation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in no caſe queſtions the truth or extent of this commandement, but rather excuſeth himſelfe and his ſonnes for not obſerving the purport of the Law as the caſe ſtood with them; his two ſonnes <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> being lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with fire iſſuing out from before the Lord, for offering ſtrange fire, (<hi>which he had not commanded them</hi>) upon his Altar. And ſeeing that although they had put off all the reſpect of the obedience of his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7904:112"/>
ſonnes, yet could he not put off the affection of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father towards them, or ſuddenly ceaſe to mourne for their untimely death; whereas to have eaten the Sacrifices in the holy place with a ſad countenance or heavy heare had been to pollute it. So that this ſad and ivofull accident made the eating of the ſinne-offring in the holy place unlawfull or unexpedient to him and his ſonnes, which ordinarily or in caſe no ſuch accident had befallen them, had not only been lawfull but neceſſary. But ſeeing the blood of the Bullock offered for <hi>Aaron's</hi> ſinne-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering at his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration had not been brought into the Sanctuary, and ſeeing no ſuch wofull accident or legall impediment had at this time befallen <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and his ſonnes, it may juſtly be queſtioned what was the reaſon they did not eate the fleſh of this their ſinne-offring or Attonement? It was a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant unto them not to eat it becauſe the Lord had forbidden it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 14. But if it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what was the reaſon or intent of this Law; or rather of this particular exception from the generall Law by which they were commanded to eate it? Some make anſwer that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes were not as yet compleat Prieſts, or Prieſts already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, but in their Conſecration only, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were not comprehended under the generall Law which commanded the Prieſt, forbidding all others, to eate the fleſh of the ſinne-offering whoſe blood was not brought into the Sanctuary. But this reaſon concludes only in probability againſt <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes, who did now attend their Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it no waies concludes againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> who did
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7904:112"/>
conſecrate them, who was not only permitted but commanded by God to eate of all the Sacrifices or offrings which <hi>Aaron's</hi> ſonnes or Succeſſors might lawfully eate; yet did not <hi>Moſes</hi> eate any part of the Bullock offered at <hi>Aaron's</hi> Conſecration for a ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offring or Attonement, for God had expreſſely commanded it to be burnt without the Campe. <hi>Their</hi> anſwer therefore to that former demand, is more pertinent, who ſay that no high Prieſt, whether or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily called or extraordinarily, (as <hi>Moſes</hi> was for the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes) might eate of any ſacrifice which was offered for a ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offring or Attonement for the Prieſts themſelves, although the Blood of it were not brought into the Sanctuary. Of the Sinne-offrings for the people whoſe Blood was not brought into the Sanctuary the Prieſts might eate, they were to eate.</p>
                  <p>2. This commandement for them to eate of the peoples ſinne-offring, argues the ſinnes of the people were to be borne or taken away by the Prieſt. The prohibition for the Prieſts to eat the Sinne-offrings made for themſelves, argues the ſinnes of the Prieſt could not be borne or taken away by the Prieſts of the Law or their ſacrifices, but were to expect a better ſacrifice of a better high Prieſt: The legall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in the meane time were to be offered in a place prefiguring the place wherein this better Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was to be offered, a place without the gates of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Whiles the people wandred in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe without any ſetled habitation, or City to dwell in, the Sacrifice or ſubſtance of the Sinne-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring was to be conſumed with fire without the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow if we conſider the ſpeciall references of the Aaronicall Prieſthood, there could no fitter Sacrifice be offered for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes at their Conſecration then the Sacrifice of Rammes; no other Sacrifices uſed in the Law could be ſo fit an embleme or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our high Prieſt's Sacrifice at his Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The points whereto the Aaronicall Prieſthood (whether during the time of their Conſecration, or after <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes were conſecrated Prieſts,) had peculiar reference, were two. The firſt, the ſolemne memorial, the commeration or reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and with his ſeede, or the continuall acceptance of it, by performing the obedience which God required at their hands in all their ſacrifices. The ſecond was a perpetuall repreſentation of the accompliſhment of this Covenant on God's part in and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Seede or Meſſias. God had promiſed by oath to <hi>Abraham</hi> that in his ſeede not only <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede after the fleſh, but all the Nations of the earth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7904:114"/>
that follow the ſteps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhould be bleſſed. And in this promiſe confirmed by oath it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as hath beene often mentioned before, that the Sonne of God ſhould become <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede, and that the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> thus made the Sonne of God ſhould be offered up to God in ſuch a manner as God required <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his ſonne <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> that is in a true and bloody ſacrifice. <hi>Iſaac's</hi> approach to death was a type, a figure, or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Saviour's bloody death. <hi>Iſaac's</hi> ſtrange deliverance from this bloody death mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his Fathers outſtretehed hand armed with a bloody knife, was a type or ſhadow of our Saviour's Reſurrection from death, which God his Father had not only threatned but inflicted upon him. Now as that which <hi>Abraham</hi> intended to have done to his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> was accompliſhed by God upon his only ſonne, ſo <hi>Abraham's</hi> words to <hi>Iſaack</hi> when hee intended to offer him up in bloody ſacrifice became a true prophecy of our Saviour's bloody ſacrifice. <hi>Iſaac</hi> bearing the wood of the burnt offering upon his back, and obſerving his Father to cary fire in the one hand, and a knife in the other, no creature in the world beſides themſelves being preſent, moved this queſtion, [<hi>Behold the fire &amp; the wood, but where is the Lamb for the burnt offring?</hi>] <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>anſwers, God will provide himſelfe a Lambe for a burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, my Sonne. Gen.</hi> 22. 7. 8. Whatſoever the naturall conſtruction of <hi>Abraham's</hi> anſwer in theſe words might import, <hi>Abraham</hi> at this time had no other intention then to offer up his ſon <hi>Iſaack</hi> for a burnt offering. Howbeit his words without wrong to their
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7904:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
grammaticall conſtruction in the originall might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as much, and as the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> conceive, they did to <hi>Iſaac's</hi> apprehenſion imply as much as if hee had ſaid, [God will provide himſelfe a Lambe for a burnt offering, even thee my Sonne; or, God will provide the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> my Sonne for a burnt offering.] And from this apprehenſion or conſtruction of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> words, <hi>Iſaac</hi> (as the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> have a tradition) forthwith became willing to be offered up in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for a burnt offering, ſuffering himſelfe to be bound upon the Altar by his Father, being able if he had been ſo diſpoſed to make reſiſtance, as being now at leaſt 25 years of age.</p>
                  <p>2 However it were, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was as willing to be offered as <hi>Abraham</hi> was to offer him. And yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi> former words are more exactly fulfilled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the preſent then if <hi>Iſaac</hi> had been then offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Altar: For though God had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his only begotten ſonne <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> for a burnt offering, yet hee had been a burnt offering of <hi>Abraham's</hi> providing; but the Ramme which was caught by the hornes in the thicket was a burnt offering of God's proviſion meerly: It was no part of <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſtore, of <hi>Abraham's</hi> proviſion, fore-caſt or fore-ſight. The Ramme queſtionleſſe came not thither from any neighbour place by chance; God did provide it for a burnt offering by a manner extraordinary and miraculous. For if <hi>David</hi> would not offer a ſacrifice to God of that which coſt him nothing, or of that which was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans by former poſſeſſion untill he had made it his owne by a better title then by free donation,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7904:115"/>
or his owne by a juſt price or valuable conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Abraham</hi> doubtleſſe would not have offered a ſacrifice unto the Lord of that which he might ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly ſuſpect to be the goods of another man untill he had bought it of the known owner. But knowing this Ramme to have been of God's own or meere provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by meanes miraculous or extraordinary, hee forthwith offered it for a burnt offring inſtead of his son. So then the League or Covenant betwixt God and <hi>Abraham</hi> is concluded and ſubſcribed unto on <hi>Abraham's</hi> part with the ſacrifice of a Ramme, and was to be continued or accepted of by <hi>Abraham's</hi> poſterity with continuation of like ſacrifices. The high Prieſts themſelves who were in their ranke and order, mediators or interceſſors for continuing and eſtabliſhing this Covenant between God and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> ſeede, were to be ſolemnely conſecrated by the ſacrifice of Rammes; And in memoriall or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of <hi>Iſaac's</hi> deliverance from death, the Iewes did celebrate that day wherein God provided this ſacrifice inſtead of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that was (according to their Kalendar) the firſt of September or feaſt of Trumpets, with the ſacrifice of Rammes. But they conſidered not that in the words of God's oath to <hi>Abraham</hi> it was implyed that God would give his Sonne his only Sonne for ſuch a bloody ſacrifice or burnt offering as <hi>Abraham</hi> intended to have made of his ſonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi> They conſidered not that in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi> anſwer to <hi>Iſaac, The Lord would provide himſelfe of a burnt offering,</hi> and in the miraculous proviſion of the Ramme for a burnt offering inſtead of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> it was implyed or fore-ſignified as well by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7904:116"/>
matter of fact, as by expreſſe word of prophecy, that God would provide matter of ſacrifice when he ſhould offer his only Sonne after a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent miraculous manner, then he had now done the Ramme inſtead of <hi>Iſaack.</hi> For ſeeing the Sonne of God as God could not dye, he therefore provides him a mortall body taken from the ſeede of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the ſubſtance of the bleſſed Virgin, and ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites it to his divine perſon, that whilſt this ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> was offered in ſacrifice, the Sonne of God was likewiſe offered, that whilſt <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede was thus conſecrated by bloody ſacrifice, the Sonne of God was likewiſe conſecrated to be the high Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> that is, to be the Author, Donour, and Diſpenſer of that bleſſing which <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in the name of the moſt high God, whoſe Prieſt he was, beſtowed on <hi>Abraham,</hi> and which God upon <hi>Abraham's</hi> readineſſe to offer <hi>Iſaac</hi> did by ſolemn oath bind himſelfe to perform, and to performe it in <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede. The neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence or abſtract of which oath, as it is before manifeſted was this, that <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeede ſhould be that moſt high God in whoſe name <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> had bleſſed <hi>Abraham.</hi>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7904:116"/>
ſtraining will more naturally beare, <hi>In the mountain the Lord or Iehovah will be ſeene.</hi> And this Proverbe taken up upon theſe occaſions, in whether ſence or conſtruction you liſt to take it, was more then a Proverbe, a true myſtery or myſticall prophecy exactly fulfilled in the crucifying of our Saviour. The Lord in the Mount did ſee and was ſeene by his ſpeciall providence when hee provided the Ramme for a ſacrifice inſtead of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whereon <hi>Abraham</hi> purpoſed to have offered <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as he was commanded by God, for a burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was one of the mountaines in the land of <hi>Moriah,</hi> and that (as all interpreters agree,) was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place wherein Ieruſalem was afterwards built; moſt are of opinion that it was that part of mount Sion wherein the Temple was afterwards built, wherein the threſhing-floore of <hi>Arauna</hi> ſtood, which <hi>David</hi> conſecrated for the Altar of God. But whether it were this mountaine or mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary</hi> I will not diſpute. Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> likewiſe was in the land of <hi>Moriah,</hi> and in this mountaine <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah did ſee, and was ſeene,</hi> he did in this mountain provide himſelfe of a Lambe for a burnt offering, he himſelfe became a Lambe or viſible ſacrifice for our ſinnes, by whoſe blood he himſelfe, and wee in him were conſecrated Prieſts to God the Father. The other circumſtances, whether concerning <hi>Iſaac</hi> or the Lambe, were viſibly and remarkably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the ſacrifice of the Sonne of God. <hi>Iſaac</hi> did beare wood for the ſacrifice up into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine where <hi>Abraham</hi> intended to ſacrifice him: The Sonne of God did bear the wood of the Croſſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7904:117"/>
whereon he was ſacrificed, at leaſt part of it, up to mount Calvary. The Ramme which God provided inſtead of <hi>Iſaac</hi> was caught by the hornes in the thicket of brambles or thornes; and the Lambe of God the Sonne of God marched to his Croſſe with a Crowne of thornes and brambles upon his head, as moſt of the Fathers and beſt moderne interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters collect from the Evangeliſts ſtory. For where it is ſaid that they tooke off the purple robe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther royall enſignes wherewith they had in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery inveſted him, it is not mentioned that they tooke off this Crown of thornes; this was the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket wherein the murtherers caught him: For as yee know he was condemned upon pretence that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Crowne of <hi>David,</hi> and ſuffered himſelfe to be entitled and ſaluted the King of the Iewes, and in deriſion of this great myſtery which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not, they put a Crowne of thornes upon his head and crucify him in it.</p>
                  <p>4 But whilſt the Princes of the earth and the Rulers take counſell againſt him, while the heathen-Souldiers and Iewiſh pepole doe rage and make a mock of him, hec that ſate in the heavens laught them to ſcorne, what they did act in jeſt or ſcorne here on earth, he turnes into earneſt and ratifies by an everlaſting decree in heaven. They cloath the Sonne of God with a purple or royall robe, and bowing their knees thus they ſalute him, <hi>Haile King of the Iewes,</hi> unwittingly fore-prophecying as <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> did, as well by matter of fact as by word, that God would now annoint the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> to be that King over Sion to whom all knees ſhould bow
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7904:117"/>
of things in heaven, of things on the earth, of things under the earth. They in deſpite and bitter ſcoffes wreath a Crown of thornes or brambles about his head, and faſtened it on with a reede or mock-ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they had put into his hand, litle conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that hee which ſate in the heavens did conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate him here by this part of his afflictions to the wearing of that everlaſting Crowne of glory which <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 132. had fore-told <hi>ſhould flouriſh upon him whilſt his enemies were cloathed with ſhame. ver.</hi> 18. And of this Crowne of Glory as well the royall Diadem or Crowne of <hi>David,</hi> wherein his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were enthronized, as the Crowne of holineſſe wherein <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Succeſſors the high Prieſts were conſecrated, were but the ſhadowes or models, and ſo no queſtion was the Crowne upon the Arke or Mercy-ſeat. And it is a point which I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto the ſerious reader's obſervation, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the reading of the apocalyps or the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in all or moſt part of the viſions made to <hi>S.

For though he was alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally ſanctified, and though this his internall ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification was moſt abſolute and perfect from the wombe, yet would the Lord have him thus viſibly and externally conſecrated with his owne blood, that we by the ſame blood might be ſanctified and conſecrated after a better manner then <hi>Aaron</hi> was by the blood of the Ramme of Conſecration. The morall implyed in ſprinkling of <hi>Aaron's</hi> right eare, the thumbe of his right hand, and the great toe of his right foot is this, Our eares which are the ſenſe

                     <hi>CHAP. 28.</hi> A briefe Recapitulation of what hath been ſaid in this parallel between the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Conſecration of the Sonne of God; the concluſion of the whole Treatiſe concerning it.</head>

                  <p>2 The everlaſting ſacrifice whereby he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated an everlaſting Prieſt was then accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and the ceſſation of the Aaronicall Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood proclaimed when hee ſaid <hi>conſummatum eſt,</hi> and commended his ſpirit unto God. Yet is it not probable that his Conſecration, or the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the everlaſting Sanctuary were at the ſame inſtant accompliſhed. His ſacred ſoule perfumed with the freſh odour and fragrancy of his ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice, annointed with his moſt precious blood into whatſoever other place it afterwards went, inſtantly repaired into the Holieſt of Holies, into Paradiſe it ſelfe. This is the accompliſhment of our Attonement, prefigured by the high Prieſt's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the holy place with blood, <hi>and the period of all ſacrifices for his owne or our Conſecration.</hi>

And reaſon they had to obſerve this ſigne or accident, in that hee had promiſed to one of them that were crucified with him, <hi>Hedie mecum erit in Paradiſo.</hi>

                  <p>4 The publike ſolemnitie of Conſecration hath ever been a ſpeciall teſtimony or adjunct of lawfull calling; and Chriſt's Conſecration was more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and publique then <hi>Aaron's</hi> was. Such it was as fleſh and blood could not affect; ſuch as nothing but filiall obedience to his heavenly Father, could have moved this our high Prieſt to admit, becauſe it was to be accompliſhed by a lingring and a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy death. <hi>Moſes</hi> at the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> is commanded to gather all the congregation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto the doore of the tabernacle. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. <hi>Ad tria voluit Dominus populum congregart: Primum ut pro eo ſacerdos offerret, eum<expan>

                  <p>7 The Tribes of Iſrael were never ſo maliciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly and ſtubbornly bent againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and <hi>Aaron's</hi> ſucceſſors with their complices, were againſt the ſonne of <hi>David;</hi> to whom the Lord deſtinated the Prieſthood after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> by ſolemn oath.

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> We have ſeene in part how fitly that teſtimony of the <hi>Pſalmist, Thou art my Son this day have I begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee,</hi> beeing underſtood of Chriſt raiſed from the dead, is avouched by our Apoſtle to prove Chriſts calling, his Conſecration and advancement to the Prieſthood here mentioned, to have been from God; and from the event anſwering to the <hi>Pſalmist's</hi> prophecy, and from that other teſtimony of <hi>Pſalme</hi> 110. often mentioned, <hi>doth S.

                  <p>9 So then the day of his Reſurrection is the day wherein the dignity of everlaſting Prieſthood is actually collated upon him, and as he himſelfe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, <hi>All power is given unto mee both in heaven and earth.</hi> And if all power; then as well the power of Prieſthood, as the power royall.

Prieſt he gives Commiſſion to his Diſciples to teach and baptize. The day of his Aſcenſion or placing at the right hand of God is the day of his ſolemne enthronization, and immediately upon this hee ſent forth the Rodde of his ſtrength out of Sion. For by this rodde (fore-told by the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 110.) we are to underſtand that power, wherewith his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were to be endued from above, which they were to expect in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at the feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> The effuſion of the holy ſpirit, and emplanting the Law of the Goſpell in their hearts upon that day or the day following wherein the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> was proclaimed, was as a proclamation to all the world, that the Prieſthood was tranſlated, or changed by this manifeſt tranſlation, or change of the Law.</p>

For the bittereſt and deepeſt ſting which wordly croſſes, or multiplicitie of buiſineſſes, or other vexations paſt have left in my thoughts, is this, That my portion for many yeares in all theſe, (reſpectively) hath brought a neceſſity upon me, either not at all, or in my old and decaying daies to publiſh the fruits of my former labours in theſe great myſteries, which to my apprehenſion had beene well <hi>ſet</hi> in my flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and vivid yeares; or (to borrow an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from a more ſacred and more authentique Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)<note place="margin">* <hi>Hezekiah 2.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7904:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theſe being the theames or ſubjects of anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Sermons upon the ſolemne feaſts unto which they properly belong as well in the Court, as in the Vniverſities, and all other well ordered Churches throughout this Kingdome; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what I muſt ſay concerning theſe two points as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ingaged to bring this long treatiſe concerning the knowledge of Chriſt and him crucified to ſome period.</p>
                  <p>3 The true or Chriſtian beliefe of any Article in the Creed includes ſomewhat more then an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, more then a pious opinion or meere probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its truth; and the knowledge of the myſteries laſt mentioned, in our Apoſtle's meaning or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, imports ſomewhat more then a meere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of them; more then ſuch a beliefe, or the ſight, or experiment of greateſt miracles could produce or eſtabliſh in moſt docile Auditors whether of our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe, or of his Apoſtles; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the beſt &amp; moſt docile of the Diſciples or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles which had been ear-witneſſes of his heavenly Doctrine, and eie-witneſſes of all his miracles from his baptiſme or temptation in the wilderneſſe unto his repoſall in the grave, did not know halfe ſo much concerning the myſteries of his Croſſe, of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and bloody death, before his Reſurrection as they did after it, nor did they ſo well underſtand ſo much of the power and vertue of his Reſurrection it ſelfe, for many dayes after their experience of the truth of it, as they did after his Aſcention into heaven, and the deſcenſion of the holy Ghoſt upon them; by whoſe efficacious inſpiration or operation
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7904:125"/>
in their hearts and ſoules, the knowledge of all the fore-mentioned Articles was much increaſed, and their beliefe of the meaneſt matters which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Chriſt, much better rooted and ſtrengthened, then it had been before his glorification: His placing at the right hand of God in his throne of majeſty did crowne their former beliefe and glorious hopes with freſh joy and comfort.</p>
                  <p>4 Wherein the knowledge of Chriſt, and the knowledge of other ſubjects, whether philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or mathematicall, or in other termes, wherein the faculty of Theology and ſciences properly ſo called agree or differ, hath been diſcuſt at large in the ſeventh Booke of theſe commentaries and in the fourth. We are then properly ſaid to know any effect, or concluſion in ſciences properly ſo called, or ſo reputed, when we diſcerne the true cauſe why it is ſo, and are aſſured that it cannot be otherwiſe. And we are then ſaid to know Chriſt, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified according to the ſcale of ſpeculative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when we can diſcerne the ſweet harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the evangelicall relations, or matters related by the Apoſtles concerning Chriſt, &amp; the predictions of the Prophets, or prefigurations by matters of fact in the Law, or legall ſervices, or in ſacred hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Againe as in ſciences properly ſo called there is a <hi>regreſſe</hi> or knowledge of the cauſe by the effect, of the effect by the cauſe; So there is a two-fold knowledge of Chriſt, the one ſpeculative (ſuch as hath beene deſcribed before) the other, which is the better, practicall or experimentall, which later is better reſembled by morall philoſophy then
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7904:125"/>
by naturall experiments, or mathematicall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

                  <p>6 The concluſions, or declarations of theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries are ſet downe by the foure Evangeliſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly, and accurately both for ſubſtance, and hiſtoricall circumſtances, and their ſeverall refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to former Scriptures avouched not only by them but by other of the Apoſtles in their canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writings, eſpecially by <hi>S. Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Epheſians, Coloſſians, Corinthians,</hi> and to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.</hi> The Evangelicall declaration of this great myſtery, with the manner how the beliefe or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it was improv'd or enlarg'd, is moſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and cleerely related by <hi>S. Iohn Chap.</hi> 20. This bleſſed Apoſtle and <hi>S. Peter</hi> did at the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Mary Magdalen's</hi> report more diſtinctly and expreſſely then they did the propheticall predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>The firſt day of the weeke, commeth</hi> Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen <hi>early when it was yet dark, unto the Sepulchre, and ſeeth the ſtone taken away from the Sepulchre. Then ſhee runneth, and commeth to</hi> Simon Peter, <hi>and to the other Diſciple whom Ieſus loved, and ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:7904:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>them, they have taken away the Lord out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.</hi> Peter <hi>therefore went forth, and that other Diſciple, and came to the Sepulcher. So they runne both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the other Diſciple did out-runne</hi> Peter, <hi>and came first to the Sepulcher.</hi> And he ſtooping downe, and looking in ſaw the linnen cloathes lying, <hi>yet went he not in. Then commeth</hi> Simon Peter <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and went into the Sepulcher, and ſeeth the linnen cloathes lie. And the Napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linnen cloathes, but wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together in a place by it ſelfe. Then went in alſo that other Diſciple, which came first to the Sepulcher, and he ſaw and believed,</hi> for as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he muſt riſe againe <hi>from the dead.</hi> Such knowledge or beliefe of the Scripture as for this time <hi>S. Iohn</hi> had, was farther improved by Chriſt's apparition unto them upon the ſame day in the evening. <hi>Then the ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of the weeke, when the doores were ſhut, where the Diſciples were aſsembled for feare of the Iewes, came Ieſus and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Peace be unto you. And when he had ſaid ſo, hee ſhewed unto them his hands and his ſide. Then were the Diſciples glad when they ſaw the Lord. Then ſaid Ieſus unto them againe, Peace be unto you: As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you. And when hee had ſaid this, he breathed on them and ſaith unto them, receive yee the holy Ghost. Whoſoever ſinnes yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they are remitted, and whoſoever ſinnes ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine they are retained. But</hi> Thomas <hi>one of the twelve which was called</hi> Didymus <hi>was not with them when</hi>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:7904:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Ieſus came. The other Diſciples therefore ſaid unto him, we have ſeene the Lord: But he ſaid unto them except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nailes, and put my finger into the print of the nailes, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not beleeve, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eight daies his Diſciples were within, and</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas <hi>with them: Then came Ieſus the doores being ſhut, and ſtood in the midſt and ſaid, Peace be unto you. Then ſaith he to</hi> Thomas, <hi>Reach hither thy finger, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide, and be not faithleſse but believing. And</hi> Thomas <hi>anſwered and ſaid unto him, My Lord and my God. Ieſus ſaith unto him,</hi> Thomas, <hi>becauſe thou hast ſeene me, thou haſt believed, bleſsed are they that have not ſeene, and yet have believed.</hi> Vnto ſome it may ſeeme queſtionable in what ſenſe, or how farre that of <hi>S. Paul</hi> is true, faith commeth by hearing, ſeeing <hi>S. Thomas</hi> profeſſeth that he would not, and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in this place of himſelfe confeſſeth that hee did not believe one of the fundamentall Articles of Chriſtian faith, to wit, Chriſt's Reſurrection from the dead, untill they had ſeene what they had to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: Yet if we could accurately ſiſt the internall ſenſe or kernell from the huske or ſhell of words wherein it is contained, it will inferre no more then this, that the ſight of the eye or miracles ſeene may be an inducement or introduction unto true beliefe; they cannot be the true ground or anchor-hold of Chriſtian faith. Such faith muſt be grounded, and hope truly Chriſtian muſt be pitched upon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets, or other ſacred and Canonicall writings. The reaſon why S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:7904:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did not believe our Saviour's Reſurrection before he ſaw his empty tombe, and the linnen cloathes wherein he had been wrapped, was becauſe before this ſight he knew not the Scripture which hee had often heard read or avouched. The ſight then of this or of other miracles, did but open an entrie or paſſage unto the true knowledge of that which hee had formerly heard. But more ſtrange it may ſeeme to all of us, that two ſo great Apoſtles as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which had been for three yeares and a halfe together perpetuall auditors of ſuch a Maſter as ſpake as never man ſpake, and often eye-witneſſes of ſuch workes done by him, as no man beſides him could doe, ſhould now be ignorant of that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Article of faith whereof at this day to doubt were hereſie, which now to deny were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity: For if Chriſt be not riſen from the dead, then the dead ſhall not ariſe, and if the dead doe not ariſe, then were both preaching and hearing vaine; our faith were vaine; both Prieſt and people were in a worſe caſe then infidels; and we Chriſtians ſhould be of all men moſt miſerable.</p>
                  <p>6 Yet farre be it from us to ſay or think that either of theſe two Apoſtles were at this time in the ſtate of Heretiques, or that either of their caſes were no better then the caſes of Infidels; rather it would be a branch of infidelity in us to think that at this time they had no faith. The roote of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in Chriſt (as in their Meſſias and Redeemer) was intire and incorrupt; the ſtemme of it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound although untill this time it had not ſhut out into this particular branch of faith. This was the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7904:127"/>
time wherein the actuall and expreſſe beliefe of Chriſt's Reſurrection from the dead was to bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and beare fruit even in theſe two Apoſtles. That it did now breake forth in them and bear fruit was the work of God; that before this time it ſhould keepe in and be in ſome ſort ſnipt, was the ordinance and diſpenſation of the ſame God: for if the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Saviour's Reſurrection had beene as <hi>expreſſe, as explicite,</hi> and diſtinct before his death, as it was after his riſing from the dead, neither had their love either been ſo hearty in it ſelfe, or ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to themſelves, nor their faith ſo lively and cheerfull as in the iſſue both did prove: The hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of their love unto him whilſt hee lived was manifeſted even unto themſelves, by their ſorrow for his death, which doubtleſſe had beene much leſſe, if in the <hi>interim</hi> they had actually and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely believed to have ſeene him againe within three dayes. The ſtrength, the livelyhood, or cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of their faith was truly manifeſted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in their joyfull entertainment of the glad tidings which were brought unto them by <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and whereof their outward ſenſes were in part witneſſes. Their joy could not have been ſo great, nor their embracement of his Reſurrection ſo cheerfull and hearty if it had been expreſſely and confidently expected by them. It was by ſo much the welcomer, by how much the accompliſhment of it was leſſe thought on.</p>
                  <p>7 But were theſe two great Apoſtles altogether without blame, in that before this time they knew not the Scripture that Chriſt was to riſe from the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7904:128"/>
dead? They might be more capable or worthy of blame, then we to lay any blame upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to pronounce what I think of them, much leſſe to determine any thing concerning them, I muſt make bold to be the Reader's remembrancer of that which our Saviour himſelfe immediately after his Reſurrection ſaid unto two of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which did doubt of the truth of it, albeit they had heard it in a ſort teſtified, the ſtory is <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 22. 23. <hi>Gertaine women of our company (ſay thoſe two Diſciples which went with our Saviour to Emmaus) made us aſtoniſhed, which were early at the Sepulcher. And when they found not his body they came ſaying, that they had alſo ſeene a viſion of Angels which ſaid that he was alive; And certaine of them which were with us went to the Sepulcher and found it even ſo as the women had ſaid, but him they ſaw not. Then hee ſaid unto them, O fooles and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken. Ought not Christ to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory.</hi> How farre S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> were lyable to this cenſure of the ſupreame Iudge <hi>that</hi> I leave for him to determine. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> from this time did expreſſely believe Chriſt's Reſurrection. So did not S. <hi>Peter</hi> till afterwards, if we may believe the collections of cardinall <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap> ſome of the ancients underſtand the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of our Saviour, and not amiſſe, ſo it doe not point out the ſimilitude too preciſely. The warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able punctuall meaning of the place is thus; As a bruiſe in the heele to an ordinary man is not dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo neither was death it ſelfe unto our Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was God as well as man, and by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his divine power, could as eaſily recover life againe after he had been put to death, as a ſtrong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whoſe vitall or internall parts are whole and ſound, can recover health after ſome bruiſe in the heele, or other infirmity in his outward or extream parts; but ſo could not Saran recover the blow which our Saviour by his Sufferings gave him in the head; hee hath been ever ſince <hi>diminuti capit is</hi> deprived of his wonted power, and diſpoſſeſſed of ſuch as were before his captives: So ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>Now is the judgment of this world, now ſhall the Prince of this world be cast out; And I if I be lift up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi> And his drawing of men unto him was a drawing of them out of Satan's bondage and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. So that <hi>Lucifer,</hi> as wee may hence gather, had a two-fold fall, The one from heaven or his ſear of Angelicall glory, when hee ſought to be like God his Creator: The other from his power or dominion over this inferior world or morrall men; And this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7904:129"/>
befell him by ſeeking to make the Sonne of God more miſerable than other men, by attempting to have him lifted up upon the Croſſe, as the braſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was in the wilderneſſe. The ſame nailes that nailed our Saviour's feete to the Croſſe did pierce the old Serpent's head. In briefe, Chriſt was to cruſh the old Serpent's head by conquering death, and death could not be fully conquered but by dying. So that when it offered it ſelfe unto our Saviour, he was to meete with it, and to fight with it, not a farre off, but hand to hand, yea to cloſe with it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the utmoſt force and power of it in every part. Not thus throughly to have taſted it, had beene to eſchew it, or to have fled from it, not to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered it: But thus to abide the extremity of it, to receive the full dint of all the blowes that death and hell, or all the powers of darkneſſe could reach mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; and yet to put all off, or rather to redouble their forces upon themſelves was truly to ſubdue death, and him that had the power of death. This is our Apoſtle's inference. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>For aſmuch then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, He alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, that is, the Divell.</hi>

                  <p>2 Our Saviour, as ſome of the ancients have wittily ſaid, did as it were <hi>bait</hi> his divinity with his humanity, that hee might catch Satan in his owne <hi>net,</hi> or with his owne <hi>hook.</hi> Satan being by nature an immortall ſpirit, did take upon him the bodily ſhape of a Serpent to beguile the firſt woman; and our Saviour being the eternall Spirit and Sonne of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7904:130"/>
God did take our fleſh (that is, the womans ſeed) upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, thereby to deceive or intrappe the great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For unleſſe the Godhead had been inveſted with the weakneſſe of mortall fleſh, the old Serpent would not have ſo deſperately adventured his ſting or teeth upon the Godhead as he did. But whilſt he ſought to ſwallow the bait of his fleſh, hee hath loſt his ſting, hee hath broken his teeth, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his jawes by medling with the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But more plainely by much was our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Reſurrection, and victory over death fore-pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured by <hi>Iſaac's</hi> narroweſcape from death. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 9.

                  <p>4 The later part of this promiſe belongs meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly unto Chriſt, in whom alone it could be fulfilled. For the more in number <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> children according to the fleſh were, before the promiſed ſeed did come; and the greater their temporall proſperity, or happineſſe were, the worſe it muſt needs goe with other Nations or kindreds of the earth. If the Meſſias, or promiſed ſeed ſhould have erected ſuch a temporall Kingdome here on earth, as the Iewes expected, the Nations of the earth could not have beene bleſſed in him, as God promiſed by Oath to <hi>Abraham:</hi> for it is no part of happineſſe, but rather miſery to have the Iewes, or ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh for their Lords and Maſters.</p>

The teſtimony out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. is preſt home by <hi>S. Peter Act.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 6. to the 37. to the Iewes ſpecially, and by <hi>S.

The point at which theſe preſent endeavours aime, is to declare how theſe two teſtimonies [1. <hi>Thou art my Sonne this day have I begotten thee;</hi> and 2. <hi>Thou art a Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedech,</hi>] doe concludently and irrefragably inferre the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, that Ieſus whom the Iewes had crucified being both the Sonne of God and ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> and his Conſecration to his everlaſting Prieſthood, for unto this later point both teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are drawne by our Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 5. and 6. But how cloſe they reach this point whether joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſeverally is not ſo cleerly ſet forth by moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, as that the Reader, unleſſe his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding farre ſurpaſſe mine, will eaſily collect. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall meaning of our Apoſtle hath been declared in the firſt Section, and in the cloſe of the fourth of this Booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is punctually thus, Seeing <hi>Aaron's</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the dignity of Prieſthood was publiquely
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7904:136"/>
manifeſted to be from God, no man after might take upon him to erect a new Prieſthood, no not to the temporall prejudice of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, much leſſe to aboliſh this Prieſthood which God had erected, unleſſe he could manifeſt to man and Angels that his Commiſſion for thus doing was immediately from God, and authentique, being ſealed by oath, and ſolemnely executed. And ſeeing no man might, therefore Chriſt though God and man did not glorifie himſelfe (as the Apoſtle addes) to be made an high Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him <hi>Thou art my Sonne this day have</hi> I <hi>begotten thee,</hi> did put this dignity upon him. Many Interpreters have ſtretcht their wits to make the literall ſenſe of this Pſalmiſt's words reach home to our Apoſtle's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Others ſo ſlight it as if they would give us to underſtand or cauſe to ſuſpect our Apoſtle himſelfe did not much ſtand upon it, but only paſſe by it unto the ſecond teſtimony, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> Albeit in my opinion the later teſtimony proves his <hi>fiat</hi> or Commiſſion, the former his ordination or execution of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. I will not wrong the judicious Reader's patience with profering variety of ſuch expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors unto his choiſe as his wiſdome cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. <hi>Cajetan</hi> hath <hi>Ribera's</hi> approbation, and of all the expoſitors which went before him drawes the Pſalmiſt's Oracle [<hi>Thou art my Sonne this day have</hi> I <hi>begotten thee</hi>] neereſt to the point in queſtion.

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7904:137"/>
their meaning in the beſt ſort I can. The Prieſthood (ſaith <hi>Cajetan,</hi> as <hi>Ribera</hi> expounds him) before the Law given was annexed as a prerogative to the firſt borne, and deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and by ſpeciall diſpenſation to <hi>Iacob.</hi> Now the whole dignity of the firſt borne being loſt by <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> was divided amongſt three of his Brethren. The Soveraignty or Principallity fell to <hi>Iudah,</hi> the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to <hi>Levi,</hi> and the double Portion to <hi>Ephraim.</hi> And in <hi>Aaron</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Levi</hi> was the Prieſthood eſtabliſhed long before the Kingdome was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in <hi>David</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſo eſtabliſhed <hi>David's</hi> ſons had as litle right, as <hi>Aaron's</hi> ſonnes had to the Crowne or Diadem. God's peremptory decree for thus dividing theſe two prerogatives, <hi>Azariah</hi> is not afraid to plead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to King <hi>Vzziah's</hi> face. <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 26. And his ſpeech did take impreſſion, for hee had no ſooner made an end of ſpeaking but the leproſie begunne to appeare in King <hi>Vzziah's</hi> face; and for his uſurpation of the Prieſt's office and intruſion into the houſe of God; he is utterly excluded from his pallace, and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to reſigne the government unto his Sonne. But inaſmuch as he, of whom the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, is ſolemnely regiſtred and by him declared to be the firſt borne and Sonne of God, it is not lawfull only, but expedient, but very neceſſary that all the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the firſt borne's prerogative which <hi>Ruben</hi> had ſcattered, ſhould be reunited in his Perſon. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in that he is the promiſed ſeed, hee is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat heire of all the bleſſings bequeathed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and out of whatſoever tribe this promiſed ſeed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7904:137"/>
was to ſpring, the honour of Prieſthood was as due unto him as the Kingdome. <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were but as foefes in truſt for conveying the Prieſthood, as <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were for making over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unto him.</p>
                  <p>3 All thoſe ſuppoſitions and others (perhaps more then <hi>Cajetan</hi> or <hi>Ribera</hi> though of) being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted prove only thus much, that the only begotten Son of God, or firſt born to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to <hi>David</hi> had a juſt title to the eternall Prieſthood. They doe not directly prove, <hi>that</hi> Ieſus whom the Iewes have crucified to be that Sonne of God, and ſeed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> meant by the Pſalmiſt in the <hi>Pſalme</hi> fore-cited: Or this being granted, all put together doe not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his Conſecration or actuall admiſſion to the high Prieſthood, by whoſe erection the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> was changed, which is the concluſion pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually intended by our Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>4 For a more ſatisfactory declaration of the ſtrength of this argument, we are to take the words of the Pſalmiſt into a further and more punctuall conſideration then hitherto wee had occaſion to take them. As firſt, of what GENERATION theſe words, <hi>ego hodie genuite,</hi> are principally meant, whether meant at all of <hi>David,</hi> or how of him, and how of Chriſt the Sonne of God and Sonne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

Many of the Ancients being ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by more of the Schoolmen, and middle ag'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorizing Commentators, underſtand this Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt's Oracle of that GENERATION of the Sonne of God which is mentioned in the NICEN Creed, or that <note n="*" place="margin">That is, the Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane Creed.</note> Creed which is to be publiquely read in the

ſecond ſervice of our Church, [<hi>Begotten of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before all worlds.</hi>] and in theſe mens conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the word HODIE is meant HODIE AETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITATIS the day of eternity or eternal day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is no ſucceſſion of parts of houres or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. But this interpretation is diſlik'd by <hi>Calvin</hi> who is alwaies zealous for the literall though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with prejudice to the myſticall or principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended ſenſe. Yet that ſenſe in this place cannot be expreſt by HODIE AETERNITATIS, or by the eternall Generation of the Sonne of God. That it cannot be the <hi>literall</hi> ſenſe of this Pſalmiſt is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent becauſe neither the Reſurrection of the Son of God, nor his Conſecration to the everlaſting Prieſthood can with any colour of probability be inferred or pretended from it: much leſſe can it be the <hi>mysticall</hi> or true allegoricall ſenſe of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; for theſe alwaies muſt be grounded upon the literall, and no Scripture can be ſaid to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd according to the myſticall or true allegoricall ſenſe untill it hath been firſt verified according to the literall ſenſe. Now the eternall GENERATION of the Sonne of God cannot follow either his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, or his Conſecration to his everlaſting Prieſthood; nor could ever any <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphraſis</hi> or <hi>notation</hi> of it be either fulfil'd, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in time ſeeing it is before all times.</p>
                  <p>5 May we ſay then with good Commentators as with <hi>Calvin</hi> for one, that theſe words (<hi>this day have I begotten thee,</hi>) have no manner of reference to the Son of God's Generation before all worlds? Certaine it is that this Generation is no part of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7904:138"/>
object, no part of the immediate ſubject, (whether according to the literall or myſticall ſenſe of the Pſalmiſt's words) whether we conſider them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or intended by him, or as avouched by <hi>S. Paul</hi> and other Apoſtles for the further confirmation of Chriſt's Reſurrection from the dead. All that can be ſaid on their parts whom <hi>Calvin</hi> cenſures is this, that the eternall GENERATION of the Son of God might be taken as a common notion or preſuppos'd truth, both by the Pſalmiſt when he writ, and by the Apoſtle when hee avouched theſe words <hi>ego hodie genuite.</hi> That the <hi>Word</hi> or Sonne of God was from Eternity, this was a common prenotion to all the Ancient learned or faithfull <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And that he who was the only begotten Sonne of God before all worlds <hi>ſhould be begotten</hi> by him <hi>from the dead,</hi> that is prov'd at large by <hi>S. Paul. Act.</hi> 13. And that the raiſing of that Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> (whom the Iewes had crucified) from the dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to immortall endleſſe life was an authentique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that this Sonne of <hi>David</hi> was likewiſe the Sonne of God their expected Lord and Meſſias, is moſt ſweetly deduced by our Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi>

might have challenged the glory of it to themſelves) did not ſo much grieve the Prieſts and captaines of the Temple with the Sadduces, as that upon this occaſion they taught the people and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Reſurrection of the dead through Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. 3. Vpon this griefe conceived at firſt by ſome few there preſent, the next morning the high Prieſt with the whole hoſt of his aſſiſtants and kndred did injoyne theſe two Apoſtles, <hi>not to teach at all, or ſpeake in the name of Ieſus;</hi> but upon that magnanimous reply, [<hi>whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you more then unto God, judge yee, ver.</hi> 19.] made joyntly by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to the high Prieſt's and Elders peremptory injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, being let goe they made report of the whole buſineſſe with the ſucceſſe, unto their owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>who, when they heard it, lift up their voice to God with one accord and ſaid, Lord, thou art God which hast made heaven and earth, and the Sea, and all that in them is; who by the mouth of thy ſervant</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>haſt ſaid, why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vaine thing? The Kings of the earth ſtood up, and the Rulers of the earth were gathered together againſt the Lord and against his Chriſt. For of a truth againſt thy holy child Ieſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>with the Gentiles and the people of Iſrael were gathered together, for to doe whatſoever thy hand and thy counſell determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be done. Acts.</hi> 4. from <hi>verſe</hi> 23. to 28. This joyfull newes thus brought by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> did raiſe the ſpirits of the other Diſciples if not to propheſy as <hi>David</hi> had done, yet to make a more
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7904:142"/>
lively expreſſion or interpretation of his prophecy then either he himſelfe or any Prophet before our Saviour's Reſurrection could have compos'd. As indignation ſometimes will hammer out verſes or rimes from wits of duller metall: ſo extraordinary exultation or uncouth matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſpirituall joy will bring forth ſacred hymnes and poeſies, or interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Scripture equivalent to the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>

in reſpect of the Article of Chriſt's Reſurrection, the force or concludency of it is warranted by our Saviour's owne authority, and for this reaſon (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) not inſiſted upon ſince by the Apoſtles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts after his death, to whom it was all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that he himſelfe had avouch'd it. But ſeeing this Type or ſigne implies diverſe circumſtances or references as well to our Saviour's Aſcenſion as to his Reſurrection, the diſcuſſion of it ſhall be differ'd as the <hi>binding</hi> or coupling of this preſent edifice. For finiſhing that part of it which concernes the Article of the Reſurrection only; the next inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be how our Saviour's paſſage to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall endleſſe life thorow death was prefigured, or fore-typified by the legall rites or ſolemnities of the paſſeover, or feaſt of unleavened bread.</p>
                  <p>2 The occaſion and firſt inſtitution of the paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I doubt not every ordinary Reader either knowes, or will eaſily call to mind. It is ſet downe <hi>Ezod.</hi> 12. which is the firſt leſſon appointed by the Church for the feaſt of the Reſurrection.

It is the Lord's Paſſeover for I will paſse through the land of Egypt this night and will ſmite all the firſt borne in the land of Egypt both man and beast. And againſt all the Princes of Egypt I will execute judgment, I am the Lord.

And by his appointment the viſitor or executioner, whoſoever hee were, good Angell or bad, one or more, was to paſſe over the houſes of the Iſraelites, as being exempted from his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whil'ſt he ſmote the firſt borne of man and beaſt that pertained to any houſe of the Egyptians. But at this preſent Paſſeover wherein the Saviour of the world became a ſacrifice, hell as we ſay, was broken up and let looſe; the powers of darkneſſe were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as a raging Sea or ſwelling tyde overflowing her bankes, and had wrought a more ruefull deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon all mankind, upon the face of the whole earth, then the flood of <hi>Noah</hi> had done, unleſſe by God's providence they had been reſtrained.

The commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the deſtroying Angell throughout Egypt did extend no further then to the firſt borne of man
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7904:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and beaſt, and was to endure but for one night, the powers of darkneſſe did aime at all, and lye in waite till the worlds end to devour all, whoſe hearts are not ſprinkled with the blood of this paſchall Lamb, which was ſhed not for a few houſes, but for all. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very houſe in Iſrael was to have their ſeverall Lambe, or two houſes at the moſt could be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged by the blood of one Lambe; but our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe as he was ſlaine by the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Iſrael, <hi>cryed</hi> down to death by the Prieſts, the Scribes and Phariſees, and the whole multitude; ſo his blood was ſufficient to redeeme all the Iſrael of God from the Deſtroyer, even as many through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages and Kingdomes as will ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto his Lawes, and acknowledge him for their Redeemer. And for this reaſon he was ſlaine without the City, as a publique ſactifice in the open aire. The Croſſe whereto he was nailed was as the doore-poſts of that houſe, of which hee is the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Maker, that is, of the whole world it ſelfe. Now it is to be preſumed that the blood of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which was to redeeme and ſanctifie all unto the worlds end, which ſeek Redemption and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification by him, ſhould not be as blood ſpilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth which cannot be gathered up. As hee was to give life to others by his blood, ſo he was to give life to himſelfe againe.</p>
                  <p>3 But is it imported in the inſtitution of the Paſſeover, or in any ſolemnitie belonging unto it, that the Lambe of God which was to take away the ſinnes of the world by his Death, ſhould himſelfe be reſtored unto life againe? Yes. This word <hi>Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:7904:149"/>
beſides the former ſignification of paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the houſes of the Iſraelites, hath another fignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or importance, to wit, That all thoſe families which were priviledged from the power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Angel which ſmote the Egyptians, ſhould paſſe out of the land of Egypt or houſe of bondage through the red ſea into the land of their reſt and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, under the conduct of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had the great Angell of the Covenant for his guide in this paſſage. For the Reader's better apprehenſion how the myſteries of the Goſpell concerning our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Paſſion and Reſurrection were fore-ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſolemnitie of the Paſſeover, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that there is a two-fold ſenſe of Scripture, the one literall, the other myſticall: The literall ſenſe conſiſts in the immediate or grammaticall ſenſe or ſignification of the words; The myſticall ſenſe is that which the Facts or Perſons immediately ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the literall or grammaticall ſenſe of the words, doe fore-ſhadow. Thus by <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſtory, ſometimes <hi>Iacob</hi> the Father of the twelve Tribes, ſometimes the twelve Tribes themſelves are literally meant. And Iſrael taken in this ſenſe is literally called the Son of God, but by this name Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael Chriſt Ieſus is myſtically meant: He it is alone <hi>qui tanti menſuram nominis implet.</hi> Hee it is which prevailed with God, and is more properly called the <hi>Son of God</hi> then either <hi>Iacob</hi> or his poſterity were. And <hi>that</hi> which according to the literall ſenſe was meant of <hi>Iacob's</hi> poſteritie; [<hi>When Iſrael was a child then I loved him, and called my Son out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1.] was literally fulfilled of Chriſtin
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7904:150"/>
a more full and exquiſite ſenſe, as the Evangeliſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us. <hi>Math.</hi> 2. 15. For God called this his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son out of Egypt, literally taken, that is, out of the ſame land or Kingdome wherein <hi>Iacob's</hi> ſeed had been ſojourners, into the ſelfe-ſame land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan into which he had brought them; ſo that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word in this prophecy is in the literall ſenſe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verified as well of Chriſt as of <hi>Iacob's</hi> ſeed. But <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> beſides this literall ſenſe and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification have a further myſticall ſenſe or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The ſtate of Iſrael or the Sons of <hi>Iacob</hi> in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt was a map or ſhadow of our ſlavery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage unto the powers of darkneſſe: Their paſſage out of Egypt into the land of Canaan through the red ſea, was a type of our paſſage from the bondage of ſinne into the Kingdome of light, through the region of death it ſelfe. Thus the paſchall Lambe, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally taken, was a picture of Chriſt's ſacrifice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe; and ſo was <hi>Moſes</hi> which inſtituted the ſacrifice, and conducted God's people out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt but a ſhadow of Chriſt: <hi>Ioſhuah,</hi> or Ieſus the Son of <hi>Nun</hi> which brought them into the land of Canaan was no more. The great Angell of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and with <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> as their guide and protector in this buſineſſe was with the man Chriſt Ieſus in unity of perſon; and Chriſt Ieſus is with us unto the worlds end, as the Arke of the Covenant was with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſhuah,</hi> or with the hoſt of Iſrael, to direct and ſupport us in all our wayes.</p>
                  <p>4 But is this paſſage from this vale of miſery to a better life any where in Scripture called a Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over?
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7904:150"/>
Or is it any part of the true meaning or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this ſolemne feaſt? This myſtery is unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>S. Iohn</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Now before the feast of the Paſse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> (and it was but a day before) <hi>when Ieſus knew that his houre was come <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, That hee ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi> (as our Engliſh renders it) <hi>or rather that he ſhould paſſe out of this world unto his Father having loved his owne which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</hi> Some good Interpreters note an elegancy of ſpeech in the originall, or an alluſion unto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymologie of the Paſſeover in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as if in Latine he had ſaid, <hi>ante diem feſtum tranſitus ſciens Ieſus quia veniet hora ejus ut tranſeat:</hi> But to my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, whereſoever there is the like elegancy of ſpeech or alluſion in the original, the elegancy is not affected for it ſelfe, as it uſually is by ſecular artiſts, but alwaies denotes ſome myſtery, or ſomewhat in the matter it ſelfe, more uſefull to ſober minds then any artificiall elegancy of ſpeech can be to curious Artiſts. Now the myſtery charactered unto us in that ſpeech of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> of Chriſt's paſſing out of this world unto his Father is this, to wit, That the legall Paſſeover which was inſtituted in memory of the Lord's paſſing ouer the houſes of the Iſraelites, and their paſſage out of Egypt through the red ſea did fore-ſhadow the paſſage of the Son of God out of this world wherein he had lived in the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a ſervant, unto the land of his reſt and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he therefore paſſed out of this world unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in his ſight and preſence he might obtaine the liberty and prerogatives of the only Sonne of God begotten of his Father before all worlds; but
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7904:151"/>
he therefore came into this world that by his death and manner of departing out of it hee might open and prepare a paſſage for us out of this vale of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. The land or inheritance into which he paſſed is the inheritance of everlaſting pleaſure; but the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was on his part bitter and full of ſorrow; yet this notwithſtanding hee willingly endured for the love of his people: having loved his owne which were in the world, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>he loved them to the end,</hi> that is, hee <hi>perfectly loved</hi> them which would not ſuffer him to forget them when the houre of his bitter Paſſion approached, willing to ſuffer whatſoever was laid upon him for their ſake. And as <hi>Moſes</hi> the night before the Iſraelites paſſage out of Egypt did inſtitute the Paſſeover; ſo our Saviour before his paſſage out of this world, did inſtitute this Sacrament or Supper, not only as a memoriall of his paſſage, but as a perpetuall pledge of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar preſence, for conducting all ſuch as believe on him, and to be a vejand or viaticum to ſtrengthen and comfort all ſuch as reſolv'd to follow him as the Iſraelites did <hi>Moſes.</hi> Againe as <hi>Moſes</hi> inſtructed the Iſraelites in the Lawes and rites of the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before they eate it; ſo our Saviour gave inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by precept and example for our due preparation unto this ſervice. The precepts are generally two; <hi>Humilitie,</hi> which he taught by his example in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing his Apoſtles feete. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. to the 17.

The myſtery fore-ſhadowed by the legall ſanctifying, or ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the firſt-borne males unto the Lord was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a firſt-borne male, by whoſe Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <hi>paſsing over</hi> unto the Lord, all theſe and the like legall ceremonies ſhould once for all be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and their children fully ſanctified and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. That theſe legall ſervices taken at the beſt could be no more then ſhadowes of good things to come, common reaſon might have taught this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for ſeeing the firſt-lings of the heards though
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7904:152"/>
offered in ſacrifice unto the Lord, could not ſanctify the uſe of their flocks unto them, but the uſe of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dumbe creature was to be ſanctified unto them, by a ſacrifice of one of the ſame kind; (As the uſe of their Lambes or Sheepe was to be hallowed by the ſacrifice of a firſtling-male Lambe, and ſo the goates by the firſtling-male kid, and their oxen and cattell by the ſacrifice of the firſtling calves or bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks;) who could in reaſon expect that the ſacrifice of a Lambe, of a Kid, of a Bullock, or any other dumbe creature ſhould be a ſufficient price for the Redemption of their firſt borne males, or able to ſanctifie or conſecrate both male and female in their ſeverall families unto the Lord; <hi>Hee that ſanctifies</hi>

                     <hi>and they that are ſanctified are all of one,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. Men were to be redeemed and ſanctified by man, and if the firſt borne male in every family had been ſacrificed for the reſt, this would have made no ſatiſfaction, no ſanctification, ſeeing the firſt born was by nature as uncleane as the reſt, and every dumbe creature which was by Law uncleane, and could not be ſacrificed, was to be redeemed by the ſacrifice of a firſtling-male which was by its kind cleane; as the aſſe becauſe it was by its kind unclean was to be redeemed, that is, the uſe of it was to be ſanctified or made lawfull unto its owner, by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a firſtling Lambe.</p>
                  <p>2 But who amongſt all the firſt borne of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was in his kind or by nature cleane? Not one beſides the Sonne of the bleſſed Virgin, who was likewiſe the only Son of God. It is hee alone that was to redeeme and ſanctifie the reſt of mankind;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7904:153"/>
which were all by nature uncleane: And with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the former Law our Apoſtle inſtiles him <hi>primogenitus omnis creatura,</hi> the firſt borne of every creature. <hi>Coloſs.</hi> 1. 15. Now though it be moſt true that Chriſt was before all things, that all things were created by him whether viſible or inviſible, that all things conſiſt by him as hee is the only Son of God, begotten of his Father before all Worlds, yet this is not the true and full meaning of that moſt ſacred maxime <hi>Eſt primogenitus omnis creature, he is the firſt borne of every creature.</hi> One part of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's meaning in that admirable paſſage. 1. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 13. to the 20. is, that unleſſe Chriſt had been the Son of God from eternity, all fulneſſe could not have dwelled in him; nor could he have had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence in all things which the Apoſtle there mentions. Another part of the Apoſtle's meaning there, is, that in the ſame Chriſt as man, it pleaſed God that all fulneſſe ſhould dwell; and that as man he ſhould in all things have the preheminence, and in as much as all fulneſſe dwelleth in him as man, and that in all reſpect he hath preheminence, he is likewiſe as man the firſt-borne of every creature; that is, all the prerogatives which the firſt-borne males had before the after-borne or females, are contained in his prerogative and fulneſſe as man. Now as the firſt-born males amongſt the offſprings of dumbe creatures did ſanctifie all the reſt of the ſame kind: So Chriſt as man doth ſanctifie all things, make all things acceptable unto God which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſanctification or acceptance: As man likewiſe hee had all the prerogatives of the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Son of God in the day of his ſufferings as he was man did aſcend in ſoule into that Paradiſe, into which the ſoules of Patriarchs, of Prophets, with the ſoules of holy and juſt men that dyed immediately after him, or at the ſame time with him, were admitted. And on that day at leaſt before the dawning of the next which was the Sabbath he conſecrated the celeſtiall Sanctuary or Paradiſe with his owne blood. But his Aſcenſion into Paradiſe, what part ſoever of Heaven that were, on that day, is not the Aſcenſion mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our Creed: For when it is ſaid, HE ASCEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DED into Heaven, this muſt be underſtood of his Aſcention thither in body which was forty dayes after his Reſurrection from the dead. And into Heaven, or that part of Heaven mentioned in our Creede hee did not then aſcend only as an high Prieſt, but alſo as King of Heaven and earth. The Day of his Aſcenſion as was <note n="*" place="margin">In the fourth Sect. of this Book <hi>Chap.</hi> laſt.</note> mentioned before
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7904:157"/>
was the day of his ſolemne enthronization.</p>
                  <p>2 The manner of his Aſcenſion is punctually related, ſpecially by the Evangeliſt <hi>S. Luke</hi> in the laſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Goſpell, and in the firſt of the ſacred hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <hi>quaerees</hi> concerning his or other Evangelicall or Apoſtolicall avouchments of his Aſcenſion are but two: The firſt how that which they hiſtorically relate or avouch was fore-pictured: The ſecond how or by what Prophets fore-told in the ſacred Writings of the Old Teſtament. And theſe two quaeries muſt be diſcuſt not by dichotomy, or by way of oppoſition, but either ſeverally or promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly as the Texts of the Old Teſtament ſhall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter occaſion.</p>
                  <p>3 The Aſcenſion of this juſt and holy one, of the great Prophet promiſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> was firſt prefigured by the tranſlation of <hi>Enoch</hi> which was long before the Law was given, long before <hi>Moſes</hi> was borne. But of <hi>Enoch's</hi> tranſlation litle can be ſaid upon ſure grounds, or by juſt warrant of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: Only this we know from authentique teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that <hi>hee was an holy man and one that pleaſed God;</hi> A man both in life and in his tranſlation from this life unto a better, who did truly fore-ſhadow <hi>him</hi> in whom alone God was, and is, and ever will be beſt pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>4 The manner of <hi>Eliah's</hi> Aſcenſion or rather of his being taken up from earth into heaven, or to a farre better place then earth, was more viſible and more conſpicuous, and the time of his taking up more publiquely knowne, then the time or manner
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7904:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Enoch's</hi> tranſlation was: He was taken or caried up out of <hi>Eliſhah's</hi> ſight who with many others did expect the time and day of his tranſlation, in a fiery Chariot; a fit embleme of <hi>Eliah's</hi> propheticall ſpirit alwaies burning with zeale towards the ſervice of God, even to the deſtruction of the enemies of it, or diſturbers of the peace of Iſrael. Our Saviour did rather <hi>aſcend</hi> in a Cloud then was <hi>taken up</hi> by it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit taken by it out of their ſight which ſaw him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from earth to heaven: The cloud it ſelfe in which he did aſcend being an embleme of his ſweet and milde ſpirit, of thoſe gracious lips which did alwaies diſtill words of mercy and love, allaying the terrible heat and fervency of <hi>Eliah's,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſpirits which had fore-told his firſt comming into, and his going out of this world, and his ſecond comming to judge it.</p>
                  <p>5 Two illuſtrious predictions of his Aſcenſion we have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. but whether the one or both of theſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> which illuſtrate or confirme the truth of the Evangelicall ſtory, be meerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall, or typically propheticall, or mixt, <hi>id eſt,</hi> thus literally verified in the Pſalmiſts themſelves, or Pen-men of theſe hymnes, and afterward myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally fulfilled in Chriſt, is more then I dare perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily either affirme or deny.

And he receives this anſwer, <hi>Hee that walketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, and worketh righteouſneſse, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart ver.</hi> 2. and thus concludes, <hi>he that doth theſe things ſhall never be moved.</hi> Which laſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7904:158"/>
words could not be exactly fulfil'd of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which it ſelfe was moveable: None but men ſo qualified as the character of the <hi>Pſalme</hi> imports, had any juſt title or ſure hope to be perpetuall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers or inheritors of the bleſſings or comforts of this life which did attend the true ſervice of the Tabernacle much leſſe of the eternall bleſſings of the heavenly ſanctuary.

                  <p>6 So that this 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Pſalme</hi> for its literal ſenſe is a fuller expreſſion of the matter contained in the firſt <hi>Pſalme,</hi> or a more lively character of the bleſſings there promiſed.

of inſtant prayer for preſent aſſiſtance; A great part of this moſt divine, moſt ſublime ditty, is a recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of the glorious victories which the God of Iſrael had purchaſed for his people, and upon their deliverance out of Egypt, and their other peculiar protections, or ſuccours which private men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their diſtreſſe had found, when they were helpleſſe in the ſight of men, or oppreſſed by their neighbours; <hi>Sing unto God, ſing praiſes to his name, extoll him that rideth upon the heavens by his name</hi> Iah, <hi>and reioyce before him.

                  <p>3 Now the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael was confident that the God of their Fathers would be as gracious to himſelfe, to his people, and their ſucceſſors, after he came to dwell in Mount Sinai, as he had been to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſhun</hi> in the wilderneſſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Aſcenſion or propagation of his Kingdome, was more clearly fore-ſeen by <hi>Daniel,</hi> and as punctually foreſhadowed by matter of fact in Moſaicall hiſtories: To begin with the teſtimony of <hi>Daniel</hi> which was meerly propheticall, a pure viſion. <hi>And I beheld inviſions by night, behold one like the ſon of man, came in the clouds of heaven and approached unto the ancient of daies, and they brought him before him. And he gave him dominion, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a Kingdome; that all people, Nations, and languages ſhould ſerve him, his dominion is an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting dominion which ſhall never be taken away: and his Kingdome ſhall never be destroyed.</hi> In that he ſaith he was like unto the Son of man, this doth not import that hee was not truly man, or only like to man, but that more glory was due unto him then to any meere ſonne of man; and that he was the true ſonne of that ancient of dayes unto whom hee was brought: And as our Apoſtle ſaith <hi>that being in the</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:7904:170"/>
                     <hi>forme of God, and equall unto God, yet he was found in the likneſse and ſhape of man,</hi> that is, as eſſentially like to man as like to God. The Prophet deſcribes his preſentation to his Father, by the Angels and coeleſtiall powers attending him, which our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt relateth not, becauſe (haply) this could not be ſeen by waking and mortall eyes, but only by viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or rapture of ſpirit. The ſame Prophet likewiſe deſcribes the manner of his Aſcenſion, as exactly as if he had been a waking ſpectator of it with the Apoſtles and Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>2 But to reſume the Prophets words: <hi>Behold ſaith the Prophet one like the ſonne of man came in the clouds of heaven and approached unto the ancient of daies.</hi> hee doth not ſay hee was brought up in the clouds of heaven, for the motion was his owne: Hee was the agent or mover, as well as the party moved in this Aſcenſion. So the Evangeliſt ſaith. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>And when hee had ſpoken theſe things, while they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held he was taken up; for a cloud tooke him out of their ſight, and whilst they looked ſtedfaſtly towards heaven as he went. Behold two men ſtood by them in white ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell which alſo ſaid, yee men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven: Emphaſim habent verba hee, videntibus illis:</hi> It was remarkably ſaid that hee was taken up <hi>his Diſciples looking on,</hi> for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, as ſome of the ancients obſerve that Chriſt did aſcend by litle and litle as it were by certaine ſteps that hee might feed the eyes and refreſh the ſoules of his Diſciples. He was not <hi>raught</hi> up as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> was, who had but one witneſſe, nor as <hi>S.

a witneſſe of his rapture, for whether hee were taken up <hi>in the body or out of the body God knowes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I cannot tell.</hi> But our Saviour went by the power of his omnipotency: he deſcended when hee would, and when he would aſcended, appointing what ſpectators or witneſſes it pleaſed him, with the place, the time, the very day and houre.</p>
                  <p>3 As <hi>S.

                     </gap> The other branch of this prenotion is as cleare, that the Tabernacle which <hi>Moſes</hi> erected in the wilderneſſe, in which he placed the Arke, was but a petty modle of that celeſtiall Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle into which Chriſt is entred, of which the Temple built by <hi>Salomon</hi> was ſomewhat a fairer draught; yet no more then a litle mappe.

But whether the exaltation of the Son of God unto the right hand of his Father farre above all Powers, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and Principalities, doe include a ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not of ſoveraignty or dominion only but withall

                  <p>2 But however the one or other of theſe may be affected, the beſt is, we need not be too curious in theſe points, eſpecially with men apt to quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>phraſes</hi> or <hi>expreſsions.</hi> Other Articles concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt we are bound to beleeve diſtinctly and explicitely according to the plaine literall or gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall ſenſe of the words, wherin the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles have expreſſed them, without the vail of any rhetoricall trope or allegory. And ſtrange it is not, if our beliefe of other Articles, or knowledge of them be literally required; ſeeing the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them is ſenſible and comprehenſible to reaſon ſanctified by grace: As his conception; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were wrought immediately by a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall cauſe; albeit the manner of it were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: yet for ſubſtance it was <hi>univocally</hi> the ſame with our conception: He was as truly and properly conceived as wee are conceived: Hee was as truly made of the ſubſtance of his Mother, as we are made of the ſubſtance of our Parents; or as <hi>Adam</hi> was made of the earth: Hee was as truly and as properly borne as we are borne: He was really and as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumciſed as any other child of <hi>Abraham</hi> was: He ſuffered truly and as properly as any man can ſuffer: Hee was as truly and as properly crucified dead and buried and roſe againe, as any man ever was crucified dead and buried, or can riſe againe. But for the place whither he aſcended, or for the manner
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7904:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his ſitting at the right hand of God, theſe cannot be ſo diſtinctly conceived by us, becauſe they are not in ſuch proper termes expreſt by the holy Ghoſt, but are wrapt up in a vaile of legall ſhadowes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations. Concerning the place whither he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, wee know in generall that it was a place of joy, of bliſſe and glory; but which place the Apoſtle himſelfe could not better repreſent unto us, then by the <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum,</hi> or the moſt holy place in the Tabernacle or Temple. <hi>This hope wee have</hi> Heb. 6. 19. <hi>as an anchor of the ſoule both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entreth within the vaile, whither the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner is for us entred, made an high Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> So <hi>S.

                  <p>3 The beſt and ſafeſt meanes for conceiving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, at leaſt for not conceiving amiſſe, of theſe two heavenly myſteries, is not by criticall ſcanning the literall ſenſe or importance of the Prophet's words in their deſcriptions of them, but by ſincere practiſe of thoſe knowne duties whereto our beliefe of theſe unknowne myſteries bind us. The moſt generall and neceſſary duty wherto wee are bound by beliefe of our Saviour's Reſurection and Aſcenſion into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is that of our Apoſtle. <hi>Goll.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. <hi>If yee then be riſen with Christ ſeeke thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God.

                     <hi>in God. When Christ who is our life ſhall appeare, then ſhall yee alſo appeare with him in glory. Mortifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your members which are upon the earth, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uncleaneneſſe, inordinate affection, evill concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence and covetouſneſse which is idolatry, for which things ſake the wrath of God cometh on the children of diſobedience.</hi> But if theſe workes of the fleſh be mortified by the ſpirit; the ſpirit of God, having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten poſſeſſion of our hearts, doth organize them, and frame a true model of the heavenly Sanctuary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our breaſts, albeit we cannot expreſſe our affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate conceits, or experimentall repreſentations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others. Chriſt is preſent with us, or in us by this renovation of our mind, or by imprinting theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly affections in our ſoules, by following love, gentleneſſe, meekneſſe, temperance, patience &amp;c. Chriſt is really faſhioned in us not by converting any ſubſtance into his ſubſtance, or by reall conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ſubſtance into ours, but by converſion of our earthly affections into the ſimilitude of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly affections: Our affections being thus conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſt hath his Throne and Habitation in our hearts, ſo anſwering to his heavenly Throne, as the light of the ſun gathered in ſome round body apt to reflect his beames, or to be penetrated by them, doth reſemble the ſun which really penetrates and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them. For effecting this reall converſion of our affections into the ſimilitude of his affections, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſence of Chriſt is either neceſſary or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, beſides the preſence of his ſpirit, by which ten dayes after his Aſcenſion he enabled his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to conceive aright of theſe heavenly myſteries,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7904:175"/>
and to convert others unto the truth of his Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>4 That Chriſt's body ſhould deſcend from heaven unto us or be bodily preſent by traſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, or ſome other manner as ſome conceive, we have no reaſon to hope nor warrant to believe; to lift up our bodies unto heaven we have no poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but to lift up our hearts and ſpirits unto our Lord now placed in his heavenly Throne, we have have peremptory precepts many. But how ſhall wee lift them up, or what power have we to lift them up? Not ſo much I confeſſe as we have to caſt our ſelves downe before his Throne, but caſting our ſelves downe before him, which we cannot performe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his preventing and aſſiſting grace, <hi>we have a ſure promiſe that he will lift us up.</hi> Wee are no where to my remembrance commanded to pray to God that he would caſt us downe, and yet bound to pray that he would give us grace to caſt <hi>our ſelves</hi> downe. As often then as wee meditate upon this Article of Chriſt's Aſcenſion or ſitting at the right hand of God, let us beſeech God and him, that the Prieſts may truly exhort their charge, his people, <hi>to lift up their hearts,</hi> and that the people may as truly anſwer <hi>we lift them up unto the Lord:</hi> And that we may all joyntly ſing that hymne in reverence and true devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>With Angels and Arch-Angels, and with all the company of heaven we laud thy glorious name O Chriſt evermore praiſing thee and ſaying, holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hoſts heaven and earth are full of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of thy Glory, Glory be to thee O Lord moſt high.</hi> AMEN.</p>

                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:7904:176"/>5 The principall diſſiculties in our Saviour's parallel are <hi>first,</hi> what manner of ſigne it was which the adulterous generation ſought for. The <hi>ſecond</hi> to what purpoſe he gave them ſuch a ſigne as they did not ſeeke after. Our Saviour before, and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after this time had given the Iewes one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many miraculous ſignes: How then doth hee ſay that no ſigne ſhall be given them beſides the ſigne of the Prophet <hi>Ionas?</hi> Some are of opinion that theſe Scribes and Phariſees deſired ſome ſuch glorious ſigne from heaven as <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Samuell</hi> had ſhewed, &amp; that our Saviour ſhould put them off with ſuch an anſwer as the Muſcovite did a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Prince, who to pacifie his anger had ſent him<note place="margin">Vide Petrum Ramum in ſcholiis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicis. lib. 2.</note> a curious celeſtiall globe; [<hi>Tu mihi coelum mittis redde terras de quibus contendimus</hi>] The Scribes and Phariſees as theſe Writers think, demand a ſigne from the heavens above, and our Saviour gave them one from the earth or waters below. But if they had demanded a ſigne to prove his divinity, as theſe Writers think: The ſigne of <hi>Elia's</hi> Aſcenſion had been more illuſtrious and effectuall to this purpoſe. <hi>Maldonat's</hi> reſolution of this difficulty is, that our Saviour ſpeakes not of a ſigne to perſwade them as they ſought, but of a ſigne to condemne them, and that our Saviour uſeth (as hee doth in many other places quoted by this Author) an elegant ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That the men of <hi>Nineveh's</hi> repentance at <hi>Ionas</hi> preaching, was an infallible argument of theſe Iews future condemnation, or a ſigne which left them altogether unexcuſable for not repenting after our Saviour's Reſurrection from the dead, no Chriſtian
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7904:177"/>
can deny. But whether this ſigne was given them for their condemnation rather then for confirming their beliefe, or for provoking them to repentance, wee may well doubt; and <hi>Maldonate</hi> if he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to his poſitions elſewhere, muſt acknowledge the later branch of this diviſion to have been more probable. His anſwer (tho) to ſpeak the truth, brings us out of a blind by path into a fairer way which leads us directly to a labyrinth of diſputations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the cauſe or manner of theſe Iews rejection, into which at this time I will not enter.</p>
                  <p>6 The true meaning of our Saviour's words conſidered with references unto former paſſages I ſhould conceive to be, as if he had ſaid albeit I have done ſuch workes as none but the Son of God <q>could have done amongſt you, ſuch as would have cheered <hi>Abraham's</hi> heart to have ſeen, yet this adulterous generation or degenerate kind of men which boaſt themſelves to be the ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> demand a further ſigne; but though I ſhould give them all the ſignes poſſible in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the earth, there could be no ſigne like to the ſigne of the Prophet <hi>Ionas.</hi> Goe therefore and ſee what that meanes, or expect the fulfilling of it by the event; otherwiſe the men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhall condemne you, for they repented at <hi>Ionah's</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, yet was the ſigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God had given them by his deliverance from the Whale, no ſigne in compariſon of <hi>that</hi> which I give unto you:</q> So that our Saviour's words doe not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exclude all other ſignes either given by him, or by his Apoſtles, but

But thus long it is evident our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did not remaine in the Grave: For he was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the ſixth day towards the ſun-ſetting, and roſe againe the firſt day with the Sun or a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; ſo that the longeſt time of his impriſonment in the Grave, was but ſo many houres as he had been weekes in the Wombe, 36. or thrice twelve in the one, and 36. or thrice twelve in the other. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty propoſed then whether as it concernes the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:7904:178"/>
time of <hi>Ionas</hi> his abode in the belly of the Whale, or of our Saviour's in the Wombe of the earth, cannot be cleerly reſolved by that conſtruction which Lawyers ſometime make <hi>in favorabilibus,</hi> that is, for the greater part of three daies; nor by that Synechdoche which wee allow in ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; as if a man would prove that his friend had been in the City to attend the Court three daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it would not be expected that he ſhould make <hi>affidavit</hi> to prove that he had been three whole daies from morning to evening: It would ſuffice that hee had been in the City ſome part of every one of the three daies; or that hee had attended the Court at competent houres in every one of the three dayes inſtanced in, as ſuppoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wedneſday, Thurſday, Friday. The true reaſon of all ſuch legall allowances of Synechdoches, as Grammarians and Rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans terme them, is grounded upon that unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable rule of reaſon or Logick. <hi>Ad veritatem inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitae propoſitionis adſtruendam ſufficit verit as unius vel alterius particularis.</hi> He that ſaith the Athenians were learned men is not bound to prove this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, that all the Athenians were learned; it were enough to give pertinent inſtance in ſomefew; for he that covenanteh to pay his day-labourer as his neighbours doe, is not bound to pay them as much as any of all his neighbours doe, if he make as juſt payment as any one or two of his good neighbours doe to their hirelings, this in legall conſtruction will acquite him from breach of Covenant: Now times and ſeaſons, dayes, weekes, and houres have theiru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall or indefinite <hi>extenſe</hi> or limitations as well
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7904:178"/>
as men, or oher things numerable or meaſurable. <hi>That</hi> may be truly ſaid to be this daies worke which is done or wrought upon any part of this day cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And according to this Synecdoche or juſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, our Saviour may in legall or logicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be truly ſaid to be in the wombe of the earth three daies and three nights; that is, in ſome part of Friday, all Saturday, and in ſome part of Sunday. But this Synecdoche will not either by legall or logicall allowance reach unto three nights: That he was two entire nights in the Grave is <hi>de fide</hi> a point of faith, but no point of faith or probability that he ſhould be in the Grave any leaſt part of any third night.</p>
                  <p>8 May wee not then believe that hee was three daies and three nights in the belly of the earth? By all meanes we muſt. <hi>Maldonat</hi> acutely diſcovers the originall of others error, or rather of the difficulty which had perplext ſo many of the ancients (who made it greater then in his opinion it needed to have been) to be this, that they made their calculations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcale of other Nations or languages, not by the Hebrew computation which doth not oppoſe day unto night, but take day and night for one naturall day. His obſervation is true and helps in part to ſalve the truth of the literall ſenſe, if hee had given the true reaſon of this their account: But yet under correction the inſtances which he brings from the Hebrew accompt of the faſting of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> (both which are expreſſed to have faſted forty daies and forty nights) doe rather prejudice then cleare the true meaning of our Saviour's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7904:179"/>
[<hi>That he was to continue three daies and three nights in the belly of the earth.</hi>] For certainly <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and ſo our Saviour in the wilderneſſe did faſt as well forty nights as forty daies, or forty natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall daies compleat without any Synecdochicall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement either of one day or night; whereas from the three daies and three nights wherein our Saviour fore-told he was to continue in the wombe of the earth, we muſt abate the one halfe of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall day beſides the ſpace of one houre, or one houre and an halfe at the moſt. This abatement being fully made hee did continue in propriety of ſacred dialect in the Grave three daies and three nights, if we would meaſure his divine prediction by the moſt ancient and originall ſcale of the Hebrew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt which <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed throughout the hiſtory of the Creation.</p>
                  <p>9 Briefly, the three daies and three nights, in the 12 of <hi>Mathew</hi> are equivalent to three of thoſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and mornings which made up halfe of the ſix naturall daies wherein the World was created. The evening we know was in order of time before the morning, whence it is that the Hebrewes begun their naturall day from the veſpers ortwilight; that which we call Saturday-night was to them the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the firſt day of the weeke; our Sunday at night the begining of their ſecond; Munday at night of their third; Tueſday night of their fourth; Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday night of their fifth, Thurſday night of their ſixth; Friday night of their ſeventh day or Sabbath. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his deſcription of the ſix daies of the World's Creation, gives the true hint for interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7904:179"/>
our Saviour's words as we have done, when he ſaid, <hi>The evening and the morning were the firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the third day &amp;c.</hi> For this is all one as if he had ſaid the heaven and the earth were created in ſix daies and ſix nights, and albeit he made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any evening or morning of the ſeventh day wherein God did reſt from his worke. Yet may we not think but <hi>that</hi> day conſiſted of the ſame parts whereof the other ſix daies did, only the viciſſitude of the evening and morning is omitted in the deſcription of that day, to repreſent the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Sabbath whereof it was a Type wherein is no night; as the genealogie of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in reſpect of Predeceſſors or Succeſſors is not mentioned by the ſame <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe the holy Ghoſt by whoſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he wrote would have him brought in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out genealogie becauſe hee might reſemble the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of our high Prieſt the Son of God. From theſe premiſes wee may ſafely conclude that when our Saviour fore-told he ſhould be three daies and three nights in the belly of the earth, this is all one as if he had ſaid hee ſhould be three evenings and mornings in the wombe of the earth. The concluſion being granted, the former Synecdoehe is in this caſe moſt allowable; for 'tis evident that our Saviour was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in the ſixth evening and morning, that is on Friday, which was the ſixth day of the weeke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrewes accompt, before the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſun, or the evening following which was the beginning of the ſeventh naturall day or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, during all which as well the whole evening as morning hee reſted in his Grave at leaſt untill the

In both places the <hi>ſame night</hi> cannot be underſtood of the ſelfe ſame naturall day and night, but of the ſame night or day after the revolution of one yeare or more. In like manner the <hi>firſt man,</hi> according to the tenor of the former received opinion, did fall upon the ſame day wherein he was created, yet not upon the ſame day numerically, individually, or identical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, but upon the ſame day after the revolution of a weeke at leaſt or more, that is upon the ſixth day, and thruſt out of Paradiſe before the Sabbath enſuing, for his ſtealth or preſumptuous uſurpation of the forbidden fruit. Vpon the ſame day after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of many yeares, the Son of God or ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> now conſecrated to be a quickning ſpirit, did reſtore the ſons of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which their Father had loſt, by giving a true naturall ſon of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> a thiefe by practiſe, <hi>liverie de ſezin,</hi> or actuall poſſeſſion of the coeleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Paradiſe.

                  <p>2 The night immediately following the legall Sabbath wherein our Saviour did reſt from all his Labours, was part of the firſt evening and morning or of the firſt naturall day of the weeke: His Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection upon that day, and at that time of the day, and at that ſeaſon, implieth a two-fold myſtery, or the accompliſhment of two remarkable divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7904:183"/>
Firſt that of <hi>Gen. Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without forme and void, and darkneſſe was upon the deepe.</hi> The darkneſſe made the evening, and the ſeparation of the light from darkneſſe made the morning of the firſt natural day. <hi>God</hi> (faith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the light from the darkneſſe and called the light day, and the darkneſse he called night, and the evening and the morning were the first day.</hi> As was the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this viſible world or form leſſe earth before the Creation of light, or the diviſion betwixt it and darkneſſe, <hi>ſuch</hi> altogether was the condition or ſtate of the intellectuall world before it was new made or redeemed by the Son of God. The corrupted maſſe of mankind was overſpread with darkneſſe, and covered with the mantle of Death, but this long darkneſſe became more palpable then that of Egypt, during the time of the Son of God's ſurprizall, and his incloſure in the region of Death. Theſe were the houres wherein it was permitted the powers of darkneſſe to domineere, but theſe powers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and the darkneſſe diſpelled by his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from Death, which was on the ſame day, and at the ſame houre, wherein God the Father by him did firſt divide darkneſſe from light. From this houre of his Reſurrection the night is gone and the day is come, as many as believe in him raiſed from death, and adore the Son of righteouſneſſe, who as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>having aboliſhed death brought life</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>and immortalitie to light, they are the Sons of God, Heires of Glory; but ſuch as love darkneſſe more then the light of his goſpel, they muſt remaine the ſons of</hi>

                     <hi>darkneſse and of death.</hi> All this and more, is implied in the circumſtance of the time and place which the day and houre of his Reſurection had in that holy weeke being the firſt houre of the firſt day. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther myſtery is implied in the circumſtance of the time and place which the day of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on held in that ſolemne feaſt of unleavened bread.</p>
                  <p>3 So it fell out by the ſweet diſpoſition of God's ſpeciall providence that the day of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Reſurrection ſhould for that yeare fall upon the ſecond day of the Feaſt of unleavened bread, or the morrow after the Sabbath of that great ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Now on that preciſe day the Iſraelites were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily bound by a ſtrict Law to offer up the firſt fruits, as eares and blades of corne unto the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 10. 11. <hi>When yee become into the land which I give unto you, and ſhall reap the harveſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then ye ſhall bring a ſheafe of the firſt fruits of your harveſt unto the Prieſt, and he ſhall wave the ſheafe before the Lord to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the Sabbath the Priest ſhall wave it.</hi> From this peculiar reference or parallel of the circumſtance of time between the day of our Saviour's Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the day appointed for this legall feaſt of offering the eares of corne, The analogy or parallel between the Type and the ſubſtance is thus: As the uſe of the corne was not allowable to the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſome eares or blades of the ſame kind were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in ſacrifice by the Prieſt unto the Lord: So neither could the ſeed of <hi>Adam</hi> or of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or of any man elſe <hi>(ſeeing all had been ſowen in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> be either holy or acceptable to the Lord, or
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7904:184"/>
partakers of his Table or prefence, or put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, untill the high Prieſt of our ſoules the Son of God had offered a ſacrifice of the ſame kind, to wit, a body ſubject to like mortality as ours are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it was conſecrated to glory and immortality by the ſufferings of Death.</p>
                  <p>4 All were ſanctified, all were reconciled to God by this one oblation of himſelfe as the firſt fruits of them that ſleepe. Yet even ſuch as were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day of his Reſurrection really ſanctified and actually reconciled unto God, (the very Apoſtles themſelves,) were not made up or wrought into one body, or loafetill fifty daies after, not until that very day wherein the new reaped corne made into bread, was ſolemnly offered and preſented to the Lord. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15. 16. 17. <hi>And yee ſhall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that yee brought the ſheafe of the wave offering, ſeven daies ſhall be compleat, even unto the morrow after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Sabbath, ſhall yee number fifty daies, and yee ſhall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord, yee ſhall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth deales; they ſhall be of fine flowre, they ſhall be baken with leaven, they are the first fruits unto the Lord.</hi> The one holy Catholique Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints which we profeſſe in our Creed did not begin to be <hi>in eſſe</hi> (as by God's helpe it ſhall appeare hereafter,) or heare true life, untill the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the holy Ghoſt; which is the ſoule of the one holy Catholique Church, or of the myſtioall Body of Chriſt: And that was upon the fiftieth day inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively from the day whereon the eares of corne, or
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7904:184"/>
ſheafe of blades was offered unto the Lord. On that fiftieth day the holy Curch received the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, it being likewiſe another ſolemne day appointed for the legall offering up of the firſt fruits.</p>
                  <p>4 Thus much of the accompliſhment of the Type of <hi>Ionas</hi> his impriſonment in the belly of the Whale, and of the myſteries contained in thoſe three ſpeciall daies and nights, or evenings and mornings wherein our Saviour was in the wombe of the earth, and the time of his riſing againe. But the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer queries. Firſt, what our Saviour's abode forty daies on the earth from his Reſurrection to his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, or which is all one, what the ſigne of <hi>Ionas</hi> did portend to this evill and adulterous generation of the Iewes. Secondly, how the ſpace of his forty daies abode upon the earth after his Reſurrection was prefigured; are points worth the diſcuſſion, and for ought I know will make the fitteſt Period of this long work concerning the knowledge of Chriſt and him crucified.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat a ſtate ſo ſtrong and mighty as <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> was then, when <hi>Ionas</hi> was ſent unto it, ſhould upon theſe or the like briefe Summons of a forrainer [<hi>Yet fory daies and</hi> Niniveh <hi>ſhall be destroied</hi>] be ſo deeply ſtricken on a ſuddaine with extreme feare of death and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine: Or that a Court ſo diſſolute, luxurious, and proud as that Court was, ſhould ſo readily change their ſoft rayment into ſackcloth, and laying aſide their perfumes and ſweet odours, as the Text ſaith the King himſelfe did, may well ſeeme a greater wonder to a Reader <hi>qui ad pauca reſpicit,</hi> then God almoſt at any time had wrought in Iſrael: But the ſtrangeneſſe of the ſuddaine change perſwades, or rather aſſures me, or any diligent Reader, that the conſtant fame of <hi>Ionas</hi> his miraculous deliverance or eſcape out of the Whales belly, had come before him into <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and made way for the efficacy of his preaching or due entertainment of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage. And as <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of his ſtrange recovery of his health, brake forth into that acknowledgment, <hi>Now I know there is no God in all the world except in Iſrael:</hi> So theſe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7904:185"/>
                     <hi>Ninivites</hi> did collect that he who had delivered <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> from the danger whereinto hee had caſt him, was able to kill and to give life to whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: And as they dread his anger for tranſgreſſions paſt, ſo they conceive hope of mercy upon their true repentance and amendment: But however, it was not ſo ſtrange that <hi>Ninivie</hi> upon <hi>Ionas</hi> ſummons ſhould ſo quickly repent, as wondrous that the Iewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould not repent after this ſigne of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ionas</hi> was ſo peremptorily and punctually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by him that was farre greater then <hi>Ionas, by a Prophet of their owne,</hi> according to their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in their calmer thoughts, <hi>mighty in word and in deed.</hi> The ſpeciall points wherein the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> condemne this preſent generation of Scribes and Phariſees are, firſt their unpartiall diligence in examining the truth of the miracle wrought on <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</hi> Secondly their readineſſe upon teſtification of it to believe God's Iudgments and his Mercies; of which the one did impell or drive, the other gently lead or draw them to repentance.</p>
                  <p>2 But that which the Apoſtle ſaith of the Iews in general was remarkably true of this evill and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous generation in this particular. They had moſt grieviouſly diſpleaſed God by putting his only Son to moſt cruell Death, and after they had thus grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly diſpleaſed God they became contrary to all men, to the moſt grievous ſinners of other nations; &amp; in ſpecial to theſe <hi>Ninivites</hi> which muſt riſe or ſtand up in Iudgment againſt them. The <hi>Ninivites</hi> upon <hi>Ionas</hi> his preaching or embaſſage being uſhered or countenanced by the fame of his miraculous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7904:186"/>
repented in ſackcloth and aſhes. To have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented in a more ample, more deepe, or better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the <hi>Ninivites</hi> did, this preſent generation of the Iewes had motives many, all in themſelves, or abſolutely more forcible then theſe heathens had. Firſt to ſearch more unpartially after the truth of that great miracle wrought by and upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, being fore-ſhadowed by the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Prophet <hi>Ionas:</hi> He who was much greater and had been in greater danger then <hi>Ionas</hi> was, fore-told them almoſt in the beginning of his propheticall function, when he ſaid unto them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring of him a ſigne why he did thoſe things, he gave them this ſigne. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Deſtroy this Temple and in three daies I will raiſe it up.</hi> But this was a kind of riddle unto them, and ſo it was to his Diſciples till after his Reſurrection, for he meant it of the Temple of his body: But this riddle or aenigmaticall prediction he vouchſafed at this time to explicate or unfold, not to the vulgar or common ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple but unto the Scribes and Phariſees who were the moſt curious Criticks or Cavaliſts of the Law and Prophets, and of the ceremonies, Types or Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes contained in them, provoking or inviting them withall by this preamble [<hi>There ſhall no ſigne be given to it but the ſigne of the Prophet Ionas</hi>] dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to obſerve the parallel between the Type or shadow exhibited in the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or antype to be exactly accompliſhed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Some at leaſt of the Scribes, of the Phariſees and Elders, ſaw him die or linguering in the paines of Death upon the Croſſe: All or moſt of them, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7904:186"/>
of this adulterous generation had the manner of his Death both for circumſtance and ſubſtance, teſtified unto them by authenticall witneſſes. And to prevent all poſſible occaſions of falſe rumors or impoſtures which might be procured or attempted by his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, they provided a band of Souldiers to watch or guard his corps in the Sepulchre, during the time preſixed by him for his Reſurrection. All this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he who commanded the Whale to reſtore the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> whom ſhe had ſwallowed up in the ſea, did now command the earth or hard rock wherein our Saviour's Sepulchre was made, to yeeld up this her priſoner within three daies and three nights after his buriall; within the time limited and prefigured by <hi>Ionas</hi> his impriſonment in the fiſhes belly; and to yeeld him up not unto the earth or ſea, but unto heaven whence he deſcended. The ſea was his and he prepared the dry land, both ſea and land, and all that are in them and upon them, were abſolutely and equally at his command and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſall, and ſo was the heaven of heavens it ſelfe.<note place="margin">And for feare of him the Keepers did ſhake and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as dead men. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>The earth now trembled at his rebuke,</hi> and men of warre were affrighted at the ſight or preſence of his heavenly meſſengers: If theſe Roman Souldiers or all their legions had offered the leaſt reſiſtance to his perſon or to his Reſurrection, theſe heavenly Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would have fought for him and for his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which now began to be propagated through the world, though it was told the Roman deputy it was not of this world.</p>
                  <p>3 All the circumſtances which beſides theſe mentioned might be alleaged, were they put together
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7904:187"/>
and preſſed home, might well occaſion on halfe Chriſtian, or diligent Reader, or unpartiall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of times and circumſtances, rather to ſuſpect the truth of the Evangelicall ſtory, then fully perſwade him that it were poſſible either for the Iewes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the ſubornation of the Roman ſouldiers to teſtifie ſo groſſe an untruth as they did, or for them to yeeld upon any termes to ſo foule a temptation. But whether we reſolve this ſpirit of contradiction in theſe Iewes unto their own unrelenting ſpleen and malice, or unto divine infatuation, or reſpectively unto both; it would be a task more eaſy then ſafe to parallel their ſtupidity and ſubtle diſpoſition with with the like or worſe blindneſſe in many, which verily believe the truth of our Saviour's Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the circumſtances, and would be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to confirme their belife of <hi>it,</hi> and moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar points of faith with their blood. For the light and evidence of divine truth can hardly ſuffer a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ecclipſe in any man profeſſing Chriſtianity, no not in men of ſpleen-bitten braines; yet many fearful partiall ecclipſes it ſuffers in theſe men, in reſpect of the particulars at which their ſpleen doth riſe or interpoſe its diſmall ſhade, whilſt they are maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or illuſtrated by others whoſe good parts they envy, or whoſe perſons they hate; but of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much hath been ſpoken before in other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and more if God permit may be added in a treatiſe promiſed as the Reader may obſerve in the Preface prefixed to the firſt two. Books of theſe Commentaries.</p>
                  <p>4 But for the Iewes which upon the fight or
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7904:187"/>
uncontroulable fame of our Saviou's miracle had traduced him for a conjurer or ſorcerer, it was no new wonder in them, either not themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or to perſwade the Roman Souldiers (being firſt halfe blinded with bribes) to believe or ſuſpect that his Diſciples might uſe ſome meanes more then commendable arts or naturall skill could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them, either for aſtoniſhing or deluding their ſenſes, or ſurprizing their wits. However this of the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> being the laſt ſigne or forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which this evill generation was to expect from our Saviour the conſequence of their non-obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, or not repenting after the exhibition of it, was moſt contrary to this examplary patterne of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivite's</hi> obſervance of <hi>Ionas</hi> embaſſage by turning to the Lord in ſackcloth and aſhes. <hi>Iudah</hi> was now become more contrary to our God then either her ſiſter <hi>Samaria</hi> or then <hi>Aſsiria</hi> or <hi>Niniveh</hi> had been; and God's waies became more contrary unto her and to her children. The <hi>Ninivites</hi> repenting within the forty daies limited for this purpoſe, God repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſentence which he had pronounced againſt them, although <hi>Ionas</hi> who proclaimed it did mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure or <hi>grumble</hi> at it. For he expected that the Lord whoſe mouth and meſſenger he was, ſhould at the forty daies end declare him to be a true Prophet by putting his ſentence in execution: The Son of God expects as long for the repentance of theſe Iewes, which doubtleſſe would have pleaſed him much better then their deſtruction: But ſeeing they would not repent within the forty daies between his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion, the ſentence proclaimed
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7904:188"/>
by <hi>Ionas</hi> againſt <hi>Niniveh</hi> proceeds in fulleſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt this wicked and adulterous generation or degenerate ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5 But ſhall we be concluded from theſe premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to ſay that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> were deſtroyed immediately upon our Saviour's Aſcenſion? No: but this we may ſafely ſay, that from the day of his Aſcenſion which was the fortieth day after his Reſurrection, both the City and Nation did <hi>ipſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto &amp; jure</hi> incurre the ſentence of woe denounced againſt <hi>Niniveh</hi> by <hi>Ionas.</hi> And we may further adde that the deſtruction both of City and Temple, the deſolation of <hi>Iudea</hi> and miſerable diſperſion of the Iewes throughout the Nations, became more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and more inevitable then heretofore they had been; not for the indefinite ſubſtance only of the woe denounced, but the very meaſure of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery did dayly by the like neceſſity increaſe both for intenſive decrees and for extenſion, eſpecially in reſpect of the number of perſons which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the ſentence or decree pronounced againſt them, and of the time ordurance of the matter of woe denounced in it. Yet were none of theſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but by their continuance in their fore-father's ſins, and by not repenting of them, and by the dayly increaſe of their owne and their childrens ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>6 During the time of theſe forty yeares after our Saviour's Aſcenſion the City and State had a poſſibility of being freed <hi>à tanto</hi> though not <hi>a toto;</hi> though not ſimply from deſtruction, yet from ſuch fearfull deſolation as afterwards befell them. But continuing as impenitent all theſe forty yeares as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7904:188"/>
they had done for the forty daies before his Aſcenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſentence within forty years after his Reſurrection began to be put in execution according to the ſtrict tenour of our Saviour's prediction. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 41. 42. 43. 44. During the time of theſe forty daies God's Iudgments did lay ſeige againſt Ieruſalem, but the ſon of man Chriſt Ieſus yet converſing as man here upon earth did bear off the puniſhments due to their iniquity, as <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> intitled and in Type the ſon of man, had before prefigured. <hi>Chap. 4. 6. Thou ſhalt beare the iniquitie of the houſe of Iudah forty daies, I have appointed thee each day for a year. ſee v.</hi> 1. 2. And thus at the end of forty yeares after our Saviour's Reſurrection, (allotting a yeare for every day of his abode on earth) the City and Temple were deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This Calender of a day for a yeare, was no new or uncouth account to this people either in the daies of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> or at the time of our Saviour's Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it was a Calender of God's owne making as we may read <hi>Numb. 14. 33. 34. Your children ſhall wander in the wilderneſse forty yeares and beare your whoredomes untill your Carkeiſes be waſted in the wildernſſe after the number of the daies in which yee ſearched the land, even forty daies</hi> (<hi>each day for a year</hi>) <hi>ſhall yee beare your iniquities, even forty yeares, and yee ſhall know my breach of promiſe.

                     </hi> who beſides the literall

explication, is in this particular moſt orthodoxall for the <hi>morall ſenſe</hi> of the Prophet, concerning Gods gracious goodneſſe unto theſe Iewes in fore-telling ſo long before, from what place the City ſhould be aſſaulted, and by whom, and in what manner taken. The place from which the City was firſt aſſaulted and the defendants moſt prejudiced, was clearly fore-told by this Prophet. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>And his feet ſhall ſtand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before</hi> (or over againſt) <hi>Ieruſalem on the Eaſt</hi> and the Mount of Olives <hi>ſhall cleave in the midſt thereof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Eaſt and toward the Weſt. &amp;c.</hi> This part of the propheſie concerning <hi>the feet of God</hi> which were to ſtand upon the Mount of Olives was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo literally verified as in the day of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Aſcenſion. Many ſtrange miraculous reports are extant, concerning the print of our Saviou's feet, which continued more then foure hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Aſcenſion, (if we may believe traditions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently recorded) and poore travellers are made to believe that the Print continues the ſame unto this day. But to let theſe traditions paſſe <hi>tanquam via navis in mari,</hi> certaine it is, that whilſt our Saviour's feet did, as upon the day of his Aſcenſion, ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mount of Olives, the feet of that God of whom the Prophet their ſpeakes, did ſtand upon it. Now the time allotted for the Iewes repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired and peace not made with him before his Aſcenſion, the very duſt of his feet, much more the print of his feet did remaine as a witneſſe againſt them. At the ſame time was that other paſſage of the Prophet. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Then ſhall the Lord goe forth,</hi> to wit,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7904:193"/>
our of Ieruſalem, literally fulfilled. If his feet had not ſtood upon the Mount of Olives as a witneſſe againſt them, the Roman army had never ſtood there to execute his wrath upon them. For to omit allegories or forced interpretations concerning the cleaving of the Mount of Olives mentioned by the Prophet, <hi>their</hi> conjecture is more then probable, who thinke the propheſie was literally verified when the Romans beſieged the City and caſt their trenches upon the Mount of Olives. The time was now come that the Nations were to tread Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem under their feet, and the Iewes which were Chriſt's enemies were to become his footſtooles. Theſe be the iſſues of his ſetting his feet upon the Mount of Olives as it concernes Ieruſalem and the Iewes. Vnleſſe the Lord of hoſts had ſet his feet upon Mount Olivet to fight for the Nations againſt Ieruſalem, it had never come into <hi>Titus</hi> his head to give command or directions, nor into his ſouldiers hearts to put his directions conceived by himſelfe (contrary to the ſeveral adviſements of his counſell of warre) in execution, by raiſing that mighty wall mentioned by <hi>Ioſephus</hi> (<hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.) in the ſpace of three daies. His relation concerning the raiſing of that wall would have been to me incredible or a <hi>lying wonder,</hi> unleſſe the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> had fore-told it. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>And the Mount of Olives ſhall cleave in the middeſt thereof toward the Eaſt and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aeard the Weſt, and there ſhall be a very great valley, and halfe of the mountaine ſhall remove toward the North, and halfe of it toward the South.</hi> The wall without queſtion was not of ſtone, for to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7904:193"/>
that had been a madneſſe, but at the moſt <hi>de ceſpite vivo,</hi> of earth and turfe. Now the digging up of ſo much earth as would ſuffice to make a wall of that height, and ſo many furlongs in length as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> deſcribes, would neceſſarily cauſe or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuch a valley as the Prophet decyphers.</p>
                  <p>4 It is well obſerved by <hi>Danaeus,</hi> and ſo I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume by many others, that Ieruſalem ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed and expoſed to ruine from that place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her rulers had apprehended her native King and ſupreme Lord as a malefactor with ſwords and ſtaves; and that her Lord and God ſhould make her amore miſerable prey to the Roman Souldiers, then they had made his ſon and his followers to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Deputy, or ſuch as were under his command. But to parallel the miſeries which befell Ieruſalem and her children by the rules of divine retaliation, according to all that ſhee had done unto her Lord and King, or to ſet the exact proportion between <hi>Ionas</hi> his fore-warning to <hi>Nineveh</hi> [<hi>Yet forty daies and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall be deſtroied</hi>] and our Saviour's fore-warning unto Ieruſalem [<hi>as Ionas was three daies and three nights &amp;c.</hi>] and the iſſues or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both fore-warnings; the one upon Ieruſalem for her pepetuall non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentance; the other upon <hi>Nineveh</hi> for returning to her vomit about forty yeares after her repentance within the forty daies prefixt by <hi>Ionas,</hi> would require a large volume. Thus much for the preſent muſt ſuffice for anſwer unto the former of the two <hi>queries</hi> laſt propos'd, to wit, what our Saviour's abode forty daies here on earth after his Reſurrection did portend.</p>

                  <p>7 But if wee ſhould deſcend unto more exact ſearch of the particular cricumſtances of time as it includes the day of his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion with the other thirty eight daies intervenient; theſe were moſt punctually and admirably fore-ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and repreſented by the day of his firſt birth from the wombe, and by the day of his bleſſed Mothers Purification and his Preſentation in the Temple in Ieruſalem.</p>
                  <p>8 Inaſmuch as all the firſt-borne are called holy unto the Lord, and God requires them expreſſely of his people. <hi>Exod. 22. 29. The firſt-born of thy ſons</hi>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:7904:195"/>
                     <hi>ſhalt thou give unto mee.</hi> This did imply that there ſhould be ſome one firſt-borne amongſt them that were borne of women, in whom the light and life of holineſſe, that holineſſe it ſelfe of which all the legall titles of holineſſe were but ſhadowes or glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings, ſhould reſide or be incorporated as light in the body of the ſun. Now that Ieſus the Son of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was this firſt-borne in whom the true and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat holineſſe did thus reſide, the holy Ghoſt did declare or proclaime by the mouth of <hi>Simeon,</hi> at that very time wherein our Saviour according to the Law of the firſt-borne was to be preſented unto the Lord in his Temple, to wit, the time of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Purification. <hi>Simeon</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Luke) came by the ſpirit into the Temple, and when the Parents brought in the child Ieſus, to doe for him after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Law, then tooke he him up in his armes and bleſsed God and ſaid: Lord now letteſt thou thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant depart in peace according to thy word, for mine eies have ſeen thy ſalvation which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people, a light to lighten the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and to be the glory of thy people Iſrael. And</hi> Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>and his Mother marvailed at thoſe things which were ſpoken of him: And</hi> Simeon <hi>bleſsed them and ſaid unto</hi> Mary <hi>his Mother: Behold this child is ſet for the fall and riſing againe of many in Iſrael, and for a ſigne which ſhall be ſpoken against.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9 They good ſoules came not to the Temple with any ſuch intent or expectation, but to obſerve the Law of the firſt-borne male, as <hi>S. Luke</hi> tels us. <hi>Chap. 2. 22. 23. 24. And when the daies of her Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were accompliſhed according to the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7904:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>they brought him to Ieruſalem to preſent him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, every male that openeth the wombe ſhall be called holy to the Lord) and to offer a ſacrifice according to that which is ſaid in the Law of the Lord, a paire of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.</hi> The ordinary offering which the Law in like caſe did require was a Lambe, as you may read <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. 6. yet with this expreſſe diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that if the party were not able to offer a Lambe, two turtle doves, or two young pigeons ſhould ſuffice. The Bleſſed Virgin whether by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her husband's poverty, or (as I rather think) by reaſon ſhee was delivered of her Son in a ſtrange place, without the Country or Province wherein ſhe dwelt, was content to uſe the benefit of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</p>
                  <p>10 But though our Saviour had this peculiar prerogative of the firſt-borne, that he was moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the Lord, and although, as he ſaid at his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, it became him to fulfill all legall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet it is queſtionable whether hee were redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at other firſt-borne were. The ſacrifice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by S. <hi>Luke</hi> was ordinary at every womans Purification, whether the child brought forth were male or female. As for our Saviour of all firſt borne, he only needed no legal Redemption becauſe he was deſtinated from his birth not to be redeemed, but to be offered up in ſacrifice for the Redemption of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And in this he did fulfill that legall rite or ſhadow of redeeming thoſe uſefull creatures which were by the Law uncleane, by the ſacrifice of ſuch<note place="margin">Exod. 13. 11. 12.</note> as by the Law were accounted cleane</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:7904:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>11 But was he exempted by any more peculiar right from the Law of Redemption then the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin his Mother was from the Law of Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? To this demand it might be anſwered that the bleſſed Virgin was not free from all taint of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne as he was. But this reply or anſwer being admitted, it would be a foule hereſie or worſe then ſo, to ſay that ſhe was either legally or natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncleane during all or any part of the time of her ſeparation from the Sanctuary or holy aſſembly, for ſhe was free from any actuall ſinne in the time or manner of her conception, and from all legall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe either in her travaile, or for forty daies after it. Otherwiſe that holy one which was borne of her might have been conceived, or brought forth or nouriſhed by her milk in her uncleanneſſe, which to avouch or conceive were foule blaſphemy. Was her obſervation then of the Law concerning Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication either a will-worſhip, or affected worke of ſupererogation? Rather an excellent patterne or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary rule of obedience unto all the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> that deſire or intend to be the ſons and daughters of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The rule is that even ſuch of either ſexe as know themſelves not to be conſcious of the occaſions nor much lyable to the temptations which publique Lawes or ſacred Canons ſeeke to prevent or reſtraine from burſting out into matter of fact, ſhall doe both wiſely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly if they ſubmit themſelves to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of ſuch decrees or injunctions as are uſefull or needfull for moſt other men to obſerve. For it well becomes and behoves the moſt ſtrong and ſound
<pb facs="tcp:7904:197"/>
members of any body naturall, or civill, of Chriſt's myſticall body eſpecially, to ſympathize, <hi>thus</hi> farre at leaſt, with unſound or decaying parts of the ſame body, <hi>as</hi> to reſtraine themſelves from uſing that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which they for their owne parts might ſafely enjoy, were the object or matter prohibited void of danger unto other members of the ſame ſociety, which have more forcible temptations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or want skill or knowledge how to uſe their generall liberty.</p>
                  <p>12 But to conclude the point laſt propoſed and with it this preſent Treatiſe. When the Evangeliſt ſaith that the <hi>bleſſed Virgin</hi> with conſent of her betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed husband <hi>brought her ſon into the Temple accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of Moſes;</hi> It is cleare that ſhe did not come to preſent her ſelfe, or him in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before the fortieth day from his birth. For ſo the tenor of the Law concerning the firſt-borne males is, that his Mother ſhould be ſeven daies uncleane, to wit, unto the day of her ſons circumciſion and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three daies after it, accounting the day of his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion for one of theſe daies.</p>
                  <p>13 The parallel before propos'd lies directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe foure points or termes of proportion: The firſt, the day of our Saviour's birth from his Mothers wombe. The ſecond, the day of the bleſſed Virgins Purification, or the ſolemnity of his Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Temple. The third, the day of his birth from the Grave, or of becomming the firſt fruits of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſleep. The fourth, the day of his Preſentation to his Father in the heavenly ſanctuary, or of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronization both as King and Prieſt. Vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
<pb facs="tcp:7904:197"/>
day after his birth from the wombe of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin <hi>Simeon bleſsed</hi> Mary <hi>and</hi> Ioſeph; <hi>and</hi> Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na <hi>the daughter of</hi> Phanuel <hi>a Propheteſſe comming at that inſtant into the Temple gave thanks likewiſe unto the Lord and ſpake of him to all them that looked for redemption. Luk.</hi> 2. 34. 38. upon the fortieth day after his birth from his maiden-grave the prophecy of <hi>Symeon</hi> &amp; <hi>Hanna</hi> and their thankſgiving to the Lord were more exquiſitely accompliſhed then can by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mortall voice or pen be expreſt. <hi>As</hi> the legal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was to the Lord's day, <hi>ſo</hi> was the fourth day of the firſt weeke, on which the ſun, moon, and ſtarres were created, but the veſpers unto the new creation, wherein the Lord of Glory and Son of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was placed in his ſuperceleſtiall ſphere. On the firſt day of that week in which he aſcended, that joy of the fourth day of the firſt Creation decyphered by * <hi>Iob, the morning ſtars did ſing together and all the Sons of God,</hi> (the holy Angels, and Archangels. <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims</hi> &amp; <hi>Seraphims,</hi> Principalities, &amp; Powers,) <hi>did ſhout for joy,</hi> was accompliſhed. The ditty or manner of their ſong or joyfull ſhout is unexpreſſible, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigable. God grant we may in this mortall pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſo demean our ſelves as that we may be able to ſtand before the ſon of man at his ſecond comming unto judgment, &amp; be capable and docile to learn our parts in that heavenly ditty or ſong wherewith the Church triumphant did entertaine him at his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
