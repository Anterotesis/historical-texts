            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Robberies upon the High-ways, and Burglaries have been more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
committed of late, then heretofore, and more audaciously in the open Streets,
and other ways, and places, in, and about the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi>
and Parts adjacent; sometimes near to His Majesties Royal Presence, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and to His Courts of Iustice, in affront to Government: Therefore for
the better Suppression and Prevention thereof, and Apprehension of Offenders,
The Kings most Excellent Majesty (by and with the Advice of His Privy Council)
doth hereby straitly Charge and Command all Sheriffs, Iustices of the Peace, Maiors, Bailiffs,
Constables, Head-burroughs, Tythingmen, and other Officers and Ministers to whom it doth
or shall appertain, to take care, That the Statute of <hi>Winchester,</hi> made in the Thirteenth year of the
Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, for Hue and Cries, and fresh Suit to be made after Felons and
Robbers, from Town to Town, and from Countrey to Countrey, be duly observed with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
For which purpose, and to the end His People, for avoiding the Penalties to the contrary,
may use their utmost endeavors for Apprehending the Offenders, His Majesty hath thought fit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:58329:2"/>
to make known and publish, That by the said Statute of <hi>Winchester,</hi> the Inhabitants of the
Countrey where the Robberies are done, are to be answerable for the Robbery, and also for the
damage to the parties robbed, if the Offenders be not apprehended within the space of Forty days;
And by other Laws and Statutes for deterring Offenders, they are deprived of the benefit of
Clergy, in case of Robberies on the High-ways, and Burglaries, and the party robbed, for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to make resistance, is not to forfeit any thing, if he kill the Robber. And for the
more effectual Discovery and Prosecution of the said Offenders, His said Majesty is graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and hereby doth promise to Pardon all such person and persons who have been Partakers, or
guilty in committing any Robberies on the High-way, Burglaries, or other Thefts, that shall
within One year, from the date of this Proclamation, discover his, or their Fellow-Offenders, or
any of them, so as to cause them to be apprehended. And furthermore, His said Majesty is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
pleased, and doth hereby declare, That such person or persons, as well the said Partakers
guilty of the Offences, as all and every other person and persons, who shall at any time, within
One year, now next ensuing, as to Offences already done and past, and for the future within One
year after the Offences committed, discover to any Iustice of Peace, or any other Officer of Iustice,
any person that hath committed, or shall commit any Robbery on the High-way, or Burglary, and
shall apprehend, or cause to be apprehended such Offender, shall within Fifteen days after Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of such Offender so apprehended upon such Discovery, have a Reward of Ten pounds for every
such Offender so apprehended and convicted. And all and every Sheriff and Sheriffs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Counties or Sheriff-wicks, where such Conviction shall be had, are hereby required upon
the Certificate of the Iudge, or under the hand of Two or more Iustices of the Peace, before
whom such Conviction shall be had, to pay unto such person or persons who shall discover and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
such Offender, or upon whose Discovery such Offenders shall be apprehended, the said Reward
of Ten pounds, within the time aforesaid, for every Offender so apprehended and convicted, out of
the Publick Moneys received by him in that County, which shall be allowed unto him upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
