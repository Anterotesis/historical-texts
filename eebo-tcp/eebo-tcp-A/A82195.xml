            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving with ſadneſs weighed the multiplied calamities wherein we are at preſent involved, how friendleſs we are Abroad, and how divided at home; the loud and heart-piercing cries of the poore, and the diſability of the better ſort to relieve them; the total decay and ſubverſion of Trade, together with the forfeiture and loſs of the honor and reputation of the Nation, and (what is more dear to us then all theſe) the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent hazard of the Goſpel through the prodigious growth of Blaſphemies, Hereſies and Schiſm, all which own their birth to the inſtability of our Governors, and the unſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Government. Laſtly, how in all theſe, an univerſal ruine threatneth us, and wil (if not timely prevented) doubtleſs overwhelm us. We thought it our bounden duties, both as Chriſtians, out of tenderneſs to our Religion; as Engliſh men, to our Countrey; and as Friends, to our ſelves and our Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to repreſent and publiſh to the world our juſt griefs for, and our lively reſentments of this our deplorable condition, and to ſeek all lawful and probable means to remedy and redreſs the ſame.</p>
            <p>Wherefore having the leading Examples of the renowned Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Exeter,</hi> together with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the VVeſt, before our eyes; and the clamours and out-cries of the People alwaies in our ears, (whereof the one encourageth, and the other enforceth us to this our Declaration) we thought that we would not be ſilent at ſuch a time, when our ſilence would ſpeak us to be either Aſſentors to our own ruine, or Abettors of ſuch procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings as have neither Law nor Equity to ſupport them.</p>
            <p>VVe therefore, the <hi>Nobility, Gentry, Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Commonalty</hi> of the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> together with the City and County of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the City of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the Ports within the ſaid County, do by theſe Preſents unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly Declare, That our deſires are for a Full and Free <hi>PARLIAMENT,</hi> as the onely probable means, under God, to lead us out of this Maze and Labyrinth of confuſions in which we are at preſent engag'd; that is, that the old ſecluded Members, ſo many of them as are ſurviving, may be readmitted into the Houſe, and that there may be a free Election of others to ſupply the places of thoſe which are dead, without any Oath, or Engagement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to their Entrance, theſe we ſhall own as the true Repreſentatives of the People; theſe we ſhall with our Lives and Fortunes, to the utter moſt of our power, aſſiſt, and with all cheerfulneſs ſubmit to, and acquieſs in whatſoever they ſhall Enact or Ordain.</p>
            <p>Thus concluding, that all publick ſpirited men, and good Patriots, wil with all readineſs join and concur with us in a matter of ſo univerſal concernment, and that we ſhal find Oppoſition from none but ſuch as prefer their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſts, and temporal reſpects, to their Religion and laws of the land; we ſhall as boldly ſubſcribe our Names as we do heattily declare our Deſires.</p>
