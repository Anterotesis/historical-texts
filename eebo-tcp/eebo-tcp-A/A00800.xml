            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>16 Then ſpake they that feared the Lord, euery one to his Neighbour, and the Lord hearkned and heard it, and a booke of Remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and thought vpon his name.</q>
               <q>17 And they ſhall be to me ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in that day that I ſhal do this, for a flock, and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his owne ſonne that ſerueth him.</q>

forte them in their diſtreſſes, or to call vppon them for the amendment of their liues. But of other ſome, it is ſuppoſed, that there was not ſo great a miſery ment againſt them, as a miſterye for their good, which was this, that they ſhould the more inſtantly and feruentlye looke for &amp; longe after the King of Prophetes, Jeſus Chriſt him ſelf. But howſoeuer it was, of this I am well aſſured, <hi>Malachi</hi> performed his function, ſo fully and ſo faithfully, that he was reputed generallye to haue béene an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſent downe from Heauen, rather then a man borne and bred vpon the earth. Not ſo muche becauſe <hi>Malachi</hi> doth ſignifie an Angel, as that his doctrine did ſhowe an Angellike ſpirite, and did woork an Angellike effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregorye 1.</hi> being Biſhop of Rome, when he ſawe certaine <hi>Engliſh</hi> children brought the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſolde, aſked of what countrey they were, it was anſwered <hi>Angli.

the perfourmance of his office &amp; function, and then we ſhall finde that <hi>non ſolum vultu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſedcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ſpiritu nitet vt Angelus,</hi> not onely in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, but alſo in ſpirite, he doth ſhine lyke an Angell. For therein he bewrayed an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellike parte, farre paſſing humane operation. otherwiſe he would neuer haue wrought ſuch a ſudden and ſtraunge conuerſion in ſuche a ſenſeles and generall corruption, wherin both Prieſt and Prophet were far from all ſignes of grace, and not neare any hope of remorſe. But <hi>ſicut populus ſic Sacerdos, Imo ſicut populus, ſic Sacerdos,</hi> as the people were, ſo were the prieſts.</p>
            <p>For the prieſt, they diſpiſed the name of the Lord, and yet they ſaid wherein haue we deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed thy name. <hi>ver. 6. Chap. 1.</hi> They offered vncleane bread vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Alter of the Lord, and yet they ſaid, wherein haue we polluted it? <hi>Verſe. 7. Chapter. 1.</hi> they ſacrificed the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, the blinde, the lame, the ſick, ſuch as they durſt not preſent to a mortall Prince, yet they thoght the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good enough for the Lord of Hoſtes who is a great King. <hi>ver. 14. chap. 1.</hi> They were out of the way, they cauſed many to fall by the lawe, they brake the couenant of <hi>Leui, ver. 8. chap. 2.</hi> They defiled the holynes of the Lord, and maried the daughters of a ſtraunge God, <hi>ver. 11. chap. 2.</hi> To be ſhorte they ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:18112:4"/>
that euerye one that dooth euill, is good in the ſight of the Lord, and he deliteth in them. <hi>ver. 17. chap. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And nowe for the people, did not the Lorde himſelfe charge &amp; accuſe them, that they were ſoothſayers, adulterers, falſe ſwearers, detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the hirelings wages, oppreſſours of the widowes and the fatherles, <hi>ver. 5. chap. 3.</hi> ſuch Atheiſts that they ſaid, it is in vaine to ſerue God. <hi>ver. 14. chap. 3.</hi> Such Mammoniſtes that they would néeds know what profit they ſhould haue by kéeping his Commandements <hi>ver. 14. ibi.</hi> And ſuch rakehels, that they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the proude, bleſſed: and the tempters of God worthy to be aduaunced. <hi>ver. 15. chap. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which ripenes and outragiouſnes of their ſins, <hi>Malachi</hi> was preſentlye ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Gods heauy Judgements, and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt them, which hee ſo throughlye executed, that thereby he not only ripped vp &amp; ranſackt their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, but alſo perſed their ſoules, and deuided their ſpirites, with the two edged ſworde, which came out of his mouth, in ſomuch that they ſpake &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now in this ſcripture we haue chéefelye to note two points.</p>
            <p>1 A bleſſed conference, and mutual prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, for the amendement of their lyues. <hi>Then ſpake they. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18112:4"/>Secondly, a thréefolde comforte and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement which the Lorde gaue them, to procede in their Repentance. 1. Becauſe he hearkened and heard them. 2. For that he cauſed a booke of Remebrance to be writen &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe hee gaue them the promiſe of his merciſull protection, <hi>And they ſhall be to me in the day &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>THen ſpake they which feared the Lorde, &amp;c.</hi> So mightie and effectuall were the Prophets woords, in the heartes of as manye as feared the Lord, that by and by thereupon, they conferred about the reformation of their lyues, and ſpoke euery one to his Neighbour, (as by the circumſtance we gather) to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Deare Neighbours we haue often and deſperatly prouoked the Lords wrath againſt vs, and needes muſt wée grant our ſelues guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the crimes whereof <hi>Malachi</hi> doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe vs. What ſhall we doo then? We are now called to repentance. both by the voice of Gods vengeance, ſaying, <hi>I will come now to you in Iudgement, and I wil be a iuſt witnes againſt you. ver. 5. chap. 3.</hi> and alſo by the voice of his mercy: ſaying, <hi>Returne to me, and I will returne to you. ver. 7. chap. 3.</hi> All this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

ſhall wee ſtill runne on with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe? Why then the wrathe of God, muſt néedes come vpon the children of diſobedience. Therefore let vs humble our ſelues vpon the loweſt pauement of vnfained repentaunce, that it may repent him of his purpoſed venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce.

               <p>And ſo it preuailed with <hi>Ioſias</hi> and his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople: for at the reading of the booke of the law by <hi>Shaphan,</hi> there was renting of cloathes, and melting of harts, and ſhedding of teares, in all humility, <hi>2. King. 22.</hi>

               <p>And ſo it preuailed with the King of <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,</hi> and his People, for at the preaching of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> there was proclaming of faſtes, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

on of ſackcloath, and ſitting downe in aſhes, and crying mightilye vnto God, from the greateſt to the leaſt: <hi>Iohn. 3.</hi> And ſo it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed with the Iſraelites, at the preaching of <hi>Eſay,</hi> for they letted not to inuite one another ſaying: <hi>Come ye houſe of Iacob, let vs walk in the light of the Lord, Eſay. 2.</hi> And ſo it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed with the people which heard <hi>Peters</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auenly ſermon: for they were thereby euen pricked in their hartes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaid, <hi>men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ſhall we do?

               <p>But I do not ſée beloued in the Lorde, that it hath ſo preuailed with vs, and yet how mightilythe Lord hath called vpon vs, both Judgelike, &amp; Fatherlike in puniſhing, and in fauours, I knowe &amp; you can not be ignorant.</p>

               <p>You may read in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and fauour, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kinges obtained, by ſuffering the people to haue eaſie acceſſe vnto them, when they came with complaints for redreſſe of their wrongs: and you may read in <hi>Samuell</hi> how ſtrangelye <hi>Abſalon</hi> ſtale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the hearts of the men of <hi>Iſraell</hi> from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> his Father, by complaint that there was none to heare them, and by promiſe of ſpéedye diſpatch, if he him ſelfe might rule the roſt.

But it is ment of him <hi>qui preiudicat,</hi> which giueth raſh Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For otherwiſe, as nothing els brought <hi>Philippe</hi> to his deaths wound, but becauſe he wold not hear the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> And as nothing wrought that maine confuſion v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> eſtate, that neuer could be recouered, but onlye their ſlacknes in hearing poore mens cauſes. So indeed nothing more fretteth the hartes or aſtraungeth the minds of poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then delaying of their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from hearing.</p>
               <p>Which is doubtleſſe a great faulte in our
<pb facs="tcp:18112:13"/>
Courts in England, both eccleſiaſtical &amp; ciuil, that it is ſo long before poore mens cauſes can come to hearing. Indeed ſome times (I know) they are the longer, by meanes of their careles and couetous Lawyers, careles of their cauſe and couetous of their money: for they can tell, how to ſpin or rather to ſpill a cauſe, &amp; to draw it out like a thréede, from tearme, to tearme, vntill their clyents coats be thréed bare, and their purſes money bare. And therefore to be plaine, I lyke not this ſame <hi>Ad idem in proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> which is ſo much vſed among the <hi>Ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> nor theſe ſame néedeles and trifling <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrars,</hi> which are ſo ordinary, among the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawyers: for both theſe proue many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to be the very bane and murrain of many a good mans right.</p>
               <p>But let a mans cauſe runne thorow all the delaies and pikes, that the cunning of any drawlatch can deuiſe, yet vnleſſe he make ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and great meanes to haue it heard, it ſhal neuer be hearde, vntill doomeſday. Be wiſe then ye Judges of the earth, and learne to be forewarde &amp; ready to heare of him, which one day ſhall Judge you all, and ſuffer not good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be diſcouraged, or poore men to be eaten out of all they haue, thorow your delayes. If you doe, you ſhall finde that the Grand Judge him ſelfe will make no delay, to rewarde you ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
<pb facs="tcp:18112:14"/>
&amp; to meaſure his vengeance accordingly.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Lord heareth the voice of the penitent, nay, the very breath and the leaſt thought in his heart, tending to repentance. And therfore it is ſaid: If any man be a woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of God and doth his will, him doth he heare. <hi>Ioh. 9.</hi> Now this is his will, euen your holynes. <hi>1. Theſ. 4.</hi> And he willeth not the death of a ſinner, but that he ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and liue. And beſides, this very thing is warranted vnto vs in this Scripture, why, they did no ſoner wiſh wel in there harts but the Lord heard it. We cannot ſo ſay of any mortall Prince, his ſubiectes may ſpeake and cry and call long inough, and yet if they be not, within his hearing they are neuer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nere. And therfore this is a flat daſh to that peeuiſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the papiſts which tell vs that as a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Prince muſt be laboured vnto by meanes and mediatours, ſo muſt the Lord our God be ſolicited by Saints and Angells: Alas there is no proporcion in this compariſon: for God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is himſelf <hi>Scrutator Cordis</hi> the ſearcher of our harts: &amp; we cannot do it but by meanes: And what iniury or rather villa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y is it to make him in his hearing of no more capaſity or excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then a mortal creature? And ſo let this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for our firſt encouragement to drawe vs on to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for that the Lord vouchſafeth
<pb facs="tcp:18112:14"/>
to hearken and hear all them, which haue but any motion of ſo happy a purpoſe.</p>

And to what end? Surely that it might for euer be remembred, how much he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liteth in al penitent ſinners, which aſſone as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they forſake ſin, he will embrace &amp; honor in his bottomles and abundant mercy. Alſo that it might neuer be forgotten, that howe great and how generall ſoeuer the corruption was, yet they were the people which became penitent, and turned vnto the Lord, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>Malachi,</hi> &amp; therefore ſome cauſe why all poſterity ſhould be encouraged, not only to follow their example, but alſo to haue them in Admiration. It ſhall be expedient, that here we conſider firſt, what is ment by the booke of reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, &amp; then to whom it doth apertaine. For this book of reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance it is very ſtrange</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18112:15"/>We read of certaine ſtones of remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which being ingrauen with the names of the children of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and ſet in golde, <hi>Aron</hi> was to weare that he might remember them to Godwards.</p>
               <p>And we finde that there was a ſacrifice of Remembrance, made by fire, for a ſweete ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vnto the Lord, to ſignifie that God will not forget him that offereth it, <hi>Leuit. 2.</hi> And we vnderſtand of a Saboth of Remembrance to be obſerued, and celebrated, for a memorial of the blowing of Trumpets, and of the Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le. <hi>Leuit. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And who can be ignorant of <hi>Abſalons</hi> pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of remembrance, which he erected, becauſe he had no ſonne to kepe his name in memorie? But what this booke of Remembrance ſhould importe, that wee doe not ſo eaſelye perceiue. Surely ſome learned wryters are of opinion that hereby we are to vnderſtand, this booke of <hi>Malachies</hi> prophecy. Which becauſe it was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the Lords appointment, was dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les written before his face: and becauſe it can not be red openly in the congregation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recitall of this their conferrence, therefore it may be termed iuſtly a booke of reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance. Euen as the goſpell it ſelfe, is a booke of Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, in reſpect of that which <hi>Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> did to our Sauiour Chriſt: for whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:18112:15"/>
this goſpell ſhall be preached, through out all the world, there ſhal this alſo that ſhe hath done bee ſpoaken of, for a memoriall of her, ſaith Chriſt Jeſus himſelfe. <hi>Math. 26.</hi> And in this ſence it doeth maruelouſlye approue and confirme the authority of this booke of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies</hi> Prophecy, as beeing written in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and at his appointment.</p>
               <p>But by the cenſure, and in the Judgement of the moſt learned and godly writers that I haue red; there is another meaning to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, by the booke of remembrance. For thereby is ſignified the booke of lyfe, wherein the righteous are written, and whereof we read. <hi>Exod. 32. Pſal. 69. Apoc. 3.</hi> And it is ment, that therein the Lorde did write their names preſently vpon their repentance, for a memoriall thereof.</p>
               <p>And that you may ſée in what ſtéed it wil ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you, to be writen in the booke of the Lordes Remembraunce, and to be remembred in the booke of lyfe, conſider firſt of that which is ſet downe <hi>Daniell. 12. ver. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thereby may you perſeiue that albeit there fall out ſuch a tyme of trouble, as neuer was ſince the worlde beganne, yet euerye one that ſhalbe found written in the booke of lyfe ſhall be delyuered, and to the ſame effect it is, that this booke was ordained for this people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18112:16"/>
to be as it were their Paſſeouer, to auoid and eſcape the dayes of miſerye, which the Lorde did threaten, to bring vpon them. Prouide that the doore poſtes of your conſciences maye be ſprinckled with the bloode of the Lambe, or that your repentaunce maye bee recorded in the booke of lyfe, and you are ſure of an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Paſſeouer to eſcape Gods moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vengeance.</p>
               <p>But if you wll ſée that prerogatiue, which is, <hi>Inſtar omnium:</hi> in ſtéede of all other. Then conſider againe and againe, of that which is written, in <hi>20. Apoc. ver, 12.</hi> Wherin the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious maieſty of our Sauiour Jeſus Chriſt, is moſte truely deſcribed, euen as he ſhall come to Judge the quick and the dead, for it is ſaid, <hi>And I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d before God: and the bookes were opened, &amp; another book was opened, which is the book of lyfe, &amp; the dead wer iudged of thoſe things which were written in the bookes, acording to their workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now what are theſe bookes that ſhall be opened before the booke of lyfe be opened? doubtles theſe thrée, the booke of the Lawe, the booke of the Goſpell, and the booke of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Firſt the booke of the Law ſhal be opened, and laid before vs, that it maye appeare what
<pb facs="tcp:18112:16"/>
duetye we ought to haue done towardes God and man through loue. And euen as <hi>Moyſes</hi> comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the <hi>Leuites</hi> to put this booke in the ſide of the Arke, that it might be for a witnes againſt them, when they diſobeyed the ſame. <hi>Deu. 31.</hi> So ſhall all the workers of iniquity in the fearefull day of the Lord, find this booke a ſwift witnes againſt them. And if <hi>Ioſias</hi> rent his cloathes and wept for wo, when he heard the law red, and thereby ſawe how much due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was required, and how little he had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: what ſorrow and heauines ſhall compas vs about, and if it were poſſible, diſſolue our teares, and turne them into drops of blood?</p>
               <p>When in the preſence of this our ſeuere Judge we ſhall both heare and ſée, not onelye what we haue left vndone, in that book com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but alſo what we haue done therein forbidden. In the meane time therefore, let vs not onelye be hearers of the Law, but dooers alſo, leſt then we finde Gods fauour vnrecouerable, and our repentance vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>Secondly the booke of the Goſpell ſhal be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that thereby it may appear what mercy, what grace, what frée pardon, what remiſſion of ſinne, what imputation of righteouſnes, and what aſſuraunce of lyfe and Saluation, you might haue had in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18112:17"/>If you had bene ſo happye to haue ſought it by repentance, and to haue laid holde vppon it by faith.</p>
               <p>At the opening of this booke, ſhall you ſée before your eyes all the ſwéete promiſes, and tender inuitations which our Sauiour Chriſt offred vnto you through preaching of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to haue drawne you to repentance, Then ſhall all the benefites of his bitter paſſion be laid open before your eyes, and you ſhall ſée that he was debaſed himſelfe, to haue brought you to honour: that he was wounded himſelf to haue healed your wounds of ſinne: and that he died himſelfe, to haue ſaued his enemies from death, and to haue purchaſed eternal life to all penitent ſinners. And as the booke of the lawe ſhall ſhewe what wee ought to haue done, ſo the booke of the Goſpell ſhall ſhewe, what we ought to haue beleeued: and both to one end (Chriſt knoweth) that ſo much more Juſt and dreadfull may be our Judgement.</p>
               <p>O ye proude contemners of the worde of trueth, conſider of this; you which thinke the Goſpell to baſe for your déepe wittes haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde vnto it, leſt the time come that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it, and féele the ſmart of it.

Then ſhal the booke of lyfe, which is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the booke of Remembraunce be opened, wherein the Lord, hath ſet downe vpon record whatſoeuer good thing we haue done, for the obtaining of the crowne of lyfe, and the auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſnares of death, and namely theſe
<pb facs="tcp:18112:19"/>
foure things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Names of all Gods Saints and ſeruants, and this is apparant by the wordes of <hi>Moyſes, Exod. 32. 32. If thou wilt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I pray thee race my name out of the booke of lyfe, which thou haſt written. And Daniell</hi> praieth, that the wicked may be raced out of the boke of lyfe, and that they may not be written with the righteous. <hi>Pſal. 69.</hi> So that as <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> had his booke of remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, wherein the names of ſuch, as had don him hye ſeruice at any time, wer vſually writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and as he finding that <hi>Mardocheus</hi> had diſcouered two traitours which ſought to laye violent hands vpon the King, cauſed him to be honored, by putting on his owne rich apparel, and by wearing his royall crowne vpon his head, <hi>Eſter. 6.</hi> In lyke maner our heauenlye King, ſéeing the good that we haue done, for the ſupplanting and ſubuerting of the enemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of his trueth will he not recorde our names in his book? will he not giue vs the rich robes of his innocencie? and the royall crowne of his euerlaſting glorye? Read you the 2. of the Re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you ſhall ſee, that the Lord doeth profeſſe this fauour: Very notably he tolde the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> that heknew her workes, her labor and her patience &amp;c. And ſo he tolde the church of <hi>Smirna,</hi> the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:18112:19"/>
Church of <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> that he knew not onely what yet they had done, but alſo did remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and recite in particuler their good, recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them for the one, and promiſſing to rewarde them for the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly in this booke of Remembraunce we ſhall finde written the teares of our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore <hi>Dauid ſaith: Thou haſte counted my wandrings, &amp; put my teares into thy bottle, are they not in thy regiſter? Pſ. 56. 8.</hi> Can there, be a greater comfort then this when wee are brought to the ſtake to bee burnt, or to the ſworde to be cut as fleſh to the potte, or to the wilde horſſes to be torne in a thouſand peeces? Let the butcherlike tirants glut their hartes by making aſhes of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or foules meat, or dogs meat of our fleſh, what care wee? They can not ſcrape our tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res out of the booke of Remembrance, nor race our bloode out of the regiſter of lyfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In this booke of Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance we ſhall finde written the works of our compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for ſo much doth the wordes of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt importe, <hi>Math. 25.</hi> Who ſhall ſay to them on the right hand, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father inherite ye the kingdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of the world, for I was an hungred &amp; ye gaue me meat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> Then ſhall the righteous aunſwer him, and
<pb facs="tcp:18112:20"/>
ſay, Lord <hi>When ſawe we thee anhongred, &amp;c.</hi> Then ſhall he anſwer and ſay, <hi>Verely, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as you haue done it to one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye haue done it vnto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo much doth the woordes of <hi>Iob</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>Cap. 31. ver. 35.</hi> Where he ſaith, that the Almighty will witnes his pitty towardes the poore, albeit his enemy ſhould write a booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. And ſo will he doe for vs: If wee giue but a cuppe of colde water for his names ſake, we ſhal not loſe our rewarde.</p>
               <p>We ſee that Princes haue their bookes of Subſidies, of Beneuolence, of priuye Seales, wherein they ſet down whatſoeuer good they receiue at the hands of their Subiects, by free gift or vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lone or lending. And ſo it is with our heauenly potentat: I warrant you, if you releeue the poore, he ſets it down in his book for a ſubſidy, or a beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce don to him: &amp; if you lend to the poore &amp; needy, he ſets it downe for a priuy ſeale lent to him: &amp; he will become your debter, and ſée it diſcharged to the vttermoſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore ye rich men, out with your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie, extend your beneuolences, and ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad your priuye ſeale money, the Lord will not forget it, he will not faile but ſet it downe in his booke of Remembrance.</p>
               <p>And heere, right Honorable, and beloued in the Lord, I cannot but put you in minde of

flocke and throug together; lyke ſhéepe to the folde.</p>
               <p>Another prerogatiue of this flock is, that as it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uented and aſſembled by the call of the worde, ſo it is continued and kept together thorow vnity and chriſtian loue, which is the bond of perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is like the folde that coopes vp the ſhepe together, and keepes them from wandring and ſtragling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is lyke the band that preſerues the ſheſe or faggot from ſhattering <hi>Vnus Paſtor, vnum Ouile.</hi> There is one ſheepehearde and one flocke or ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the behalf of Jeſus Chriſt our head ſhepehearde, I beſéeche you, and for your owne ſaluations ſake, I require you and charge you al to take heed how by ſciſmes and ſects ye ſeeke to ſcatter the flocke of Chriſt, leſt you bring it from <hi>Ouile</hi> to <hi>Hedile,</hi> and from <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile</hi> to <hi>Canile,</hi> from a ſhepefolde to a hearde of Goates, and from a heard of Goates, to a ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Alas, alas, it was not lawfull to break a bone of Chriſtes naturall bodye, but hée that breaketh the peace of the Church, breaketh the verye backebone of his miſticall body.</p>
               <p>And it was as vnlawfull to part or deuide ſo muche as his vnſeamed cote: But they which practiſe to deuide the Church, what do
<pb facs="tcp:18112:26"/>
they elſe, but teare his cote off his backe? and rent in ſonder his tender harte? Wherefore as nature forced the right mother to abhorre the deuiding of her owne childe. <hi>1.

               <p>A third prerogatiue of the Lords flocke is, that it is ſuſtained and foſtered after the beſt manner that may be poſſible. For <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard, therfore I ſhal wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nothing.

                  </hi> For this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes flouriſheth, and neither the heat of Sommer can ſcorch it, nor the colde of winter freeſe it. And by the waters of comforte, he meaneth the graces of the holye Ghoſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is written. <hi>Io. 7.

               <p>Fourthlye, this flocke is ſure to be guided, and directed by the Lordes owne hand, <hi>Hee ſhall lead mee in the pathes of righteouſnes,</hi>

               <p>And to this very end was the miniſtery of the Angels ordained, to guarde the flocke of Chriſt in all ſafety. <hi>The Angell of the Lord pitcheth round about them that feare him, &amp; delyuereth them. Pſal. 34.</hi> And againe, <hi>He ſhall giue his Angelles charge ouer thee, to kepe thee in all thy waies: They ſhall beare thee in their handes, that thou daſhe not thy foote againſt a ſtone. Pſal. 91.</hi> And haue not the Patriarkes, and the Prophets, &amp; the people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and the Apoſtles, and the Saints of God founde it ſo in their diſireſſes?</p>
               <p>Was not <hi>Iacob</hi> comforted againſt <hi>Eſau,</hi> by an hoſt of Angels? <hi>Gen. 32.</hi> Was not <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeus</hi> ſauegarded by an army of Angels from the <hi>Aſſirians? 2.

               </p>
               <p>Moſte wonderfull is the protection, and moſt tender is the care which the Lord hath ouer his flocke.</p>
               <p>It were a great fauour to allow vnto his

flocke a garde of men, and to allowe it a band of Princes, were exceading and ſurpaſſing and incredible loue: But to make the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels garde vs, and to pitch round about vs for our ſafetye, what an vnſpeakeable prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue is it of his incomparable mercye and bottomles compaſſion towardes the ſhéepe of his paſture?</p>
               <p>And laſtly, this flocke ſhall eſcape and goe ſcotfree in the day of vengeance. <hi>In the day that I ſhall do this.</hi> But what is it the nere, or wherein are wee the better? when in the meane time our Sauiour Chriſt telleth his diſciples, that their eſtate in this lyfe ſhall be <hi>Tanquam Oues in medio Luporum, <hi>As ſhepe in the middeſt of Wolues, Math. 10.</hi>
                  </hi> Is this all the care he hath of his flock? to leaue it in ſuch a caſe in the middes of Wolues? Tuſh, take we no care, for the Lordes care ouer his: For as the very heare of our heades are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and not one of them ſhall miſcary: So right deare in the ſight of the Lorde, is the death of his Saints. And if they be but in daunger once, he will doe as that ſame good ſhepheard did, whereof we read in the Goſpell. <hi>Luk. 15.</hi> Who hauing but 100. ſheepe in all his flocke, when one of them went aſtraye, left the reſt in the wildernes, and ſought it out, and brought it home into ſafetye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18112:27"/>But what if the Lordes flock be left in the middes of Wolues, <hi>id eſt,</hi> Heretickes, or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes? yet the Lorde hathe noe ſuche purpoſe rhere to leaue them, becauſe they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of them, but a contrary drift there is, which you woulde lyttle thinke. That is, that this flocke ſhould ouercome and deuoure the Wolues themſelues. And ſo much <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Plurimos morſus ab us accipientes non ſolum non conſumuntur, ſed et illos conuertunt, <hi>receiuing many bytings of them, they are not only not deuoured, but they eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conuert the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is ſurely miraculous. It were ſtrange to ſee a ſhéepe ouercome or kil a wolfe But it is not ſtraunge to ſée one of Chriſtes ſheepe ouercome or kill one of Sathans Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.</p>
               <p>It were a wonder to heare that a ſheepe ſhould turne a Wolfe into a ſheepe (I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you that <hi>Ouid</hi> in all his Metamorphoſis hathe none ſuche) But it is not vnlikelye nor vnpoſſible that one of the Lordes ſheepe may of an Heretike make a good Chriſtian, and of a tyrant a good Magiſtrat, which is al one in effect. And therefore <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>multo mirabilius eſt et maius, tranſmutare mentes eorum, quam interficere eos.</hi> It is a thing much more wonderfull &amp; greater, to chaunge the minds of Heretikes &amp; tyrants then to kill

them.</p>
               <p>Taking theſe Wolues for Heretikes, you ſhall finde that the ſheepe of the Lords flocke haue conuerted them, and turned them into ſhéepe.</p>

               <p>But indéede our heauenly Father doth ſo entirely tender his children, that there is no ende or compariſon thereof to bee made. And therfore as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>he is our Father. cap. 63.</hi>

               <p>He ſpareth vs in three reſpectes, in two of them much lyke a naturall Father, but in the third there is no compariſon, I am ſure, and ſo you will ſay.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as a naturall Father will not Kill or deſtroye his childe when he is ſicke, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cannot eat his meat, or aborreth ſuch things thorow infirmity, as ſhould be a mean to recouer his health: So our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſpare vs, and not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne vs, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found vs for euer, although we be ſicke in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and weake in faith, &amp; do euen loath often times his heauenly woord, which is the health and ſaluation of our ſoules.</p>
               <p>Secondly, like a natural father he ſpareth vs in reſpect of our wilfull prodigalities, and waſtinges of his bleſſinges and graces: not vnlike that ſame louing Father in the goſpell who forgaue his ſonne, which had ſo leudlye conſumed his fathers ſubſtance, and his owne

               <p>Our race we haue as wilfully runne. Our tyme we haue as vainely ſpent. His fauours we haue as ilfau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

to ſpare and to ſaue vs, thou haſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thy ſelfe to become a very ſpoile for the malice of Sathan.</p>
               <p>I graunt you <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> was verie deſirous to ſpare and ſaue the Romane Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, when hee ſolde all his patrimony to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déeme them.

               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> was wondred at for his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection toward <hi>Leonicus</hi> his deere frend, becauſe hee gaue all the <hi>Rhodian</hi> captiues to redeeme him: but yet he gaue his enemies to redéeme his friend. But Chriſt Jeſus our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour, hath giuen himſelfe to redeeme his enemies.</p>
               <p>To bee ſhort, when there was in <hi>Rome</hi> a ſodaine gaping gulph which they could by no meanes fill vp, and the Oracle had ſignified, that except the chiefeſt thing, and that which the commons loued beſt, were caſt into it, it could not be ſtopped: <hi>Curtius</hi> vnderſtanding that he himſelfe was their onely Jewel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe threw himſelfe into it, and ſo it was fild vp preſently.

our bleſſed ſauiour caſt himſelfe into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of it, and died a moſt bitter death, &amp; this he did for the people, which thought they had nothing worſe or more vile than hee, no not <hi>Barrabas</hi> that arrant cutthroat.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay then of this ſo rare, ſo royall, ſo vnſpeakeable, and ſo incomparable loue of his towards vs?

               <p>The Lord therefore graunt that ſuch bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles compaſſion in him may preſently work ſome thankfull compunction in you. And that as the vaile of the temple rent in ſunder from the toppe to the bottome, when theſe thinges were performed: So the conſideration of the extreame miſerie which hée endured, that hée might ſpare and ſaue our forlorne ſoules, may ranſacke euery vaine in our hearts in all due remorſe.
