         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you are to me, however I am or may
be unto you; what God shall cause me
here to write as a Preface, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
is not for my self at all, but for
you all, that is all for you; I seek not my self herein
(God forbid) and God forbid I should have a thought,
or any itching, to speak, to make you speak in the behalf
of me, who am a poor man, a nothing but sin, (as I am
in my self) therefore not fit to be mentioned, no other
than to be lamented, as I am in my self, and God to
be praised and glorified, as I am in him, brought
home to him, living in him, and for that I find and
know that he liveth in me. I have not nor I shall
not (I trust through Grace) ever henceforth, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to speak or write my self, but him that hath called
me, and as he shall inable me, and shew forth himself in
me, and unto me; for I desire to forget my self with

my whole heart, unless to humble me, and to exalt the
honour and praise of my God, who hath not only crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

speak. Wherefore all ye that shall come to see these
lines, and this following discourse, I trust that you
shall see the Power of God accompanying them, and
owning them for his own words, and works, and if you
find them not on your own Spirits to be his, disown them
and me; but I dare you so to do who ever you be.
Read them I willingly would you did, and Ah would
to God it were (all your Portions) to read them with
a double Portion of his Spirit and prefence, which I
had when I writ them, that he that gave them me,
would doubly thus give them unto you, then I am sure
you would never forget his loving kindnesse, nor crease to

all that see them may know them to be thine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

God, as thou hast feasted me, fill them with thy self as
thou hast often filled me, give them and make them
partakers of all those heavenly gifts and graces, which
thou hast many times manifested, and given unto me,
shew them, O God, shew them thy Kingdom, Power,

thy ravishing beauty, dart into their hearts a beam of
thy Divine Light, that they may see all things (in

Christ, thy dearly beloved Son, that having put him
on, thou maist for ever own them for thine own, and
love them with that pure, perfect and surpassing Love
wherewith thou lovest them, and give them I most
humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, thine own holy
Spirit to direct them to walk obediently and faithfully
henceforth in all the waies of thy Commandments, to

the praise, honour and glory of thy most holy and most
glorious name, the edification of the brethren, and the
comfort and consolation of their own Souls, in the day
of the Lod Jesus Christ, that when he shall appear at
his second coming in glory, they may also all of them
appear with him.</p>
            <p>Dear Friends, I know that God hath not given me
what he hath given me, for my self alone, because that
what of it hath been already communicated unto others
he hath with the blessing of his own Spirit, made it a
Spiritual blessing unto them, wherefore I have good
reason to believe (besides the perswasion of divers good
Christians) that it will also find acceptation (among
you especially) for whose sakes I do what I do, that is
make it publick, wherefore if it should meet with any
so desperately critical, or devilish, as to censure it or me,
let him, or them know, that as I fear not, so I care not,
what ever they say or do either against the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because I know that God knoweth both my heart
and my thoughts hereon, and that is enough to give me
boldness to go on to do it, and also to rejoyce in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, because he hath and doth perswade me, that
this my labour shall not be in vain, in the Lord. And
who ever thou art that any waies censurest it, or me,
I shall as heartily pray for thee and thy Soul, that God
censure thee not for it, but convince thee and convert
thee, even as if thou wert a part of my very self, and as
if my well being did consist in thy well being for be thou
what ever thou art, though I hate thy sin, and be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:105293:4"/>
at it, yet I truly and in all faithfulness love thy self
and thy Soul, and would with my heart that it go so
well with thee as it doth (through the free Grace, Love
and Mercy of God in Jesus Christ) with me. And
I shall continue to contend with God in the behalf of thy
Soul, ann the pardon of thy sins, as for my own. I
know what it is to be a great sinner; and I also know
(through the infinite and incomprehensible Love of
God) what it is to be washed, cleansed, pardoned, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
sanctified, and saved from all sin, and to be (in
Christ without spot, or wrinckle, undefiled. And
therefore I cannot, (in humility I speak it) but as
God, love all Souls with true and unfeigned Love,
heartily praying and desiring that none might perish,
but that all might come to partake of everlasting life,
to enjoy for ever those heart and Soul ravishing joyes
that God hath prepared and laid up for all those that
truly love him.</p>
            <p>I intend not to speak anything touching the method,
nor to crave the excuse of any for any thing that may
not savour with them. I know from whom I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, and he I am sure will patronize and protect
it, and blesse it in some measure I hope, unto all that
shall read it; but whatever successe it find, I shall find
I am sure, all that I seek for, which is peace within
during this life, and honour, glory and immortality in
the World to come, which good Lord grant for Christ
his sake unto all those that love thee, and wait for thine
appearing, And thus, dear hearts, I leave you to the
<pb facs="tcp:105293:5"/>
guidance of the good Spirit of the Lord, to direct you
in all your thoughts and words, that they and all your
actions, as well as mine may be now and alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
in his sight, who is our strength and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
to him who is able to keep you from the hour
of temptation, and to preserve you blamelesse until
the hour of his coming, I commit and commend you

of thy dear only and beloved Son Jesus Christ the
Righteous.</p>
            <p>And grant O most mercifull and loving Father in
Jesus Christ my Redeemer, that I may set down
from time to time the only Dictates of thy holy and
most blessed Spirit unto my poor soul, not any head no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but my very hearts frame and only desires and
motions; that they may both then and ever after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,
rejoyce, glad and comfort me, and cause me to
bring forth fruit to newness and amendment of life,
for the honour and glory of thy great Name; and
grant that I may ever renounce all merit or worthiness
in my self for the very least of all thy mercies, no not
for the crumbs that fall by thy providence from the
childrens table.</p>
            <p>Sure I am the more light I have from thee, O
Lord my God, I shall the better and clearer see my
own darknesse, the more I have of thy wisdom, the
better I shall see the foolishnesse of all worldly wisdom,
and the errours of my own waies; the more I have
of thee, the less I shall have of my self; the more thou
shalt be pleased to give me, the less I shall confess I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
and the more thou shalt be pleased to lift me up,
the lower I will cast my self down: Ah Lord God,
teach me to know my self that I may hate my self;
teach me to know thee rightly, not in the history only,
but in the mystery also; not only without, but also
within, that I may love thee in fear, and fear thee
with true unfaigned sincere spotlesse love; wean me, O
<pb facs="tcp:105293:7"/>
Lord, from the world and the worlds loves, let me
die to the world and to all things in it, that I may live
to thee. Ah take me from the world, ere thou takest
the world from me; fit me for thy self, ere thou takest
me to thy self; let my last daies be my best daies, and
my last thoughts my best thoughts; let me not live one
moment longer then to do thee service, and let that
only be my aim and my end, let thy work be my wages,
<hi>and thy wages my work.</hi> O Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God in Jesus
Christ, I most humbly beseech thee to perfect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
that good work which thou hast begun in me,
for all my hope, trust and confidence is in thee, that
thou wilt never leave me nor forsake me; Ah Lord,
do not leave me to my self at any time, for I shall undo
in one moment all thy doings, so great is my skill, power,
strength, mind and will to all evil, against all good.
But O my God, do thou continue to restrain my will
and constrain it to thy will, and to the faithfull and
entire obedience of all thy Laws and Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.
Write thy Laws of grace in my heart
and thy Statutes in my minde, by the finger of thy
holy Spirit, and suffer me never through any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to depart from them, but let them be a lanthorn to
my feet, and a light unto my paths, to lead, guide, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and govern me in the waies of righteousness and
holiness, that I may live the life of the righteous, in
the midst of this crooked, froward and perverse gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Ah Lord, suffer not the mountains of my
sins, nor the Rocks of unbelief to hinder thy mercies
<pb facs="tcp:105293:8"/>
from descending into my heart by thy holy Spirit,
nor my prayers from ascending up unto thee by faith.
Let thy mercies draw me, and thy judgements drive
me, that I may run and not grow weary, that I may
walk and not faint. Be, O Lord, my God I most
humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ a savour of life
unto life to my soul, and of death unto death to my
sins, and let thy holy and most blessed Spirit of grace,
that knoweth thy whole, holy and sacred mind and
will, lead me, teach me, direct me and instruct me in
all the things I shall take in hand to do; and give
me, O Lord I beseech thee, those things, and those
things only that may draw me nearer and nearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy self, to make me thine and only thine, that I
may be wholly thine, <hi>holy thine,</hi> alwaies thine, <hi>and
ever thine,</hi> that living here in thy fear, I may die
in thy favour, and after death be neade partaker of
Eternal life, through Jesus Christ my blessed and
alone Saviour and Redeemer, for whom I desire ever
to blesse thee as the Lord my Righteousnesse; and to
whom with thy glorious, holy and sacred Majesty, thy
eternal and blessed Spirit of grace, be given and
ascribed by me, and all thine, as all due is, Honour,
Glory, Power, Might, Majesty, Dominion and
Thanksgiving, Now and for ever more, <hi>Amen.</hi>

abundantly, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
therefore of thee in Jesus

that I have nothing, though thou keepest nothing
else from me.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I know that there is no perfect perfection
here, and therefore we cannot live without sinne,
but O most gracious and most mercifull Father,

lay them not to my charge, but bury them all,
past, present, <hi>and to come,</hi> in the grave of my bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

            <p n="5">5. I will ever seek thee, O God, whom my
soul loveth, desire thee only, and lay hold and
depend on thee alone.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let, O God, the things of the world be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, as I was unto thee (whilst I was in the
world, out of thee) even as a menstrous cloth,
and filthy rags.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thy mercies, O God, are the hid Treasures
which my heart seeketh, and longeth to enjoy.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Thy love, O Christ, is much sweeter to my
taste, than the honey-comb, and I desire it much
more then gold, yea above all the worlds treasure,
good, and glory.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I am sure I shall be able to rejoyce, in and
under any, yea all afflictions, if thou dost not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
me, O my God and my Father in Jesus Christ,
with thy absence.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He is in heaven though on earth, that doth
truly love thee, and only love thee, and heaven is
in him, because thy love is in him, because thou
lovest him; thy love, O God, being the heaven of
heaven in heaven, the best of heaven.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Do unto me, O God, what thou wilt, and
do but only tell me that thou wilt it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Were I in hell for thy sake, that is absent
from thee, I could and would rejoyce, for it is my

Heaven to please thee, my God, who hast and dost
so much delight me.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Let me be but esteemed in thy eies, Oh my

and I shall not vallue, but contemne all the
ill looks of all others eies.</p>
            <p n="14">14. I had much rather be a <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Job,</hi> or a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi>
then a <hi>Solomon,</hi> be Ignominious all my
days, and honour my God alwayes, then be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
all my days, and dishonour my God but
one day.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Of all afflictions, O God my God, let not
sin be my affliction, afflict me not with sin, for
sin.</p>
            <p n="16">16. A wounded heart, a heart wounded with
sin, who can bear.</p>
            <p n="17">17. What burthen so intolerable heavy as the
burthen of one sin only, if the Lord lift it not up
with one of his fingers.</p>
            <p n="18">18. I ask nothing in Heaven or Earth, but God
in Christ.</p>
            <p n="19">19. God in Christ is all things, for all things
out of Christ is to me nothing, he is my joy and
my Salvation.</p>
            <p n="20">20. I had much rather, me thinks, be ever
afflicted then never afflicted (whilst on earth.)</p>
            <p n="21">21. Though by thy free grace, O God, thou
hast in love and mercy brought me home unto
thee, yet thou hast used affliction as the means,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105293:11"/>
therefore do I love and kiss the Rod, because thou
hast appointed it.</p>
            <p n="22">22. I love affliction, because it was the hand by
which thou did'st O God lead me out of affliction,
that is out of sin.</p>
            <p n="23">23. I love affliction, because by it thou hast
taught me to love thee, yea so to love thee, as I
love nothing in comparison of thee, but all things
in subordination to thee.</p>
            <p n="24">24. I love affliction, because in it I saw thee in
me, and my self in thee.</p>
            <p n="25">25. I love affliction, because by it I saw that
thou did'st love me.</p>
            <p n="26">26. I love affliction, because it taught me to
love thy Statutes, to choose them, imbrace them,
and delight in them.</p>
            <p n="27">27. And I will love affliction, because it will
keep me in the ways of thy Statutes.</p>
            <p n="28">28. I love afflictions, because they are lovely,
and sent from thee the God of Love, to me in
Love.</p>
            <p n="29">29. I Love afflictions, because thou hast sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
them to me, and me by them.</p>
            <p n="30">30. I love affliction, because since that I was
deeply afflicted (for sins) I have not been afflicted
with sins triumph nor raign.</p>
            <p n="31">31. I love afflictions, because thou hast made
them O God, unto me Lovely.</p>
            <p n="32">32. I love afflictions, because thou hast ever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105293:11"/>
sweetned them unto me by Sanctification.</p>
            <p n="33">33. I love afflictions, because by them thou hast
taught me how to bear afflictions.</p>
            <p n="34">34. I love afflictions, because by them thou hast
taught me how to afflict my self, that is my flesh
for sins afflictions.</p>
            <p n="35">35. O my God, give me what afflictions thou
wilt so by them thou suffer me not <hi>to afflict thee,</hi>
who I know, never took'st pleasure to afflict me.</p>
            <p n="36">36. If I had not known afflictions, me thinks I
had never sought to learn to know thee, nor thy
knowledge.</p>
            <p n="37">37. If I had not been undone, I may justly fear
I had been for ever undone.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Give me O Lord, as many sanctified
afflictions as thou pleasest, for then in the mid'st
of them I am sure I shall please thee.</p>
            <p n="39">39. O Lord suffer not any affliction to afflict
me with murmurings or repynings, which I am
sure will <hi>afflict thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="40">40. I desire ever to praise thee O Lord, for
that I never had affliction in the flesh, to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
but it brought me comfort in the
Spirit.</p>
            <p n="41">41. So that I may say (through grace) my
afflictions have been my best and choisest bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
            <p n="42">42. So esteeming them, give me O Lord this
grace, to esteem them as tokens and signs of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105293:12"/>
43. O Lord make me ever thankfull for all
these thy afflictions which deserve so much
thanks.</p>
            <p n="44">44. O Lord I heartily thank thee for that thou
hast made my heart such, as it doth truly thank
thee for them.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Give me grace O Lord to will thy will,
and to submit to all thy <hi>Wills Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="46">46. Ah Lord, give me grace to know thy will,
and a will to learn to know thy grace.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Thy glory is my gloryes end, thy end is my
gloryes aime.</p>
            <p n="48">48. I desire no other honour, O Lord, then to
have the honour to be thy Servant.</p>
            <p n="49">49. I will rejoyce in any Condition, so I may
be in the Condition of thy Servant.</p>
            <p n="50">50. O Lord I am willing to do any work, so it
may be thy work.</p>
            <p n="51">51. Thy glory O Lord is my only longing, my
only joy, delight, desire, aime, and end.</p>
            <p n="52">52. O Lord let me never be ashamed to do thy
work though never so mean in the eies of men,
let it be alwayes beautifull, honourable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to my eies, heart, will, and affections.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Give me Christ, O God, on any terms
and conditions, and I will confess them to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
terms, and conditions advantagious and
glorious.</p>
            <p n="54">54. I had much rather have Communion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105293:12"/>
with Christ (in a dungeon) then be adorned and
ever possess all <hi>Solomons</hi> outward glory in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
            <p n="55">55. Communion with Christ will, I am sure,
make me content in all places and conditions.</p>
            <p n="56">56. In Christ I am sure there is fulness of joy,
and all true peace and comfort, though without
any of all the worlds comforts.</p>
            <p n="57">57. In Christ there is all pleasure, though in
the worlds frowns, disgrace and displeasures.</p>
            <p n="58">58. In Christ there is true light, though in the
worlds dark Dungeons.</p>
            <p n="59">59. Thy smiles O Christ, my Christ, are my
Heaven, and thy frowns let me never know, for I
fear them as the worst of Hell.</p>
            <p n="60">60. Let me enjoy that Heaven, and I care not
for all other Hells.</p>
            <p n="61">61. Ah sweet Jesus, let thy will be my will,
that my will may be always according to thy
will.</p>
            <p n="62">62. Let nothing O Lord satisfie me, but my as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of being in thee, and thou in me.</p>
            <p n="63">63. Let me always O Lord meditate on thy
love and mercyes in loving me.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Ah suffer not any thing in this world of
this world to content or delight me, unless thou
be in it, my sweet Iesus.</p>
            <p n="65">65. O Lord grant that as often as I do sin, I
may sigh and sorrow for sin, and earnestly desire to
sin no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:105293:13"/>
66. Grant that I may set all my affections and
love on thee (my dear Saviour, and Soveraigne
Lord, who art the Fathers glory, the Heaven of
Heaven in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="67">67. Grant O Lord, who art my God, and all
my good, that in all Conditions I may abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejoyce with true contentment, and not at all
to murmur or repine at thy hand, though heavy
on me.</p>
            <p n="68">68. Ah Lord be thou always all my thoughts,
all my joy, and the only and all the rejoycing of
my heart.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Grant that I may always love thee O my
Lord, more then my life, yea then the life, that is,
the Salvation of my Soul.</p>
            <p n="70">70. Grant O Lord, that I may not so much by
much labour for the joyes of Heaven to my self, as
to do thy will on earth in love only to thy self.</p>
            <p n="71">71. Grant O Lord, that all my solace may be
in uprightness of heart to serve thee.</p>
            <p n="72">72. O Lord give me grace, that whilst I am on
earth, I may labour to do thy will, with my whole
will as it is done in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="73">73. Grant O Lord, that I may every day, yet
all the day long have Communion with thee the
Spirit of grace, my sole comforter, and only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p n="74">74. Grant that I may will nothing but thy will,
O thou my Father in Iesus Christ which art in
Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:105293:13"/>
75. I had rather have thy smiles in Hell, O my
sweet and dear Iesus, if it could be, then thy
frowns in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="76">76. I had much rather, if it could be, be in Hell
and obey God, then in Heaven and sin against
him.</p>
            <p n="77">77. O God, give me, I most humbly beseech
thee for Jesus Christ his sake, those things, and
those things only, both for soul and body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on
earth, as may prepare me, and make me fittest for
Heaven.</p>
            <p n="78">78. I had much rather choose death, then
choose to sin.</p>
            <p n="79">79. Though I cannot live without sin here, yet
whilst I live here, suffer me not, O God, at any
time to consent unto sin.</p>
            <p n="80">80. I do beleive that Christ Jesus is my Jesus
and my Christ, and that he makes intercession for
me every moment, and ever will, even to my very
last moment.</p>
            <p n="81">81. I had much rather enjoy affliction with
enjoying thee, O my Saviour, then all manner of
prosperity if thou do'st not prosper it.</p>
            <p n="82">82. As long, O God, as thou givest me bread,
water and grace, I will acknowledge that I have
sufficient, meat, drink and rayment, yea that I
fare delitiously, and am arrayed more gloriously,
then if I were with purple scarlet and fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105293:14"/>
83. To do thy work O God, is the wages I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and which will and shall ever content me.</p>
            <p n="84">84. Ah Lord, I praise thee for that thou hast
given me a heart to be willing to part from all
things most willingly, so I might part from all
sin also.</p>
            <p n="85">85. Dispose of all things as thou wilt, O God,
do but only leave me thy self in possession.</p>
            <p n="86">86. All good thoughts come in love, O God,
from thee, to me, but woe me, miserable me, for
that all evil thoughts come from my self in hatred
to thee.</p>
            <p n="87">87. Good Lord make my heart and all my
thoughts such, that I may be only such, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
such, as thou would'st have me to be.</p>
            <p n="88">88. Do thou, O Christ, live and raigne by thy
power and might in me, that the mighty power
and raigne of sin may be cast out of me.</p>
            <p n="89">89. Let not the things of the world, put thee
O Lord out of my mind, not sin out of my heart
to abhor it.</p>
            <p n="90">90. Give me, O Lord grace and power to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
and cast out all worldly lusts and affections
out of my heart, that there be a place for thee, and
thee only to dwell in, my sweet Jesus.</p>
            <p n="91">91. Grant O Lord, that I may esteem the
worlds gifts without thee my Saviour, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
gifts, that will destroy me.</p>
            <p n="92">92. Grant O Lord, that I may ever beleive and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105293:14"/>
esteem my best duties and performances (as from
my self) to deserve nothing but shame &amp; confusion,
being but as filthy rags, and a menstrous cloath, and
that I am less and less worth at the best, then the
least of all thy mercies.</p>
            <p n="93">93. Nothing but thy blood O Lord, can wash
me, nothing but thy death could satisfie for me,
nothing but thy resurrection can raise me, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thy living, can make me live.</p>
            <p n="94">94. Let thy blessed Ordinances O Lord be
more delightfull to me then my meat and drink,
and sweeter to my tast then the hony and the hony
comb, let them much more please me then the
pleasures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which are but for a season.</p>
            <p n="95">95. I had much rather have nothing of the
world, and hate it, then all the world and love

            <p>AH most blessed, Incomprehensible, and Eternall
Lord God, Glorious in Holiness, fearfull in
Praises, doing wonders; the Heavens are not pure
in thy sight, and yet thou art gratiously pleased in
Jesus Christ to look down, and to dwell in poor man,
who is sinfull Dust and Ashes; thou livest only in
the highest Heavens, and in the lowest hearts, the
one is thy Kingdome of Glory, the other of thy grace,
good Lord make my heart so low in my own esteem, as
it may be so high in thine, that thou may'st make it
thy delight to dwell in it for even; Ah Lord when I
consider all that thou hast done for me, and all that
I have done against thee, I am ashamed, and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
seems to cover my face as a vaile, having, O Lord,
transgrest all thy holy and just Lawes, and broken
wilfully, willingly, knowingly, and presumptuously
all thy Divine Commandements from the first to the
last, from the greatest to the least, as well by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
as Omission, as well by actuall sin, as Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
sin, knowingly as well as ignorantly, both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and willingly on thy dayes, as well as on our
dayes, in thy house as in other houses, in doing thy
work, as in doing my own work, in duties, as well
as out of duties; praying sins, reading sins, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
sins, Sermon sins, and Sacrament sins, so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105293:24"/>
that my repentance must be repented off, and my
Prayers Prayed against, even my sighs and groans
have need of tears to wash them, and my very tears
of doubled tears.</p>
            <p>How Lord have I made thy holy things unholy
unto my self, and turned thy graces into wantonness,
and quencht the motions of thy holy Spirit by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
how Lord have I treasured up wrath against
the day of wrath unto my poor soul, and made thee a
savour of death unto it, when thou comest as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of life; how have I, Lord, hated to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and turned from thee when thou camest running
towards me in love and in mercy; how have I cast
thy promises behind my back, and trampled thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
under my feet; how many times have I bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
my Promises, Vows, and Covenants made with
thee in my straights, with how much more eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and earnestness, have I served my sinfull Lusts
(then thee) in thy services, my good Lord God; and
how much more pains have I taken for earthly things
then for Heavenly; how much more delightsome
have these things below, and the remembrance of
them (been unto me) then the things above; how
much sweeter hath sin been to me then grace, and how
have I bent my will against thy great and holy will
in all things; how willingly and how fast, O Lord,
did I run in the wayes of Eternal destruction; and
how, good Lord, have I vehemently delighted and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured,
to make others to commit the same sins, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105293:24"/>
to do the same things; how easily, and how willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did I believe the suggestions of the Devil, and
with what willingness have I left thy work, and
how often, good Lord, to do his, nay, which is yet
worse; how often have I tempted him the tempter
to tempt me unto sin, when I knew <hi>that the wages
of sin was death,</hi> even Temporal, Spiritual, and
Eternall, for body and soul, doing my very utmost to
destroy both.</p>
            <p>But what, O Lord, are all these sins, to those I

loving, and most mercifull Father, in Jesus
Christ (restrained me) and come in continually unto

when I did my utmost to run from thee; thou did'st,
O Lord, continue knocking, when I would not open to
thee, and wert'st contented, such was thy endearing
loving love unto me, to stand at the dore of my heart

not this enough to cause all the Creatures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

and astonishment to admire the condescention of so
great a God as thou art.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord God, what could I more desire, nay what
could'st thou do more for me then thou hast done, to
bring me out of the death of sin to the life of grace,
out of the suburbs of Hell, into the suburbs of
Heaven; me thinks, Ah me thinks, I may truly say,
out of Hell it self, into Heaven it self; such a vast
difference there is, such a blessed and glorious change
there is already, blessed and ever magnified, and
praised be thy ever blessed, great and most glorious
name of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> my strength and my Portion.</p>
            <p>Thou hast not only, O Lord, delivered me out of
the pawes of that rearing Lyon (the Devil) who
had almost devoured me, but hast given me of thine

malice, and the wickedness, and the deceitfulness of
my own deceitfull wicked heart that did thus betray
me.</p>

            <p>Ah Lord God, good as great, and great as good, when
wilt thou by thine Almighty power utterly destroy
and root out all sin out of me, when shall the time, O
Lord, come, that it shall be Crucified unto me and I

persecuted, banisht, evil spoken off, torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

            <p n="73">73. It is not, Lord, what I desire only, but what
thou hast ordained, that I only desire.</p>
            <p n="74">74. I know and am assured, that thou wilt, O
Lord, sooner cast the earth into the Sea, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

those whom thou lovest.</p>
            <p n="75">75. For seeing sin (cannot) nor shall not, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
us, Lord, what shall, what can.</p>
            <p n="76">76. It is fixt on thy own love, O Father, in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:105293:35"/>
77. It is from thy great Love, O my God, that
I find thee lovely, but thy love is greater, for that
I love thee, and yet more greater that I love thee
only, but more greater then all, it is, that thou hast
ever loved, and wilt ever love me.</p>
            <p n="78">78. Ah love that passeth all degree, the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p n="79">79. It is thy mercy, O God, that I am not past

mercy, that I value mercy, that I prize mercy,
that I seek mercy, that I hope for mercy, am assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of mercy, and that I desire the same mercyes
for all others that are not past mercy.</p>
            <p n="80">80. To will thy will, O God, is to do thy will,
when we would as willingly do it (be it what it
will) as we will it.</p>
            <p n="81">81. To serve thee best and most, or to do thee,
O God, most and best service, is in most submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

            <p n="82">82. It is not the work of the hand, or of the

the maker, and the giver of all good hearts.</p>

            <p n="86">86. Ah Lord, my Lord, if thou did'st not at

should I afflict thee.</p>
            <p n="87">87. But I mightily desire to magnifie &amp; praise
thee, O my God, for that I find when affliction
comes on me, thou comest with it, and dost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
abundantly comfort me, yea my greatest
comforts have been, when thou seemest as if thou
would'st afflict me, that is even in affliction.</p>
            <p n="88">88. If affliction should goe from me, I fear I
should goe from all good, which is from God.</p>
            <p n="89">89. Afflict me, O Lord, so much as thou wilt,
and so often as thou pleasest, so that in it, I afflict

Lord, I consess I am careless, Ah too too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
            <p n="91">91. Affliction makes me, O Lord, to run to

            <p n="92">92. If the outward man receive such joy and

them, Ah what joy, delight and ravishment doth
the inward man receive, having Communion with
God, and enjoying his deare Creator.</p>
            <p n="93">93. If earth, and the things below, be able to

above, shall be able, and will satisfie all, for every
one there shall enjoy God, who is all, and in
all.</p>
            <p n="94">94. Seeing Heaven on earth is so sweet, Ah
how sweet is Heaven in Heaven, or the Heaven of
Heaven, which is our God.</p>
            <p n="95">95. And seeing Heavens joyes are so great on
earth, Ah how greatly great are they in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="96">96. Ah sweet, most ravishing sweet Jesus, let
me enjoy them so here, that I may long to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and to be in Heaven to enjoy them there,
Ah to enjoy thee, thee, there.</p>
            <p n="97">97. Seeing one drop or tast of them is so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
Ah how delitiously, and delightfully are
they fed, that feed on them continually, and shall
feed on them for ever and ever.</p>
            <p n="98">98. Grant, O my God, that sins sweets, be to

that I may alwayes prefer Heavens bitterest, to
sins sweetest, and never to find any sweet in the
sweets of sin.</p>
            <p n="99">99. I had rather see Christ with spirituall eyes,
then in the flesh, with the eyes of the flesh, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105293:36"/>
to have him in my heart then in my arms.</p>
            <p n="100">100. Christ only can make us spiritually hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and he only can feed us with the bread of life,
from him we have our spirituall thirsting, and he,
he only can give us to drink of those living waters,
the fountaine of life, being in him only.</p>
            <p n="101">101. Were there as many worlds to be offered
me, as there would be minutes from Eternity to

not, give my hope, and my interest in my Jesus,
to enjoy all their riches, honours, and pleasures,
unto all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="102">102. For by how much he is above all things,
and more worth then all things, by so much, yet
by so much more, do I value my interest in him
above all things, for all things to God, can be fitly
compared to nothing, but to nothing.</p>
            <p n="103">103. For God is all things, and I am sure of
him, and therefore I have all things sure.</p>
            <p n="104">104. He that believes in Christ, loves him,
and he that loves him, fears him, and he that fears
him, obeys him, and he that loves, fears, obeys,
and believes in him, must and will walk as he
walked.</p>
            <p n="105">105. We can both will and do our own wills,
which are evil, but we can neither will nor do thy
will, O God, which is all and only good.</p>
            <p n="106">106. Give me then grace, O God, the God, and
giver of all grace, to deny my own will, to hate and

forsake my own will, that I wholly and perfectly
do thy perfect and holy will.</p>

that thy holy will be do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

that I may please thy self, for without thee, I shall
be still my self, and displeasing still to thee.</p>
            <p n="109">109. For I am all evil, and thou, O God, art all

thou my God, that can'st do all things, turn my
evil unto good, that my Hell may be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

man hath a double fear, till he have perfect love,
that casteth out all fear.</p>
            <p n="111">111. Fear causeth me to doubt, and fear caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

bringeth me joy, fear casteth me down to Hell,
and fear raiseth me up to Heaven, fear causeth me
to distrust, and fear causeth me to trust, fear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights
me with sadness, and fear comforts me
with rejoycings, for if I did not fear, I might justly
be afraid, if I did not fear the want of grace, I
might justly fear I had no grace, if I did not fear
falling, I fear I should fall indeed; But though
through fear I am many times afraid, yet I would

not be without fear, though I should be alwayes
afraid, for fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> causeth me to put away fear, and
not to fear fear, nor to be afraid of fear, through
fear I trust, I beleive, I rejoyce, and I hope I shall
be for ever brought out, and freed from all fear.</p>

I may be faithfull even unto the death, and then
for ever to enjoy thy gratious promise of that

            <p n="114">114. Make me faithfully obedient unto thee in

            <p n="115">115. Any thing of all that man can do, (as

God doth, man should accept, and likewise know
and beleive, that he doth all things, and therefore

            <p n="116">116. Mans best all, all mans best, is worse then

all that I would have; But Ah, when I want thee,

that thou abidest and dwellest in me, so that all

            <p>O God, I know that thou do'st all that thou

for all our springs are in thee, and from thee.</p>
            <p>And now, O Lord God, I come at this time
before thee to speak a word unto thee, but I find
my self as unable as unfit, and as unfit, as unable,
being empty of all good, and full fit, and ready,
for any, or all evils, such, O Lord, thou knowest, is
my wretched and miserable nature, averse unto all
that is good, and prone unto all that is evil, but
thou, O my God, in Jesus Christ, that art all good,

beseech thee, my empty heart, with thy self, even
with thy fulness, that I may speak unto thee thine
own words, and not mine own, for mine own
words, would be but words, but meer words, but
thy words, even thine, O God, are works, and
work I know effectually: thou do'st not here us for
our words sake, because they are but the words of
men, nor for our works sake, because they are but
mens works, nor for our own sake, because we
have forsaken thee, but for thy great names sake,
O Lord, which is thy self, and therefore for thine
own sake thou hearest us.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord God, let me then so heare thy voyce
as my soul may live, and so live as to praise thee,

forthwith come out of my self, flye from my self,
hate, loath, and abhor my self, in dust and ashes,
cause me, O Lord, to consider my self as indeed I
am, which is a little creeping clay, speaking earth,
a worme, and no man, vile, sinful, wretched, and
abominable from the Crown of the head, to the

thou hast so great a skill, that if thou wilt, thou

that thou wilt dwell and delight to dwell in such

power of thy goodness, and the working of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit in their hearts, that nothing is hard for
thee, O God, to do: but all things are as easie as
possible, thou bringest light out of darkness, and
turnest evil into good, with the word of thy mouth,
for he is only worthy, whom thou in favour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countest
worthy.</p>
            <p>Seeing then, O Lord God, that it is thy good will
and pleasure, to do so much for me as thou canst
do, which is to give me thine own self, be thou,
Ah be thou pleased in the riches of thy mercy and

O Lord, for this thy great gift, but as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,
that I have received so great a gift
from thee, and that therefore I am no longer, nor
no more, mine own, nor any others either in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

thine all, and I most humbly, and most unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Jesus Christ, that it may so continue, and be, unto
all Eternity, and that I may not henceforth, think,
speak, or do, any thing by my self, from my self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,

Ah most glorious Lord God, who art thus

thy glory, or thee, O Lord, the Lord of all glory,
I confess and acknowledge, that I am not able of
my self, to know my self, my vileness, wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
emptiness, and nothingness, how then, O
Lord, am I able to know thee, or to consider
thee as thou art in thy self, and how much thy
goodness exceeds my badness, thy wisdome my
folly, thy strength my weakness, thy fulness my
emptiness, thine Almightiness my nothingness,
and yet how content am I, though nothing, or
less worth then nothing, yea to be turned even
into nothing for thy sake.</p>
            <p>But seeing, O Lord, thou hast in thy great
goodness, love, and mercy, made me thine, make
me now, O Lord, even what thou wilt, and send
me whether thou wilt, I am ready and willing to
to goe, and be, and do, and suffer, yea to spend,
and to be spent for thee, for thou knowest, O
Lord God, if I desire to live, it is to live to thee,
in thee, and for thee, to praise thee, and for thy
praise, for to praise thee is to live, and this to do
only, is the only desire I have to live, for when I
have thee, Lord, I have all that I desire and crave,
thy presence being my Heaven on earth, and thy
absence my Hell; having thee, O Lord, I have
my all, but wanting thee, I want all that I would
have, thou only art able to content, to satisfie,

Ah Lord God, make me willing to give my self up
unto thee that did'st so willingly give up thy self
for me, and to be made like unto me, that I might
be made like unto thee, thou rejoyced'st, O Lord,

up from earth into Heaven, to live a mortall life
on earth, that I might live an immortal life in
Heaven, to dye on earth, to free me from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
death, and to give me Eternal life; thou wert,
O Lord, made subject to all infirmities on earth,
to confirme and make me for ever free from
them, in Heaven, seeing then, thou wert, O Lord,
willing to come to me in blood, even through
thine own blood, to wash me out of my blood,
and to make me for ever clean; Ah Lord, wash
not my hands and my feet only, but my head and
my heart also, even my bloody heart, that hath
delighted so much, and so often, to make thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
heart to bleed, yea to shed the last drop

            <p>Thou would'st, O Christ, thou would'st ware

that I might weare a glorious Crown of glory

of love, that such a God would be thus wounded
to heal such a man as I am, thus accurst to make
me blest, thus bound to make me free, thus made

love thee, fear to fear thee, faith to beleive in thee,
to depend on thee, and to rowle my self upon
thee, hope to trust in thee, and joy to rejoyce in

all my self, and though I do, I confess, already
own thee mine all, yet I would willingly owe thee

yet I desire, and heartily desire to owe thee more,
to be more indebted unto thee, for I delight to
be thy great debtor, yea and would be thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and so I confess I should be, though thou
shouldest neither give, nor forgive, me any more,
then thou hast already forgiven, and given me;
Ah Lord, I know, that for all thy gifts of grace,
mercy, pardon, and forgiveness, that thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectest
only an acknowledgment, that I am thine

            <p>Let thy word, O God, feed me, yea let me feast

not grow weary, and walk, and not faint; O

            <p>I do most unfeignedly confess, O Lord, that I
am unable and unfit to speak unto thee, and as
unworthy to hear thee, speak unto me, for in me,
that is in my flesh, there is no good, I am all evil,
only evil, and continually evil, but in thee, O God,
dwelleth all good, for thou art all good, only
good, and continually dost good, without thee I
can say nothing, think nothing, nor do nothing
that is good; suffer me not therefore, O Lord, I
beseech thee, to speak in my own wisdome, for
that would be but the wisdome of words; but let
me, O Lord, speak in thy wisdome, which will be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105293:49"/>
the words of wisdome, <hi>and Wisdoms words:</hi> Let
me not, O Lord, go forth in my own strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

let thy strength, thy power, thy might, and thy

me, and by thy power, powerfully working in
me, I may overcome and trample under my feet,
all the strength and power of all my adversaries
and enemies, Devils lusts, worlds lusts, and self
lusts.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord God, suffer me not to goe from thee,
for thou hast the words of Eternal life, thou art
the word, and the life, yea, Eternal life, he that
hath thee, hath life, and shall not see death, nor
tast of death, because he is past from death to life,
but he that hath not thee, O Lord Christ, is dead
already, because he liveth in sin, for he that liveth
in sin, is dead, though he liveth.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord, I confess that the Well of thy mercy
is much deeper then <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well, and yet sure I
am that such Children, yea such Infants as I am,
can draw water from thence, even the water of
life, even such water as giveth another life, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life, which is an immortal and eternal life, a
life that shall never see death, being hid with
Christ in God.</p>
            <p>Ah sweet Jesus, let me have thee in my heart,
which is much better then to have thee as <hi>Simeon</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:105293:49"/>
had in his armes my armes might let thee fall out

much rather see thee with the eyes of true saving
faith, then of sence, or with the eyes of the flesh,
for thine Enemyes, O Lord, saw thee with flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eyes, and yet hated thee, spit on thee, reviled
and mocked thee, whipped thee, persecuted thee,
and crucified thee, bearing false witness against
thee, and believed not in thee, notwithstanding all
the miracles that thou did'st, but all those that see
thee, O Lord, by the eyes of faith, will believe
in thee, and say of thee, unto thee, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did,
my Lord, and my God, they will so love thee, as
they will Crucific themselves and their bosome
sins, hate themselves, and their own wayes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
themselves, and Crucifie all their own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
fleshly, worldly, devilish lusts and affections,
and live as new Creatures, in the world, as if they

O Lord, perfect that good work of grace, which

and is past from death, death hath no more domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over him, but he that hath thee not, is dead,
though he liveth, for he that is in thee, O Lord, is
from all sin free, he that is born of thee, O God,
sinneth not, sin hath no more dominion over him,
because thy seed of holiness, which is sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
remaineth in him, such a one hath overcome
the world, and that wicked one, with all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
of the Kingdome of darkness, sin, Hell, death,
and the Devil, he that is in Christ, is Crucified to
the world, and the world unto him, he is departed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105293:58"/>
from all iniquity, he hath Crucified the flesh with
the lusts and affections thereof, he maketh no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
provision for the flesh to satisfie its lusts, for
they know that his Servants they are whom they
obey, whether of sin unto death, or of Obedience
unto Righteousness.</p>
            <p>Ah blessed, ever blessed, and only blessed and
happy condition, to be thus born againe of God,
and to sin no more, to be a member of Christs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
body, bone of his bone, and flesh of his
flesh, such shall be as assuredly, members of his
glorious body, for they that are betrothed unto
him here by grace, shall be hereafter marryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him in glory.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord God, I am sure thou knowest my
heart, and that though it is not what it would be;
or should be, yet thou hast, (for which I desire ever
to praise thee) in grace, and mercy, made it such,
as it heartily desireth and longeth to be what it
should be, but, O Lord, I know, that here is no
perfection, and that therefore it cannot be here;
Ah Lord, I most humbly beseech thee in Jesus
Christ, in thine own good, due and appointed time,
bring me home to that long wished for, and bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
home, that I may be ever blessed in thee, and
with thee, who art God blessed for ever, and
ever.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord my Lord, thou knowest how willing I
am to leave all for thee, loose all to enjoy thee,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105293:58"/>
trample all under my feet, and hate all for thy sake,
yea, spend and be spent for thee, and to follow
thee the Lamb of Righteousness in all places whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou wilt goe, even as a Chast Wife giveth
her self unto her Husband, and delighteth to love,
honour, and obey him, and longeth for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
when he is absent, that she may lye in his
bosome, and be imbraced in his armes, esteeming
all things toys, and trash, to his love, even so Lord,
thou knowest that my heart desireth and longeth
to be espoused unto thee in Heaven, made one
with thee, knit and glued unto thee, that I may be
thine for ever, and be imbraced in thine armes,
and lye in thy bosome, living as thine, and thine
only, unspotted and unblameable, holy, O Lord,
as thou art holy.</p>
            <p>Heaven, O Lord, is Heaven, because it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yea, because thou art there that art holiness,
therefore, yea, therefore is Heaven Heaven, and
Heaven holy, and such a holy Heaven as it is, so
those that are there a thousand years, seems but as
one day, so sweet is its enjoyment, and one day
seemes as a thousand years, so great is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of enjoyment, and therefore, O Lord, and to
praise thee, do I long to be dissolved from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of sin which is death, that I may live in thee,
and with thee in holiness, which is Eternal life,
for this, O Lord, thou hast taught me to know, and
therefore my soul rejoyceth, that holiness is the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105293:59"/>
only felicity and chief happiness in Heaven, for
that makes us only like unto thee, who art the
Heaven of Heaven, in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Grant therefore, O my God, in Christ, and for
his sake, that I may, whil'st here below in the flesh
on earth, seek after, labour for, and endeavour to
obtaine that measure and degree of holiness, that
my earthly Heaven may be a Heaven in part,
though not a perfect Heaven, and that I may from
day, to day, grow and increase, from one degree
of grace unto another, until I com to enjoy that
measure and fulness, that thou hast, O Lord my
God, in the infinitness and Eternity of thy love,
goodness, and mercy, through thy free grace in
Jesus Christ, reserved, provided and appointed
for me, out of thine own abundant and overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fulness, for with thee is fulness of joy, and at
thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord, for thy mercyes sake bring me unto
that fulness, that I may for ever rejoyce in that joy
which bringeth such peace as passeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
which eye hath not seen, eare hath not
heard, neither hath it ever entred into the heart of
man to conceive; Ah Lord, bring me into that
Heaven, and in the mean time let Heaven be in
me, for holiness is Heaven, and Heaven is holiness,
therefore the more holiness is in us, the more
Heaven is in us, yea, the happiness in Heaven,
which is God himself, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, threepersons, but one God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:105293:59"/>
Grant O Lord, I most humbly beseech thee,
that I may do the work of my generation and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
calling, prudently, wisely, justly, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,
faithfully, obediently; circumspectly,
cheerfully, willingly, and perseveringly, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, O God, and before all men, giving eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man his due, and doing unto all men as I would
they should do unto me, without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and let me alwaies value and esteem these
things below, as low things, as temporal inferior
good things, as common mercies, of the left-hand,
of the foot-stool, the nether Springs, even such
O Lord as thou givest unto all, even unto the evil,
and wicked, as well as unto the good and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as thou makest the Sun to shine, and the rain
to fall, alike on all, it being no token either of thy
hatred, or of thy love.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore O Lord, have power through
grace, to use them as if I used them not, and to
live in this World, as if I were not of this World,
making no provision for the flesh to satisfie
the lusts thereof, but that I may overcome the
World, by despising of it, And give me not the
things of the World, O Lord I beseech thee, till
thou hast given me a heart, to use them according
to thine own heart, even as liketh thee best, and
grant O Lord, that I may be alwaies as willing to
leave them, as to receive them, and to give them
back unto thee when thou pleasest, and in thine
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105293:60"/>
own way, as thine O Lord, and not as mine, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thee for the leaving them with me any time,
but most especially for the well using of them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that time, considering that their well using
will turn to my Eternal profit, and their abusing
of them to my Eternal losse: Ah Lord let the eies
of my understanding be enlightened, and alwaies
open, to see the many perils and dangers in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
them, as well as their nothingnesse, whilst
I shall possesse them, and that worldly blisse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
more in possessing of little void of fears, than
of much subject unto danger, and that it's much
the sweeter condition, to want the Worlds sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than to have them, if in their want we find
no want, and to esteem alwaies that best which
God giveth, because he having promised will
make it work for the best, come on me then what
will come, I doubt not Lord, but I shall find it as
I have hitherto found it, to be for my good, and
coming from a God of Love to me in love, and
therefore O Lord, I will love both thee and it,
and esteem every change the best change, yea and
a changing for the best, and if at any time my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
should not please the flesh, sure I am it will
alwaies please the Spirit, if it please not at any
time the outward, it will alwaies please the inward
man, if it please not the old man without, it will
please the new man within; for, Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
if my condition should at any time displease
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105293:60"/>
me, and I could change it, yet I would not, if by
so doing I should displease thee; for thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
I desire to please thee, not my self, the Spirit
not the flesh, the inward not the outward man,
the New not the old man, for I would not have
what I would, but O Lord, that only that thou
wilt, be it what ever it will, deny me not, O Lord,
I most humbly, most earnestly, and most unfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
beg, and beseech thee, in Jesus Christ, for
thine own dear and holy names sake, deny me not
this one thing, what ever it cost me, but let my
life, and my death, my place of abode, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be such as may, O Lord, bring thee most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as may glorifie thee most, O God of all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Glory.</p>
            <p>And that Seeing I served thee not, O God,
my Creator, in the daies of my youth, grant I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, that I may serve thee freely, cheerfully,
willingly, and joyfully, all the rest of my daies,
unto the very last hower of my life, that I may
henceforth live the life of the righteous, and that
my last end may be like his, Ah Lord, let all the
rest of my life to come be so spent, as it may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
a continual sorrow for my life past, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lived here in thy fear, I may dye, O Lord, my
God in thy favour, that having lived here the life
of Grace, I may ever hereafter live with thee O my
sweet Iesus, the life of Glory, in thy Kingdom of
Glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:105293:61"/>
O Lord that triest the heart and searchest the
reigns! thou knowest all my thoughts, as well as
ponderest all my actions, and therefore thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
how much my heart rejoyceth, because that
thou thus knowest it, and because thou hast made
it such as it is; not that it is, O Lord, as it would
or should be, but because it willingly would be
what it should be; and that it would do, and be,
as willingly any thing that it wills, as it wills it;
So it be O Lord God according to thy most holy,
righteous, good and blessed will.</p>
            <p>And now, O Lord God Almighty, maker, giver,
and preserver of all things; I most humbly beseech
thee to hear me in Jesus Christ, for all Kingdoms,
Nations, and People, in general; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
over the face of the whole earth; gather O
Lord in much mercy, gather thine Elect together
from all the ends and corners of the World; Jew,
and Gentile, Turk, and Infidel, bond, and free,
male, and female, young, and old, rich, and poor;
Ah Lord be thou pleased, in the greatnesse of thy
compassions, to pour out thy Holy Spirit upon all
flesh, and write thy holy Laws of Grace, in their
hearts, and thy Statutes of fear in their minds, by
the finger of thine Holy Spirit, that every one
may know who is the Lord, and the power of his
might, that all flesh may be converted and brought
home unto thee, that their fouls may live and not
die eternally.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:105293:61"/>
Remember, O Lord God, thine ancient Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>Abraham</hi> thy Friend, and pity our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sister the Jews; suffer them not, Ah Lord!
suffer them not, longer to wander as sheep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Shepherd, but bring them home, Ah Lord,
bring them home to thy fold and to thy flock, and
be thou the Shepherd and life of their Souls; Open,
O Lord, the eies of their understanding, that they
may know thee the true God, and Iesus Christ,
whom thou hast sent, that they may behold him
whom they have crucified by their sins, and may
mourn as one mourneth for his only son, and be
in bitternesse as for a first-born; have they stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that they should fall? (God forbid) but rather
through their fall Salvation is come unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
for to provoke them unto Jealousie; Now
if the fall of them be the riches of the World, and
the diminishing the riches of the Gentiles: how
much more, O Lord, their fulnesse; and if the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
away of them be the reconciling of the
World, what shall the receiving of them be, but
life from the dead? for if the first fruit be holy, the
lump is also holy; and if the root be holy so are
the branches; because of unbelief they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off; and if they abide nor still in unbelief,
hast thou not promised, O God, to graft them in
again? and seeing thou wert O Lord, pleased to
graft us into the good Olive-tree, that were wild by
nature; Ah when; Ah Lord when wilt thou grast
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105293:62"/>
in again these into their own Olive tree, which be
the natural branches; for blindnesse is happened
to <hi>Israel,</hi> until the fulnesse of the Gentiles be come
in, and so all <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved; as concerning
the Gospel, they are Enemies for our sakes; but as
touching the Election, they are beloved for the
Fathers sake; for the gifts and calling of God are
without repentance, bring in then, O Lord, bring in
then the fulnessse of us the Gentiles, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of shine Elect may be accomplished, and that
man of fin destroyed, with an utter, total, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
destruction.</p>
            <p>Break, O Lord, the power of the Turk, and all
thy Churches adversaries; destroy the pride of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and root out Antichrist, O Lord, I beseech
thee, out of all our hearts; and permit not that
any of thy children be led away by Errors, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
Sects, or any false worship; but let thy
Word O Lord, and Gospel, be preached and
taught throughout the whole Earth, in purity and
sincerity, as thy Word, and with the powerful as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of thine own Holy Spirit; Ah Lord, cause
it to work efficaciously on the hearts of all hearers,
that they may hear it with fear and trembling,
even as thine own Word, and by it be convinct of
sin, of righteousnesse, and of Judgment, and to
this end, O Lord God, be thou pleased to give a
double portion of thy Holy Spirit unto all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
ther of, that they may preach it in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105293:62"/>
power of the Holy Ghost, not fearing the face of
men, being confidently assured, that their work
and labour, shall not be in vain in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord in much mercy propagate thy Gospel
where it is planted, and be thou pleased to plant
it where it is not; and send forth faithful Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
into thy Vineyard and harvest; for thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
O Lord God, that the Harvest is great, but the
Labourers are few. Ah Lord, suffer not, I most
humbly beseech thee in Iesus Christ, that the wild
Boar of the wood pluck up the roots, nor the little
Foxes to cut off the branches; but blast, O Lord,
all the designs and machinations, that are any
where hatching against thy Church and People,
and bring them to nought, and cause their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which are thy Enemies, to fall into the
Pits and snares which they have laid for them: do
good, O Lord, to thy Sion, and build up the walls
of thy <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> do thine own work in thine
own good, due, and appointed time, and let thine
own arm, O Lord, bring us Salvation.</p>
            <p>In a more particular and most special manner,
O Lord, I humbly beseech thee in Iesus Christ,
be mindful, and have mercy upon the Land of my
Nativity; Pardon O Lord, the Nation, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sins thereof, past, present, and to come, of
Magistrates, Ministers and People; our sins, O
Lord, of blood, our sins of unthankfulnesse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
and rebellion against thee our God;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105293:63"/>
our sins of covetousnesse, which is Idolatry; our
sins of pride, and hypocrisie; of self-love, and
hatred of out brethren; our sins of gluttony, and
drunkennesse; of uncleannesse, of malice, wrath,
and revenge; our sins of profanation, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
our sins of blasphemy, and toleration, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganst
thy self O God, and Christ; against thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Law, and Gospel; O God, that art the Iudg
of Heaven, and of Earth, pardon, O Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
I humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
sins, for they are many, for they are great,
and enter into a Covenant with them, and be thou
their God, and make them thy people, that
they may serve thee for ever, and for ever;
and thou maiest henceforth delight in them, to
live amongst them, and never more to be wrath
with them. Settle, O Lord, I beseech thee, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Magistracy over us; Iudges as at the first, and
Counsellors as in the beginning; that Iustice may
run down our streets as a mighty river, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
as a great stream, that the cause of the
poor, the Widow, and the Orphane may be
heard, and Iustice done without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
that there be no cries in our Land, nor no
complaining in our streets; Give O Lord, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Zeal, Courage, and Faithfulnesse unto all
the Ministers thereof, that they may not seek the
praise of men, but the praise, honour, and glory,
of thee our God, and that they may be ready and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105293:63"/>
willing to lay down their lives for the truth,
and be faithful unto the death, choosing rather,
much rather, affliction and persecution for thy sake,
and the Gospels, then to dwell in the Tabernacles
of the wicked, and to serve the lusts of men, and
to this end, O Lord God, give them I humbly
pray thee a double Portion of thy holy Spirit,
which thou gavest unto thy faithful Servant <hi>Elias,</hi>
to lead, guide, govern, and direct them, in the
wayes of all truth and Righteousness, that they
may not at all fear him, which can only kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but him (which is thy self) O Lord, who having
killed the body, can'st cast the soul into Hell; O
Lord, open their eyes, that they may see thee and
thy strength and power on their side, and therefore
may not fear the power, nor the policy of their
Enemyes, how great soever it be to the eyes of
men, for they are but men, meer men, whose
breath is in their Nostrils, a little creeping clay,
speaking earth, Wormes of six foot long, whose
hearts thou turnest as the rivers of waters, and
changest them as thou pleasest, and that nothing
is, or can be done by them, but what thou pleasest,
and sufferest to be done, cause them, and all thy
people to know, that having thee on their side, and
for them, they need not fear who be against them,
for none ever fought against thy power and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
and that though thou dost usually use means,
yet thou canst, O God, we know, (if thou so
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105293:64"/>
pleasest) do thy work without meanes, yea and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
meanes, and that there is no meanes so
contemptable but thou canst, O God, our God,
make effctual, even to the pulling down of strong
holds, as thou did'st the Walls of <hi>Jerico,</hi> at the
noyse of Rams Horns; it is as easie with thee to
do what thou willest, as to will it, all things are as
easie as possible; let us not then, O God, fear any
power, no nor all powers, having thee the Lord
for our God, before whom all the Nations of the
earth, are as the drop of a bucket, and as the dust of
the ballance, thou holdest, O God, the Ocean in
the hollow of thine hand, and the earth is upheld,
and standeth fast by the power of thy might, give
us then, O Lord God, such fear as may cause us to
love thee, and such love as may cast out and destroy
all fear, for thou only, who art God only, art to be
feared only.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord, look down gratiously, and in mercy,
upon poor afflicted <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> stir up thy
self, and come and save them, even now, now,
when there is no help for them nigh at hand; O
Lord, be thou their help, and help thou them, and
give them grace to put their trust in thee, that thou
mayest be their help and deliverer: of three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
make us, O Lord, one people, that we may be
knit together with the bonds of love and unity,
serving thee, O Lord, with a perfect heart in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Righteousness, all the dayes of our lives,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105293:64"/>
and though, O Lord, thou hast delivered them into
our hands, and given us power over them; Ah
Lord, suffer us not to do other unto them, then we
would they should do unto us, and that we lay not
on them too heavy burthens to bear.</p>
            <p>Bless, O Lord, I beseech thee, all my kindred
and acquaintance in the flesh. Ah Lord, I know
that thou knowest all their soul and body cases;
Ah be thou pleased in Jesus Christ, to come into
their help, and give them deliverance, make, O
Lord, make their hearts below their conditions,
and then make their conditions what thou wilt,
lay no more, O Lord, on them, then thou shalt be
pleased to inable them to bear, and then lay on
them what thou wilt; Ah Lord, cause every thing
to work together for their good, let them alwayes
see, and acknowledge, that thou punishest them
for less then their iniquities deserve, and that all
afflictions whatsoever come from thee, but the
procuring cause is in themselves, make them, O
Lord, as willing to weare the Cross here, as the
Crown hereafter, to suffer for thee here, as to
raigne with thee hereafter, and though, O Lord,
they be poor in the world, let them be rich in
grace; though they be contemptible in the world;
let them be honourable in thy sight; be thou, O,
Lord, their Portion, and make them thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and grant, O Lord, I beseech thee, that their
last dayes may be their best dayes, and their last
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105293:65"/>
thoughts their best thoughts, that they may be thy
faithful, humble, and obedient Servants, unto their
lives end; living the lives of the Righteous, that
they may be like them both in death, and after
death, be thou with them, O Lord, in all places,
and at all times, that they may alwayes sit under
the shadows of thy wings, and that the fruit of thy
word may be pleasant unto the tast of their souls;
let them through grace delight to walk in the
wayes of thy Statutes, and let thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be their daily talk; suffer them not, O
Lord, to goe astray from thee, either after the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
or profits of the world, but inable them all
through grace to walk uprightly and circumspectly
before thee unto their lives end.</p>
            <p>Be mindful and merciful, O Lord, unto all the
Sons and Daughters of affliction wheresoever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'st,
wheresoever scattered on the face of the

deliver all Captives, and set free all Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that every one may sit under his Vine, and
rejoyce under his Fig-Tree, eating in peace the
fruits of their labours; visit, O Lord, the sick,
comfort the comfortless, bind up the broken heart,
heal the wounded heart, give life to the dead heart,
give the grace of faith unto the doubting heart,
and of hope unto the despairing heart, speak peace
O Lord, unto the disconsolated and afflicted heart,
give understanding, memory, sence, and reason,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105293:65"/>
unto the distracted heart, and those amongst them,
whom thou dost intend, O Lord, and hast appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take unto thy self, let them see thine arms of
love, in mercy, open and ready to receive them; let
them hear, O Lord, thy sweet and comfortable
voyce, speaking peace unto their fouls, and saying,
Sons, and Daughters be of good cheer, your sins
are forgiven you; wash them, O Lord, with thy
most dear, and most pretious blood, and sanctifie
them with thy holy spirit of grace, that they may
appear spotless, and unblameable before thee,
whiter then Snow, <hi>purer then Wooll,</hi> finer the
Gold, and brighter then the Sun, and make them,
O Lord, more then Conquerors: and those, O
Lord, whom thou dost intend to restore unto their
former health and strength, give them grace to
lead new lives, and to become new Creatures, that
others seeing their good works, may glorifie thee,
O God, our Heavenly Father, in Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord God, look with much mercy I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beseech thee, upon all those every where, that
suffer for the peace of a good Conscience, because
they will not sin against thy truth, keep them, O
Lord, as the apple of thine eye, that nothing come
nigh to hurt them, nor to affright them; let them
depend on thy mercyes, fear thy judgments, and
lay hold on thy gratious promises, give them, O
Lord, courage and strength to fight that good fight,
and to run that good race that thou hast set before
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105293:66"/>
them, that they may be alwayes willing and ready
to give up their lives unto the death, and then from
thee, O Lord, they may receive the Crown of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life.</p>
            <p>And those, O Lord, that suffer for an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
because they have sinned against thy truth,
let them not alwayes mourn as men and women
without hope, but poure down, O Lord, in much

            <p>Bless, O Lord, all that are travelling by Sea, or

            <p>And lastly, O Lord, I most humbly and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beg and beseech thee in Jesus Christ, to pardon
and forgive all mine Enemies, all the world over;
love them, O Lord, that hate me, bless them that
curse me, do good to them that seek to do me evil,
forget and forgive all that they have done or would
have done against me, &amp; change their hearts from
evil unto good, that they may no longer walk after
the deceitfulness of their own evil hearts, but may
do all things for the time to come in truth and
sincerity, according to thine own heart, O Lord
God, that thou mayest own them for thy own, and
give them hearts, O Lord, to forgive me whom I
have wronged, whether it have been in thought,
word, or deed, either unto high or low, rich or
poor, young or old, and grant, O Lord, that I may
fear and do so no more, but as thou hast been unto
me a sin-pardoning God, so I beseech thee be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me a sin-preventing God, that I may not as the
Dog, return to his Vomit, nor as the Sow to her
wallowing in the mire againe, but that I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
henceforth set thee, O Lord, before mine
eyes, and be attent unto the motions of thy holy
spirit, and never to forget thy exceeding bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and mercyful dealings towards me, and that
love in Jesus Christ, wherewith thou hast loved me,
and that I may remember that it is impossible for
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105293:67"/>
those who were once enlightned, and have tasted
of the Heavenly gift, and were made partakers of
the Holy-Ghost, and have tasted the good word of
God, and the powers of the world to come, if
they shall fall away, to renew them again unto
Repentance, seeing they Crucifie to themselves
the Son of God afresh, and put him to open

the knowledg of the truth, there remaineth
no more sacrifice for sin, but a certain fearfull look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Ah Lord God, my Lord, and my God, in Jesus

that I cannot of my self, as of my self,

there is still, O Lord God, a law in my members,

warring against the law of my mind, and leading
me Captive into the law of sin; Ah Lord, when,

that blessed, most blessed, and glorious day dawn
and appear in my heart, that the root and branch
of sin be totally rooted up, and utterly destroyed,
and grace confirmed, &amp; grow up more and more,
until I come to be a perfect man in Christ Jesus,
that I may still more and more hate the evil which
I do, and love the good which I do not and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

that dwelleth in me, and that by the assistance of
thy grace and holy spirit, I may walk well pleasing
before thee, doing thy work and thy will here on
earth, as it is done in Heaven, living the life of
grace here, and of glory hereafter, the life of the
Righteous, that I may dye their death; Ah Lord,
give thy self to me, that I may give my self to thee,

thine own, that I may own thee for mine all, give
me, Ah give me, O Lord, much grace, that I may
give thee much glory, daily grace, that I may give
thee daily glory, continually grace, that I may give
thee continually glory, that I may be all thine, O
Lord, only thine, alwayes thine, and ever thine, and
all this I most humbly and unfainedly beg of thee,
and what ever else thou knowest to be needfull or
expedient for me, both for my soul and body, for
the name, and for the worthiness of Jesus Christ,

our hearts set on fire with Love, when we have

God, yea of a God of Love, whose Love is so

it seems to us that we cannot love him so much as
we would, and do desire to do, and we crave and
desire chiefly his Love, that we may yet love him
more, and this from and because we love him so
much, and for that our senses can be only satisfied
with his Love, and by loving of him; for we love
him most for his Love, and his Love doth cause us
to love him more, whom we love so much, yea
whom we love most.</p>
            <p n="37">37. But Ah how great then, yea how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

all Love and things lovely in the Creature, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase

O God, because they know and feel that thy Love

who out of his love do so much hate him, and love
only what he hateth; alas, alas, what can we,

his love; Let us then, Ah let us then admire, and
in humility ever adore this his love, with which
he hath so loved us, as to make us like himself, in

love us, so likewise doth this his love in us, cause
us thus to love him, and thus to love one another
with the same loving love, and all that we
may be all one and the same, in love, in him, to
him, and for him, who is the love of our love, the
cause of our loves love, the subject of our love,
the object of our love, which we only desire to

that is, that our love may never know end, as his

God, yea the incomprehensible love with which
he loveth us, being such, and so great, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend it's greatnesse; it cannot enter

on their works, and labour for the flesh, but
how, Ah how faintly, cowardly, and feebly do
they wrestle with God in dutyes, in prayer, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
hearing and reading the word of God, as
if they would not that blessing, or at least cared
not for it, thus Gods work, and soul work is to them
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105293:74"/>
of little concernment, and when they do mind
the soul and Heaven, it is because of its happyness,
they then seek God for Heavens sake, but never
Heaven for Gods sake, and even then when the
Lord sends a faire wind, with the breath and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his grace into their hearts, to hasten them
forward, to their place of rest, and to make them
to saile over the floods and tempests of tentations,
and waves of opposition, yet then; Ah then, so
selfish, fond, stupid and ignorant are they, as they
hoyse up all the sayls they can, to goe against this
sweet, new, fresh gale they row and tug and toyle,
to goe back from their Port, from their Haven and
Harbour, which is so near them, desiring not to
come so soon to their journeys end, they desire not
so soon to end their journeying, travel, and paines
in the flesh, they prefer this travel, and toyle, and
care, before that peace and rest, and ease, and joy,
and though this all, all this, be but vanity, and
brings nothing but vexation of spirit, yet so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
are they to God and his wayes, that they
will none of them, as long as they can these, they
gladly and willingly will put off that day, for this,
nay though God do at times shew some of them
Heaven, as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> and they behold things
unutterable, and, with <hi>Peter,</hi> see the glory of the
Lord, which is unconceiveable; yet these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights,
and fore-tasts, being taken from them, or
they from it; Ah how soon do they forget that

ever they saw any such thing, how soon, how glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
willingly, and chearfully, do they return to
<hi>Egypt,</hi> the place of their Captivity, and joyfully
and heartily feed on the Garlick and Onyons, yea
on the husks that Swines feed on, so much love
they have to themselves, as they forget God, and
that they were Created for him, and unto good
works to please and serve him, such then, as thus
love, or love thus, are self-lovers only, or chiefly,
and therefore not right or true lovers, because they
love not God rightly, therefore not truly, for he is
to be beloved first of all, most of all, beyond and
above all, he being our only, chief, supream, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
superiour, and best good, all good, being
in him, and flowes only from him, he contayning
all, and being contained by none.</p>
            <p n="54">54. But as for me, O Lord, as for me, I know,
O Lord, I know, that there is none in Heaven but
thee, nor in all the earth in comparison of thee, a
Doore keeper, O Lord, a Doore keeper in thy
house, do I much prefer, choose, and imbrace, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to dwell in Tents, or Tabernacles with
the wicked, with those that know thee not, and
that fear thee not, I much rather, Ah Lord thou

the Gospels, as thy Servant, rather, yea much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

these fleshly pleasures, with the wicked, any life,
O Lord, and any death, yea that life, and that

thee most glory, do I most humbly and unfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

thee, and to be found ever in thee, yea though thou
shouldest make all my life, as <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi>
were, when they saw and enjoyed in part, those

yea though I could alwaies see Heaven open, as
<hi>Stephen,</hi> and thou O Lord, my Jesus, and my

Lord now let thy servant depart in peace, for mine

cry out, none but Christ, none but Christ? and
come Lord Jesus; Ah come quickly, and take me

for themselves only, for the good

they receive from them, were it not for this good,
they would not care for them, nor think of them,
nor pray for them, nor wish or desire any blessing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105293:76"/>
on them, if they do at any time do them any

their losse than their gain, their dishonour
than their honour; and they would deligth more,
much more, to hear an evil than a good report of
them, and were it not that they want them, or
may want them, that they stand them in stead,
they would rather, yea much rather dis-serve
them, then serve them, hurt them than do them
good; and though with their mouths they blesse
them, yet in their hearts they curse them, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very happinesse, that they pray for (on
their behalf) they love them for their gifts, not
their gifts for them; yea they love their gifts, but
not the givers of the gifts; they love their gifts,
not because it comes from their love, but because
they are lovely, that is, because they stand them
in stead, they have need of them, they should be
in want, if they did want them, if they had them
not, they do not praise God on their behalf, and
pray for a double blessing on them, for this their
blessing of them; if they wish or desire an increase
of their substance, and a blessing on their labours, it
is because they hope they will increase in doing
them good, in giving to them of their substance, a
blessing of their labours, a part and portion of
their profits; and if they do not do so, such will
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105293:76"/>
curse and not blesse, and would if they could, take
from them all that they have, or seem to have;
for their love is self-love, love only to themselves,
for themselves, therefore false love, loving
falsly.</p>
            <p n="56">56. I had much rather have no portion in the
World, than have the World for my portion.</p>
            <p n="57">57. For I am sure the World never did, nor
never will make any rich, and as sure that it hath,
and will make many, Ah too too many poor.</p>
            <p n="58">58. For many that have had, and yet shall have,
great Portions of this Worlds good, have, nor
shall have none of the good of Heaven for their
Portion; it's hard for a rich man here to be rich
there.</p>
            <p n="59">59. And many that have no Portion in this
World, of this World, have God, and shall have
God for their sure and everlasting Portion in the
World to come.</p>
            <p n="60">60. Ah happy, yea thrice happy man, that hath
such a Portion there, though he have none here,
what ever be his condition, he is in a blessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
for he shall be ever blessed, blessed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and ever.</p>
            <p n="61">61. But Ah miserable man, who art only mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
that hath no Portion there, what ever
Portion he hath here, yea though he abound in
Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, and all this Worlds
good, and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:105293:77"/>
62. Give me, Ah Lord, give me any Portion in
Heaven, though but to be a door-keeper; if I
may but see thy face, and hear thy voyce, I care
not, though it be with the losse of all Portions
here, both of riches, honours, and pleasures.</p>
            <p n="63">63. If thou givest me here O Lord, but food
and rayment, how mean soever it be, I will be
content therewith, and heartily thank thee, and
if thou givest me none, I will thank thee for the
time past, and believe I shall want none for the
time to come, and that shall content me.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Ah if the want of the World be so sweet
when in its want we find no want, how sweet then,
yea how much sweeter is Heavens fulnesse? where
is all fulnesse of all things, and therefore no want
at all of any thing.</p>
            <p n="65">65. Ah how much better is it, and how much
greater gain, to lose this Worlds all, and gain
Heaven, then to gain this Worlds all, and lose
our part of Heaven, which is Heavens all, yea all
Heaven.</p>
            <p n="66">66. The Worlds losse with Heavens gain, I
shall not account any losse, but all gain, yea the
greatest gain I can get; But Heavens losse, with all
this Worlds gain, I shall not account any gain, but
a great losse, yea the greatest that I could, or can
sustain.</p>
            <p n="67">67. He that loseth Heaven loseth all, but he
that gets only this Worlds all, gets nothing, even
nothing at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:105293:77"/>
68. I will and alwaies will account all losses
gain (to win Christ) and all gain losses if I lose
Christ.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Let Christ then be my gain, and I care not
what losses I sustain.</p>
            <p n="70">70. For this Worlds felicity is certain but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but the felicity, or infelicity of the World
to come, is not uncertain any moment, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
good or bad from the first to the last mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which last moment will be alwaies a like, as
far off, as it was the very first moment, being ever,
ever.</p>
            <p n="71">71. Give me then, Ah Lord God, that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
good, felicity and happinesse, which is like,
thy self, shall never change but endure for ever,
and not that which is like my self subject every
moment to all change.</p>
            <p n="72">72. Ah Lord, thou knowest I would willingly,
most willingly change thus, my life for death, and
then my death for life.</p>
            <p n="73">73. That is my life of sin, for a death to sin, to
put all sin to death, and then death, for eternal
life with Christ, who is my life.</p>
            <p n="74">74. Thou knowest, O Lord also, that I would
willingly die to live, and live to die.</p>
            <p n="75">75. That is to dye to sin, and live to grace, live
in all grace and dye to all sin, that to me to live may
be Christ, but to dye gain, yea that my life may
be hid with Christ in God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:105293:78"/>
76. I would willingly, O Lord, have thee mine
all, that I may give thee mine all, and reserve from
thee nothing at all.</p>
            <p n="77">77. All Lord, All, I most willingly and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
give thee, Ah that thou wouldest receive all,
and refuse nothing at all.</p>
            <p n="78">78. For all, Lord, thats mine is thine, that is,
all that is good; for the bad I renounce, and give
back also to him that gave it.</p>
            <p n="79">79. All the World is nothing, being all perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
therefore can be to nothing compared, but
to nothing.</p>
            <p n="80">80. Ah what a pity is it, that any man should
be so fickle, as to love such fickle things, as are
these below, which to day are, and to morrow are
not.</p>
            <p n="81">81. For is any thing lesser, worser, or lighter
than vanity; if any thing be, or can be, or if this
Worlds things be any thing, it is it, which is so
much vanity, and so full of vanity, and therefore
the more, the lesser worth, the worser, and the
lighter, be all nothing, but all vanity.</p>
            <p n="82">82. The more there is of a bad thing, the
worser, and the lesser too, is the thing, (that is to
goodnesse).</p>
            <p n="83">83. Well therefore may it be said of the best of
this Worlds, of this Worlds best, as the old old
woman, said unto her daughter, arise daughter Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and come to thy daughter Vanity, for thy
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105293:78"/>
daughter Vanity, hath another daughter of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="84">84. Ah fruitful, but cursed fruitful womb, that
brings forth so much cursed fruit, full of Vanity.</p>
            <p n="85">85. How much better were it, that thou wert
barren, than thus to bear.</p>
            <p n="86">86. Vanity is in the getting, Vanity is in the
keeping, Vanity is in the spending, and there is
Vanity for the most part, in giving of this Worlds
Vanity; So that all in this World, even all this
World, is Vanity, yea all Vanity, and Vexation
of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="87">87. Ah vain foolish man that labourest so hard,
that hazardest so much, for that which at the best
is so vain, being so full of Vanity, and, which is
worse, vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p n="88">88. If then its best be so bad, what is its worst?
if its all be worth nothing at all, why wilt thou then
be such a fool? as to labour for that which is not,
and to spend thy time, thy dear most dear, and
most pretious time, for that which will not, for
that which cannot profit thee.</p>
            <p n="89">89. Let then, Ah let then the morrow care for
its self, care thou O man, Oh carelesse man for
thy self, that is, for thy better self, which will
make thee ever happy, or else thy carelesnesse
ever miserable, miserable for ever.</p>
            <p n="90">90. Be not, Ah be not so carelesse, to put off
thy care till to morrow, seeing there is a change
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105293:79"/>
every moment; but fear still, Ah fear thou still,
that change which a day may bring forth.</p>
            <p n="91">91. Let the World take its own, make sure
what is thine own, (if thou wilt so have it) which
is Christ Jesus, and all his merits, and say truly
and bouldly, I will have none but Christ; I care
for none but Christ, nor to know nothing but
Christ and him crucified; be then contented if
thou hast him, and be not contented what ever
thou hast, if thou hast him not.</p>
            <p n="92">92. For all other things give discontent, and
bring with them Vexation of Spirit; but he gives
alone all true contentment, and brings with him the
peace of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="93">93. If then our peace in believing bring so
great joy, that it passeth all understanding; Ah
how great shall our peace and joy be, when it shall
be above believing, that is, when we shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
the God and giver of all peace, who is our
rest and peace, yea our peaceable rest, and he will
augment our understanding as much as our peace,
and yet our peace shall surpasse ours, and all others
understanding.</p>
            <p n="94">94. And if our joy be so great when we believe
the certainty thereof, Ah how great in possession,
when we shall know certainly with the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and sure knowledg of God, that it shall be
ever most surely sure, and certain.</p>
            <p n="95">95. If then these things below be able to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105293:79"/>
any, a moment, surely the things above, (above
all things) shall be able, and will ever, ever will
satisfie all, for all there, shall enjoy all God, who
hath all things, and is all things, and more then
all things, and he giveth himself unto all, being
all in all, and over all, and above and more than
all.</p>
            <p n="96">96. Ah Lord God, the searcher the trier and
knower of all hearts; thou knowest, O Lord, thou
knowest my heart, and therefore knowest right
well, what my heart heartily, chiefly, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
desireth, above, beyond, and more than all

most pretious, sweet and dear self. Ah let me so
have thee, as never to be without thee, and I will
never more, ask any thing more of thee; fill me,
Ah fill me so with thy blessed fulnesse, as that I
may never more be emptied of thee, but may
continually receive from thee grace for grace, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

O my Lord, even into thee, who art the Lord of

by grace, that I may be hereafter for ever married

with thee, unto thee, in glory, Raign, rule, bless,

me from all evils, perils, and dangers, that I
may enjoy those blessed, great, gratious, holy, and
glorious promises, which thou hast been pleased
from time to time to make unto me, that I may
live, and living dye, that I may dye, and dying
ever live, to the praise, honour and glory of thine
ever blessed, Eternal, most holy, and most great,
most sacred and most glorious name, so be it Lord,
so be it.</p>
            <p n="97">97. Heaven is Heaven, because it is holy, yea
because, O Lord God, thou art there that art holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
therefore is Heaven Heaven, and Heaven ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yea such a holy, and therefore blessed Heaven
as it is, so as to those that are there, a thousand
years seem but as one day, so greatly sweet is its
enjoyment, and one day seems as a thousand years,
so great is their joy in its enjoyment, and holiness
is the chief joy, felicity, and happiness in Heaven,
because it makes them, all like unto thy self; O
all Heavenly God, who art the Heaven of Heaven
in Heaven, being the holiness of Heaven, and
therefore Heavens chief joy, felicity and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="98">98. If earths sweets are so sweet to earthly
hearts, as they desire nothing but earth, that is the
things on earth; Ah how sweet then are Heavens
sweets to a Heavenly heart, and how shall, Ah
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105293:80"/>
how shall Heaven ravish their hearts with joy, and
contentment, when that their hearts, souls, and

that is with all holiness and blessedness, even
with God himself, the ever blessed, and holy God,
then shall they be all holy, all Heavenly, yea all,
a holy Heaven, being holy as God is holy, but not
so holy.</p>
            <p n="99">99. If earth then, or earthly things on earth, be
able to satisfie any on earth, surely Heaven, and
the things in Heaven, shall be able and will satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
all in Heaven, for that all there, shall enjoy all
that is there, even all God, Father, Son, and Holy

            <p n="100">100. And therefore by how much God is above
all things, and more worth then all things, by so
much, yea so much more, do I value my interest in
him above all things, for having him sure, I have
all things sure, I am sure.</p>
            <p n="101">101. Ah when I enjoy that true joy, of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that true Communion with the true God,
though here on earth, me thinks I am not on earth,
but in Heaven, and yet I know all this is, but an
earthly Heaven, (though a Heaven.)</p>
            <p n="102">102. But how then, Ah how then doth my
heart rejoyce with joy unspeakable, knowing that
the time will come, and is ever near at hand, when
I shall ever enjoy Heavens true joys, which is
God himself, the joy of all joys, yea all joys that

103. O Lord, thou knowest that the Heaven

peace unto thy soul. Ah then, do thou by

            <p n="119">119. To have God sustaine us, and be our help,

and not put any trust in Princes, or in the

that very day his thoughts perish.</p>
            <p n="120">120. To have God be all ours, we must be all

think our own thoughts, or speak our own words,
nor do our own works, but do all to the praise of
his holy, holy, holy name.</p>
            <p n="121">121. He that would live with the Lord in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

            <p n="122">122. He that would have the Lord, to be his

            <p n="140">140. Seeing then that these things, O Lord, shall

ought to be.</p>
            <p n="141">141. Now seeing that holiness is Heaven, and
Heaven is holiness, Ah Lord make me all holy,
that I may be all Heavenly; let holiness alwayes

            <p n="142">142. And seeing, O Lord, that our desire

in Heaven, and Heaven in me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:105293:83"/>
143. And seeing that the more holy we are, the
more heavenly we are, and the more like unto
thee, O most heavenly, and most holy Lord
God, that is throughout holy, in Spirit, Soul, and
Body, grant that though I am here below on earth
(and earth) I may in holinesse be like unto thee

            <p n="144">144. Ah Lord God, that hast fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Heaven for me, prepare me for it, that I
may enjoy thee all, who art my all, and my only
Joy.</p>
            <p n="145">145. And seeing none shall enjoy thee in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but those that enjoy thee on Earth, Ah
Lord, let me so enjoy thee here, that I may long
to be dissolved, for ever to enjoy thee there, yet not
for mine own sake only, but for thine own sake
(good Lord.)</p>
            <p n="146">146. Ah Lord, let my joy be so full of thee
here on Earth, as I may alwaies long to be filled
with thy fulnesse of joy in Heaven, and to enjoy
fully those pleasures that are there at thy right

            <p n="147">147. Yet O Lord, I humbly beseech thee in
Jesus Christ, to make me still patient to wait, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
my blessed change shall come, and that I may
alwaies say, thine, O Lord, thine, and not my
will be done.</p>
            <p n="148">148. Ah come Lord Jesus, come when thou
wilt, and as thou wilt, either at midnight, or at
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105293:84"/>
the Cock crowing; for though I do long for thy
coming to take me hence unto thy self, yet I
would rather, O Lord, thou knowest, that I had
rather abide here, to do thy will, and for thy sake
on earth, then to leave thy will undone, and to
be in Heaven for my one sake.</p>
            <p n="149">149. Ah Lord, my Lord, and my God, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that thou hast in the abundance of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
love, and mercy, done so much for me, in
bringing me out of Hell, and assuring me of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that even all that I can imagine to do, to
lose, or to suffer, is so little, so too too little, as I
could wish, yea and do wish, that I could do
more, and suffer more, to witnesse that my little
will is great (or desires) and would be great wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
            <p n="150">150. Ah Lord, I know, and am well assured,
that thy goodnesse, is so great, and thy greatnesse
so good, for the sake of my soul, that my soul long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be great in goodnesse, to do great good

            <p n="151">151. Ah Lord God, seeing what thou hast done
for me, is to assure me of thine Eternal Love and
Mercy in Jesus Christ, give me I beseech thee,
grace, that I may not turn thy gifts of grace into
wantonnesse; but for this thy Love, wherewith
thou hast loved me, grant that it may be a strong
and firm obligation unto me, to depend upon thy
Love, and to be assured that thou wilt continue to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105293:84"/>
do as thou hast begun, that is, continually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to love me.</p>
            <p n="152">152. For seeing none but thy self, O Lord,
could do the things that thou hast done; that is,
to love me, such a lovelesse, yea vile wretch (as I
am in my self) I will therefore be bold to say,
surely the Lord will ever love me, because he doth
thus love me, and hath ever loved me thus.</p>
            <p n="153">153. Ah suffer me not then, O Lord God,
holy, just, and true, to depart from thee, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up any other God in my heart, or my heart to
love, choose, or esteem any other good, than thy
self, who art only good, all good, and able on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to do me all good, and to make me to do all
good.</p>
            <p n="154">154. Ah Lord God, in thine own good time,
accomplish and finish, the good which thou hast
begun to work in me, by causing me to depart from
all evil.</p>
            <p n="155">155. And suffer me not, I humbly beseech thee,
for thine own great, holy, and dear name sake, to
go astray from those holy, holy, holy waies, which
thou hast set before me, and written with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of thine own Spirit on my heart.</p>
            <p n="156">156. But grant, O Lord, that my Soul may
continually be ravisht with the pleasantnesse of
them, and to delight to sit alwaies under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of thy branches, for thou knowest, O Lord,
thou right wel knowest, how sweet and delightful
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105293:85"/>
the fruit of thy Word, and the knowledge of thy
waies, is to the tast of my Soul.</p>
            <p n="157">157. And therefore, and to praise thee, doth
my Soul long to come into thy house, to behold
thy beauty and thy glory, as in thy Sanctuary, and
to hide my self under the shadow of thy wings,
that no evil may come nigh me to hurt me.</p>
            <p n="158">158. Ah Lord, thou that hast wrought in me
holy desires to do thy whole and holy will, give me
grace to teach and instruct others, and to tell them
how willing thou art, to teach all sinners to come
out of their sins, and to direct them how to walk
wel pleasing unto thee, and to lead them by the
hand, that they slip not.</p>
            <p n="159">159. Ah Lord, suffer me not to do as do the
men of the World, to labour to heap up, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these things that profit not, and to leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
me, much of these low earthly outward
things, that endure but for a season, but let me ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cast off these garments bespotted in the flesh,
and follow thee naked, and gather up and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
those true and heavenly riches, which shall
make the Soul glad, and rich, and honourable for
ever, that my heirs may be heirs of Heaven, and
not of earth.</p>
            <p n="160">160. Ah Lord, Let all the Worlds all, be all
unto me, as I was unto thee, when in it and
of it (even as a menstruous cloth) and my all not
worth any thing at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:105293:85"/>
161. Ah Lord, suffer me not to mind earth any
more with an earthly but with a heavenly mind,
and that my heart my be alwaies there where my
true, only, and everlasting treasure is; and that
I may live in the World, as if I were not of the
World, and use these things below, as low things,
even as if I used them not.</p>
            <p n="162">162. Ah Lord, suffer me not to mind these
things my self, which I teach, and labour to have
others forget, and not to mind, and so save them,
but perish my self.</p>
            <p n="163">163. Ah Lord, full of grace, give me grace to
shew forth unto all, that all my covetings, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and longings are for the things above, and
not for these things here below, and that these
things here, are fit, and only fit, for such as have
their heatts, and affections here.</p>
            <p n="164">164. Ah Lord, sure, yea most sure it is, that
those that are risen with thee, will seek the things
that are above, even where thou fittest at the right
hand of God, and that those that do it not, are
not yet risen, but lye dead in the grave of their

            <p n="165">165. Ah Lord, suffer not the World to deceive
any, that their Souls may not be deceived, and
they perish for ever in their sins.</p>
            <p n="166">166. But bring them all home, Ah Lord, bring
them all home, unto thy self, and betroth them
all to thy self here by grace, that thou dost intend
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105293:86"/>
to marry unto thy self hereafter in glory.</p>
            <p n="167">167. Ah Lord, I confesse it is not my study, nor
my care, nor yet my careful study, nor my studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
care, that teacheth me wisdom, so as to know
thee, or to learn what thou knowest; but it is thy
self, O Lord, it is thy self, that givest me that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to know thy self, and learning to know what
thou knowest; for who but thy self hath that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to know thy self, or learning in himself, from
himself, to learn what thou, O Lord God
knowest.</p>
            <p n="168">168. Ah teach me then so, O my good God,
that art <hi>Israels</hi> teacher, that I may tell henceforth,
Devil, World, and flesh, that I will no more be
taught by them, nor follow their teachings.</p>
            <p n="169">169. I Know, O Lord, I know, that the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of men, no nor all mens teachings, are not
able to teach me to know any good, but I know
that thy teachings, O God, are able to teach me
all good, and how to do all good.</p>
            <p n="170">170. I will rejoyce therefore in what my God
can do, because he can, and therefore I know as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
that he will, do all the things for me that
shall be for my good.</p>
            <p n="171">171. And therefore I will not fear what men

they are but mens works, nor for our own

he doth not his work negligently, nor slothfully,
but diligently, and willingly; for his work is his

done in Heaven, he desireth no other wages for
his work, than his work, he would continually do
his work, for his works sake, for his yoak is easie to

            <p n="178">178. He that hath the Spirit of the Lord abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

these things below, as earthly low things, even as
nothing, for the whole world is much too little
for him, is not enough to satisfie, please or content
him, for he looks on its all, even as nothing at all,
as durt, dung, and dross, he is content in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and conditions; for he knows both how to

want, and how to abound, and with St. <hi>Paul</hi> to say,
as sorrowful, yet alwayes rejoycing, as poor, yet
making many rich, as having nothing, yet posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all things; for Christ is his exceeding gain,
his Heavenly riches, his true treasure, he hath now
learnt to know Christ, and him Crucified, and
therefore rejoyceth only in the Cross of Christ,
and saith, I have none in Heaven but thee, nor in
all the earth in comparison of thee, Christ is now
only his all, and his all to him to live is Christ, he
mindeth none but Christ, nor nothing but Christ,
and what he hath done for him; he so loveth and

night, if he sleeps; yet he talks with him, so that
sleeping as well as waking, he desires to have him
in his thoughts, and never to have his thoughts off
from him, and his sleep he accounts not sweet, if
he have had no Conversation with him by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication;
and as soon as he is awake, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes, and he presently recollects, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
his mercyes, and delighteth in that he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him more and more, for though he oweth him
so much, yet he longs to owe him as much more,
and though he cannot pay him any thing, yet he is
not ashamed every moment to ask him all things,
and nothing less then all things, which is himself,
will content him, and though he have his word
and promise for it, yet he will have his seal also,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105293:89"/>
and when he hath both sign and seal, yet he must
have it daily, yea Hourly, yea as it were every
moment if he could; and though he accounts that
he hath nothing so sure, yet he would alwayes have
him assure him of it, not that he doubts at all of
his word or promise, but that he might alwayes
bear in mind this his sweet and gratious promise,
to sweeten all other sowers of afflictions and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and to imbitter all other worldly and
fleshly sweets; he is so wedded unto him, as he is
never at rest nor ease, if he do not alwayes behold
him, if he do not alwayes smile upon him, if he do
not still speak peace unto him, if he do not in all
places cause the light of his blessed Countenance
to shine upon him, he is so in love with him, and so
loveth him, as if he could, he would willingly think
of no other, speak of no other, nor act for no other,
he would most willingly spend his all, and be all
spent for him, &amp; follow him wheresoever he goeth,
though it were to be banisht, imprisoned, and made
the poorest, vilest, and contemptiblest of men, yea
though it should bring sickness, and death; he is
much grieved for that he hath so little to loose for
him, he accounts his life and all not any thing at
all, not worth the offering unto such a God as he is,
that hath done so much as he hath done for him;
Ah when he afresh considers hereof, how afresh
doth his grief and sorrow begin, and most because
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105293:90"/>
he cannot grieve and sorrow as he would; he is
so wounded afresh, with his new old love, or his
old new love, as now he finds nothing lovely in
himself, to witness his love unto him: he cannot
do for him the half that he would do, and Ah how
is he troubled that he doth, and is able to do so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
for him that he loveth so much; Ah how
willing is he, and how willingly would he do his
whole and holy will here on earth, as it is done in
Heaven, and would be as willingly Sanctified as
Glorified, this his imperfection causeth him to
long for perfection, and this his holiness in part to
long to be dissolved, to enjoy for ever perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
but though he be thus tossed on the restless
waves of tentation, tryal and affliction, this spirit
of God that dwelleth and abideth in him, assureth
him, that all these things are tokens of Gods love,
and come from him in love, and therefore he is
content, for that he knowes that his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Christ Jesus is touched with the feeling of
his infirmities, and was in all points like unto him,
yet without sin.</p>
            <p n="186">186. This spirit comforts him when he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortless,
and binds up his broken heart, heals his
wounded heart, visits his sick heart, gives feeling
to his senceless heart, life to his dead heart, faith
to his doubting heart, hope to his dispairing heart,
speaks peace to his disconsolated and afflicted
heart, and gives understanding, sence, memory,
and reason unto his distracted heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:105293:90"/>
187. He that hath this spirit, he is grieved to
see Christ dishonoured by any, and to see him
blasphemed and evil spoken off, is to throw durt
and dung in his face; mens dishonest &amp; filthy lives
and conversation, makes his soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o melt, his heart
to quake, his eares to tingle, and to gnash his teeth
for grief, he goeth mourning all the day long, and
lamenteth with a most bitter lamentation, to hear
the mockings of God and his Word, because this
is to Crucifie his Jesus afresh, and to put him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to open shame.</p>
            <p n="188">188. For he that hath this spirit rejoyceth to
hear, the name of God, and of Christ magnified,
and praised, to hear him well spoken off, causeth
his heart to leap within him, as the Babe did in
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> Womb, for he loves those that love
him, and honour those that honour him, and such
only he accounteth his Father and Mother, his
Brothers and Sisters, that do the will of God his
Father, which is in Heaven; for he esteemeth
only the true Christian to be wise, and rich, and
honourable, though otherwise he be poor, and
vile, and contemptible in the eyes and esteem of
men; his very heart and soul cleaves unto these,
as the heart of <hi>Jonathan</hi> did unto <hi>David,</hi> for,</p>
            <p n="189">189. He that hath this spirit of God dwelling
in him, dwelleth in love, and God, the God of
love in him, he loves the souls of all men as his own
soul, whether they be relations or strangers, he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105293:91"/>
prays for them in secret, and exhorts them in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
yea he weeps bitterly for all such as are not
yet brought home to Christ, but especially for such
as he seeth are dead in their sins, as have eyes but
see not, eares but hear not, feet but walk not,
hands but handle not, mouths but tast not; for all
such as walk after the flesh, and do the works of
the flesh, for with his will he would that none did
goe to Hell, and that the Kingdome of Satan were
not so populous, and that he had not so many
faithful Servants, which are so faithless to Jesus
Christ, and to their own poor souls, he would that
all would believe and receive Christ, that they
might be all saved, because he knoweth that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are interressed in every souls Salvation, both
in Heaven and on earth.</p>
            <p n="190">190. This spirit opens Heavens Gates, and
leads the soul into the Inner Courts, and carryes
him up into the Brides Chamber, and feasts him
in his Banqueting house, and fills and solaces his
heart, not with the delicacies of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not with
the Milk and Hony of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but with those
sweet, rich, delitious, and pretious, most pretious
delicasies that are in that Heavenly Jerusalem, the
City of the living God, where the spirit of all just
men are made perfect, they are fed continually
with that rich dish of assurance, and have the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasts
of those Eternal joyes, which is that blessed
rest prepared for the people of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:105293:91"/>
161. And thus this spirit causeth those in
whom it dwelleth, to rejoyce ever more, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I say to rejoyce, for can any man in whom
this spirit dwelleth, who is the Sanctifier, and the
Comforter, and sent us from Heaven by our bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Saviour,(be afflicted) can any mourn whil'st the
Bridgroome is with them. Ah no, surely no, for
he comes with healings in his wings, he bringeth,
Ah he bringeth the glad tydings of peace, and
salvation to all soules where it cometh to abide;
and thus are all the Sons of God led by his spirit,
comforted by his Spirit, ravisht with his Spirit,
taught by his Spirit, feasted by his Spirit, brought
home unto him by his Spirit, and made one with
him by his Spirit, for we have all access unto the
Father through the same Spirit; let this then teach
us all that are acquainted with the works of this
Spirit, not to quench its motions, not to afflict or
grieve this holy Spirit of blessedness, but be always
ready and willing to receive him, and entertaine
him, for if we delight in him, and to abide with
him, he will delight in us, and delight to abide in
us, for he will not break the bruised reed, nor
quench the smoaking flax, but wheresoever there is
the true sincere and unfained desires of grace, he
will give grace according to these desires, for he
will never leave us comfortless, but will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, and where he hath begun his work, he will
as assuredly finish it, he will never leave nor forsake
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105293:92"/>
us, if we do not leave not forsake him, but will
make our weak and imperfect grace, strong and
perfect glory, for he knoweth all our desires, and
the thoughts and imaginations of our hearts are
not hid from him, but are alwayes open and naked
before him, and he delighteth most to feed us, when
we are most hungry, and to refresh us when we
are most thirsty, and to cloath us most richly, when
we are naked, and to give us the greatest treasure
when we are poorest, and to visit us when we are
most sick for his absence, and to comfort us when
we are most disconsolated and afflicted, and when
we cast our selves down, then doth he delight to
raise us up to the highest, and when we think our
selves worst, then doth he esteem us at the best,
and after our mourning, causeth us to rejoyce, and
wipes away all tears from our eyes.</p>
            <p n="192">192. Thus is this Spirit (unto us all things, who
bringeth us much more joy, then we are able to
ask, then we are able to think, it Convinceth our
hearts of sin, of Righteousness, and of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="193">193. This Spirit giveth wisdome to the simple,
and teacheth the Ignorant knowledg, and causeth
him to understand; so as Babes and Sucklings
shew forth his mighty praises, for he revealeth
unto them, what he hideth from the wise and
mighty men of the earth, and maketh appear plain
that their Wisdome is but meer foolishness, their
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105293:92"/>
strength, weakness, and their honours, but as a leaf
which the wind driveth too and fro, as he was made
of nothing, so in a moment he turns to nothing,
their breath goeth forth, they rerurn to the earth,
in that very day his thoughts perish, he is as the
grass of the earth, and as the flower of the field,
which to day is, and to morrow is not, he is so
perishable as he can be compared to nothing, but
to nothing.</p>
            <p n="194">194. This Spirit sheweth us, that those things
which we see not, and cannot see, be unto us, as if
they were, and these things which we see, are, as
if they were not, because we value them not, but
as Pilgrims and strangers, we seek a Country, an
Habitation not made with hands, Eternal in the
Heavens.</p>
            <p n="195">195. This Spirit openeth unto our sence, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and understanding, that which no man can
shut, and shutteth that which no man can open;
this spirit declareth unto us, what the mind and
will of God is for our good: and worketh in us a
holy conformity in all our minds, wills, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
to be carefully studious, and studiously
careful, to walk in all well pleasing before him, it
maketh us to press forward to comprehend, that
for which we are also comprehended of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
our Lord; it worketh in us a fear that increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our love, and such love as casteth out all fear,
it maketh us to do, all that we do (for him) and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105293:93"/>
not for our selves, loving him much more for himself,
than for our own selves; and more for his glory then
for our own glory; if such long to be with him, it is
to do him more, and better service; for here we can
know but in part, and do but in part, but there we
shall know him as he is to be known, and do for
him all things, which were fore-ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
by him, before that we were, and that is,
to possesse him wholly, and holy as he is, that is, as
much as is possible for us Creatures.</p>
            <p n="196">196. This Spirit warmeth our hearts so with
his divine Love, and maketh us partakers of his
divine nature, that daily we grow more and more
conformable, and like unto him, and to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
and know, more, and more, what is the
length, the bredth, the heighth of the depth of
his love, to his children and servants, and to be
such, as eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath it entred into the heart of any man to
conceive rightly, the things that God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for those that love him.</p>
            <p n="197">197. The Spirit causeth them, where it dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to feel what they cannot comprehend, nor
expresse; and it so filleth their hearts with such
Joy in believing, that there is no joy like unto
it; this is that true bread of life, that feedeth
them unto eternal life, this is that true water of
life, that causeth us never more to thirst, with
fear or doubtings; this is that Rock flowing with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105293:93"/>
hony, that reviveth the fainting Spirits of every
true <hi>Jonathan</hi> that tasts it with the mouth of Faith,
yea this is that heavenly Mannah, and bread of
Angels, and Saints, on which they feed and are
satisfied in heaven; these are the Royal Robes,
which Jesus Christ our Bridegrome arrayeth us
with, even his own Righteousnesse, and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse:
this filleth our Lamps, with that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oyl of assurance, that we shall be admitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that marriage Feast, and Supper of the Lamb,
this gives them all to know that their names are
written in the Book of life, and that their lives are
hid with Christ in God. So that when he shall
appear at his second and sudden coming, they shall
also appear with him in glory; this causeth them
to hear his most sweet, and blessed voyce, come
ye blessed of my Father inherit the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for you, before the foundation of the World
was laid; this assureth them that God is, and will
be their Portion for ever; this causeth them to
know, that they shall all sit down with <hi>Abraham,
Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that God will not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
to be called their God, and to own them
for his own, even for his sons and daughters in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; this is that new name, which they all
know that have it, and this is that which fills them
with true love to adore all his Attributes of Justice,
as well as of mercy; and for that there is a Hell
for the wicked, as a Heaven for the righteous; for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105293:94"/>
their greatest joy, and glory is, for that he is, what
he is, and for that he doth what he doth; for all
things that pleaseth him pleaseth them, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is their honour, and his glory their glory,
and therefore they delight to blesse, and praise,
and laud, and extol, and magnifie his holy name,
and this causeth them so earnestly to beseech, and
beg, and pray Souls to come unto Christ, and to
wash and bath themselves in this fountain of his
blood, which is allwaies open for sin, and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse;
this maketh them to prize it above all
works, knowing that it is the work of the Lord,
and that in it he is well pleased, and that many
are losers in the losse of a Soul, and that great is
the joy in Heaven at the conversion of a sinner;
this makes them to feel what they speak, and to
speak what they feel; this makes them so willing
to spend and to be spent, and to follow the Lamb
of righteousnesse wheresoever he goeth, and to go
and do, and suffer quietly, willingly, joyfully,
cheerfully, and patiently, all that is commanded
them: alwaies saying, O Lord, send me; and as
<hi>Samuel,</hi> speak Lord, for thy servant heareth, and
with <hi>David,</hi> my heart is ready, and with <hi>Paul,</hi>
Lord what wilt thou have me to do, take all my
worldly, and fleshly honours, pleasures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
make me if thou wilt, as poor, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptable,
as thou thy self wast when thou wert
here on earth, I am content; what thou wilt and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105293:94"/>
only what thou wilt, and all that thou wilt, O
Lord, is the desires, covetings, longings, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of my heart, and Soul, for I have, nor would
have no other will, than thy will, and to do thy
holy, whole and blessed will here on earth as
it is done in Heaven; for this, O Lord, thou
knowest is the Heaven that my soul desireth to
have on Earth: I shall rejoyce to be banisht, to be
trampled on, to be a gazing, and a mocking stock,
to be derided and scoffed at, any thing Lord let
me be, and suffer, in spirit, soul, and body, so I
may but bring home poor souls, that they may not
go unto that place of torment, but be received by
thee into thy mansion of glory, to sing for ever
Hallelujahs, of praise, honour, and glory, unto
thy most holy and most glorious name, with all
that numberlesse number of Angels and Saints,
and with the Spirits of just men made perfect;
Ah who would not lose a member of his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yea though it were all his members, as the
blessed Martyrs did, to make up a member of
Christs body; for who would not have his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
increase, and Satans decrease? who would
not fight for Christ against all his enemies, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
knowing that they are already conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and made his foot-stool? who would not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to undeceive poor silly Souls, that go on so
fast, and run so swift in the waies of Eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and whose feet make hast to death, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105293:95"/>
who drink up iniquity as it were water, and rush
into all evil, as the horse rusheth into the battel,
and that rise early, and go to bed late, that they
may yet sin the more, and notwithstanding they
commit not half the evil that they would, they are
thus ensnared to their own hurt; Ah who would
not labour to free such poor creatures, as are slaves,
and drudges, and serve such a Master as gives such
wages, as is Hell, death, and destruction, eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
both for body and Soul; Ah who is not an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
fit enough, to set forth, the uglinesse and the
filthinesse of sin, which thus defileth the heart,
in which God so much delighteth, and desireth to
dwell; and which depraves them of his most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and most glorious Image, and makes them the
Image of the Devil, instead of being a member of
Christ, it makes them a member of Satan, instead
of being a child of God and an heir of Heaven,
yea coheir with Jesus Christ, it makes them a
child of wrath, an heir of hell, and coheir with
the Devil and his Angels, of Gods eternal and
unplacable wrath and vengance, which shall ever
burn them but never consume them; for God
himself will laugh at their great calamity, and
mock when their fear cometh; Ah who would
not rejoyce to do such a work, as to hinder poor
Souls from having such a portion as this, and bring
them home to Jesus Christ, who is the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
who will give them this his Holy Spirit to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105293:95"/>
teach them, lead them, direct and instruct them,
in those things which belong to their eternal peace
and Salvation, which is, in all truth, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p n="198">198. Thus are all those in whom this Spirit of
God dwelleth, made partaker of his own holy, and
divine nature, to love the brethren, even with
this true, sincere, and free love, that they may
for ever and ever enjoy that true and free Love of
God, which shall make them for ever free, from
all miseries and pains, and of all pleasures and
joyes, enjoying him, who enjoyeth all things in
himself, from himself, with whom is all joy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
joy, fulnesse of joy, and at whose right
hand are pleasures for ever more.</p>
            <p n="199">199. Thus blessed, and for ever blessed are all
those, that have this blessed Spirit of God for their
Portion on Earth, which shall lead them as the
Sons of God, unto God, their Father and their
Portion in Heaven, who is the Portion, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the everlasting Rest of all the blessed.</p>
            <p n="200">200. Ah blessed condition, to be thus blessed
by the Spirit of God, yea by the God of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
having hearts so full of true love and charity, as
to long, labour, and desire, to have all others thus
blessed with themselves, and as themselves; that
are so full of the Love of God, as to love all others
as they love themselves, and would have all belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by him; Ah Holy Father, increase this thy
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105293:96"/>
love in the hearts of all thy children and servants
here on Earth, that we may together go hand in
hand, witnessing that the love wherewith we love
one another is from thy Love, and that we live in
thee and thou in us, who art all Love, even the
God of Love, and that it is from thy Love, and the
living of thy holy and blessed Spirit in us, that we
thus love, or love thus.</p>
            <p n="201">201. Ah Lord God, for thine own great, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Spirit the Comforter from me, but let it ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
and dwell in me, that I may alwaies go forth
before thee rejoycing, as the Bride rejoyceth in
her Bridegroom, for thou, O Lord, knowest my
many weaknesses and imperfections, and that I
cannot do any thing well pleasing unto thee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the assistance of this thy Holy Spirit, for that
my heart is all evil, only evil, and continually evil,
leave me therefore O Lord, this thine holy and
blessed Spirit the Sanctifier, and the Comforter,
that I may be ever led in the waies of all truth
and holinesse, which may conduct me unto thy
dwelling place, which is all peace, rest, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
blessednesse, and eternal life, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p n="202">202. Here followeth a short Admonition, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or advice, unto all carelesse sinners, that prize
not this life or living of Gods Holy Spirit in
them; that they would no longer quench its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105293:96"/>
but come out of their sins, and tast and see
how gratious the Lord is.</p>
            <p n="203">203. Ah poor, most poor, and most miserable man,
for thou, thou only art truely miserably poor that
art Christlesse, though thou aboundest in Corn,
Wine, and Oyl, though thou farest delicately eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, and art arraied with Purple, Scarlet and
fine linnen, though thou feedest on the delicasies
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and enjoyest all this Worlds good; the
honours, riches, and pleasures thereof, though
thou lyest on the beds of Ivory, and hast thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
bedeckt with the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Pearls and Diamonds of the Orient, though
Princes should be thy servants, and Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
thy maidens, yet remember for all this, thou
shalt dye, and come to Judgement, thine honour
and thy riches shall not save thee, but in the day
of thy distresse they shall take themselves wings
and flye away from thee, miserable comforters are
all such comforts: Ah put not, put not thy trust
then on such things as in a moment, ere thou art
aware, shall be taken from thee, or thou from
them.</p>
            <p n="204">204. Awake, awake, from the dead thou care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
man, why sleepest thou? arise and Christ
shall give thee light and life; why, Ah why wilt
thou be so obstinate, as thus wittingly, knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and wilfully, neglect so great Salvation, and
be thus idle all the day long? dost thou not know
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105293:97"/>
that the night is coming wherein no man shall
work, and the day when thou shalt say, thou hast
no pleasure in them: Remember, Ah Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
thou that sleepest in security, that drinkest in
iniquity as water, and vanity as with cart-ropes,
that sayest to thy Soul eat, drink, and take thy fill
of pleasures, and to morrow shall be as this day;
Ah thou fool when wilt thou be wise, may not thy
Soul this night be taken from thee, whose then
shall those things be? and what, Ah what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of all those thy vain pleasures and delights,
thou canst not carry any of them with thee, but as
thou camest into the World naked, so thou shalt
naked return, from earth thou cam'st, and to earth
thou shalt again return; thine honour shall not
go down into the pit with thee, nor thy money
neither.</p>
            <p n="205">205. Deceive not then, Ah deceive not then
thy self any longer, with those vain things, which
are not, that is, they are not, what they seem to
be, what they promise to be, nor what we take

to serve no longer, Devils lusts, Worlds lusts,

Christ in sincerity and truth, with full purpose of

and still, unto thee, thy God, and thy guide, thy
Sun, and thy Shield, thy peace, and thy portion,
in the land of the living. Neglect, Ah neglect no

and so great Salvation, as those that are with God
enjoy.</p>
            <p n="206">206. Cast not, Ah cast not his holy and divine

is not dull of hearing, he is the same, yesterday, to

thy sins, that separates between thee and thy God,

the Lord, and thou shalt find mercy, and to our
God, who is full of Compassion. Ah tast, tast, and
see how good the Lord is, and how gratious he will
be unto thee, if thou wilt leave and forsake thy
filthy, filthy sins: though thou hast played the
Prodigal, and spent the stock of his grace on Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
and Strangers, in a far Country; yet, Ah yet
if thou wilt but return, whilst he seeth thee yet afar
off, he will run towards thee to meet thee, and
fall on thy neck and kiss thee, and kill for thee the
fatted Calf, and array thee with the best white
Robes, even with the Royal and most glorious

Eldest Brother, Christ Jesus, he will delight in

perswaded, that there is not so much sweetness in
Jesus Christ as in the world, not his paths are not

therefore thou makest the world thy God, and thy
Christ, and lovest it as thou should'st love God
and Christ, well, the world, and sin, and its good
and pleasures thou knowest well; I desire only
this one thing of thee, that thou would'st labour to
know Christ as well as thou knowest the world

them, and if thou dost not find more sweet,
more beauty, more pleasantnesse, more delight,
more profit, more advantage, and more honour
then in the world, and sin, return then to thine

and assure thee, and will freely pawn thee
my soul for surety, that thou shalt gain more by
serving Christ one year, if that thou do'st it as thou
oughtest, then by serving the world and sin all the
dayes of thy life, and if thou dost repent of thy bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I will confess that I do deserve thy curses,
and not thy prayers; thou shalt find, thou shalt
find that his wayes are not strowed with Thorns

and Thistels, as thou supposest, but with Odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Roses, and sweet perfumes, as thou supposest

God, thou shalt by thy life (if Godly) perhaps

that surely, Gods wayes are the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and delight some, seeing thou preferest them,
and choosest, and esteemest, and praisest them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
and more, and beyond all the wayes of sin;
and this may cause them (perhaps to make a tryal)
which if they do, there is hopes, for God will not

Christ in God; put off, Ah put off the old man

that Created him, and as the Elect of God, put on

which is the bond of perfectness, and let the peace

Word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom,
teaching and admonishing one another in <hi>Psalms,</hi>

his Image of holiness &amp; righteousness is renewed

with his own love, perfectly, and so he hates all

they judge none but themselves, knowing with

what they were themselves in time past, how they

a holy and a just God, all good, yea because he is
such a God as he is, and as well for that he punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

holiness with Eternal life, after he hath given

the sinner in Hell shall be despighted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he lives to sin and cannot dye, nor flye from

him (with life) and will not suffer death to have
power over him, he sees death to fly from him,
ye so far as it will never be nearer him then it is,
so that he shall ever live thus; the Saints rejoyce
to live because they live in God, and for God,
a Saint loves God, because he hath thus rewarded
him, by making him to live such a life as this, that
is to his praise, and because God was ever thus,
and shall be thus ever, he knoweth he shall be ever
so also, death is fled from him, and shall be never
nearer him then it is, he knoweth he shall ever
live thus, that is be thus ever with God, in God,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105293:105"/>
and see him, and know him, as he is to be known

            <p n="280">280. Thus then holinesse, and sin are Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites,
and Enemies, but holinesse destroyes sin,
as light doth darknesse; this eternal darknesse of
sin, must vanish, when this eternal everlasting
light of holinesse doth appear, thus is it conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and overcome, because holinesse is from God,
and sin from the Devil, holinesse from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
sin from the Creature, holinesse had never
beginning nor shall never have end; sin had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and therefore not from the beginning;
the Devil then brought sin into the World, but
God who is holinesse, was so before time, before
that ever the World, or the Devil was; sin then is
the lesser being from the Creature, the worser
being from the Devil, holinesse the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Creator, the better being and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from him that is all good, and giveth all
good to all, to make them good all, yea all good
as himself, for all the good that is in all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in Heaven, and on earth, is from his good,
he filleth them all, but emptyeth not himself at
all, he is still the same, still full, yea so full still, as
he overfloweth still into them from his own full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
ad they though filled full, yet do they still
receive from his fulnesse, without having in them
any emptinesse, being alwaies full from the very

beginning that they are with him, and yet are they
continually receiving, as if they were as well emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed,
as filled; thus doth our good, gratious, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and merciful God, satisfie us, and resasiate us
every moment, giving us what we ask not, what
we want not, what we know not, and though he
doth thus increase his blessings by blessing us, yet
doth he not suffer them to decrease in us when
given us, but we retain all, hold fast all, keep all,
rejoyce in all, and give him glory for all, which
is what he only requires; for this his continually
giving of us all, even to give him continually for
ever and ever, all glory, for his thus ever and for
ever giving us all grace, perfect grace and glory,
yea fulnesse of all perfect grace and glory.</p>
            <p n="281">281. As on Earth we delight to have much, so
nothing more delights God than that we crave
much, the more we ask, the more we are sure to
have, and therefore doth he did us to open our
mouths wide, and then he promiseth to fill them,
and the wider they are, the sooner they shall be
filled; his waies, nor his thoughts, are not as ours,
he is never weary giving, nor repenteth, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
beggers are best welcome, and those that
are not satisfied with a little, he takes pleasure to
give them much; our dissatisfaction herein is his
satisfaction; our covetings causeth his liberality,
with our ambition to have all, and to be denyed
nothing at all, he is right well pleased, and by
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105293:106"/>
thus exalting him as our chief and only good, doth
he exalt us, and set us on such high mountains,
that we can even see not only such a glory as is
the glory of this World, and the old <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
but that of his Kingdom of Grace here, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hereafter, the New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the City of our
God, where he is sitting on his Throne of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty

            <p n="293">293. Ah Lord God, how much better is it to

            <p n="296">296. For in thee, O Lord, in thee, is all things,
but out of thee is nothing desirable.</p>
            <p n="297">297. All sweets but thine, are bitter.</p>
            <p n="298">298. But O Lord, how savoury, yea how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

            <p n="300">300. Above all things, and more than all
things, my soul desireth thee, O Lord God, who
art the Lord of all things.</p>
            <p n="301">301. Loving of God, is knowing of him, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him is adoring of him, choosing him, shews
a delight in him, running after him, is prizing of
him, seeking of him, shews our longing desire
for him, to hunger and thirst for him, is imbracing
of him, with eager covetings, to serve him is to
honour him, to rejoyce in him is to glorifie him, to
praise him is to magnifie him, and to worship him
is to exalt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:105293:108"/>
302. It is better and more profitable many
times to be silent than to speak, for the eagernesse
of our desires to speak, takes away and hinders us
from comprehending what we do hear, so as we
consider not what is spoken (so much) as what we
desire and would speak.</p>
            <p n="303">303. But Ah how much better is it to hear the
Spirit of God speak to our hearts, than the spirit
of man to our ears, or our selves to our selves, to
consult with the Spirit, and to talk with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
than with the flesh, either our own or others,
though they have the Letter, yea and the Spirit
too.</p>
            <p n="304">304. For what we hear from God in the Spirit
by meditation, is usually engraven and written as
it were with the pen of a diamond, on and in the
heart, by the finger of God; but the words of
men, are even as man, whose breath is in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils,
soon blown out, soon put out, emptyed,
and brings forth nothing, comes to nothing (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a part) of that whole man (nothing) nothing
man.</p>
            <p n="305">305. Ah Lord God, thou knowest how willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I would be deaf, and not hear any of mans
words, so I could, or were alwaies to hear thee,
and dumb to, and not able to speak to man, so I
might, and were fit and able alwaies to speak unto
thee, I would willingly be blind to all things, and
see nothing of all the things out of thee, so I
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:105293:108"/>
could alwaies, Ah so I could alwaies see thee, I
would willingly most willingly lose all things, to
have all thee, or to be all thine, enjoy nothing at
all, but thee, O God in Christ, but thee, but thee,
for enjoying thee I shall be compleat, and enjoy
all things, for thou art all things desireable, yea thou
only art all my desires, being all things.</p>
            <p n="306">306. The greatest work we can do for God, I
conceive, is, to destroy sin, and to endeavour to
extinguish it, and root it out of the greatest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
is the greatest work, as it is greater glory to
God, speaking as men, to forgive many sins, and
great ones, than few, and small ones, and when we
are most tempted, or enticed, then to labour most
to overcome them, in our selves, and in others;
Ah then, then, the work is great and well wrought,
and be sure great shall be thy recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
if thou so livest, and actest; thine own heart
is not able to conceive, be thou what thou wilt,
how great thy wages shall be, even here.</p>
            <p n="307">307. But in Heaven we shall be filled with all
joy, unspeakable joy, fulnesse of joy, and have
no desire for any other, for any more, than those
which we shall enjoy, and yet I conceive that
every moment it shall increase, by and from the
reflections on Gods most glorious and holy attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
the Soul being not able to comprehend
them all at once, and yet she shall never at any
time desire more, nor conceive that more is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105293:109"/>
or can be than she enjoyeth, we shall be alwaies
so full of all, being filled with God, who is all, and
therefore we cannot be capable of emptinesse, or
of any want, and so by consequence of no desire,
such is the Souls blessednesse, but how much more,
thou only, O God, who art not only wise, but
Wisdom it self knowest, and none else, doth, or
can, being not able to comprehend thee, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thee, or to know thee, as thou truly art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an invisible and incomprehensible Ocean,
and Fountain of all good, blessednesse, felicity,
peace, rest, joy, eternity, and eternal happinesse,
thou only, O God, comprehendest all things, and
hast all things in thy self, from thy self, thy self
only, being all things, and yet both much more,
and much above all things.</p>
            <p n="308">308. I would much rather think on nothing,
then on any thing out of, or besides God.</p>
            <p n="309">309. To think on nothing me thinks are good
thoughts, in comparison of any other thing, out of
God, and besides God.</p>
            <p n="310">310. Ah how sweet are those sweets, not to
think, that is, to resolve and intend never to tast
more, of the bitter sweets of sin.</p>
            <p n="311">311. Ah how sweet a thing is it not to sin, though
a man do else nothing, or nothing else, but to
keep his thoughts from sin.</p>
            <p n="312">312. Sinful thoughts are harsh, and hard
thoughts, and cannot be savoured or digested,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:105293:109"/>
but by those that live in sinne, and sinne in them.</p>
            <p n="313">313. Feed me, O Lord, feed me continually
with the breathings of thy Holy Spirit, which is
the true bread and water of life, the heavenly
Mannah which the Angels still feed on with joy
and delight and are never weary, the blessed so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
themselves with, but do not surfeit, the Saints
here below continually hunger, thirst, gape, pant,
and longa after, and cannot with any other thing
or things, subject, or object, be fully satisfied.</p>
            <p n="314">314. To fare delitiously every day, is to feed
on, and fill our hearts, thoughts, and affections,
with the Love and kindnesse, or the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
of God in Christ.</p>
            <p n="315">315. To be arrayed gorgeously, and gloriously,
is to be arrayed, with humble and low thoughts of
our selves, esteeming our own righteousnesse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse,
and our very best bad enough to
condemn us into Hell for ever, but to have high
heavenly thoughts of the righteousnesse and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Jesus Christ, and that through his holiness,
worhiness, and perfect obedience, we shall be made
perfectly holy, and eternally happy.</p>
            <p n="316">316. To be right Honourable, and truly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
is to be Gods children and servants, sons
and daughters to him who is King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords.</p>
            <p n="317">317. To have all things, is to have Jesus
Christ, for our Jesus and for our Christ, get him,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:105293:110"/>
Oh get him, and I am sure thou wilt hereunto
set thy seal.</p>
            <p n="318">318. Wilt thou live happy? live to him, and
for him only.</p>
            <p n="319">319. Wilt thou dye willingly, dye first to sin.</p>
            <p n="320">320. Wilt thou live eternally? live so then here as
as Christ thy head and thy husband lived when he
was in the flesh, doing alwaies the will of God,
his heavenly Father.</p>
            <p n="321">321. Wilt thou alwaies be comforted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce?
make thy peace with thy God, and labour
to maintain it.</p>
            <p n="322">322. For fear, or favour, to gain, or lose, what
thou hast, or maiest hope to have, have a special,
care, and resolve, that thou consent not unto,
connive at, or love the least, or sweetest sin.</p>
            <p n="323">323. And if unhappily at any time thou dost
fall, lie not, Ah beware thou lie not willingly in
it, but rise quickly, and come out of it, by true,
sincere, unfained repentance, and wash and bathe
thy self in tears of sorrow, grief, and lamentation,
but still hope and trust in the Lord, for he will fail

works also, yea the work of Gods spirit, for its the
spirits work thus to work, to work his will and his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105293:112"/>
work on our hearts, and to cause us to feel, that is
to know, that he works for us, and in us, and will
never leave thus working, till he hath wrought out
our Salvation, that is, till he hath sanctified us
throughout in spirit, soul and body, and prepared
and fitted us for Heaven, as Heaven is fitted and
prepared for us.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Ah how great a folly is it to prise any other
wisdome, or to account any other things wisdome,
then this one thing, feelingly to know, and to
know feelingly in truth, and sincerity, that Jesus
is the Christ, our Christ and our Jesus, to anoynt
us, and to sanctifie and save us, to be unto us
Wisdome, Rightousnesse, Justification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
            <p n="20">20. O my soul, my soul, flye from all other
knowledg that hinders this, as from madness and
folly, as from mad folly, and foolish madness,
brutishness and stupidity, and choose to learn, and
learn to choose this one thing needfull, that is to
know Jesus Christ, and him Crucified for thee,
for thee my soul and body in thy place and stead,
not with the knowledg of the letter, but of the
spirit, for thus to know him is life, yea life Eternal,
Eternal and Everlasting life.</p>
            <p n="21">21. How willing, Ah how willing is that soul
that receives any thing from God, to lay it out for
him, that is, to give it unto others; he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be alwayes receiving, and God and his own
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:105293:113"/>
heart only knows how willing he is to be alwayes
giving, even as if he desired and begged for others,
and not for himself, and as its freely given him, so
doth he freely, or would if he could freely give it
unto others; he will not, Ah he will not, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consent to napkin it up, or hide it, he would
be thus rich, and wise, and honourable, but it is to
do good works, as it were to make others such,
when others are what they should be, he praiseth
God much on their behalf, and rejoyceth with
unspeakable joy, for the glory of God is his only
rejoycing, he minds in some manner, yet and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
too, more others welfare then his own, because
it seems to him that he cannot alone do what he
would have done for his God; therefore as soon
as he receives this Heavenly treasure, he desires
to shew himself to be the Treasurer of Heaven, to
distribute it unto those that want, that lack it, that
are hunger starved, and when he meets with such,
and perceives and finds that they feed heartily, and
favour it, Ah how doth he bless God for thus
blessing him, and them, for thus using him as an
instrument, as his hand, and mouth, as it were to
give unto them, and to help their infirmityes;
but he gives it not as his own, but as his Masters
goods, for he chargeth then strictly to account
themselves Debtors to his Lord, not to him, for
he alwayes to all, acknowledgeth to have nothing
but what he hath received; he will by no means
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105293:113"/>
hide his light under a bushel, but puts it on a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick
that it may be seen, his only amibition is so
to traffick with it, that it may redound to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
profit and advantage (that being) he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
he shall ever have a well being, that is, be
received into, and ever to abide in the joy of his
Lord, yea into the Lord of his joy.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Ah Lord empty my self, of my self, my
heart of my own heart, my affections of my own
affections, my thoughts of all my own thoughts,
that I may be filled with thee, who fillest all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
with all the good things they enjoy; be
thou, O Lord, be thou all my all, all my honour,
wisdome, strength, tiches, pleasures, life, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and happy dayes; for even then when I have
all things, and have thee not, thou knowest, O
Lord, that I have nothing, for that I esteem them
all, even nothing at all, but when I have thee, Ah
when I have thee, I have all things that I would
have, that my soul desireth, or can ask, or
crave.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Give me but thy self, O Lord, O Lord
give me but thy self, and then give me what thou

            <p n="24">24. Though I am unable, unfit, and cannot do

               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:105293:114"/>
25. O Lord, I know that thou knowest all

how willingly I would, and how much I desire to
give thee all my life, all my labour, and all my
love.</p>
            <p n="26">26. For there is no other thing lovely, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to have our loves, but that one thing, thy
Love, O God, O God thy Love, thy Love.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Ah what is all mans teachings, and mans
doings to that, O God, which by thy spirit thou
teachest us to know, and inablest us to do.</p>
            <p n="28">28. If it be so sweet, Ah if it be so sweet a
thing to think of God and his wayes here on earth
in the flesh, so that all earthly sweets, or earths
sweets are made bitter by it, unsavory, and unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
Ah how wholsome, savory, and sweet is it
to walk, O Lord, in all thy wayes, to do all thy
will, and to enjoy thy self, all as thou art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where thinking thoughts, hoping desires, and
believing joyes, shall be turned into possessing
truths, even true possession of all that ever we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
desired, hoped or thought on, yea it shall
far surpass all the imaginations of our hearts, of
our desires, or hopes, being infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible,
as well as Everlasting and Eternal.</p>
            <p n="29">29. And when, O God, thou hast thus filled us
here, thou dost at times seem to us to be as the
ebbing Sea, goe back again, but that we may not
remaine comfortlesse, thou comest again unto us,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:105293:114"/>
into us, even as the flood, yea as the full Sea, to
shew us, witness to us, and assure us, that there is
no want, decrease, nor diminishing in thee, but
that thou art still the same, full of bounty, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
love, and willingness, to do us all good, much
above what we can ask, or think.</p>
            <p n="30">30. There is, Ah there is a most blessed
Heaven to be had on this side Heaven, even whilst
we are on earth, which is an assurance certain, or
a certain and a sure assurance, of that Heaven of
Heaven in Heaven, and this some have alwayes
within them, at all times and places, they enjoy
this unspeakable joy, but more fully, sweetly, and
particularly, at some times, when they have a near
Converse and Communion with God, then are
they as it were wrapt up in God, and clothed with
him, and filled with him, &amp; made meete and fitted
by him, then Ah then do they sing new songs of
deliverance, rejoycing with unspeakable joy, that
they are thus made free.</p>
            <p n="31">31. That high Heaven above, is to be had here
below, and we have it, when though we are high in
God, yet we are low in our selves, though we have
our hearts high, living in that Heaven above, above
all things here below, yet our affections, esteem
and desire are alwayes weak, dull, and low, to all
these things here below, yea much lower then the
lowest of things.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Ah did but our hearts well consider what is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:105293:115"/>
in Gods heart to give us, and to do for us, surely
we should and we would do no other thing then
wait upon him continually, to hear what he would
say unto us, and do for us, which would bring us
more joy, joy us more then our hearts are able to
hold, then we are any of us able to think, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p n="33">33. O Lord, thou knowest that I would not
have all that I would have, but the heart of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
yea the desires of my heart are to have only,
only to have that which is in thy heart to have me
to have.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Let, O Lord, I humbly beseech thee, my

with the loaves of thy love.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Let my soul alwayes be resatiated with thy

O Lord.</p>
            <p n="36">36. O God in Jesus Christ, let thy former mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
alwayes glad my heart, when it shall either
droop, or faint, I most humbly beseech thee.</p>
            <p n="37">37. Let me not, Ah let me not wander from
thee, nor thy precepts, O Lord, who keepest this
close unto me.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Let thy Commandements be as a Chaine
of Gold about my neck, and as Bracelets of Pearls
on my arms.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Let, O Lord God, thy whole law, which
is holy, be written on my heart with the singer of

thy holy and blessed spirit, and grant through thy
grace, love and mercy in Jesus Christ, that I may
never depart from them, but alwayes and ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

which thou hast appointed and ordained to feed
this temporal life.</p>
            <p n="40">40. Let thy word, O God, be as, yea be the
hony comb, to the spiritual tast of my soul, and
resatiate and solace it as with marrow and fatness,
and comfort and glad it, as wine on the lees, yea
as wine well refined on the Lees.</p>
            <p n="41">41. Ah Lord God, cause my soul alwayes feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
and rejoycingly to say, I have none in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
but thee, nor on all the earth in comparison of
thee, my Jesus, and my Christ, and let the Corne,
Wine, and Oyle, which are the riches, honours,

dross in comparison of it.</p>
            <p n="42">42. Ah Lord God, what is man, sinful man,
wretched, blind, despicable poor man, that thou
art thus mindful of him, and the Son of man that
thou should'st thus regard him, delight in him, and
set thy heart upon him, to do him good, yea to do
him all the good that is in thy heart, and to make
him, that is his heart according to thine own
heart.</p>
            <p n="43">43. Ah wonder of Wonders, that such a God
should thus condescend to love such a man, nothing
man, man that is nothing, but evil, all evil, yea
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:105293:116"/>
and continually all evil, for there is none good,
but thee O God, O none, no not one.</p>
            <p n="44">44. Bow down, O Lord, bow down my heart
unto the obedience of thy Laws, and lift it up to
rejoyce in the obedience of thy Commandments,
to keep them, and do them, for in the keeping of
them there is life, yea eternal and everlasting
life.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Banish O Lord, I most humbly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly

the love, and the liking, unto any other Love, besides
thee, and thy Love.</p>
            <p n="46">46. And grant that with the heart of my heart,
I may serve thee in truth of heart unfainedly all
the daies and moments of my life, that I may
long after no other thing, and that thy fear may be
my daily food.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Ah Lord, I humbly beseech thee to give
out thy self unto me, that I may give up my self
unto thee.</p>
            <p n="48">48. Give, O Lord, give thy self unto me, that
I may for ever give my self to thee, to live ever to
thee, and for thee, as I desire ever to live in thee,
and with thee.</p>
            <p n="49">49. Thou knowest, O Lord my God, that I
desire not what I do desire, unlesse it be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to thy desires; so that my desires are not
mine, but thine, not mine own, but thine own,
yea thine all, all thine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:105293:116"/>
50. I would not have, O Lord God, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
right well what I would have, but what I
should, that what thou wilt have me to have, what
thou hast appointed me to have, Ah let me have
that only, that all, all that.</p>
            <p n="51">51. I know that all that thou givest us, whether
graces or gifts, thou wilt have an account of, we
shall account with thee for.</p>
            <p n="52">52. Ah let me no longer, nor no more have
this woe and grief of heart, to have received much
and done little, and to ask much for my self, but
to do little, Ah little for thee.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Suffer me not, O Lord, never to think or
do that in secret, which I would not, which I

let me much more fear thine all seeing eies, than

blessed O Lord, be thy name, as do the Papists,
suppose, or believe, that I eat thy flesh and drink
thy blood, as thou wert when thou wert here on
Earth, in the flesh, on the Crosse; for I know
that the Spirit must be fed with spiritual food spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,
the food of the body cannot resatiate, or

hunger for this blessed heavenly food, of thy holy,
heavenly, blessed, most blessed Spirit, even for
the breathings of this thy Spirit, for the joyes and

though the body be hunger starved, it shall, for,
sure I am, it will, be well content, if the Spirit be

and to thee, here by grace and hereafter in glory,
this is my belief, O Lord increase my Faith,
strengthen it, and comfort it more, and more,
by thine own Spirits living, raigning, and ruling

the flesh, but not with the will, and mind, which
is the heart, though the flesh saith yea, and yields,
if the Spirit faith nay and yields not, and doth
much more ardently, and vehemently desire, and

yet he hates, detests, and abhors the evil which he

Gods Law is written in his heart, and remains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven

as opening, asking as well as giving, is Gods free
gift, for he freely giveth all things unto all that ask

whom he hath pardoned he will save, where he

those that are beloved, shall be ever his beloved,
for he hath loved them ever, and will love them

            <p n="7">7. The fire of Gods Love are the fiery flames,
in which all his children desire to live, for out of

certain token, and sign that Heaven is fitted and
prepared for us; for as without holinesse no man
shall see God, so being made holy, he shall be
sure to see God; that is, to possesse him, who is
Heaven, eternal life and happinesse; where ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse

empty my self, that is, what of God is in me,
into them, that they might be so filled with him,
as to know him, love him, fear him, choose him,
prize him, and joy and rejoyce in him, and seek
him and his presence, with eagernesse, hungring

I am his.</p>

making intercession for us; See <hi>John</hi> 15. 16, and

the best Heaven, yea the only Heaven, that
there is no other Heaven, desirable, to be desired,

it is nothing but evil, all evil, the worst evil, yea

out, and putting forth false Colours, not its own,
its food starves the Soul, its riches impoverisheth
it, its robes shews plainly the Souls nakednesse,
its beautifulnesse and gloriousnesse shews the
Souls deformity, vilenesse, and basenesse, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse,

which racks, tears, rends, and striks through the
Soul with a fiery poysoned dart, that makes the
wound uncurable, only the blood of God (man)
(man God) can cure it, can heal this deadly,
otherwise uncurable, wound; Sin is that intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
burthen that presseth down into that nether-most
Hell, that casteth into that Lake burning
with fire and brimstone, unquenchable; sin is
fewel to that fire, so as it cannot be put out; sin

thou delightest to make us obedient, and
then thou delightest in our obedience; thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightest
to make us lovely, and then thou takest
delight in our loveliness; thou delightest, ah thou
delightest to make us such as thou wouldst have us
to be, and then thou takest great delight in the

            <p n="53">53. Ah our great, most great God, how greatly
great is thy greatness! How greatly good is thy
goodness! how greatly true is thy truth! how
greatly just is thy Justice! how greatly mighty is
thy might! how greatly lovely is thy love! how
greatly beautiful is thy beautiful countenance!
How greatly, ah how greatly sweet are all thy
Sweets! how greatly delightful are all thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights!
how pleasant, ah how pleasant are all thy
pleasant things! with thee, O God, is fulness of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:105293:134"/>
all joy, unspeakable joy, and from thy right hand
flow pleasures for evermore.</p>
            <p n="54">54. Ah the joyes, the joyes even in this worlds
joyes, when God is in them, and comes with
them, and when in that, therein alone, we take
and make all our joy.</p>
            <p n="55">55. God many times is so gracious, as he takes
us napping; that is, gives us grace when we
sought it not; yea, gives us himself, many many
times, when we seek him not, when we think not
of him.</p>
            <p n="56">56. How doth he many times measure our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, and shower down upon us such measure of
mercy, even when we never measured the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
nor the greatness of what received, much
less of that which we did not, of that which we
could not expect.</p>
            <p n="57">57. Ah how much above all things is our God,
even in the want of all things, of all this worlds
all! that soul, ah that soul that hath him, finds not,
nor cannot find any want at all.</p>
            <p n="58">58. But wanting, ah wanting him, in the midst
of all we have nothing, even nothing at all, but
want all, even all, in the very enjoyment of all
this worlds all.</p>
            <p n="59">59. O God, our God, thou fillest us many

even then, many times, when we see our

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:105293:134"/>
and many times thou causest us to bear and bring
forth most fruit, even then when we think and see
our selves most barren; we have thee, O God, we
have thee many times most when we think that
we have thee least, and thou are nighest us when
we think, ah when we think that thou art farthest
off from us, such a good God is our God.</p>
            <p n="60">60. How much better is it to be a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to
beg at a <hi>Dives</hi> door, than be a <hi>Dives,</hi> and suffer a
<hi>Lazarus</hi> to beg at our doors, and not to give him
of our goods.</p>
            <p n="61">61. How much better is it to have nothing at
all of this worlds all, then to have this worlds all,
and give of it, ah and to give of it unto others
nothing at all.</p>
            <p n="62">62. How much better is it to feed on thee, O
God, and to have nothing else to feed on, than to
feed on all things else, and not to taste of thee,
of thine own sweet, blessed, most blessed, and
most sweet self, O God in Christ, who art the souls
only food by faith.</p>
            <p n="63">63. Having thee, O God, we are soon filled,
yea, feasted and solaced with all delicious dainties:
but feeding on all other things, and not tasting, O
God, of thy pleasant things, they have all no taste
at all.</p>
            <p n="64">64. O God, thou knowst I would most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be, ah most willinglie I would be a child, yea, a
very fool in wisdom for the world, or of worldlie
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:105293:135"/>
wisdom, for to get or keep earthlie things, to be
an old man in Christ, to learn, know, feel, and
keep spiritual things. Ah if I could alwaies walk,
talk, and live in the Spirit, and obey the Spirit, I
would account all other joyes and wisdome very
toyes, and meer foolishness.</p>
            <p n="65">65. To forget all things out of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
God, and to mind him so, as to have nothing
else in my mind, this, ah this is my longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and I trust it will continue in me through
grace, and augment until I have all I would have,
which is my Christ, my Christ, who is my
God.</p>
            <p n="66">66. Take all this worlds all, ye men of the
world, give me my God, my God, and I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ask yours, your God: But yet I would that ye
had mine, that my God were your God; that my
Portion were all your Portion also, and that we
might be ever brethren.</p>
            <p n="67">67. Let me, ah let me be blind (as it were) to
see beautie in no beautie out of thee O Christ,
dumb to hear no voice but thine, ah the still sweet
voice of thy Spirit, and senseless to feel no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but in those things, O God, as are pleasing,
pretious, and dear in thy fight; lame, so as I may not
walk after any other thing but thee my God, my
God, so that I may be only thine, and none but
thine, at all times, and in all places, companies,
and things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:105293:135"/>
68. He that hath not tasted of the sweetnesse
of God, even of those sweet sweets that God
giveth to Souls, knoweth it not, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
it not; but Ah, he that feedeth on them,
and hath been resatiated with them, he finds no
sweets like them; nay all other pleasant things,
unpleasant, and all other sweets bitter in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of these his sweet, most pleasant sweets.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Beeing with God, having God, enjoying
God and Communion with him, a dungeon is to
him a Palace, bread and water is good cheer, to
lye on the ground, the earth his bed, the
heavens his canopy, and the trees root his
pillow, is as a bed of down, as curtains of gold,
and pillow of wool; nay in flames of fire, or on
a rack, he can lye softly, and sing sweetly, so he
do but hear the still sweet voyce of God speaking
peace to his Soul, and bidding it to be of good
cheer.</p>
            <p n="70">70. There is no companie like to no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
to be alone with God, with God alone; if
ever it be satisfied, it is then satisfied, to speak
with him, to him, and to hear God answer him by
his Spirit in love; Ah the lovely discourse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
delight and joy, which makes a man not to
know where he is, nor whether he be in the flesh
or Spirit, he is at such times so spiritual.</p>
            <p n="71">71. Who can, Ah who can tell, or set forth,
nay meditate what, how good, great, loving,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:105293:136"/>
gracious, merciful, beautiful and abundant is the
loving kindnesse the kind Love of God to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and servants? or set forth the sweetnesse and
greatnesse of his gifts of Grace.</p>
            <p n="72">72. He ravisheth them, he filleth them, he feedeth
them, he cloatheth them, he solaceth them, he
inricheth them, he giveth them such pleasures,
and joyes as eye hath not seen, as ear hath not
heard, nor as no heart can conceive; this honour
doth the Lord to those whom he loveth, to all his
Saints.</p>
            <p n="73">73. He maketh them to triumph in, and over
all adversity, and prosperity; in sicknesse and in
health, in all places and conditions; he is alwaies
nigh at hand to those that unfaignedly love him,
and fear him, and that tremble at his Word.</p>
            <p n="74">74. He causeth his goodnesse to passe before
them, and proclaimeth (as with an audible voice)
that he will be ever and for ever their God, and
their Guide, their Sun, and their shield, their
peace, and their everlasting portion; that he will
never leave them nor forsake them, but alwaies
and ever own them for his own, and so stand by
them, and live and dwell in them; that no evil
shall come nigh them to hurt them, or to do them
the least harm, but every thing shall alwaies work
together for his own glory and their everlasting
good.</p>
            <p n="75">75. Thus they that honour him he will honour,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:105293:136"/>
they that flye to him shall find succour and help,
and be brought out of all dangers, for his own
mouth hath spoken it, which is to me much more
by much, than ten thousand thousand witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p n="76">76. Ah Lord, I most humbly beseech thee,
keep me so close unto thee, as I may alwaies touch
thee, feel thee, hear thee, so as I may know thee
by thy name, that is by thy doings, by thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
most gratious dealings, by thy wonderful by
thy most wonderful gratious actings in my Soul,

that it may be all thine, and only thine, that thou
maist not only, O God, be in all my thoughts

liking and longing.</p>
            <p n="77">77. Fill me, O Lord, fill me with love to thy

            <p n="78">78. Fill me, O God, with thine own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that I may be good, with thine own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
that I may be just, with thine own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
that I may be righteous, with thine own
mercy that I may be merciful, with thine own
truth, that I may be truely true, with thine own
Love, that I may be lovely loving thee in truth,
with thine own fear to fear thee, with thine own
Faith to believe in thee, and to lay fast hold upon
thee, with thine own beauty, O Lord, to make

me comly and beautiful, with thine own glorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

faithful unto thy holy Laws all my whole life.</p>
            <p n="79">79. Thou hast, O God, thou hast, for which I
shall neve cease to laud and praise thee, promised
to keep me by thine own power through Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
salvation, therefore I will not be afraid nor fear
any power, no nor all powers what ever, whether
of sin, men, or Devils; for I know that they are
all weak, and that thou art strong, they are the
conquered, thou O Lord, thou art the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
they are all subdued, and thou hast, O Lord,
subdued them, they are brought under, and thou
rulest over them, they are thy foot-stool, and thou
tramplest upon them, all their all to thee, O great
God, is nothing even nothing at all, all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth, are as the drop of a bucket,
and as the dust of the ballance in thy sight, with
the breath of thy nostrils thou art able to consume
them, and turn them to their first substance (dust)
therefore, O Lord my Lord, I will depend and
rely on thee, that thou wilt do for thy servant this
good, that is so great, even to make, preserve and
keep me faithful unto the death, and then, O
Lord then, in the greatnesse of thy eternal and
everlasting goodnesse wilt give me for ever the

            <p n="80">80. How small a thing, how poor a thing, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:105293:137"/>
how low a thing, is and are all things? if God be
not in them, and come not with them.</p>
            <p n="81">81. What is it to have all things out of God,
and besides God? that is, not to have him with
them, in them, who is all good, and only able to
make all things good unto us.</p>
            <p n="81">81. How poor and low are all these high things
here below, the riches of the World, the honours
of the World, and the pleasures of the World, to
enjoy all their pleasures and their joyes; how
foolish is it? and Ah what toys, considering their
ficklenesse, shortnesse, and uncertainty; for what
is green, desirable, and flourishing, to day, is to

all its beauty past away; for who can say of any
thing, or of himself, it shall be to morrow as it is
this day.</p>
            <p n="82">82. The wicked shall not live out half his daies,
and how long soever he live, they will not be half
the dayes he would live, though God should
lengthen them as he did <hi>Hezekiahs,</hi> for ten years,
nay for a hundred, nay make his daies as <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salems,</hi>
all such a time would be but a moment, to
eternity, but to live in the Love and favour of
God a man shall dye never, but death shall make
him live for ever and for ever.</p>
            <p n="83">83. What a poor, yea despicable poor small
thing are Kingdoms, Crowns, and Scepters, and
what else, as humane Learning, the wisdom of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:105293:138"/>
men, mans wisdom; yea though a man could
know more than <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi> knew, though
he could know all things that are, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
too, that are out of God, and besides God,
what, Ah what were all this learning, knowledg,
or wisdom, but folly, meer foolishnesse, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the knowledg of the Spirit, Spiritual
knowledg, to know in Spirit and in Truth, Jesus
Christ, and him crucified, to be our Christ and
our Jesus; <hi>Paul</hi> accounted all other wisdom folly
to this, and so blessed be our God do I; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to know no other thing, but only this one
thing, no more do not I; Let all other knowledg
in me perish, so this augment and continue, I
shall not, I am sure grieve, be sad, repine, nor
sorrowful for its losse, come when it will come,
and Ah that it were come, if God so would.</p>
            <p n="84">84. Thy Love, O God, O God thy Love thy
Love, is the Heaven of Heaven in Heaven, there
can be nothing more lovely or desirable, either
there or here; Let me, O Lord, I beseech thee
never leave sighing after it, longing for it, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to enjoy it, until I do enjoy it with thy
self in thy self, by possessing thy blessed most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
self, O sweet Jesus, who art all blessings, and
all blessednesse.</p>
            <p n="85">85. One look of Love from Christ, will make
a man willingly and cheerfully, to cast aside, to
cast away, all things that hinder his loving of him,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:105293:138"/>
though never so lovely, or lawful, near, or dear
unto him; for his Love will constrain, only to love
him again.</p>
            <p n="86">86. But how then, Ah how then doth, and will
that Soul love him, that seeth and knoweth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
that he is beloved by him, he is fed with
his Love, yea continually feasted with his Love, he
is cloathed with his Love, all his garments are
Love, his treasure is his Love, his honour is his
Love, and his Love is all his pleasure and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
he sees his Love in all things that he sees, that
he enjoys, he is continually with him, and this
his sweet, amiable and blessed presence of Love,
his most loving presence, he cannot be without,
when he hath him not thus nigh him, he seems to
want all things, and when he hath him thus, he
hath all things, and wants nothing.</p>
            <p n="87">87. Such a Soul rowleth, dependeth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
rejoyceth, his heart is only made glad by
his delightful approaches, and indwellings; so
as he esteemeth no life like to this life, of living in
him, to him, and for him; and when, Ah when
all other Subjects, and Objects how loving, or
lawful soever at other times, are outed of his
mind, memory, heart, and affections; how glad
is he? how doth he rejoyce, and leap and skip,
and sing for joy, that he is with him alone? that
he enjoyeth him only, that nothing hinders, nor
molests their sweet intercourse, their sweet
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:105293:139"/>
imbraces, their mutual Delight, Joy, and Love.</p>
            <p n="88">88. Love cannot endure to be molested, when
it hath what it would have, there is none so rich,
so happy, so honourable as he, that is thus loved by
God, and lives alwayes in his love, and is by him,
from his love, made to walk worthy of his love;
for such is Gods love, that he accepteth the willing
will that is in us, for the working deed, when that
it is upright true, real and sincere.</p>
            <p n="89">89. On Christ, the King of love, the soveraign
tye and chaine of love, thy love is so lovely, so
shining, so transpiercing, so bright, so burning, so
Conquering, so consuming that all other loves are
consum'd at the very approach of thy love; at thy
comeing they flye away, they are not heeded,
minded, remembred, nor thought on any more,
nay to forget them all what ever they be, bringeth
joy, even such joy as is unspeakable, for then the
soul and body, and all the facultyes and members
thereof are filled with thee, and thy joyes which
are such as no tongue can tell, nor no heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

Ah let it thus be ever with me, let me

to enjoy him, he is at rest, at ease, he hath
all that he would have, that he can ask or crave, yea
much above all that ever he did ask or think, so

for that they make thee vile in Gods eyes, and

Dost thou much more love heaven for God than

what thy death be, though poor, hunger-starved,

dost thou find that all that thou dost is nothing

things are too too unholy, and all thine all even
nothing at all; thou art altogether ashamed of
thy self that thou art what thou art, and abhorrest
thy self in dust and ashes, accounting thy self (as

Dost thou thus condemn thy self, loath and abhor
thy self, and art thus truly angry with thy self, and
ashamed of thy self, and of all thy doings, and
marvellest how thou canst find acceptance at such

we have our eyes opened to see him, and know
him as he is to be known and seen, which is by
faith from love.</p>
            <p n="144">144. To hear God, we must resolve to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

Son be of good chear, thy sins are forgiven thee, I

God, which is after his likenesse, to be like him,
for it cannot else be satisfied, no not with all

thou wilt be my guide, and if thou art my
guide, O God, I am sure thou art my God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If, O God, thou goest with me, I am sure
that all will goe well with me, but if thou goest not
with me, I am sure that what ever I do will be ill
with me, and for me.</p>

            <p n="8">8. I love truth in all things, it is only truth that
makes all things unto me lovely, for where truth
is, there we may safely and truly say that God is,
for God is truth.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Let, O God, alwayes truth abide in me,
and I in truth.</p>

gladdeth my heart, and makes it to rebound
upward, to skip and leap as a Kid on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,

            <p n="11">11. Truth is to me as a pretious Oyntment, an

alwayes.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Truth brings down (as it were) Heaven
unto me, and carryes me up againe into it.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Truth speaks loud in the ears of my soul,
and fills it with joy, and continual and abundant

            <p n="15">15. Truth is a balme to heal all sores, to fill up
all scarrs, to make us without blemish, faire and
beautifull.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Truth never grows old, but is alwayes,
young, strong, and tender, it keeps us fast to him,
and him fast to us, whom only we desire to hold
fast, and never to let goe.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Truth hath power to weaken all that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
in us, to bring it under untill it be conquered
finally, and destroyed totally.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Truth inflames our hearts, that they are as
a fire newly kindled, which cannot easily be
quenched.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Truth aboundeth over all, and makes us to
abound likewise, so that we know both how to
want and how to abound.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Truth inableth to goe beyond all things,
for truth bringeth us home to possesse all things,
even to possesse God, the God and giver of all
things, who is truth.</p>
            <p n="21">21. By truth we are inabled to lead new lives,
and to have holy affections frequent in us, our
hearts being set on earth.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Truth is lovely, amiable, beautiful, desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as the finest gold that cannot be finer.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Truth maketh us (unlovely) lovely, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
bright, shining, transparent and glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a beame, a spark, a coale, a little light of that
great light, in whom we are comprehended, but

incomprehensible.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Truth makes us alwayes lovely, fair and
beautiful in his eyes, who can behold no falsity,
no evil.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Truth is that mantle to cover our many
infirmityes, and to make us that with bouldness
we may approach that glorious Sun, and not be
burnt; that glorious day, and pertake of its glory,
that will cloud and eclipse the errours that are yet
in us, and make us to feel and to know that we are
bound up in this blessed mantle with his hand
that will take care over us and for us, that no evil
any more hurt us.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Ah God, the God of truth, and my God,
let this truth of thine never depart from me, nor I
from it; let me shine in it more and more, that I
may be resplendent and glorious, alwayes shining
in thy sight, that thou mayest delight to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, to love me, and to honour me, making me
thy delight, in and through the Son of thy love,
and the Saviour and Redeemer of my soul, Jesus
Christ the Righteous, let my heart be alwayes a
heart of truth, a true heart, serving thee unfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and doing alwayes all that I do in truth, from
love.</p>
            <p n="27">27. When God is present, there is present all

nothing but good, he being the best, the

            <p n="30">30. Who can, ah who can recount, express,
tell, or set forth the gracious, magnificent, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent,
bountiful bountifulness of our God in
Jesus Christ; its height is too high, its breadth is
too broad, its length is too long, and its depth is
too deep. As it is only his own Spirit that can tell
what is in his mind for our good, so it is only they,
they only that possess his Spirit that can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

            <p n="34">34. It is unto thee, O Christ, that I come to

            <lg>
               <l>Let the world and devil use all their skill,</l>

            </lg>
            <p n="36">36. I am sure that God will sit and prepare me
for all trials and afflictions whatsover, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or in the trial of affliction.</p>
            <p n="37">37. Ah Lord, I beseech thee give me this
grace, that I may desire grace, pray for grace, and
prize grace here on earth, as I do and shall do
glory hereafter in heaven, for I know that he that
hath not grace here shall not have glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
and the more grace here, the more glory
hereafter.</p>
            <p n="38">38. If then I live the life of grace here, I am
as sure I shall live the life of glory hereafter.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Me thinks it is much too low a thing
for a Christian to desire any thing, either here or
hereafter for himself alone. If I desire any thing
here, methinks it is chiefly for other, most of all
for others to refresh and comfort them. I desire
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:105293:152"/>
to have that I may have to give; as for my self,
any condition (I praise God) would now fully
please me, would now fully content me; yea, I
am fully perswaded that any bitter, yea, all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
would be to me sweet, in povertie, I should
find riches, in banishment libertie, in dishonour
honour, in contempt applause, in being despised
rejoyce; and though I had nothing, yet me thinks
I should enjoy all things.</p>
            <p n="40">40. My God knows how much I desire heaven,
but more for his sake then for my own sake, he
knoweth, that knoweth all the secrets of my heart,
that with my heart and soul I love him more
(much by much) then my self. I am so unlovely
to my self, that I cannot, that I dare not love my
self but in subordination to him, and for him, that
I may praise him, that I may prize him, that I
may fear him, that I may love him, ah that I may
love him, obey him, and adore him.</p>
            <p n="41">41. To love God I am unfit, I am unworthy,
because I cannot, ah because I cannot love him as
I would, as I should. Indeed, if thus it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for me to love him, ah how would I delight
even in my own love, and love my self, if that I
had such a heart according to his heart, to love
him only with my whole heart, even with a holy
heart.</p>
            <p n="42">42. But I find my heart so dull, so dead, so cold,
so benumm'd, so Icy and frozen, that there is not
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:105293:153"/>
that heat left within me (of love) as I would, as
I desire, and as I should have for my God, for my
good, for my heaven, for my bliss, for my rest, for
my peace, and for my only joy, all which is my
God.</p>
            <p n="43">43. Ah my Love, thou art altogether unlovely,
because thou dost not, and because thou canst not
love as thou shouldst what thou shouldst love, and
because thou lovest so much too much what thou
shouldst not love (thy self) thy unlovely loveless
self.</p>
            <p n="44">44. Ah Lord, my Lord, it is thee, it is thee
that my soul with all my heart would love, and
would if it could love none else, love none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
in comparison of thee; and thou knowst, O
Lord my God, I desire sincerely, and would be
filled with this grace of Love; but for thee alone,
alone for thee, for thee, my God, my God, who art
to me onlie lovelie; let I beseech thee all other
love that is disordinate decrease, that loving these
less, I may love thee more; love thee so as thou
requirest and deservest, that is, above all things in
heaven above, or on earth below.</p>
            <p n="45">45. I know, O Lord, that thou art with me of
a truth, because thy truth is with me, that is, in me
of a very truth.</p>
            <p n="46">46. Love from God fills our hearts with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and true love for God, or Gods love to us fills
us with love for him, his love sweetly constraineth
us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:105293:153"/>
47. Ah how light, how light is that heart that
is emptied of all sin, being unburdened of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
burden; for if a wounded heart cannot
be born, ah then when such a heart is made whole,
it must needs bring ease, refreshing, comfort, and
unspeakable joy.</p>
            <p n="48">48. When God is in the heart it may be seen
in the face, and perceived by the words that come
out of the mouth; such a lustre is on the whole
man, both within and without, when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God by his Spirit is within, he is surelie
beautiful in the eyes of all beholders that delight
and desire to behold the face of God in Jesus
Christ, the very Majestie of God (in some sort) is
on such a soul, and through the glorious light of
Christs gracious face his face doth shine in the
sight of God, and all good men.</p>
            <p n="49">49. I will make no condition with thee, O God,
but only this, that is, to love thee only in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
as my God, and my only good.</p>
            <p n="50">50. Ah Lord, I most unfeignedlie and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
beseech thee let me never taste of this bitter
bitter, that is, to find any sin sweet.</p>
            <p n="51">51.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>But let all sin, even all, oh all,</l>
               <l>Be unto me as wormwood and gall.</l>
            </lg>
            <p n="52">52. Ah Lord, I humbly beseech thee never suffer
the remembrance of the former pleasures of sin
to please me, but let their remembrance be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
displeasing, hateful and detestabel, and to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:105293:154"/>
be delivered from them; let it be unto me as the
deliverance from death, and from Hell.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Let the fire of thy grace quench totally the
heat and fire of all and every lust, sinful, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
affection, that I may henceforth burn on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the fire of Love to thy Laws.</p>
            <p n="54">54. The true life of God in a Christian is most
of all and plainliest seen by his hatred to all evil and
sin, and by his unfeigned, sincere, ardent, and
continual Love to all that is good; he loves all
that is good in all, to see it though a far off; to
hear it spoken of by any whatsoever; but to find
it in himself, most of all joyes and satisfies him;
to see any evil committed, or to hear any evil spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by any, troubles and afflicts him; such is his
Antipathy against it, that he will not give it the
least hearing, or parley, no nor cast the least glance
of an eie to favour it, it is abominable to him in
thought, word, and deed, and in all its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
even in all. And as well hath the whole
man, all the faculties of the Soul, hatred to the
least circumstance of all ill, as well as to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
but the degree and measure, is according to
the measure or degree, or nature of the ill, but
its alike hated (sincerely) as well the very least as
the very greatest of all. And in the same manner
and measure is his unfeigned Love to all that is
good; he thanks, and praiseth, and priezth God,
for good thoughts, as heartily and sincerly, as for
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:105293:154"/>
good words, or actions, because he as plainly
seeth the true Love of God in the very least par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticualr,
as in the very gretest, And 'tis the Love
of God, which is his presence in Love, that
makes his Soul to leap within him, with joy. When
that the Soul sees his God, it sees all his good, his
Heaven, his blisse, his peace, his Love, his joy,
his rest his whole and only delight, contentment
and comfort; But in the most good he seeth him
most, and therefore desireth to do the most good
that ever was done, or is possible to be done, and
therein he is best pleased, because that pleaseth his
God best, and to please him is his only pleasure, all
his pleasure, joy, and delight only; it is his Heaven,
and therefore he makes it his only happinesse.</p>
            <p n="55">55. Ah God my God, and my only good, let
it be I most humbly and unfaignedly beseech thee
in Jesus Christ, alwaies thus with me, that my
soul may be satisfied, may be solaced, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresht
and comforted, by thy living in me, and
by my living alwaies in thee, and unto thee, to
thine eternal honour, praise, and glory, for thine

grace, that I may live this life here on Earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
I come to live that life, that I shall after this
is ended, live with thee in Heaven. So be it Lord.
So be it. Amen. Amen.</p>

               <l>Who both tast, know, feel, find, savour, and see,</l>
               <l>That thou livest in us, and that we live in thee.</l>

            <p n="57">57. Empty me, O Lord of all, even of all,
that I may be sit to receive, and be filled with thy
fulnesse, even with thy blessed most blessed self,
the Ocean and Sea of all goodnesse.</p>
            <p n="58">58. As long as we are full, or in part filled with
World, flesh, of self, so much lesse room there
is for God; for when a Vessel is full it can receive
nothing, and according to the measure its empty,
it is capable to receive.</p>
            <p n="59">59. How then, Ah how then should we labour
to empty our hearts of all that is not of God, that
we may be filled only with God, with God only,
and alwaies be thus empty, that we may be thus

we are empty, we are capable to receive, and

of unspeakable joyes and pleasures, if we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and labour earnestly and sincerely to empty
our selves of our selves, and of all fleshly world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasures and joyes, which are but meer fancies,
vanities, fooleries, and toyes.</p>
            <p n="60">60. Ah Lord God, the Fountain and the Ocean,
that can never be emptied, empty I most humbly
and unfainedly beseech thee, in the name and for
the merits of thy Son and my Saviour Jesus
Christ, my heart of all things, even of all, what

desirable, and to be desired only; grant that all
the Worlds all, may be more and more unto me
nothing, even nothing at all, that thou maiest be
all mine, and I all thine, that I may love all things
out of thee lesse, and lesse daily, and thee, O God,
more and more, until I so love thee as it may not
be possible for me to love thee more, that my
Love may cause me so to sink into thee, as I may
see my self in thee and thee in me, yea that I may

            <p n="61">61. The greatest gift that God can give us, is
himself by Christ, and then Faith to believe it; a
heart to love him and rejoyce in it, and to praise
him continually for it.</p>
            <p n="62">62. And this will work in us unfained sincere
ardent true Love, which will cast out all fear, of

or grieve him any more, seeing he hath given us
himself, to make us his for ever and for ever.</p>
            <p n="63">63. The greatest gift that God gives man here
on Earth, is, to assertain and assure him, by his

own Spirit, that he hath and will give him him
self, for ever hereafter, to behold his face in
Heaven, and that we are his, and shall be his for
ever.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Ah Lord God, I beseech thee augment and
increase my Faith, that it may remove the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of my sins altogether out of my sight, that
they may never shadow thy graces in me any
more; but that I may alwaies say, as now thine
own Spirit in me causeth me to say sweetly, and
boldly, that thou art mine, and I am thine, that
so I may in all needs, wants, crosses, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whatsoever (say) I have enough, I shall not
want, I cannot be poor, because the Lord is
my God, and my Portion, for ever and for
ever.</p>
            <p n="65">65. Ah Lord God, let me feel anew and afresh
daily, what I have felt of thy Love and kindnesse
in truth, and know more and more clearly that
thou art mine and that I am thine; let me be still
constantly assured that thou art my Lord and my
God, and that thou wilt never leave me nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
me, but wilt live in me for ever and for
ever.</p>
            <p n="66">66. Let all doubts and fears be scattered, that
Satan may never gather them together to molest
or trouble me, that my joy may be full, that I
may alwaies joy, in this thy so great Salvation, and
be made glad by the light of thy countenance,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:105293:156"/>
shining upon me, which is better much by much,
and cheareth more than any wine.</p>
            <p n="67">67. It is a most sweet thing to live free from
all sin.</p>
            <p n="68">68. To see our selves as we are in our selves,
and as we are in Christ; in our selves black, ugly,
deformed, loathsome, filthy and abominable;
but in Christ comly, fair, beautiful, white, clean,
pure, bright, delightful and spotlesse, to see our
selves in our selves darknesse, black, thick horrible
darknesse; but in Christ transparent, transcendent
bright light; to see our selves in our selves weak,
but in Christ strong; to see our selves in our selves
barren, but in Christ fruitful; to see our selves in
our selves very foolishnesse, but in Christ ture
Wisdom; to see our selves in our selves lovelesse,
but in Christ lovely; to see our selves in our
selves nothing, but in Christ all things; to see
our selves in our selves sinners, miserable sinners,
members of Satan, heirs of Hell and eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but in Christ, Ah in Christ our Christ,
without sin, as if we had never sinned, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his own glorious body, and coheirs with
him of Eternal Life and Glory; thus Faith doth
cause us to see our selves, when our eyes are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p n="69">69. I had much rather by much, have Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
than any grace of comfort or assurance; I
had rather much by much be wholly obedient and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:105293:157"/>
want assurance, than have assurance, and fail in
any point of obedience.</p>
            <p n="70">70. Ah God my God, and my only good, give
this grace that I may be wholly obedient, unto all
thy holy Laws and Divine Commandments; for
as thou lookest on it as the best of Sacrifices, so my
Soul rejoyceth more in it, than in all graces; for
me thinks it comprehends all graces to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from true sincere unfained Love. Such a one
would be wholy holly, do thy whole and holy will
alwaies; for such a Soul makes the keeping of thy
Commandments the only joy of his heart, and the
solace of his Soul.</p>
            <p n="71">71. What, Ah what a sweet most sweet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is it to live in God only, and to see our
selves in him; for then the heart desires nothing
else, nor the mind minds nothing else, nor the
will chuse any thing else, nor the affections love
any thing else, nor the Soul cares for any thing else,
nay it rejoyceth for that it is thus divorst from all
things else, an Ah, how it chuseth and desireth
thus to be ever, to be ever thus, to joy only in
God, and to make God only his joy.</p>
            <p n="72">72. The heart and Soul is then to the World,
and to all the things of the World, as a man asleep,
he values no more Crowns, Scepters not King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
wisdome, strength, beauty, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
or pleasures, than a stock or a stone doth,
or can do; he is so senslesse, so benum'd, frozen,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:105293:157"/>
icy, and cold, that he hath no sense or feeling, he
is caught up above all these high things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and when he doth return to consider them.
Ah how low, vain, and foolish, doth he account
them, nay he maketh not any account of them at
all, either great or smal.</p>
            <p n="73">73. He weeps to see that he hath esteemed
them as he hath, and laughs at their folly that do
chuse them for their choice, best, soveraign and
chief good.</p>
            <p n="74">74. A Soul in such a condition saith, what have
I any more to do with such Idols; Ah that I
could, faith such a Soul, ever enjoy my God so, as
that all things out of him and besides him, might
give me no joy.</p>
            <p n="75">75. Such a Soul saith, when, and whilst I have
the best good, the soveraign good, take the other
he that will; I would, Ah I would with my whole
heart give all to any, so I could give the thoughts
of it likewise, that it might never more come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my thoughts, but that I might be so swallowed
up in God, as he might only contain me, and be
all my all.</p>
            <p n="76">76. What hath the King more than the beggar,
or what is he more? when he is asleep (as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment)
the beggar then wants nothing of what
his heart desireth, and the King possesseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
then, of all that he possesseth, according
to the desires of his heart, they are then alike,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:105293:158"/>
frustrate of all things, and possesse nothing.</p>
            <p n="77">77. Even so it is with the Soul, nay with the
whole man, when he is drawn in, drowned, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
or swallowed up in God, he is asleep, yea
dead to all things out of God, and besides God,
and saith, what are all these outward, glorious,
beautiful Objects, to those which I did enjoy in
God? Ah if I could, if I could, alwaies possesse
these, what would I care for them? they are to
me at such times even as if they were not, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of what they are at other times. I can
and do now heartily laugh them to scorn, and have
them in contempt and derision, my God, my God,
is so good, he is so good and so delightful, as
he is now become my whole and my sole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p n="78">78. Ah if it could be ever thus with me, I am
sure I should never want any of these things that
the flesh craves, not bread to feed me, not drink
to refresh me, not cloaths to cover me, having
and possessing the things above, and could they,
Ah and could they alwaies be possest, I think none
but mad men and fools, will dare say, that we
want any of the things below, though we should
want them all. As to me, I am sure I should not
find any vvant. If I could be alvvaies, as I have
been sometimes.</p>
            <p n="79">79. But, O Lord, I praise thee, O Lord I
mightily prize and praise thee, that I am content
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:105293:158"/>
with thy will, that is, yet to live in this Bacca, in
this Wilderness, and in this Valley of tears as
long as thou wilt; yea, I am so content, that I
pray heartily with my whole heart, Let thy will
be done on me wholly as thou wilt, and not as I
I will or would, I desire to be only, only to be
what thou wilt have me to be, thine, O Lord
thine, and not my will be done, untill thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

<hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="80">80. To have all things, and not to have God
sure, is to have nothing sure; to possess all things,
and not to possess God, is to possess nothing; all
things besides God is vanity, foolishness, nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
will fly from us, and leave us for ever, even
then, and when we have most need of help, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
and defence, but God will leave us never.
If we be his, he will surely stand by us, defend us,
assist us, and give us all that we shall stand in
need of, yea, much above what we can ask or
think.</p>
            <p n="81">81. The very least mercy or blessing, either on
body or soul, which I have received from God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
much more praise, by much, than I am able
to give unto God, though I should continually
praise him, and live continually to his praise, for
what am I, poor despicable I, that I should receive
any thing from the hand of God! But ah how
much less then from the heart of God (in
love.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:105293:159"/>
82. I know, O Lord God, that thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to my feebleness, to make me strong; to my
poverty, despicable povertie, to make me rich for

with thy blessed, most blessed self; to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness

to make me clean; to my uncomliness, to make
me comelie; to my ugliness, to make me lovelie;
to my wretchedness and miserie, to make me ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and blessed; and to my nothingness, to

fathom the sea, and count the stars in heaven, and
yet how much more unable and hard is it to
measure, to comprehend, and understand the
height, the depth, the length, and the breadth of
the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
            <p n="84">84. His goodness is as his greatness, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensiblie

incomprehensiblie good.</p>
            <p n="85">85. Thy presence, O God, thy presence, makes
all things that are bitter, sweet, and thy absence
makes all sweet things bitter.</p>
            <p n="86">86. O God, 'thou givest such gifts to men,
that they can see even here in the flesh (by the

they have alreadie (as it were) what they shall

because that thou, O God, that art all good art

hell is hell; Heaven is filled with thy smiles,

Heaven is filled with thy love, and therefore it is

            <p n="107">107. By seeing my failings and my fallings thou

finding no true love in me for thee, I thought, O

that thou did'st hate me, because indeed I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
hateful. But now I know (and for which
I heartily and sincerely desire ever to praise thee)
that thine anger is turned away, and that thine
hand is stretched out still over me, to preserve,

110. So that what I thought was my ill, I now
know is my greatest good; that thou seest me (O
God) that thou alwayes seest me, and I would not
but that thou did'st alwayes see me, as well when I
am in my sins, in my worst case and condition, as
when at the very best, because at the very best thou
canst see (I acknowledge and sincerely consess)
nothing in me, that thou should'st do any good to
me or for me, so bad is my very best, so empty no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
and vile is all mine all. And knowing thee
now, O Lord God, by thine own sweet name of
love and mercy, I am not (I praise thee) at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
that thou see in me all my sins (past) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast given me a free pardon for them
(present sins) because having pardoned those, I
am as sure that thou wilt pardon these, neither am
I afraid of my sins to come, because I know that
thou art never weary doing good, and that thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me. Wherefore, O Lord, seeing that thou
art become my Lord, and my God, I now most
humbly beseech thee to look on me at all times, in
all places and things, what ever my failings or my
fallings be, to recover me, and comfort me as thou

O God, my God, that thou art such a God as thou

            <p n="114">114. I sincerely confesse, and professe, were I
to spend all my daies to praise thee, that the time

praiseth thee, and rejoyceth; for that there shall be
no end of that time which thou hast, O God, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
wherein I shall speak of and sing thy praises;
it shall be World without end, that I shall praise
thee, O God, the God of my Salvation, and my

me, as wine to comfor me, as cloaths to cloth me,
as riches of all sorts to inrich me; let it be to me
alwaies all things. Let it not lose its worth nor
fast by lying, but let it be alwaies as the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb,
dropping honey to revive and comfort and

thou art, and that thou changest not, thou art still
the same God blessed for ever and for ever.</p>
            <p n="116">116. Ah Lord, let me never forget these thy

            <p n="117">117. Many times God is so good and gratious
so merciful and loving unto us, that then, even
then, when we fear we shall see his frowns, that
he will frown on us when we come before him;
He, to our great astonishment and admiration
smiles on us When we fear that he will strike us
with the rod of his anger, he imbraceth and kiss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:105293:164"/>
us, with the kisses of exceeding transcendent
Love, when we fear he will be absent, he is then
many times most sweetly present, surpassing much

our selves, and are heartily ashamed and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by reason of our weaknesses, failings, and
imperfections, he sheweth that he will not punish
us, when we do as it were thus freely and severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punish our selves; he knoweth of what we are
made, and that we are but dust, and yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
that we love him, fear him, prise him,
praise him, and believe him, and make him and his
Love all our delight and joy.</p>
            <p n="220">220. Ah Lord, suffer me never more to requite
this thy exceeding great kindnesse, with the least,

            <p n="121">121. When a Soul sees himself free from the

Love, liking, or allowing of any sin, it see, its self
in God, and how it is made partaker of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, that it is a little spark or beam of that
glorious Light, which is pure, trasparent, bright
and clear, and having no mixture, nor no cloud;
for sin only brings darknesse in the Soul, sin only
is the cloud which eclypses the Light of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Sun; sin only darkens, and weakens our
sight, and our knowledge, and hinders us that we
do not nor cannot see our selves as we are in God,
but when that sin is done away totally, that is all
Love, liking, and allowance; then are the eies
of our understanding opened, and all darknesse is
swallowed up, done away, and wholy and totally
consumed, and we are swallowed up in to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Light, by which we are made to see and know
our selves as we are in God, a part, (as it were) of
this Light, even this Light it self in some measure,
it is so in us, and we are so in it; we see our selves
clear and free from all fears and cares, being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from them, and having obtained the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of knowledge desired, or desirable; that is;
that we are partakers of him that is all purity, all
light, all wisdom, all serenity, peace, contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and rest, all passions ceasing of desiring more,
for all the desires are satisfied, having this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to see our selves and know our selves to be

his thoughts) is on any sinne, though never so
smal, or never so little, if in the least measure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto, it robs him at that time, of all his
happinesse, his sight is darkned, his eies are so

that it presseth the Soul downward, to Hell,
to the Devil, which plainly shews its Center,
whence it is, and what it is, for the time that it is
thus liked, or loved, or but connived at, it meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoses
the Soul, and makes it instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God-like, Spiritual, Knowledge, Light, Purity,

downward, and not able in the least measure
to look upward, or to hope, or to think, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
this is the nature of sin, and of the man

down, and giving it self up unto all fears,
horribly ashamed and confounded, being dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

think, that he knoweth what condition is best for
him, and be so bold as to say, that a contrary
condition to that which God gives him and sends
him would be better for him; as if God knew
not when best to fill us with joyes, and when
with sorrows, and when to take the one and the
other from us. If he sends me alwaies joyes, I
will alwaies rejoyce, and if he fill me alwaies
with sighing and sorrows, I am sure he will fit me
for that condition also; and also in it to make
me to rejoyce: Let the Lord do unto me alwaies

of the love of God, we cannot being cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his nature, loving what he loves (holinesse
and Righteousnesse) but hate what he hates, which
is all sin and wickednesse, having put Christ Jesus
on, we must put the other off, the world, flesh,

and holding him fast, we must and will, and can
do no other still, then let goe our hold to all things
out of him and besides him, for according as our
love is to the one, so our hatred will be, nay is to
the other, they being contraryes and opposite one
unto another.</p>
            <p n="160">160. He that truly loves the wayes of God,
which is Righteousnesse, must, doth, and can do
no other then hate the wayes of the Devil, which is
sin, we cannot serve two such Masters, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to love two such Contraryes.</p>

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:105293:171"/>
to the one, we may see and be sure of our unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
sincere, and true love to the other, and if we
thus love truly all good, we love God truly, which
ought and should assure us that we are beloved of
God, yea that we are his beloved, through Jesus
Christ the truly beloved, whom he doth and ever
will love truly, &amp; us in him, for his love is not yea

and therefore he that wants thee wants all, though
he wants nothing else at all.</p>
            <p n="163">163. He that possesseth thee, O God, possesseth
surely the best possession that is or can be possest.</p>
            <p n="164">164. He that knows thee, O God, hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge, for none doth or can know thee,
but from and by thy holy spirit of true wisdome
and knowledge, all knowledge and wisdome else,
to this is meer foolishnesse.</p>
            <p n="165">165. When we are in thee, O God, we are
truly free, free from all evil, and filled with all
good, for all good is in thee, and comes freely from
thee, as the Rivers from the Sea.</p>
            <p n="166">166. Wash me, make me clean, O God, in
and by Christ, that I may be pure in thy sight, even
as gold well refined, without any dross or mixture,
perfectly pure, pure in perfection.</p>
            <p n="167">167. By giving, we receive, that is, when our
hearts are drawn forth sincerely to give what God
hath given us, (I mean of spirituals) God gives us
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:105293:172"/>
what we would have, yea and much above what we
did ask or could think.</p>
            <p n="168">168. When thus we beg for others, to have,
that we may have to give; Ah how good, gratious
&amp; bountiful is the Lord unto us, in giving of us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our hearts desires, even the very desires
of our hearts.</p>
            <p n="169">169. When thus we desire grace, to impart it
unto others, how agreeable unto God are our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
how, Ah how doth he regard us, &amp; reward us.</p>
            <p n="170">170. When thus we are beggers for others,
God maketh us rich with the treasures of Heaven,
with that true riches which will make us rich for
ever, which is grace here, and glory hereafter.</p>
            <p n="171">171. When thus we mind others good and
welfare as our own, making their case ours, sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathising
with them, both in their good and evil,
in their present and future happinesse, then we
shew forth that we live in God, and that God liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in us, for where true love is, God is, for love
is God, and God is love.</p>
            <p n="172">172. When we feel want in our Brethrens
wants, and are filled with what they are filled;
bearing their burthens of grief and sorrow with
them, it shews that we are of one heart, and of
one mind, that we are Brethren, if we have thus
compassion one of another.</p>
            <p n="173">173. And when we make their joyes our joyes,
it shews plainly that there is one spirit in us, even
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:105293:172"/>
the spirit of the love of God (which is Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
our Lord) who leadeth us in his paths, and
teacheth us to practise what he hath commanded
us, and his Children we are whom we obey, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of sin unto death, or of Righteousnesse unto
life. By their works ye shall know (as God) who
are his.</p>
            <p n="174">174. When thus we are unto others what we
are unto our selves, it sheweth plainly that we are
members of Christs mystical body, and that he is
our head.</p>
            <p n="175">175. When thus we agree and sympathise in
one anothers honour and dishonour, sorrows and
joys, we shew forth that we are not two but one,
and this oneness sheweth also, that we are one in
Christ, that he liveth in us, and that we live in
him, that he is ours, and that we are his.</p>
            <p n="176">176. And when Christ thus owneth us for his
own, we may be sure that when he cometh at his
second and sudden coming in glory, we shall also
appear with him, and be made like him, glorious
as he is glorious, though not so glorious.</p>
            <p n="177">177. He that thinks any thing more worth then
Christ, is not worthy of Christ.</p>
            <p n="178">178. He that would not willingly loose all
things for him, and for his sake, shall never have
him, not of him partake.</p>
            <p n="179">179. He that holds any thing dearer then
Christs love, shall never partake of his love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:105293:173"/>
180. But he that loveth him above all things
beyond all things, and more then all things, may
surely say that he hath all things, for as Christ is
above all, God blessed for ever and for ever, so he
is all in all unto all those that truly love him.</p>
            <p n="181">181. So sure as we would, that he did love us;
so sure it is that he doth love us, and more surer
much by much, and so much as we would that he
did love us, so much he doth love us, and yet much
more by much, and so strongly, and continually as
we would that he did love us, so doth he, and so
will he, even unto the end, for there is, nor never
shall be any end of his love, he will love whom he
doth love, world without end, for ever and for
ever.</p>
            <p n="182">182. So sure as we are Gods creatures, so sure
is he our God, and so sure as he is the Father of all
mercies, so sure is he our Father; and therefore
sure it is that we are his dear children, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
surely he will be ever unto us a most loving
and merciful Father; delighting to do us good,
and to make us his very delight, in Jesus Christ, out
eldest Brother, blessed Saviour and Redeemer.</p>
            <p n="183">183. O Lord, I have no good in me but what
comes from thee, I say none at all either great or
small.</p>
            <p n="184">184. From thee, O Lord alone, I have all that
I have, therefore me and all mine, I confesse and

            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:105293:173"/>
185. How weary, Ah how weary am I of my
self? and yet not so weary as I would be, because
I keep not thy Laws.</p>
            <p n="186">186. How loathsome, Ah how loathsome am
I to my self, and yet not so much by much as I
would be? because I love thee not, O God my
God, as I would, and as I should love thee.</p>
            <p n="187">187. That God is what he is, is the greatest
and chiefest joy of all those that love him, fear
him, know him, and have given up themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
            <p n="188">188. The presence of God (which is Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him through his Holy Spirit) is the feast
of fat and pleasant things, yea the Feast of Feasts
unto that Soul, and every Soul that hath truly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
of him.</p>
            <p n="189">189. In his presence is all joy, unspeakable joy,
and from his right hand flow continual pleasures
for evermore.</p>
            <p n="190">190. The good, and the only good that a soul
in God desireth, chooseth, longeth for, and pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
continually after, being ever hungry and a
thirst to enjoy, is, in some measure to be like him
in all things, alwaies to be conformable unto him,
to put him on, and that he may never put him
off.</p>
            <p n="191">191. The goodnesse of God, is suc ah souls
only goodnesse; the glory of God is such a souls
only glory; the honour of God is such a souls

only honour; the wisdom of God is such a souls
only wisdom; the riches of God is such a souls
only riches; and the love of God is such a souls
only love, God being only his, his only good,
his only all in all, alwaies: All that is Gods, is
dear and near unto him, yea is his dearest and his
nearest of all things, either in Heaven above, or
on Earth below, his cause such a soul makes his,
and his truth and waies he is so wedded unto, as he
only joyeth in the remembrance of them, and for
that he is by his Holy Spirit thus strictly wedded
unto them, having chosen them for his Love,
his delight, his refreshings, and rejoycings, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his heart in some measure according to Gods
heart, and his mind according to the mind of
God.</p>
            <p n="192">192. All that is in all creatures, both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

God, all their strength is from his strength, all
their Power from his Power, all their might from
his might, all their wisdom from his wisdom, all

from his lovelinesse, all their goodnesse from his

all their riches from his riches, and
all their peace from him who is the God of

all happinesse in himself, and is his own felicity
and blisse. Thus from Gods all, all Creatures,
Saints, and Angels, have their all, and therefore
they return unto him alwaies, as all due is, all
Honour, Glory, Power, Might, Majesty, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and Thanksgiving, for ever, and for

            <p n="193">193. Ah God, how great is thy greatnesse?
how good. Ah how good is thy great goodnesse?
how deliciously sweet is thy sweetnesse? how

how beautiful, Ah how beautiful is thy

blessed in thee, even from thy ever blessed bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse.</p>
            <p n="195">195. The Lord would not give me the World
at full, till he had first fully given me Heaven, to
the end that I might not love what I should not,
but what I should, that I might not love most the
lesse, but the most; that is, having the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the worth of heaven, I might chuse it,
prize it, love it, and make it my whole choyce, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and love; for if the Lord had first given
me my fill of the World (I should doubtlesse)
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:105293:175"/>
have satisfied my self therewith, and rested on it,
and sought only after it, and not have minded
Heaven, nor the things in Heaven; I should
have made these low things here below, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
things in my esteem and choyce, and sought
no other Heaven than thus to have lived on earth
possessing earthly things.</p>
            <p n="196">196. But now blessed be God for his goodness,
though I have earthly things in abundance, I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
account and prize them, but as the things
of earth, even as durt dung and drosse, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the things of Heaven; yea with those
things of Heaven, that God giveth here on earth
to those that love him; for he that hath seen, that
hath tasted, and that knows the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
must needs acknowledge, confesse, and say,
Ah how low are all these things here below,
when compared with the things above, they are
all even nothing at all, empty, poor, despicable
poor low things.</p>
            <p n="197">197. The Lord would not suffer me to possess
the things of the flesh first, ere he had feasted,
resatiated, and satisfied me with the things of the
Spirit, with Heavenly and Spiritual things, that I
might be able to make a fit choice, to chuse fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

            <p n="1">1. THe happiness of a Christian in this World
or in this life (he makes, as to me) to be
strength against all sin, even against all, both great
and smal, against the lust of the eie, the lust of the
flesh, and the pride of life, that he may totally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
and alwaies, all sinful, worldly, fleshly
lustings and affections, so that he commit not
consent unto, no evil at all, either great or small,
but serve the Lord continually in sincerity and
godly simplicity, by all his thoughts words and
actions, doing all good alwaies, that is possible
to be done, at least, in his choice, will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The comfort of a Christian in this life is in
purity and holynesse of heart, mind, affection,
and thoughts, endeavouring alwaies with might
and main, to his very utmost, that he be not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with vain, foolish, fleshly thoughts,
cogitations, inclinations, or affections. The more
Spiritual, holy, heavenly, and the more perfect
he is, the more of the Divine Nature he hath, the
more of Heavens beauty, glory and happinesse is
in him; the more he hath of the glorious, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and ever blessed impress of the Image of God
in him, which shines forth unto his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:105293:176"/>
comprehension and reason, so irradiously and
brightly, that he is comforted, delighted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed,
with the very joyes and bliss in glory, he
is made partaker of those very joyes (though but
in a small measure) that the Angels and Saints en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
in Heaven; for such a soul possesseth God,
and his glory, and happinesse as they do; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
only is in the measure, or quantity, and
not in the certainty or quality, the Saints cup in
Heaven is full to the brim, when given them, and
they drink deep of those pleasures and joyes
which are at Gods right hand. But we indeed here,
have but a sip, a tast and away, they indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
these joyes alwaies without the least inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
But alas our enjoyment of these joys,
are short, but a very little moment, we cannot so
comprehend as they do how they are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
we see but darkly and know but in part,
however it is the same that they see and know,
and so are all things ours as well as theirs, both
things present and to come; for God being our
God, we have as much as they have, he being our
Portion, theirs is not, nor theirs cannot be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus is a Saint on Earth perfectly, substantially,
&amp; effectually in heaven, though on earth (at times)
and sees and beholds things there, as they are; for
a Saints heart which is his better part, and greatest
part, is alwaies in Heaven, though his body be on
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:105293:177"/>
Earth, his affections are above and burn in the
fire of Love (alwaies) for the things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
purity, holinesse, and love, his Meditations
and desires are on his God, in his God, and for
his God; and thus he dwelleth in God, and God
dwelleth in him, which is the sole entire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
comfort and joy of his life and soul, even as
it is theirs that enjoy and possesse God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Put these two together, a Christians hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
and a Christians comfort; for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be separated, yea there is such a onenesse in
them, as though they be two, yet they seem to be
but one; true one man may abound more in one
of them, and the other in another. Now I am
sure that there is not the man alive, nor never will
live, that knows the sweet, the worth, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of them, but will confesse and say, that
such a man is the only happy man, the comfortable
man the peaceable man, the rich and the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man; Ah man, man, who ever then thou art
that shalt be brought by Providence, I mean the
Spiritual and most favourable Providence of God
to peep here into; I pray thee, endeavour to pry
and look into this perfect Law of Liberty more
fully, more clearly, more plainly, than yet thou
hast, and thou shalt find what I have exprest, thy
self to be even in Heaven, and Heaven to be in
thee, though thou art on Earth, to be in God
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:105293:177"/>
and God to be in thee, which is both men and
Angels only good, bliss, happiness, comfort joy
and rest, which good Lord for thine only holy
names sake in Jesus Christ I most humbly beseech
thee cause me more and more to know, to feel, to
love and long after, and that it may be my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imployment to find out this incomparable
good, this wisdom of wisdom, those joys of all
joys, the only true and satisfactory, and to be
desired, esteemed, and rejoyced in. Let me then,
O God my God, I beseech thee be sequestred
from all things that tend to please, satisfie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,
solace, content or delight the flesh; for
I earnestly would, O God, if thou so wilt, that
thou wouldst alwaies be all mine all, (for thou
alone thou knowest) O God my God, art only
able to satisfie the ambitious and exorbitant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
desires of my mind, heart, and soul; for
it hanckers and hangs on thee, as thou knowest
continually; let me have thee, O God, let me so have
thee, as I may find and feel, that I have nothing
else, what ever else I may have. Let me be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up and consumed in thee, yea let me I most
humbly beseech thee, be as it were dead and sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
to all things out of thee, and besides thee,
and give me grace, that I may so live to thee here,
that I may ever live with thee he easter, as there,
so here, to blesse, praise, magnifie, laud, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and extol thy holy ever holy, most blessed,

most great, most gratious, and most glorious
name. So be it Lord, So be it. Amen. Amen.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Christians life should be (me thinks) but a
good thought, that is, alwaies thinking of God for
good, or at the most but as two thoughts, one of
Gods Goodnesse, Love, Mercy, and Kindnesse;
and the other of our own desparate badnesse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse,
ingratitude, and misery. Thus even
thus (me thinks) we should alwaies be, all the day
long, all our daies, unto the very end of our lives.</p>
            <p n="6">6. According as is our Spiritual warfare (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us) so is our peace, if there be an universal warr
in all the faculties of the Soul, and members of
the body, against all sin, then and only then do we
enjoy peace, true peace, full peace, and perfect
peace. Wherefore make first a Covenant with
thine eies, that they gaze not abroad, not look
irregularly, or wantonly. Secondly, with thine
ears, that thou take no pleasure, but avoid to heir
all vain, idle, foolish, or sinful talk. Thirdly,
with thine hands, that they touch no unclean
thing, that is, that they serve not as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(at any time) to do any evil. Fourthly, with
thy feet, that they carry thee not to do the thing
at any time, that is not altogether right in Gods
sight and esteem. Fifthly, with thy tongue, that
thou speak not vainly, lightly, idly, foolishly,
hurtfully, slanderously, or sinfully. But that which
shall honour thy God, edifie thee here, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:105293:178"/>
thine own soul, and give thee joy in the day
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Sixthly, with thy mirde,
that thou mind only the things of God, and what
are according to his mind. Seventhly, with thy
heart, that thou love not, seek not, choose not, prize
not any other thing, than what is according to Gods
heart. Eighthly, with all thy affections, to love
what God loveth, and to hate what God hateth,
and as he loveth and hareth them in sincerity and
truth continually. Ninthly and lastly, but not
the least, with thy thoughts, to suffer no evil, vain,
Idle, foolish gadding worldly affection to settle it
self there a moment, keep out all things thence,
but thy God, and the serious thoughts of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and of thine own badness, of his mercy, and
of thine own misery, of his Heaven, and of thine
own Hell, of his glory, and of thine own shame,
of his beauty, and of thine own deformity and ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
of his light, and of thine own darkness, of
his fulness, and of thine own emptiness, of his
fruitfulness, and of thine own barrenness, of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and of thine own weakness, of his Wisdome,
and of thine own foolishness, of his Patience, and
of thine own frowardness and pevishness; in a
word of his riches, which is above all, over all, and
more then all things much by much, either in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above or earth beneath, and of thine own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
poverty and nothingness at all, only a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
nothing, or nothing but sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:105293:179"/>
7. IS thus thou endeavourest to keep out all
things (but God and his wayes) out of all thy
thoughts alwayes, thou shalt I promise thee live
such a peaceable, quiet, comfortable, sanctified,
holy blessed life, as is unutterable, unexpressable;
for as thy thoughts are, so will be thy comforts, or
discomforts, thy joyes and rejoycings, or thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and bewaylings. Do thou thus draw
near to God, and thou shalt find him, and feel
him, and perceive him, and see him to draw near
unto thee, by his graces here, which will bring thee
to possess himself, his Heaven and his Glory for
ever hereafter.</p>
            <p n="8">8. God doth not give us such a measure of grace
here to free us altogether from our Corruptions,
infirmities and failings, for these two ends (as I
conceive) first, that we be not lifted up above
measure, as we should be, and think our selves to
be something, and that we are cloathed and rich,
and full; God knoweth that it is better for us to
see our Poverty, nakedness, and emptiness, that
we may be Inheritors with the Saints in life of all
the promises, both of things present and to come.
And not to be shut out of them with the evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and have our Portion in the Lake of fire and
Brimstone world without end. Again, secondly,
If thus we did live at our hearts ease, alwayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
temptations, failings or falls; we should sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with <hi>Peter,</hi> foolishly make Tabernacles here,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:105293:179"/>
and not care for any other Heaven; for indeed it
would be a Heaven. But not, Ah not such a
Heaven as our God hath prepared and provided
for us above, where we shall see him as he is to be
seen, and know him as he is to be known. If
we had here all that we would have, or could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and crave, we should not with holy Heavenly
enlightned Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> desire to be dissolved and
to be with Christ, which as he sayed well, truly,
and divinely, was much better by much, yea best
of all. And if we were not at times tempted,
how should we manifest the gifts and graces of
Gods spirit in us, as now through grace we do by
our fightings, strivings, struglings, wrestlings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings
in the heat of Zeal, and fire of fervent
love in truth, to keep our selves as valiant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants
in the holy Lifts of his Divine and blessed
Lawes and wayes, not flinching at all, or drawing
back in the least, or moving a foot. But standing
it out to the very last breath against all our spiritual
Enemies and Adversaries, within and without, of
Devils Lusts, worlds Lusts, and fleshly Lusts and
Corruptions. And here, by constant and faithful
engagements in this holy war, in this spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
in this Angelical fight, for the honour and
glory of the Eternal God, the King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords, we are confirmed, assured, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and setled by the whispers and sweet voyce of
his holy spirit within us, to our souls and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:105293:180"/>
that we shall in due time be made through
his strength and continual assistance more then
Conquerors; and shall at last sit down and rest in
peace Triumphantly, with the Patriarks, Prophets,
Apostles, Martyrs and Saints, wearing for ever the
Crown of Victory and Glory, in Glory, and be
arrayed with the long white robes of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
worthiness, merits, and obedience, and
ever live with him and his bliss, enjoying for ever
and ever his presence, his Heaven, yea himself,
who is the bliss of all bliss, the top and Crown of
all joy; the Heaven of Heaven in Heaven, and
the glory, beauty, splendour, and sublimity of
Glory in Glory.</p>
            <p n="9">9. See then, and consider, how much better
doth God deal with us, and carve to us, then we
can or would for our selves; how much, Ah how
much better is he to us and for us, then we would
be to and for our selves, how much more over and
above hath he prepared for us, and will surely give
us, then we are able to ask, then we are able to
think; wherefore let us learn to let him alone,
and pray him to deal vvith us, and do for us, as
seemeth him good; and alvvayes say in all things,
so Lord, so vvould I have it, seeing thou vvilt have
it so.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I also conceive that God suffers us to fall
at times for this end, or the like, that by our fall,
we may learn and be made to stand the faster, to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:105293:180"/>
rise the higher, and to stick the closer unto him,
who only is able to hold us up, and to keep us from
falling; me thinks if we did not sometimes fall,
not that I desire to fall or stumble at all, neither to
sin in the least, to have grace abound; but me
thinks if we did not at times fall, vve should not
see his Fatherly love so clearly, so greatly, in taking
care of us to preserve us, by protecting of us from
greater evils and dangers; for when he hath lifted
us up againe, after we have fallen, Ah how do we
cling to him, how do we hold him fast, how do we
endeavour to have him alwayes in our sight, and
how do we cry after him, when we perceive any
evil of affliction or temptation to be nigh us; and
how do we cast our selves down before him at his
feet, and bewail our infirmities and weaknesses,
begging strength from him to support and keep us
up; how do we wonder and are astonisht to see
the fire of his wrath kindled against the wicked,
and against evil doers, and yet that such wicked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
doers (as we are) are not consumed; to see fire
in the bush, and yet the bush not burnt.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Thus we may plainly see that God seeth all
to be good for us, yea best of all, which he sendeth
us, causing every thing to work together for our
good. Ah, seeing then that his love, mercy, and
goodnesse is such, and so great for us, let us always
mightily praise him, and prize him at the very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
price, and give up our spirits, souls and bodyes
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:105293:181"/>
to live to him, and for him, and unto, and for his
praise, honour, and glory, it being our glory and
our honour, our happiness, and our bliss that he is
such a God as he is; To him alone therefore be
given alwayes, all honour, and glory, and praise,
for ever and for ever.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Laying out, is laying up; laying out of
earthly treasure on earth, with a heavenly heart,
is to lay up heavenly treasure in Heaven, according
to Gods word, and his heart.</p>
            <p n="13">13. God giveth unto his Children, of his own
strength (to overcome as it were (himself) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
to be (as it were) overcome by them. And
to make us more than Conquerours.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Ah the mercy, the mercy and bounty of
God and the misery of man, that God being such
a God as he is, should notwithstanding continue
to do so much for man, and man nevertheless
continue continually to do so much against his
God, I say against his God, even then, when he
knoweth God to be his God.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Ah Lord, how is it that thou should'st take
pleasure to mind us so much as thou dost, although
thou knowest well our evil minds, and how little
we mind thee; and although thou tellest us by
thine own spirit, how that we are near and dear
unto thee, even alwayes in thy mind and heart, to
do us good for ever and for ever. Ah how great
is our misery to have such depraved natures, and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:105293:181"/>
such Devil-like hearts, to pay thy merciful kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with such high unkindnesse and ingratitude,
to thee who art our only good.</p>
            <p n="16">16. How is it, O Lord, that thou takest such
continual care and payns (as it were) and art at so
much cost, to overcome us with thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and yet we remain so brutish and senslesse,
stupid and unkind, that we will not (but refuse) to
be overcome.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Ah the misery, the misery of man, who is
never weary, nor would never be weary of doing
evil, yea all manner of evil against his most kind
and loving Lord and God, who is so good to him,
as he is never weary nor repents of doing of him
good, notwithstanding his continual doing of evil,
or doing of all evil continually.</p>
            <p n="18">18. A good heart giveth unto the Lord freely,
cheerfully, willingly, and rejoycingly, of all that
he hath, and alwaies acknowledgeth, and saith, of
thine own, O Lord, I will and do give thee.</p>
            <p n="19">19. When that the Lord giveth unto such a soul
Grace, he giveth him Glory; when he giveth him
outward things, he praiseth him, and enlargeth
his bowels of compassion unto the Saints.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Such hearts desire mightily, largnesse of
heart, or large hearts, to give according to what
they receive, whether it be Spirituals, or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
nothing is so near or dear unto them, as the
work of the Lord, which is to do his will in all
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:105293:182"/>
things, from the very highest of Grace, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lowest of things in Nature.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Ah Lord God, let me alwaies bear thee in
mind, when ever I mind, that is, think on any
thing.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Let me, O Lord, I most humbly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly
beseech thee, do every thing that I do, as
knowing and remembring, that thou seest and
all knowest the thoughts of my heart, and writest
down all my words, and works on thy blessed
book of remembrance.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Let me do all that I do before men, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, O God my God, knowing that thou seest
it and hearest it.</p>
            <p n="24">24. And all that I take in hand to do, O God,
before thee, Let me do it all, as if all the men in
the World did look on me and see it.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Norwithstanding the greatnesse and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless
number of my sins, thy goodnesse, O God,
was so great towards me, as moved thee to have
compassion on me, and to pour out thy endlesse and
everlasting Love and kindnesse in mercy upon me.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Also O God, thou causedst my own sins to
appear so great and filthy before me, that I was
thereby ashamed of my self and confounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee.</p>
            <p n="27">27. So that seeing my self thus polluted, filthy
abominable, and unclean, yea abominably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
I left my self willingly, I hated, and do hate
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:105293:182"/>
and do hate my self truly, and I imbraced (through
Grace) thy most gratious offers of Grace, Love
and Mercy, heartily, and unfeignedly, returning
unto thee with my whole heart, desiring entirely
and sinserely, an entire change from all evil to all
good, from my own evil waies, to thy most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
waies that are so good, so sweet, so beautiful,
so delightful, that since the knowledge of them,
my soul hath been often delighted, refreshed, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
and satisfied in them, and with them.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Ah mercy of mercies, that thou wouldest,
O God, be pleased thus in mercy to look on me,
when I was fit and ripe for all thy Judgments;
And when thou mightest justly have poured out the
viols of thy wrath and fury upon me with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
indignation, that then even then to kindle the
flames of Love in my heart, from the continual
burnings in thine, O God, in thine, to love, fear,
seek, adore, and serve thee unfiegnedly with my
whole heart; Ah what mercy to this mercy.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Continue, O God, that art my God and
only good; continue, Ah continue I most humbly
beseech thee, to be thus merciful unto me, that I
turn not thy Grace into wantonnesse; but in some
measure labour and strive to walk worthy of these
thy rich and saving mercies, with which thou hast,
and wilt for ever inrich my poor Soul with, and
save it.</p>
            <p n="30">30. As a natural Father, a Father in the flesh, is,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:105293:183"/>
and must be still a Father, and a child, a child, so
me thinks it is with God our Heavenly and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Father; he having once begotten us, and we
are born again, and are become his children by the
Grace of Adoption, Justification, and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he must be still our Father, and we his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
unto Eternal Salvation. Though we do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times (as fleshly children) not alwaies do the
will of their Fathers in the flesh, not please them
alwaies, not satisfie or delight them, nor give them
content, yet notwithstanding they are still chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
nor they cannot cease to be children, nor
their Father to be their Father; even so, though
we do not alwaies do what liketh God our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father; but that at times which disliketh
him, and displeaseth him, he as a good Father
sometimes punisheth us, and sometimes passeth
by our failings, without punishment, eyeing what
is best for us, and as a Father he never faileth us,
neither will he suffer us to fail of being his children.
Once his children and ever his, his for ever, and
for ever.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Ah Lord God, that art so glorious here in
Grace, how transcendently glorious art thou in
Glory? If the Earth be so full of thy Glory, how
full is Heaven, O Lord thy dwelling place, where
thou manifestest thy self unto the Saints, and they
behold thy beauty and thy glory face to face.</p>
            <p n="32">32. If thy back parts be so beautiful, to our
eies (here in the flesh, how beautiful, Ah how
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:105293:183"/>
beautiful, O Lord, will thy glorious countenance
be unto us in glory? where we shall see thee and
know thee as thou art to be known.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Thy presence even here, O Lord God,
when we have Communion with thee, doth so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and ravish us, that we had much rather by
much be a door-keeper in thy house, be a servant
to the meanest of all thy servants, than sit on
Thrones and rule among the wicked that keep not
thy Laws.</p>
            <p n="34">34. I have, O Lord, I confesse, abused thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and do therefore acknowledge that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
justly refuse me all mercies.</p>
            <p n="35">35. I have walked contrary unto thee, O God,
and still do, and therefore I confesse that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
justly walk contrary unto me, and give me up
to do all the evil, that is in my heart, which is the
very greatest of all thy Judgments in this life.</p>
            <p n="36">36. We are the work of thine hand, we are
thine own, and thou mayest justly do with us, all
that seemeth good unto thee to do; for what is
right in thy sight, O Lord, is just, and right, and
good.</p>
            <p n="37">37. When the Lord is with us for good, then
he hath accepted of us, he is in us, and we are in
him, one with him, and he one with us, we as
bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, and he as
bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh; we are
not two but one, yea there is such an onenesse, as
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:105293:184"/>
we are one (in some measure) in all things, and
have the same affections for all things, loving what
is to be loved, and hating what is to be hated;
there is a like purity and no mixture in our choyse
of good, and in our hatred and abhorrency of evil,
(as to the truth and cincerity if it) though much
different in the degrees.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Thus even thus is man made (in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure)
as God, that is God-like. Thus even thus
doth he partake of the holy and Divine Nature of
God. Thus even thus doth God himself give
of himself unto man, to make man like himself.
That man may be satisfied as God is satisfied; but
differently thus, God seeing all things in himself,
from himself, and man seeing what is of God in
him, is of his free gift, from his free Love.</p>
            <p n="39">39. That is, to have a heart according to Gods
heart, to be alwaies satisfied in all Gods dealings
and doings.</p>
            <p n="40">40. All that God doth is to have his own will
accomplisht and done, and if our will (as it should)
be according to his will, then are we well conrent
in and with all that is done; for nothing is done
or can be done, but that, and only that which God
will have to be done.</p>
            <p n="41">41. The honour of all the Saints, is Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and their glory is to bring him glory, or
to glorifie him as the Saints and Angels doe in

            <p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:105293:184"/>
42. Ah Lord God; let me as the Bee, make
honey of the weeds as well as of the flovvers, fetch
good out of evil, as vvell as increase and multiply
good from good, condemn sin vvhere ever I see it,
hate it most vvhere I see it most, speak most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

            <p n="44">44. I am, O Lord, resolved (through grace) not

            <p n="47">47. Let my goings out be comeings in unto me,

that is, Let all, O Lord, that I do, bring me good,

that I depart not from thee, but that I do
the things alwaies, that are in some measure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

            <p n="49">49. The Lord gives his graces unto those that
rightly ask them, as we would do water at a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto all those should come for it in a due and
right manner, give as well a thousand, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
yea a hundred times ten thousand draughts
to any one that should need it, as one draught

his goodnesse, that he gives as well and as willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all the desires of our hearts and Souls, as one
desire alone, yea as the least desire of all, if we do
but ask as we should ask, and for that end or those
ends alone, that he hath appoynted them, and us
to have them; for to give much, or little, is to
him all alike; he cannot (such a Fountain is he)
be emptied, no nor lessened at all by whatever he
gives, he is still the same, full of all blessednesse,
and goodnesse, alwaies ready to distribute and give
unto the necessity of the Saints, never weary nor

               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:105293:185"/>
50. Therefore to have much, is to ask much,
ask and ye shall have, that your joy may be full,
God doth not say or mean that we may or can be
too bold, that we may ask too much. And to take
away this scruple, or doubt, he promiseth that
what ever we shall ask (believingly) in the
name of Jesus Christ, we shall receive if we open
our mouths wide, then we have his promise that
he will fill them, which implyes that the way or
meanes to have much, is to ask much, this holy
Coveting and ambition he is well pleased with,
and so good, bountifull and free our God is, that
we cannot please him better, then after what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we have asked, to believe that he will give us
much more by much, then we are able to ask or
think; whoever lacks Wisdome, if he ask it of
God, he will give it liberally, for he upbraids no
man, neither is he a respector of persons, having
given us Jesus Christ his only Son, the Son of his
love and delight (how) shall he not with him give
us all things.</p>
            <p n="51">51. Surely, surely, seeing he hath, and daily
doth give us such things as these, Himself, his Son,
and holy Spirit, we may be sure we shall (as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

leave giving, for weary he cannot be, fit then thy
self to be filled; and I promise and assure thee who
ever thou art, thou shalt not be sent empty away,
what ever thy hunger and thirst be, whatever thy

thou canst ask or think (believe) for all things are

            <p n="52">52. The life which delighteth the Lord, and
which he would have us to live, is to live unto all

live every moment of the day, all our dayes, as if
it were our very last moment.</p>
            <p n="53">53. The death of the Righteous every one
(seemingly) desires to dye, but truly I may say of
the most that thus say, be they whoever they be,
that they know not well what they say, because,
that perhaps, not one of a thousand but denyes it
in his deeds for the death of the Righteous, in
which the Lord delighteth, as in their life, and
which honours him most, even as a holy and godly
that is God like life doth; Is I say this death of
the Righteous is (as I take it) to die daily, yea
every moment of the day, to all sin, even to all
both great and small, in thought, in word, and
deed; to dye thus, is to honour, glorifie, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie

those Sacrifices of our Lusts Corruptions, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
affections, that God is well pleased, refreshed
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:105293:186"/>
as it were, and delighted. These Sacrifices send up
sweet Odours in his Nostrils, these are pretious in
his eyes; I, thus, thus doubtlesse it is, that the
death of the Saints are pretious in the eyes of the
Lord, to put to death those cruel ones, those Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
of our Eternal life, of our souls salvation,
that put to death the Lord of life and glory himself,
(in his manhood) this is to be valiant for the Lord,
to do wonders, or wonderfully, to fight well his
battels, and to help the Lord (as it were) against
the mighty; Ah how is he delighted, that we will
avenge our selves thus on his Enemyes, and spare
none alive, but as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, hew <hi>Agag</hi> the King
(himself) in pieces; this is to be jealous for the
Lord with a godly jealousie, and to have our love
for the Almighty to be as hot as fire; Ah thus,
thus, if we pull out our right eyes, and cut off our
right hands, we shall be sure to enter into life, but
not maimed, but whole and entire. And he that
is thus willing to loose his life, shall save it, and
he that will spare or save his life, that is his life of
sin, or fleshly life to live in and commit sin, shall
surely loose his life, both Spiritual, Temporal and
Eternal.</p>
            <p n="54">54. He that thus dyes all the day long, all his
life long, dyes much more gloriously by much in
the eyes of the Lord God, and in the eyes of all his
enlightened Children; then if he did suffer in
the flesh constantly all his dayes the cruellest death
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:105293:187"/>
of any of all the Martyrs. Ah to suffer thus, is
to suffer truly, is to suffer rightly for the cause of
Christ, and the honour of the Gospel; for 'tis not,
Ah no, our outward sufferings in the flesh, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
the Lord, for he is a God of joy, &amp; would
that we did alwayes rejoyce; and is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing that we do, or can do, that gives us so
much cause to rejoyce, as to be delivered out of the
hands of all our Enemyes, and to see them lye
slain before our eyes, as the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Ah then,
then may we serve him without fear, then and
thereby do we serve the Lord in Righteousnesse,
and true holinesse, and he that is thus faithful unto
the death, to put sin to death every moment of his
life, shall be sure in the end of his dayes, to have
the full end of all his desires, and to wear for ever
the Crown of Eternal life; he that thus fights
shall overcome, he that thus suffers no sin to raign
in his mortal body, shall raign with Christ in bliss
and glory, world without end, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="55">55. Thus then to live, and thus to dye, is to be
sure we shall live with Christ Eternally.</p>
            <p n="56">56. He that doth live thus, and thus puts sin to
death, lives that life and dyes that death daily, as
most of all honours God, and which brings him
most glory, which is the thing only, or the only
thing, (as I suppose) that all Gods Children most
desire and long for in this life.</p>
            <p n="57">57. He that thus lives, shall ever live; and he
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:105293:187"/>
that thus puts sin to death, is past from death to
life, and shall never see death, that is the power of
death to terrifie him, for death is swallowed up
into Victory; death when it comes shall carry
him in triumph, yea triumphantly into the blessed
armes of his blessed Jesus, who hath thus redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him from Hell, from sin, and from death, to live
ever with himself in bliss, and glory, an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life.</p>
            <p n="58">58. When I shall find that sin is thus put to
death in me, then will I say bouldly, that the Lord
hath sent his destroying Angel to do it, that he
hath done it with the word of his power, with his
own voyce, who is that blessed Arch-Angel of the
Covenant of peace and reconciliation.</p>
            <p n="59">59. When I shall find that sin is thus rooted up
in me by the roots, then will I say, that the Lords
hand hath done it, for I know that none but the
Lord himself can do such wonders, and work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
thus.</p>
            <p n="60">60. When I shall find that sin is destroyed in
me, then will I say that the Lord hath visited me
gratiously, that he hath spoken peace to my poor
soul, and revived it, and refreshed it, then may I
say he hath been with me of a truth, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
the low estate of his poor Servant.</p>
            <p n="61">61. When I shall find sin dead, then will I say
as the Lord liveth, and because he was put to death,
and now liveth, I shall live also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:105293:188"/>
62. Sin being thus banisht and cast out, then
shall I see my self free, and taken O Lord into
Covenant with thee, then will I say, I am no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
under the Law, but under Grace, which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
favour, O Lord, do me, that I may hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
and for ever live unto and for, thine Eternal
honour and glory.</p>
            <p n="63">63. Ah Lord God, that wert fastned to the
Crosse for my sins, and to save my poor Soul; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
my sins there, and let them never get loose
again, and Ah Lord, let my Soul live ever in thee
and possesse thee ever.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Ah Lord, that raignest over all Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Powers, reign I most humbly beseech
thee over all these Princes, and Powers, that have
Dominion over me, that I may be brought into
subjection unto thy most holy Laws and live obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently
keeping all thy Divine Commandments.
That thou, O Lord God, who art God over all
blessed for ever and ever, maiest be my God ever,
over all, and blesse me also for ever and for ever,
that I may ever live in thee, and thee in me. Amen,
Amen.</p>
            <p n="65">65. If we be so willing to unstrip our selves of
our cloathing at night, and to lye down on out
beds naked to uncloath our selves of all our glory
and honour, pomp and beauty, and to unmind that
we are what we are, to the end we may enjoy
a few hours quiet and rest; Ah how willing shall
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:105293:188"/>
we be to unstrip our selves of all that we possesse,
and of our lives too, when that last long night of
death shall come and appear to fetch us up from
hence, that we may be ever with the Lord, who
is our Eternal and everlasting Portion, our infinite
and incomprehensible good, and blessed rest and
peace, which shall be as it were, ever beginning,
and never end nor cease.</p>
            <p n="66">66. Ah our God that art what thou art, and
yet wilt be pleased to be ours, and to own us for
thine own.</p>
            <p n="67">67. Ah Lord God, though others satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to hear of thee, let me not be satisfied till
mine eie see thee.</p>
            <p n="68">68. Though others, O Lord, be well contented
to know thee as men reach, Let me I beseech thee
be satisfied only with thine own reachings, to
know thee as thou art to be known, that is, to see
and find, and feel thee in me, dwelling, raigning,
and ruling there, being all in all and bringing into
subjection all powers that lift up themselves in me
against thee.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Ah Lord God, how much better is it thus
to have thee, then to have all things out of thee? as
the Corn, Wine, and Oyl of the World.</p>
            <p n="70">70. What, Ah what is Earth to Heaven, these
things below, to the things that are above, but as
pebbles to pearls, as drosse to gold, or as a shadow
to the most glorious and most sublime substance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:105293:189"/>
71. The one being life, the other death, the
one fully satisfies, the other is vain, and brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but vexation of Spirit with it.</p>
            <p n="72">72. We cannot know God till we altogether
forget our selves, we cannot hear God till we are
altogether deaf to our selves, and to all things out
of God; we cannot see God, till we are stark
blind to all things besides him, and that is not of
him; we cannot find God as he is, until we have
lost our selves, and all things else that concerns
him not (so do and prosper.)</p>
            <p n="73">73. As we know not our latter end, nor are not
able to number our daies, so are we not at all able
to tell what God is, unlesse he tell us, nor to hear
him unlesse he open our hearts, and give us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
not comprehend him until he hath made
us one with himself, and given us his own Spirit
to know him by.</p>
            <p n="74">74. Thus if we live to move after his call, and
be obedient unto his voyce, we shall so hear, that
our Souls shall live and for ever rejoyce, that we
live thus to obey him.</p>
            <p n="75">75. Ah Lord God Almighty, maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, thou art the all of all those that
know thee; they that know thee, O God as thou
art to be known, care to know nothing else, thou
art altogether alsufficient to content and satisfie
them, with all pleasures and delights, their joyes
are full when that they enjoy thee; And they then
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:105293:189"/>
say with <hi>Jacob, that they have all,</hi> and with <hi>David
desire nothing else either in Heaven above, or Earth
beneath.</hi> Their wills are so swallowed up into
thine, that they are not theirs but thine, and thus
to live to thee, and in thee, they count it only to
live, and out of thee (to be) as if they were not, as
if they had no being.</p>
            <p n="76">76. I am a Creature, but thy Creature, O Lord
my God, I am a man, but created for thy self, for
thy glory and my Everlasting good and happinesse,
and shall I know that I am thus, such a one, and
not be satisfied; for is there any thing else that
can satisfie me thus.</p>
            <p n="77">77. Ah Lord thou settest before me life and
death, good and evil, light and darknesse, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, the things above and the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Ah suffer me not I most humbly beseech
thee in Jesus Christ, to prefer pebbles to pearls,
drosse to gold, darknesse to light, death to life,
evil to good, Earth to Heaven, these low things
here below, to those high and most transcendent
glorious things above. But let me give my self to
thee, O God, that hast provided and given such
rich, rare, and pretious things to me, enjoying
them; let me not care, seek for, or mind these, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thee, let me be fully satisfied, and rejoyce
evermore with unspeakable joy.</p>
            <p n="78">78. Being thy favourite, O God, who art King
of Kings and Lord of Lords, living in thy fear and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:105293:190"/>
favour, shall I not rejoyce much more by much
than they do, or can do, that are but favourites to
men, and have but their favour, they shall all pass
away, but thee and thy word of grace ingrafted in
me, shall endure for ever and for ever.</p>
            <p n="79">79. Ah Lord God, pour out of thy self into
me more and more, that I may be made to rejoyce
alwaies with unspeakable joy, yea that my joyes
may be full.</p>
            <p n="80">80. Let me, O Lord, rejoyce much more in
despising these things here below, than in prizing
of them, and to have a heart to trample them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my feet, than to set them up in my thoughts
and affections. These being low as they are, let
me, O God, keep them alwaies under my feet,
and trample on them as on durt and dung, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these high and holy things above, which thou
givest only in love, and to those only whom thou
lovest.</p>
            <p n="81">81. Ah Lord God, swallow me up into thy
self, that I may be found there, naked and empty
of all things out of thee and besides thee, so that I
may only possesse thee my only good, blisse, and
blessednesse.</p>
            <p n="82">82. Ah Lord God, set alwaies before my eies
mine Eternal and Everlasting Portion of thy grace,
and grant that I may be made thereby a worthy
partaker of thine infinite and eternal glory in glory;
so be it Lord, so be it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:105293:190"/>
83. If any other condition were fitter for me
than my present condition, I know that the Lord
would give it me, and fit it for me and fit me
for it.</p>
            <p n="84">84. Ah Lord, give me then a contented and
thankful heart alwaies, and in all conditions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
seeing thou hast caused me this day to know
a fresh, and to be assured, that thou art alwaies
with me, takest care for me, and watchest heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
over me, and that thou wilt be ever unto me,
as hitherto thou hast been, my support, strength,
assistance and satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="55">55. If God be come down into our hearts then
all powers that are not of God, are brought down,
are brought under into subjection unto his holy
Laws, by obedience unto his Divine Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for where he is present, all that is not of
him, must absent it self; Two being not agreed,
they cannot live together, and the stronger will
turn out the weaker.</p>
            <p n="86">86. Ah Lord, let me alwaies eie thee eying of
me, and let my eie be never off from thee; for I
know that thine is not, nor cannot be, off from
me.</p>
            <p n="87">87. Ah Lord, let me seriously consider, that all
things that are done by thee, are done for the good
of all those that love thee.</p>
            <p n="87">87. Therefore whatever is done at any time
whether in Heaven or Earth, let me alwaies say, so
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:105293:191"/>
Lord would I have in, seeing thou that art Lord of
all things and over all, even God blessed for ever
and for ever wilt have it so.</p>
            <p n="88">88. Ah Lord, suffer not my vile will, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
at any time thy Divine will; but let thine
be alwaies mine, and mine according unto thine.</p>
            <p n="89">89. Ah Lord, suffer me never to go about to
bring thy will to mine, but alwaies and in all
things labour with all the Powers of my Soul to
bring mine to thine.</p>
            <p n="90">90. And after I have askt let me be content
with what ever I have, knowing that thou, O Lord,
seest and knowest my condition.</p>
            <p n="91">91. Ah Lord, swallow me up into this blessed
condition, that all conditions be a like unto me,
and that I may esteem them blessings, and thee
and me alike blessed, not in a like degree, but in
truth. Thou God blessed over all, and I in thee,
blessed by thee, through thy blessed goodnesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me.</p>
            <p n="92">92. Ah Lord be thou with me where ever I am
(mine) and then I am sure I shall not want any
thing, because, O God, thou that art all full
nesse wilt I know, and am sure of, continually fill
me.</p>
            <p n="93">93. Thou art O God my good, and therefore
no evil can or shall come nigh me to hurt me; for
I know that thou alwaies watchest over me for
good, and that thou never slumbrest nor sleepest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:105293:191"/>
94. Ah Lord, thy shadow is unto me safety, let
me then alwaies sit under the shadow of thy wings
(that thy Word in me) may be alwaies the food
and the life of my Soul.</p>
            <p n="95">95. Ah Lord God, if thou hast made our life
thus sweet unto us over all things, and above all
things, it is because thy self, being thus the life of
our life, we may be taught to spend it so for thee,
as we may ever preserve it for thee, to live unto
thee for ever and for ever, to praise thee.</p>
            <p n="96">96. Ah Lord, I praise thee for that thou hast at
this time made me so to touch thee feelingly, so as
to feel vertue come out from thee into me, that
mine eies are opened so, as I see thee and know
thee to be with me and in me.</p>
            <p n="97">97. Ah Lord, let this light of thine never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from me, but let me more and more be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up into it, that by it I may be made more
and more able to comprehend it and live in it.</p>
            <p n="98">98. Ah Lord God, let these thy dawnings draw
me after thee, to follow thee the Lamb of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
where ever thou goest, and let me never
grow weary, nor faint in the way where ever thou
shalt lead me, or what ever thou shalt bid me to
do, though it be to spend and to be spent. But
grant that I may be alwaies thine, as I know and
see through thy good grace in me, that thou art
mine.</p>
            <p n="99">99. Ah what a most blessed thing is it to live
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:105293:192"/>
in the Peace of the Lord, and to dye with his
Peace.</p>
            <p n="100">100. Ah Lord, suffer me not to purchase the
whole World (if it were to be had) with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of one sin against Conscience; for <hi>what
shall it profit me to gain the whole World, if I lose my
own Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="101">101. Ah Lord, how happy is the man that
knoweth thee only, that is, is so swallowed up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, as he knoweth none, nor nothing but
thee, thou art, O God, over all, and above
all in him, and he is only thine, and none but
thine.</p>
            <p n="102">102. Ah how low, how low is it, to know
any thing but thee, O God? or in comparison of
thee.</p>
            <p n="103">103. Ah Lord God, let me so know thee, as
I may comprehend thee, that I may despise all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowledge and rest satisfied in this one thing,
only necessary.</p>
            <p n="104">104. To know thee the true God, and Jesus
Christ whom thou hast sent, is the depth of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and all things to it (in comparison of it) is
meer foolishnesse.</p>
            <p n="105">105. The Angels know not more, and this
knowledge of theirs is but in a degree, and, ah how
low and inferiour to that knowledg that is in thee,
that is, O God, in thee, in thee.</p>
            <p n="106">106. This knowledge is so sweet in its mani-manifestation,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:105293:192"/>
that it drowns and consumes both
men and Angels in its contemplation.</p>
            <p n="107">107. This knowledge is so deep and sweet, that
all, both men and Angels do thee only greet.</p>
            <p n="108">108. Thus to know thee, O God, is to be in
some measure like unto thee, filled with all wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and knowledge.</p>
            <p n="109">109. But this (alone) is given us all to know
from thy self, who knowest all things, and givest
unto none but what thou knowest, is for thine own
glory, O God, and their Everlasting good.</p>
            <p n="110">110. Fill, O Lord, fill all the hearts of those
that unfeinedly seek thee, and this thy Wisdome,
that they may become fools to themselves, and
only wise in thee, and for thee.</p>
            <p n="111">111. Ah Lord God, what is it to know all
things from the Cedar to the Hysop, if we have not
our understanding enlightned, to comprehend that
we are comprehended of thee.</p>
            <p n="112">112. Let me only have this honour, and I will
despise all other honours and dishonours, yea let
me be despised by all, so that I may be thus honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
O God by thee, by thee O God by thee.</p>
            <p n="113">113. All things, O God, compared to the
knowledge of thee, is not, nor shall not, I trust, be
ever at all regarded or esteemed by me.</p>
            <p n="114">114. For if I can but once attain to know thee
as thou art to be known; I am sure I shall have all
that I can desire to know, to possesse, or to
have.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:105293:193"/>
115. Having thee alone, O God, I shall have
all that is, or can ever be attained, either here, or
hereafter.</p>
            <p n="116">116. I know that there is none in Heaven that
have more, or that desire more; let me have what
they have, and I shall then be as they be (satisfied)
but till I have as much (at least) as any, I cannot
say that I have enough; for my desires are as large.
And till I am thus filed as they are, that thus know
thee, possesse thee, and adore thee; I cannot but
cry out with continual hungring and thirstings.
Oh feed me, Oh fill me, for I am empty and want
all things; if thou dost not, O God, thus fill me
with thy bounty, and satisfie me with thy loving
kindnesse, and cause me to see and know that thou
art mine, and that I am only thine.</p>
            <p n="117">117. Ah Lord God, I know it is thee only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
only thee, that canst cast out Devils; Ah cast out
I most humbly beseech thee all the Devils that are
in me; thou, O God, that raisest from death to
life, and that forgivest all our sins freely, even for
thine own names sake only.</p>
            <p n="118">118. All that is done in me, is done by thee,
O God, it is thine arme that bringeth me so great
Salvation.</p>
            <p n="119">119. Ah Lord God, thou only art able to
teach, and none but those that are immediatly
taught by thy spirit, know thee, or thy teachings.</p>
            <p n="120">120. Ah Lord, teach me then but to know thee
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:105293:193"/>
as thou art known by thine, and I will not care for
any other knowledge, or any other thing; for he
that hath this one thing given him, may truly say
as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>that he hath all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="121">121. Thou art, O Lord God, that well of life,
and water of life, that whoever drinketh off, that
is, hath thee in himself, shall never more thirst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
after any other thing, for thou wilt, O Christ,
be ever in him a well of water, springing in him,
even unto Eternal life.</p>
            <p n="121">121. Thou art, O Christ, thou art that bread
of life that cometh down from Heaven (into our
hearts) and feedest our souls in the assurance of
faith, sight, and knowledg unto Everlasting life.</p>
            <p n="122">122. Thou art ours, and we are thine, and this
we are taught by thine own spirit dwelling in us,
and not by any other teaching or science.</p>
            <p n="123">123. And being thus perswaded and assured
our hearts do continually rejoyce, yea and shall

all evil, and filled with all good. But Ah, its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the most part, for the most of times, is
little, and soon departs; such is our forwardness,

Children of God (with <hi>Paul</hi>) to be weary, yea

all that all the Angels and blessed in Heaven see,

            <p n="163">163. Ah Lord God, I know that thou lovest

thee, because that thou lovest us.</p>
            <p n="164">164. Thou art, O God, all things to all those
that depend upon thee, food to the hungry, drink

165. Let the wicked the men of the World
have their fill of the World, the Corn, Wine and

my fill of thee; for thou art much better by much,
than all thing either in Heaven above, or on Earth

light of thy Countenance, that I may see thy light,
and I shall rejoyce with unspeakable joy.</p>
            <p n="166">166. All things, O Lord God, compared to
thee, is blacknesse and darknesse and nothingness,
thou only art and there is none besides thee,
wherefore my Soul saith with <hi>David, whom have I
in Heaven but thee, and what is there on all the Earth
in comparison of thee;</hi> all other joyes are false joyes,
and all other things are nothing, but meer toyes;
for with thee, O God, and only with thee is all

thy self. Therefore the Angels, those glorious,

there is in them all, from the greatest to the

A Tabernacle to dwell in for ever and for ever,
not only to behold the glory of our Lord, but the

            <p n="172">172. And to be with thee here on Earth, whilst

O God, take it; for I confesse its thine and not

live in God and possesse him, and his fulnesse, be

occasion presenting it self to our charity, we should
shew forth by our grosse streams of largenesse, in

in their hearts, love him so, as it may be truly

love him above their goods, or good name, above
their Children, above their Wives, yea much
more and above their very lives. They can, and
easily do, when called thereto give up all to him
and for him, his love doth constrain, to love him
again, the heart is so in love with him, finding him
so lovely, that it cryes out continually for more
love, that it may love him more; for nothing
comforts such souls as Gods love, they make and
account his love as himself, and himself to be his
love, and being thus loved by him, and living thus
in his love, they live in him and he in them, which
is the very life of their lives, and the very bliss and

A soul that truely knowes Christ, cannot live as
he would, without a farther knowledg of him,
living in him, to have Communion and fellowship
with him, which is of more value to him, and he
prizeth it more then ten thousand worlds and
lives, Christ being above all things, and more then
all things much by much.</p>
            <p>A Christians last hour is his best hour, the hour
of his Death is the best hour of all his life; yea
that hour is the true beginning of life, for Death,
sin, and Hell are swallowed up into Victory, and
the Devil totally and finally overcome.</p>
            <p>Death is advantagious unto a Christian divers
wayes; when he dyes then he begins to live in
the Lord, who is the Lord of life and glory, then
he shall in a very great measure know, feel, and
see the unspeakable love of God to him, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not altogether so as it is in God, that shall
even surpasse our knowledge there, for we shall be
swallowed up into it, and be filled with it, it shall
contain us, but we shall not be able to contain it,
and there shall we have continual and perfect love;
to love God perfectly and continually, even as he
would have us to love him, which is the continual
fulfilling the whole Law, and which will make us
of all things most like himself, for God is love, and
surely it is the most lovely grace of all graces, both
on earth as well as in Heaven; and so, through
grace I have found it; Ah let us never then pray
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:105293:205"/>
against Death, which brings us these and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
more Heavenly advantages, but rather be
prepared to meet it with joy, and imbrace it as
our best friend, next to Christ.</p>
            <p>Ah how sweet is Death, even almost as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to that soul that is housed in God, and hath
his peace made sure with him; Death to such a
soul is much better then any life.</p>
            <p>Ah how sweet is Death to that soul that knows
Heaven is prepared for him, and finds, and feels
himself prepared for Heaven, and sees his Saviour
with his blessed armes spread abroad to welcome
and imbrace him, and his glorious head bowed
down to kiss him, and he nigh him, to receive him
into his everlasting Habitation of rest, joy, and
peace.</p>
            <p>Death at the worst is but a sweet sleep to the
body, to him that dyes in the Lord, for he rests
from all his labours; but it is life to the soul, and
it shall ever live in and with the Lord of life and
Glory.</p>
            <p>I am sure to a good Christian, that is, such a one
as is in some measure like Christ that lives, and
walks, and doth (as far as he is able) as Christ did
when he was here in the flesh, the thoughts of
death, and its being not far off, brings him the
most joy next to the Glory of God, and his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in him by Christ.</p>
            <p>Ah how sweet is death to that soul that knows
himself to be long since dead to all sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:105293:205"/>
Death is sweet to all such souls, because he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends
them so much as in a moment, to house
them in the blessed arms of their blessed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>Death is sweet to them that are in Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he carryes them in a moment to live in his
presence for ever and for ever, and to enjoy him
as he is to be enjoyed, and to be made like him,
glorious as he is glorious, though not so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>Death is to all that are in Christ, as <hi>Eliahs</hi>
Chariot of fire, which purifies them, and expels
all the remainder of Corruption that is within
them, that is by death, all evil is done away, we are
no more capable of sin by death, death is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and life appears.</p>
            <p>But Death to the wicked is the Devils Chariot
sent from Hell to bring them quickly there, as
<hi>Jehu</hi>'s chariot it drives them furiously thither, from
whence none is able to deliver.</p>
            <p>Death to the Godly is a Consuming fire to all
their sins, they shall not ever more be seen or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
but it is a fire as from Gods Altar, to
purifie their graces, and to make them shine more
radiant than the Sun; after death they shall in a
moment be made perfectly pure, and purely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and ever so abide.</p>
            <p>But Death to the Wicked is that fire of Hell
that shall consume all the good that ever they did,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:105293:206"/>
so as it shall not, nor cannot be seen nor remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred;
but it will make all the evil that ever they
Committed, either in thought, word, or deed, to
be ever before the eyes ef God, and all the bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Heaven, and before the Devils, and all the
damned, and their own, as if writ with a beam of
the Sun.</p>
            <p>Death to those that are in Christ, brings them
to hear that sweet and ever blessed voyce of Christ
himself; come ye blessed inherit the Kingdome
prepared for you from all Eternity, and well done
good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the joy
of thy Lord.</p>
            <p>But death to the Wicked will bring them in a
moment for ever to hear that most doleful voyce
from the mouth of Christ; go ye cursed (with
whom) with the Devil and his Angels into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
burning, into that fire that cannot be
quenched, which is so hot that a whole world of
gold would be given for a drop of water, and yet
it is so cold as will make thee for ever to weep and
waile, and gnash thy teeth. But it may be thou
wilt not believe it, till thou hast felt it; if thou
art such a fool, and such an Enemy to thy own
soul, to thine own peril be it. I can and doe assure
thee on my souls salvation, that then it will be too
late, and thou shalt find no place to repent in, how
many tears soever thou sheddest; wherefore
whilst it is to day, hear the voyce of the Lord, who
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:105293:206"/>
wooes thee to come unto him, that thou mayest
have life, and be no longer a neglecter of so great
Salvation as is so freely offered unto thee; and
quench not the spirit (in thee) no longer, which if
thou wilt but now repent and leave for ever thy
sins, thou shalt find mercy, and he will seal it to
thy heart and Conscience unto the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
awake then thou that sleepest, and
arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee life.
But know that if thou neglectest it, and wilt put it
off till to morrow, know that there is no to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
in all the Scripture, 'tis to day if thou wilt
hear his voyce, harden not thy heart, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how nigh this day may be past, and how nigh
the night may be at hand wherein no man shall
work. The Lord speak so effectually to thy dry,
obdurate, rocky heart, that it may so hear as thy
soul may live, and that these words may prove a
savour of death to all thy sins, and of life unto thy
poor soul.</p>
            <p>Death to all that are in Christ is a day of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
of reaping, gatheting, and gain; it will be
to him a day of Espousals, she shall be marryed
unto the fairest Bridegroome that ever was; <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loms</hi>
beauty will be blacknesse and uncomlinesse
to his, to the richest that ever was; <hi>Solomons</hi> riches
will be but as <hi>Jobs</hi> poverty compared to his. And
to the most highest in honour that ever was, being
King of Kings and Lord of Lords; to him all
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:105293:207"/>
Kings shall fall, and cast their Crowns at his
feet.</p>
            <p>Death to a true believer is the best of all things,
because it brings him to possesse all things, yea to
possesse Christ himself, who is the giver of all
things, and much better then all things, much by
much.</p>
            <p>A soul in Christ is alwayes ready to meet and
imbrace death at midnight or mid-day, at the
Cock-crowing or any other time, he hath his life
as it were in his hand, alwayes ready and willing
to lay it down, or give it up unto him that gave it
him, and redeemed it; he accounts nothing his
own but all Christs, and that he hath all things
both in Heaven and earth having him.</p>
            <p>When Death is ready to carry us into the arms
of Christ, the Ark of our peace and rest, then the
Devil many times rageth most against us. But
Christ our Captain and deliverer, who will save us
to the utmost, (as the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>)
roareth against him, and forceth him to a tream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and yielding retreat. But to Saints our Christ
appears as a Lamb, meek and pacified, yea as the
Lamb of God that taketh away all our sins, that he
may present us spotless and unblameable unto his
Father, that we may as Children and Co-heires
with himself, receive a Crown incorruptible, and
the inheritance prepared for us from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:105293:207"/>
Death to us, that are dead to sin, and alive to
Christ, hath no sting, and therefore cannot in the
least do us any harm, wherefore we cherish him,
and as a dear friend are glad to hear of him, and
to think often on him, and when he comes, we
bid him most heartily welcome, entertain him
kindly, and lodg him in our bosoms.</p>
            <p>But to those that know not Christ, his Master,
and have no interest in him, nor his mark on their
foreheads, he comes in flames of fire, and as a most
cruel Executioner, to execute on them the direful
and eternal doom of God, and so carries them post
and headlong to Hell, delivering them into the
hands and power of their grand Enemie the Devil,
to be tormented in everlasting burning, world
without end, or for ever and for ever.</p>
            <p>Death Ah how comly art thou in the sight of all
Gods children? that art sent by him, to bring them
to see him, their King, Lord and Master, that have
so long desired to see this day, and thy delightsome
countenance, thou art most welcome and dear as
the most dearest brother; come in thou messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
of the most highest, I know what thou hast to say
unto me, thou bringest me the gladdest tidings that
ever I heard, I am ready to go with thee when
thou wilt, I shall be now soon brought to my long
desired home, to my everlasting habitation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and rest. Now my Soul thou shalt be no
longer perplext nor troubled, all sighing for sin,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:105293:208"/>
and fear of sinning shal flie away; now is that blessed
day come wherein thou shalt at once have all thy
Prayers answered, all thy desires, petitions and suits
granted, and ten thousand times ten thousand
more than ever thou didst ask or think; now thou
shalt sin, grieve nor offend thy God no more, but
evermore serve, honour, obey and please him.
Now thou shalt see him who created thee, God
the Father; him who redeemed thee, Jesus Christ
the Son, and him who so often comforted thee,
and hath sanctified thee; the Holy Ghost, the
blessed Spirit, three in one, and one in three,
which is a great misterie, but most true; Ah hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
they unto whom it hath been manifestly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
such have Eternal life, and therefore fear
not death.</p>
            <p>But to the wicked that see and know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of Christ, death is to all such the King
of terrors; they dread and fear him more than
all the Kings, Tyrants, Torments and Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in the World, nay than the Devil himself;
for tis by death that they are sent or brought to
keep company for ever one with another; tis
death carries them to that infernal habitation,
that throws them headlong into that Lake of fire
and brimstone, into that bottomlesse pit of black
thick darknesse which may be felt, that binds them
in fetters so strong as none is able to deliver them,
and then flyes swifter than the wind from them,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:105293:208"/>
resolving (which they know) never to return to
deliver them, and this latter woe, for ever to abide
so is the greatest of all; this sinks their hearts,
and hopes, into an everlasting despair, which most
of all makes death dreadful to them, and they
would much rather lye under the greatest rocks or
mountains, or be cast with a milstone about their
necks, into the bottom of the Sea: But it cannot
be, death will execute his part of the doom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against them, by him that judgeth wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
righteously and justly, and that spake as never
man spake.</p>

puld me out of the everlasting burning, as a
brand out of the fire, If thou hadst not, O God,
come in to my help and succour, the Devil had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
me, the Devil had destroyed me for ever
and for ever; for I was his captive, his vassal, his
slave, I did his will, I obeyed his commands, I did
even run when he bid me go.</p>
            <p>But ever praised be thy transcendent glorious
name, O God of all goodnesse, and Father of Love,
mercy and compassion, that wert pleased to make
my calamity and extremity, thine opportunity,
that then even then when thou sawest that all help
(out of thy self) was in vain, thou shouldest be
pleased to come and succour me, and set me free,
to break the fetters and chains by which I was led
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:105293:210"/>
as a most miserable caitif and captive almost into
Hell it self, thou hast, O God, thou hast broken the
snares and I am escaped, thou hast delivered my
Soul from death, and my Songs shall be to praise
thee; whilst I live I will praise thee, O Lord, my
deliverer, and never keep silence; rather would I
that my tongue should cleave to the roof of my
mouth, than not declare the mercies and the
loving kindnesse of thee my God, to my poor soul,
and I trust, as well as pray and beseech thee, O my
God and Father in Jesus Christ, that thou wilt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put new Songs of praise into my mouth, and
that thou wilt in some measure inable me to speak
fitly, worthily and opportunely, of thy gratious
dealings towards me, that those that hear and
know thee may with me labour to be more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and delighted with thee, and prize thee yet
at a far higher prise, and that other that hear, and
know thee not, may so hear, as that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to seek thee with us, and may see thee to be
the fairest of ten thousand, yea the only fair, lovely,
beautiful, and desirable.</p>
            <p>But O incomprehensible, unconceivable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible
goodnesse, love and bounty, the Ocean
and Fountain of all bliss, blessedness, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
how can I, how shall I, worm I, nothing I,
speak of thee, and of thy gratious dealings unto my
poor Soul? O the heighth, depth, length, and
bredth, of thy Love, it is as the Heavens for heighth,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:105293:211"/>
as Hell for depth, as Eternity for length, and as
from Everlasting to Everlasting for bredth, nay all
this is far short of it, it is much more than all
this, by much; for it is thy self, O God, thy only
self, thy very self that thou hast given me, thy
Kingdom, and thy Glory, and not only in Heaven
hereafter, but even now, now, hast thou done this
for my poor unworthy Soul; having often fed,
feasted, and solaced my Soul with those ravishing
joyes that thou hast laid up and prepared for those
that unfaignedly love thee, thou hast in thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
hounty and Love often caused me to tast of
that hidden Manna, that bread of Life, and to
drink of those Rivers of pleasures that flow from
thine own right hand, thou hast many times (as it
were) carried my Soul into that mountain of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
where I have seen thy glorious back parts,
thy gratious transcendent goodness, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in the Spirit, the Celestial <hi>Canaan,</hi> the new
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the City of God, even God in man,
communicating himself unto him; for Christ the
hope of glory is in us, dwells in us, and makes his
abode there, which is thy Tabernacle, O God,
thou hast not only given him for us on the Cross,
but thou continually continuest to give him unto
us to crucifie our sins and sinful lusts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in us, to put them to death, that he himself
may live, and reign and rule in us, that we may be
thine and thou ours; Ah Lord God, I praise thee,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:105293:211"/>
thou hast often given me the seal of thy Love, thy
Holy Spirit witnessing, assuring establishing and
perswading, my Soul, heart and Conscience of the
free, full, and gratious pardon of all my sins, past,
present and to come. Thou hast often, O God, I
praise thee, thus covered me, thus spread the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of thy Love over me, thus made me sit under
the shadow of thy branches, thus feasted my Soul
in thy banquetting house of Love, rest, peace, and
joy, thus shewn me thy beauty and thy glory, thus
allured me and tied me fast unto thy self with the
cords of thy Divine Love, thus shewn me thy great
Salvation, thus given me wisdom and knowledge
to know thee my God and Father, and Jesus
Christ whom thou hast sent, thus caused me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and hereby made my joyes full, to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
adoration, and astonishment: On this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Mountain of Grace, have I often desired to
abide, that I might continue to abide with thee,
to enjoy thee who only art full and perfect joy;
but I know that these changes shall and must come
(as Winter and Summer,) whilst we are here in
the flesh, but the time will come that thou wilt
change us but once more, and then we shall live
with thee, in thee, and to rhee, for ever and for
ever.</p>
            <p>Ah Love, who can speak of it fitly, or as he
should, it is thy Divine Nature, O God, it is thy
self, and therefore men nor Angels cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:105293:212"/>
it; this three-fold Cord (thy Love, O most
blessed and glorious Trinity) cannot be broken,
and against it the gates of Hell shall never prevail.
Ah greatness that art good, although thou hast in
Heaven Millions of Millions of most glorious
Creatures, to look on and converse with, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
such is thy profound humility and
condescendence, love and goodnesse, that thou
wilt and dost behold, yea and delight too, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and communicate unto us poor worms, sinsul
dust and ashes, the richest, choycest, greatest and
most peculiar treasures of thy grace and glory,
even of the very same (though in a far less degree
and measure) as thou dost unto them that are with
thee in Heaven, thou givest us knowledge to know
thee, love to love thee, joy to rejoyce in thee, and
rest to roul and rest our selves on thee; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
eat and are filled, drink deep and are resatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
see thy face and are altogether fatisfied. But
we indeed here, do eat but the fragments or crums
of their so Royal Feast and Banquet, we do but sip
of the cup of which they drink so deep, and this
to us is but at times, but they are alwaies thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
and filled with the good things of thy
House; we indeed see thee, O God, but very
darkly at the best sight of thee, to their sight, we
know but in part, at the highest pitch of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
here in the flesh, and joy and rejoyce
but at times; the World, Ah this wretched
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:105293:212"/>
World, and the things of the flesh, as cloggs, yea
as Mountains of Earth, pull us down to the Earth;
when our Souls are as on Eagles wings soaring up
to Heaven, and pull us back when we are as it
were peeping into Heaven, yea when, O God,
thou dost as it were pull back the vail that we
might see even into the Holy of Holies; thus thou
feedest and feastest us (at times) with the very
bread the blessed (with thee) feed on, and caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
us to drink the Wine of the same Vintage, and
we (in thy Son Jesus Christ,) see our selves clean,
undefiled, without spot or wrinckle, pardoned,
justified, sanctified, yea as if we were already glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
with thine own glory; true they have their
portion in hand in possession, ours is by promise
yet to receive, but we have thy Word (O God)
who art just, true and unchangable, and therefore
we can and do rejoyce as well as they, and with
the same joy.</p>
            <p>And thus O Christ, my Saviour and Redeemer,
I know thou wilt present me unto thy Father,
even in thine own righteousness, worthiness, and
obedience, they shall all be imputed unto me as
if they were mine own, and in these thy glorious
robes I am sure, and certainly perswaded, I shall
find acceptance before God thy Father, who will
not be ashamed to own me for his own, nor to be
called my God and my Father. I know, and
confess, Ah my dear Redeemer, that all my bliss,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:105293:213"/>
and happiness, present and future, consists in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
united unto thee, and as having an interest
and sure title to thy worchiness and obedience;
for in thee, and in thee alone we are heirs of all
mercies and blessings, out of thee we are heirs of
all miseries, in thee we are children of the Father,
but out of thee children of the Devil; in thee we
shall be accepted and accounted worthy, but out
of thee rejected and esteemed unworthy; in thee
we shall pass for obedient, even as if we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
transgrest, nor sinned, but out of thee we can
be lookt on but as disobedient, and transgressors of
all thy most holy Laws and Divine Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
in thee, O Christ, I say in thee, we are
fit for Heaven, but out of thee only fit for Hell; in
thee, O Christ, in thee, we are the Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
but out of thee his hatred; in thee, O Christ,
in thee we have much boldness and free access to
the Throne of Grace, but out of thee only shame
and confusion of face; in thee, O Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
we are more resplendent, glorious and
beautiful than the Sun, but out of thee, Ah out
of thee we are blackness, ugliness, and deformity;
in thee, O thou the only all, we have all things,
but out of thee we want all things. Ah that thou
wouldest give me more and more of thy self, that
I might give thee more of my self. Ah that thou
wouldest so live in me, that I might only live to
thee and for thee, who art the life of my life, yea
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:105293:213"/>
much better than ten thousand lives. Thus even
thus thy blood, O Christ, speaketh good things to
us, and for our souls, for whom thou hast dyed,
it opens Heavens gates unto us, when it shuts
them against others; it appeaseth the Fathers
wrath towards us, when it causeth it to burn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
others; it procureth us all good, when it
preventeth all against others; it maketh our peace,
So that we shall ever live in rest and peace with
thy Father the God of Peace, with thy self the
Prince of Peace, and with thy Holy Spirit the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Peace, when to others it shall make Warr
for ever and for ever. Ah my dear Saviour, send
down I most humbly beseech thee thy Holy Spirit
into my heart, to sanctifie purifie and purge me
from all dead works, from the lust of the eie, the
lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, that I may
live as thou didst live here in the flesh, doing all
the good was possible to be done, from the highest
of Grace to the very lowest of Nature, that it may
be no longer I that live, but thee in me, and that
even whilst I live here in the flesh, it may be by
thy Faith, and in thy Faith, O Son of God, who
hast loved me and given thy self for me, O Lord,
I believe, increase I beseech thee my Faith, that
I may increase in strength, grow in grace, from
one degree unto another, that having finisht
my Course here in thy fear, I may die in thy
favour, and after this life ended live with thee
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:105293:214"/>
and in thee in blisse and glory, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord God, seeing I have taken upon me to
speak, be thou pleased to hear me, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to inspire and teach me, to direct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
me by thy holy spirit, that I may yet prize
thee and praise thee, for thy late great and sweet
mercyes, pouered and showred down so gratiously
and plentiously into my heart and soul on my bed
of sicknesse; Ah how greatly hast thou been pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to strengthen and comfort me, and to make
me to rejoyce in and over all my paines, yea making
the thoughts of death, and that King of terrors, to
be pleasant and comely in my eyes. Ah the
Mountains of the Mountains, the Floods, Rivers,
Wells and Springs of true joy, that thou hast been
pleased, O God, in Jesus Christ, by thy holy
Spirit, to Communicate unto my soul, heart and
Conscience, feasting and filling me in the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of thy gratious and Divine love, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of all my sins; the Floods, O God, of thy
most sweet and blessed presence have often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
me, and swallowed up my soul into the
Ocean of thy unexpressable and infinite goodness;
Thus, even thus thou raisest up those that are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
comfortest those that are afflicted, healest
those that are sick, strengthenest those that are weak,
inrichest those that are poor, cloathest those that
are naked, and settest poor Prisoners free, that
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:105293:214"/>
they may freely rejoyce in thee; and this joy I am
sure none can, nor none shall take from me, for
being thus redeemed and made free by thee, O
Christ, we are free indeed, and shall with thee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
perfect freedome and Liberty.</p>
            <p>And now, O Lord God, what shall I render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee for all thy many and special mercyes which
thou hast been pleased so richly, gratiously, freely,
and plentifully to pour down upon my poor soul
and body; I have nothing to offer thee but what
is already thine own, all is thine, O God, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
all mine is thine, and I am thine; give me I
most humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, who is
worthy, a heart according to thine own heart, that
I may walk worthily before thee all the remainder
of my dayes, not turning aside or going astray, to
the right hand of pleasures, or the left hand of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
and that I may make it my daily food to keep
thy holy Lawes, yea my Heaven here on earth, to
do thy will on earth as it is done in Heaven. Let
henceforth all my thoughts, words, and actions
tend to honour, and glorifie thee, my good God
and Heavenly Father, making thine honour only,
my honour, and thy glory my glory, redeeming the
fore past time of my life, by an exact, serious, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
watchful, and holy walking in thy most holy
wayes, and never be truly satisfied, till thou hast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ogether
sanctified me in spirit soul and body; so
that I may alwayes see my self in thee, and thee in
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:105293:215"/>
me, and know my self to be thine, and thee to be
mine. Ah Lord, thou knowest all my thoughts,
affections and desires, yea my very heart, what
then shall I say unto thee, make me I beseech thee
such as thou would'st have me to be, fit me for thy
self, and take me to thy self; do for me what thou
knowest to be best for me, that I may glorifie thee,
not what I will, but all that thou wilt, both on soul
and body, that I may live that life, and dye that
death, by which I may glorifie thee most, is all
and the only desires of my heart and soul, so be it
Lord, so be it, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah Lord God, that knowest all things, thou
knowest what is my end and ayme in publishing
this thy work, thine it is, and I trust thou wilt
own it; and therefore I seek no other power to
patronize or protect it, and thou owning of it, I
care not who disown it; thou esteeming of it, I
care not who dis-esteem it; thou approving of it,
I care not who disapprove of it, and that thou wilt
do this, and blesse it too, unto the hearts of many,
O Lord, I believe, and therein rejoyce, that it
shall prove a Cordial to some, and a Corrisive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others; a plaister of healing to some, and a sharp
Lance to make the wound deeper of others, even
as a savour of life to some, and of death to others,
to cast down some, and to raise up others', to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
some, and to justifie others, to give trouble
to some, and peace to others; for some scoffing
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:105293:215"/>
deriding <hi>Ishmaels,</hi> rayling <hi>Shemeies,</hi> sinful Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
censures; I cannot but think it will meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this sinful ignorant Nation, and times, because
it hath not the false visage on which they prize,
that is the invention and flourishes of the brain of
humane Wisdome; for such, Ah Lord, it is not
intended, neither by thee I know, nor by me, so
I shall not I trust care for, or be a whit troubled at
such Curs snarling or barking, for power, I know
they shall not have to bite or hurt me. But some
true <hi>Nathaniels</hi> in whom there is neither gale not
guile, some spiritually wise unto Salvation, that
are able to judge of all things, having that anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them that is truth, and no lye, and which
teacheth and instructeth them in the truth, many
such I hope and trust it shall also meet with, and
for them, and for them only, it is I hope by thee,
O Lord my God, intended, and so thou knowest
it is by me, that they with me may together Laud
and praise thee, and give thee the honour due unto
thy holy name, for all thy gracious works of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
wrought in and on my poor soul. I know, O
Lord, that what thou hast thus in the abundance of
thy mercies given me, is not for my self alone,
neither may I monopolize it to my self; hide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
this my Talent in this my house of Clay, not
keep this Star, or rather Sun-light from others, but
thou expectest and requirest I know well, that as
I have freely received, so that I freely impart of it
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:105293:216"/>
and give it as thine unto others, that I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
them with the same refreshing wherewith
thou hast refreshed my poor unworthy soul, and
comfort, and make glad their hearts with the
same comforts, that thou hast made glad and
comforted mine, and give them to eat and drink
of that true bread and water of life, wherewith
thou hast so abundantly and frequently fed, feasted,
solaced and refreshed me; and as it were inrich
them with the true riches of saving knowledge, to
know thee the true God and Jesus Christ whom
thou hast sent, which thou hast, I praise thee, in some
measure caused me to know to my Everlasting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
thus, even thus, I am sure, O God, is thy
good will and pleasure that I Communicate and
forget not what thou hast in so much love Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
unto me, impart unto them all that
thou hast imparted unto me. And I praise thy
goodnesse, O God, for that thou hast given me a
heart in some measure, heartily to desire it, and
longingly, and lovingly, to imbrace with much
comfort, joy, and content all occasions whatsoever
to do it unto all, without any respect of persons to
the poorest and meanest Creature (according to
the flesh) as well as unto the highest in degree and
honour among men, and that their Conditions
blessed be thy Name makes no condition with me,
for I account my self in very truth, Servant and
Debtor unto all, both bond and free, young and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:105293:216"/>
old, and would with all my heart and soul do for any
of them what thou requirest and Commandest, yea
me thinks I would give them what I have, and be
without it, that they might have it; I would be
hungry and thirsty, and poor, and naked, to feed,
refresh, cloath and make rich their souls. I would
most sincerely and willingly that they had all of
them a double Portion of the gifts and graces of
thy holy Spirit, which thou hast given me, to the
end it might be well with them, and they might
doubly praise thee.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord, Stamp on their hearts the seal of thy
Divine love; hide them under thy most sacred
and glorious pavilion, that they may be kept safe
from the evil day, and from the evil one, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
seeketh to devout them, swallow them up,
O Lord, into thy self, that they may be ever secure,
dart, O God, a beam of thy Divine love, that by
its reflection, they may have love to love thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
as thou lovest them, not as to measure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that I know well is in none, either on earth
or in Heaven, nor cannot be, the most blessed
Saints, Angels, Arch Angels, Cherubins and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims,
were the love of all those lovely blessed
and glorious Creatures emptied into one alone,
then even I know his would come short of thine,
of thy love, O God, to that Creature whom thou
lovest in the least degree (to Salvation;) for thy
love is the love of a God, who is love that would
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:105293:217"/>
be but the love of a Creature, thine would be from
thy self alone, that would be from thee, and given
by thee, so that the love (which in sincere love)
I thus in Jesus Christ begg of thee for them, is,
that they may have true love for thee and thine
continually, that it may continue with them and
in them unto the end, till that thou shalt so fill
them with that first choyce, and chiefe grace, that
they all may be as thou art (in a degree) all
love.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord God, confound I pray thee the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the wise (I mean thou knowest) the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wise, bring down their pride, and staine their
glory, such as will go about to condemne what
they cannot mend, and to marre what they cannot
make; turn, O God, their wisdome (as thou
did'st Achitophels) into foolishnesse, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them unto the end from such a like end, and
open the eyes of their understanding, that they
may see and acknowledge the errors of their wayes
and come speedily out of them, and before ever
converted unto thee, that their souls may ever live
with thee.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord God, what a most pittiful thing is it,
and of all things to be lamented with, and in
teares of blood, that any poor soul should either
live or die in sin, that a soul which is of much
more value then ten thousand worlds, should be
for ever lost and undone, for such a base, vile, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:105293:217"/>
thing as is sin, the very excrements of naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and by which, O God, thou that art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all honour, art so much dishonoured, and
the Devil so much honoured. Ah how is it to be
pittyed, and dolefully lamented, that so many
poor souls should believe lyes, and the Father of
lyes (the Devil,) before thy word and thy self,
who art the God of all truth, and love; how great,
Ah how great was thy love, O God, to save poor
lost sinners, in sparing and giving thy own only
dear and beloved Son, to the most shameful and
most painful death of the Cross, to redeem them
from sin, death, Hell, and the Devil; and hast
thou not promised with him to give them all
things. And Ah how great was thy love, O most
sweet Jesus, who did'st so willingly submit to thy
Fathers will, and for the glory which was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee (for us sinners) did'st chearfully endure
the Cross, and despise the shame, aud so sits down
at the right hand of thy Father, to prepare there
a place for us, and by thy continual intercession to
prepare us for that place; and this thy sitting down
in glory at his right hand, shews plain that thou
hast done all that is to be done, that can be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
all as thou said'st when thou gavest up the
Ghost is surely finished, our Redemption fully
wrought and compleated, thy Fathers wrath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased,
and he well pleased. Ah Christ (with
and in all humility of heart I speak it) thou had'st
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:105293:218"/>
this spirit in thee, thou did'st even as it were thus
complain, ye will not come to me that ye may have
life; and did'st weep for and over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
her day of salvation was past, and thy holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the mouth of thy Prophet complaineth, and
as it were lamenteth their sad condition; saying,
Ah why will you dye O House of <hi>Israel.</hi> And
further, how often doth this thy gracious and bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
spirit, O God, leave (as it were) thy bosome,
and comes and sues and wooes us, that he may san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
and make us chosen and fit Vessels for thy
use.</p>
            <p>Ah Lord, thou knowest how often such like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
have sadened my soul; that thou who
art the God of truth, should'st be thought by so
many (as it were) a lyer; for thy Word is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by them, but made as a thing of nought,
trampled under foot, and cast behind the back; and
Drunkards, Whoremongers, and such vile persons
words be received, entertain'd, taken up, welcom'd
and preferr'd before thee, O God, before thee, and
thy Word, and all thy most gratious offers of grace.
Now if such by thy good and gratious Providence,
come to read these words, or of that which thou
hast made me to write, I humbly pray thee in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ thy Son, to pity him and pardon him.
Ah fetch home, O God, all windering Prodigals
that are in far Countrys (that is) far from thee,
feeding on Hogs and Harlots, which is, on their
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:105293:218"/>
own fleshly Carnal Lusts, and vile affect ions. Ah
Father, I know thee to be full of love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion;
Ah be thou pleased to do for all such as
thou hast done for me, for such was my most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and woful condition; But I praise thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Name, thou hast washt, and cleansed, and
sanctified my soul. Ah be thou pleased to let them
all tast of the same love and kindnesse, let them
drink all of the same Cup, and eat of the same
meat, and be cloathed with the same Robes, and
have a like ring of Love put on their fingers. Ah
let them, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth,
be thus welcomed by the, and owned by thee for
thine own, and adorn'd thus gratiously with thine
own glory, that thou mayest delight in them, and
they may make thee only all their joy, delight,
and rejoycing. Ah that the Devil had fewer Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and thou, O God, who art all goodnesse
had'st more, that he were cast of by all, and thy
grace and favour accepted off; that he were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned;
and thou, O God, for ever owned, to
be only worthy to be believed in, feared, loved,
prized, magnified and praised; let these, and a
thousand-fold more of thanksgiving, honour, and
glory be given unto thy most sacred, and most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Name, who art God of Gods, and Lord of
Lords, the very and only true God, blessed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus, even thus, O Lord, I have taken on me
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:105293:219"/>
through the guidance of thy good spirit, to chatter
a little as a Crane or a Swallow, and to speak unto
thee, and of thee with a stammering tongue; thou
knowest how far short &amp; scant it is, to what I might
would, and me thinks could speak; if thou would'st
be pleased to inable me to declare and shew forth
what thou hast in love and mercy stablisht and
rooted within me. But in my weaknesse and scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
I trust, O Lord, thou wilt be large, and by
and with my little, speak much to their hearts, souls
and Consciences; unto whom I can speak but to
the hearing of the eare, and though I had the
tongue of an Angel, yet my words could not be
effectual. <hi>Paul</hi> could speak but to <hi>Lydias</hi>'s eare,
it was the sweet charming voyce of thy holy spirit
that spake to her heart, and begat in her holy and
Heavenly affections. <hi>Pauls</hi> planting and <hi>Apollo's</hi>
watering without thy blessing would be in vaine;
all mans all is nothing at all but emptinesse, it is
only thou, O God, that mad'st the soul, that only
canst satisfie the soul; and thou, who only art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Conscience that canst quiet the Conscience,
that thou wilt thus graciously and powerfully work
on others hearts and lives, with this thy gracious
work of grace, with which thou hast so richly and
plentiously wrought on mine, and in me, are my
hopes, desires, and hearty, humble and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
prayers, and for this end, and to bring glory
to thy Eternrl, most holy, and most glorious name.
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:105293:219"/>
I send it forth under the shadow of thy wings, to
be protected. Ah Lord, hear me, and graciously
answer me, and do for me and all thine, much
more abundantly then I or they can ask or think
according to the greatnesse of thy goodnesse, and
the goodnesse of thy greatnesse; and all I humbly
beg, ask, and crave in the name, and for the sake
and worthinesse of Jesus Christ the Righteous, thy
dear Son, and my dear Saviour and Redeemer, for
whom my soul doth, and shall ever praise thee, and
to him with thine own sacred, holy, divine and
glorious Majesty, and blessed spirit be now and
alwayes given by me and all thine, as all due is
and to none else, honour, glory, power, might,
dominion and thanksgiving for ever and for ever,
<hi>Amen, Amen.</hi> so be it, Lord so be it, <hi>Amen,</hi> and
<hi>Amen.</hi>
