            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for the morning tyde; our men of warre comming vp againe, yet with their often ſhooting from their battery, and out of their Punts with their great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, got cleare off them againe, and ſo with that ebbe fell downe towards <hi>Bergen</hi> and beyond <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſwall,</hi> in the view of our Army, and paſſing by, three or foure ſhot was made from the South ſconce of <hi>Bergens</hi> head to them, ſo that one of them ſhot off the Rudder of one of their Sloopes, which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and brought in. But before I proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will ſhew you the liſt of their preparations, and how ſtrong they ſet forward from <hi>Antwerpe, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifty great Sloopes.</p>
            <p>Tenne great Punts, wherein their Canon was planted.</p>
            <p>Eighteene Pleyts or great Lighters, which make in all ſeuenty eight ſayle.</p>
            <p>Foure hundred ſmall Peeces of Ordnance, as ſmall Braſſe and Leather Peeces, Chambers and Murderers.</p>
            <p>Foure thouſand hand Granadoes, and other fire workes.</p>
            <p>Tenne halfe Canon.</p>
            <p>Twenty <hi>French</hi> Canon, or three quarter Canon, carrying Bullets of 36. pound.</p>
            <p>betweene ſixe and ſeuen thouſand Souldiers and Saylers.</p>
            <p>Eleuen Barrells of money.</p>
            <p>Great ſtore of Ammunition, us Powder, Bullets, and Match.</p>
            <p>Whoſe chiefe Commanders were the Prince of

               <hi>Barbanzon</hi> and <hi>Count Iohn of Naſſaw;</hi> And victuals, wine and beere for fourteene dayes.</p>
            <p>Being thus prouided, as is aforeſaid, and falling downe before <hi>Bergen,</hi> at the firſt fight his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and we hearing ſuch a ſhooting the night before, and in this morning, being Friday the 12. of this moneth, knew no better but that they had beene our owne men, which had beene put to a retreat; not thinking the Enemy had beene ſo madde to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo high an attempt, as to come vnder our noſes, and to dare and braue our Army at noone day, our Souldiers being on fire, and their fingers itching at them, and that onely the water parted vs; his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, from the hill which is by his quarter, calls for his perſpectiue glaſſe, diſcouers the <hi>Burgunn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Proffering to land, they cry'd to the Peaſants, which ſtood vpon the Dyke to deſend it with their Armes, that they would waſh their hands in the <hi>Geufes</hi> blood; but ſeeing Generall <hi>Morgan</hi> and his Colours making ſuch haſte to meete them, they bethought themſelues, and fell backe againe into the ſtreame. But ere I conclude, there happened two wonderfull markes of the prouidence of God. Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one after another like a company of wild geele, twelue or fourteen of their greateſt Lighters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</p>

But the ſecond mark of the admirable prouidence of God, was this; In the morning towards foure of the clocke, the Lord ſent a thicke miſt, which did ſo blind fold them, as heretofore the enemies of Gods children were in the old Teſtament, ſo that they could not ſee one another, and <hi>Count Iohn</hi> in this miſt ranne a ground, put forth a light, and the reſt following, thinking he had been in the ſtreame, were all like wiſe ſtranded with him. When the miſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, they ſaw likewiſe our men of Warre which came from <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> in the head of them, which hindered them from recouering the Point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Count Iohn,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Barbanzon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Borneuille,</hi> &amp; two or three more Commanders, being ſtrucken with an amazement at this ſudden worke of God, got into a little boate, and ſtole away from them, <hi>Count Iohn</hi> calling to them, and ſaying, <hi>Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs à Dieu, Ceſt mon d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rniers,</hi> Euery man ſhift for himſelfe; which did much diſcourage and aſtoniſh their men, as they themſelues confeſſed: So when that beganne to cleare vp, our men ſaw the groſſe of their punts and ſloopes lying vpon the ſands and mud, and they by hundreds forſaking their ſloopes, and caſting away their armes, ſome ſwamme, others waded vp to the neck to get to the Land to ſaue their liues, crying for quarter to the Peſants, which at the firſt did repulſe them: In the meane time <hi>Count Iohn</hi> gaue them the ſlip, and got into <hi>Prince-land</hi> with thoſe which hee had in his little ſloope, leauing his Sword, his Leading-ſtaffe, his Horſes, and his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petor and Laquyes behind him.
