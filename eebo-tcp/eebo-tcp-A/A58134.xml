            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT might justly appear ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to make a large Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to this little paper. The design of it is easily known at the first sight, to render the chief Heads of our Religion plain and easie to the young and ignorant. And this I hope, is an attempt of that nature as needs no great Apologie, except on this account, that it comes after there hath been so much done to the same purpose already, and that so suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, as might seem to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all future undertakings of this nature wholly needless. But to this let it suffice to answer, that what I have here drawn up was intended for my own private
<pb facs="tcp:49267:3"/>
use, for which I could not find any of those Expositions I light on, (though otherwise in their kinds very excellent, and to some of which I have been much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) in all circumstances so sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as I desired.</p>
            <p>And they moreover for whose sake this was chiefly designed, had not those other helps of this nature at hand, nor could I so easily procure the same for them as I can this.</p>
            <p>What is here done is in subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to that Catechisme which our Church recommends to the younger sort: that by a plain and fuller explication of the principles contained in it, the use thereof might be rendred more profitable to the learners. And for this I had the judgment and authority of the Right Reverend my Diocesan encouraging me
<pb facs="tcp:49267:3"/>
hereto, that none may accuse me of boldness in this undertaking.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may wonder that I observe no more proportion in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating the Articles of the Creed, whilst I am so large on some, and on others very brief. But for this I thought I had sufficient reason, when I considered, that about some of them (as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of <hi>Believing in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi>) there have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hot disputes, and some dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mistakes, of which there are still some popular Books and Sermons too full, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the endeavours of many excellent Divines for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval. That which I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in sincerely aimed at, is onely to represent the Gospel in its native plainness and simplicity, that the Text might not be spoiled by a dark Comment, as too oft it
<pb facs="tcp:49267:4"/>
is, whilst easie and obvious truths are obscur'd with hard words, and with such subtil notions and distinctions, that if the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Common people lay upon the understanding of them, their case were hard.</p>
            <p>In the explication of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles, (as especially that of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>) I have consulted the particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and danger of that people, amongst whom at present the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God hath cast my lot. And to this I was the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, as finding not long since in some of their hands an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Creed by a Popish Author, wherein he endeavours, though with miserable success, to shelter some of the prime novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and falshoods of Popery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Articles of the common Christian Faith. And under that
<pb facs="tcp:49267:4"/>
head of <hi>the Catholick Church</hi> would fain perswade us, that the Roman Church and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick are of equal signification and extent. In order whereto, with their usual cunning, he jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles I can't tell how many things together, and asks his Scholar how he can prove that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Head of the Church, and the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> his Successors in this power and dignity. And the Proof is only from those two Texts, which they so commonly press to this purpose. <hi>Joh.</hi> the last, 15, 16, 17. Mat. 16. 18. The insufficiencie of which Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for that end they produce them, hath an hundred times over been shewn them; whilst from Christs command, in the former place, to St. <hi>Peter</hi> to feed his flock, that is, to be diligent in preaching to them the Gospel, they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb facs="tcp:49267:5"/>
his power over the whole Church, because forsooth thereis mention made both of <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Sheep.</hi> And the title given him in the latter place (supposing it to be spoke rather of his person than consession) is no more than what we find bestowed on the other Apostles, <hi>Eph. 2. 20. Rev. 21. 14.</hi> But all this while, here's not a syllable of his establishment in the Bishoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor of any power over the universal Church to be derived from him to his successours in that Sex; nor yet will they ever be able to shew, why this power (if any such there had been) should not rather be confer'd upon the Sex of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> whereof they grant him to have been Bishop, before he was at <hi>Rome.</hi> On such meer uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties do depend the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Romish</hi> faith. But
<pb facs="tcp:49267:5"/>
these things 'tis needless here to repeat; only I shall desire any man that is impartial to let his own conscience judge, whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition I have afterward given of atrue Catholick Christian, <hi>That he is one who sincerely believes the doctrines, and obeys the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Jesus Christ,</hi> be not far more agreeable to Scripture and reason, than that which Popish Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors give, whilst they would have it essential to a Christian to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctej to the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And Ineed not suggest to the judicious, how considerably the Popish Cause is weakned by this single conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That a man may be a true Catholick Christian,</hi> (as I have before defined him) <hi>and so be saved, without being subject to the Pope.</hi> For if this once be granted (as needs it must, if Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reason may be of any
<pb facs="tcp:49267:6"/>
force in the dispute) then it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that all their loud talk about the Infallibility of the Church, the Authority of the Church, no salvation is to be had out of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is nothing else but empty noise: And a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Quakers</hi> or any other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if they were got but good store of them together, might talk just at the same rate, and with much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the same reason; whilst they arrogate all those things to their own party, which are spoke of the Universal Church of Christ, if not more than we find ascribed even to this. Yea, and grant that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were a sound part of this universal Church, yet still'tis but a part, and therefore could not, with any pretence of reason, lay claim to those promises and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which pertain to the whole Church, any more than any other
<pb facs="tcp:49267:6"/>
part equally sound might do. But this is not a place to discourse these matters at large.</p>
            <p>One thing more I cannot but mention, which I observed in the forenamed Popish Treatise, <hi>viz.</hi> the Authors endeavour to prove the lawfuless of praying to Saints, and that from <hi>Gen. 48. 16.</hi> Where Iacob blessing Iosephs children, saith, <hi>Let my name be named on them, and the name of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Isaac. Here for <hi>named</hi> he renders it <hi>invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> (which makes nothing for his advantage, since even thus it is not invocated <hi>by</hi> but <hi>on</hi> them) and thence would fain perswade his Readers, that <hi>Jacob</hi> here exhorts his Sons to pray to him when dead, and to their forefathers. Though I can hardly think this Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was so perswaded, but offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as much violence to his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:49267:7"/>
as to the Text, when he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it as a proof of that, to which it hath not the least refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: being spoke onely of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi> into the number of his Sons, according to <hi>ver. 5.</hi> of that <hi>Chap.</hi> and so they were afterwards reckoned with the rest, as Heads of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Tribes. (Is it any wonder, by the way, if this sort of men have such a low esteem of Scripture, when they can have no more service from it at their greatest needs?) Upon this occasion it was, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Exposition of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> I have in an Answer or two shewn, to whom it is we ought to direct our prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>God onely through Jesus Christ,</hi> of which I have there, I hope, given sufficient evidence. So plain and justifiable is the doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Church, in this and all
<pb facs="tcp:49267:7"/>
other matters of moment in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they themselves not daring to disapprove of what we doe, whilst we justly reject and sufficiently disprove their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to Christianity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they have loaded and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</p>
            <p>Throughout the explication of the Creed (there being seldome any need under the other Heads) I have been careful to annex Scripture-Proofs to all those points, which might in the least seem to need them, and were capable of that way of Proof.</p>
            <p>In the end I have added two Forms of prayer, useful for fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that have no better helps: two also for the younger sort; together with two graces to be used before and after meat. In the drawing up of which I have been so careful,
<pb facs="tcp:49267:8"/>
that I hope there lies no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objection against the matter of them: And then, as for those who think a Form it self unlawful, I shall not stand to concern my self with their objections or censure. May but these weak endeavours conduce any thing to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the knowledge and practice of that <hi>Doctrine which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Godliness,</hi> that is, of our Christian Religion, all whose do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Precepts, are every way sitted to make men godly here, and blessed hereafter, I shall then have my end, and let God have the praise.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Why is the Divine Spirit called Holy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not only as he is holy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 13. Tit. 3. 5.</note> but also as it is his peculiar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to make men holy.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He hath revealed the will of<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21. Ioh. 16. 13. Rom. 8. 13. Gal. 5. 22.</note> God in the holy Scriptures, and carries on the interest and design of Christ in the world, by turning mens hearts from the world to God, from sin to holiness.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We need no Traditions beside<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 9.</note> the Scripture: but the Tradition or delivery of Christian Religion, and the Holy Scriptures, from one generation to another, ever since the time of Christ and his Apostles, gives us great assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their truth, and helps us to judge what books belong to the Canon of Scripture, and what do not.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I do hereby profess to believe, that Jesus Christ hath a Church upon earth,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49267:16"/>
made up of all his true and living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12.</note> which may be called that Body whereof he is the Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is there not some one Person here in earth, appointed to be visible head o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Universal Church, who is to be held Christs Vicar on Earth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We read of no such thing in<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 23. Rom. 13. 1. Act. 20. 28. Heb. 13. 17. Eph. 2. 20. 21.</note> Scripture, and therefore have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe it; but under Christ, Princes and Pastours are the Heads and Governours in their respective do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why is this Church called holy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because the members thereof are<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 26, 27. 1 Thess. 4. 7. Rom. 6. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 15.</note> separated from the rest of the world, dedicated to God, and engaged to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in heart and life.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Such whose belief and life is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 29. Ioh. 15. 5. 8. 14.</note> to their profession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why is it called the Catholique or Universal Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To shew that it is not confin'd<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 10, 11. Col. 3. 11.</note> to any particular place or nation, as the Church of the Jews was, but is spread abroad over the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it proper then to give the name of <hi>Catholick</hi> onely to those who are of this or that particular Church or Sect?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, not at all, but very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How is it then that some say, that the Church of Rome is the Catholique Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is neither sense nor chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, since it is as much as to say, that one part (and a bad one too) is the whole; and that no man can be a true Christian, except he be of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are not all Christians in the world bound to be subject to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, not though it should be<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12. The <hi>Cephas</hi> here named was St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (see Ioh. 1. 42.) who therefore could not be Head of the whole church much less the Popes his pretended Successours.</note> Reformed, any more than they are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49267:17"/>
bound to be subject to the Church of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> which are but parts of the Universal Church; And many good Christians there were in the world, before there was a Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> and many have been since, who perhaps never heard of any such place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not all one then to be Papists and Catholicks?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Upon no account, since Papists (how many so ever they be) are but a particular Sect of Christians, as Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists or Quakers are, and a Sect that hath done a world of mischief to the Church of God, by their dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous innovations, both in opinion and practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Who then is properly and truly a Catholick Christian?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He that heartily believes all<note place="margin">Mar. 16 16. Act. 10. 34, 35. Gal. 6. 15. 16. Rom. 14. 17, 18.</note> that Jesus Christ hath revealed, and sincerely endeavours to do all that he hath commanded, is the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, of what Church or nation soever he be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is one of the best signs of such a true Catholick?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49267:18"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> To have a great deal of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 35. Rom. 14. 3, 4.</note> for all his fellow Christians, though they are not in all things of the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> And does that sign agree to that Sect who absurdly call themselvos Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catholicks?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Less than to any other Sect whatever, for they are bound by the definitions of Popes &amp; Councils (which if they contradict, they cannot be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists) to judge all men damn'd that are not of their Sect, thereby condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning many millions of Christians far better than themselves; which horrid uncharitableness, is enough to keep wise men from amongst them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are the Churches which be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from Popish innovations parts of the Catholick Church of Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, and the best and soundest parts thereof, agreeing in all matters of substance, with the Church of Christ in all ages and nations of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How prove you that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In that these reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (as particularly our Church of <hi>England</hi>) do profess to hold nothing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49267:18"/>
as necessary to salvation, which is not contained in the holy Scriptures; which same Scriptures are received and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by all other Christian Churches, who do thereby approve of all that we hold as necessary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But why did these reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at first depart from Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 16, 17, 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because the Romish Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed such new fangled doctrines and practises, as were plainly contrary to the word of God; and therefore it was in those things to be departed from, by all those who would conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the ancient Church, as it was settled by Christ and his Apostles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What mean you by <hi>Communion of Saints?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That Communion which Saints<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 3. 1 Cor. 12, 13. Act. 2. 4. 2.

they who repent of their sins, trust in<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 32. 1 Thess. 1. 10.</note> and obey the Lord Jesus, shall, for his sake, find God so gracious to them, as to free them from that condemnation and punishment to which their sins made them liable.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> I hereby profess to believe, that<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 51. 1 Thess. 4. 14. 15, 16. Ioh. 5. 28, 29.</note> at the last day, God will raise up all that were dead, and change those that are then alive, and that they shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Judgment-Seat of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What mean you by <hi>Life everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>A.</hi> I do hereby profess my belief<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 10. Mat. 25. 26.

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But does it not seem very harsh to think, that God should punish any the worst of sinners with everlasting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, not when we consider<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 15. &amp;c. Ioh. 3. 16, 17.</note> what graciou terms were proposed to them, for their obtaining of glory, and

escaping of this misery; and how they<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 36. Ioh. 5. 40. Act. 13. 46.</note> themselves did wilfully refuse the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of grace, when they knew this misery would follow upon that refusal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What then is safest for us all to do in this case?</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I am the Lord thy God, which<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c.</note> brought the out of the land of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other Gods before me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What learn you from the first commandment and the Preface set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I hence learn, that we are bound

to acknowledge that God, who is our Maker, Owner, and the giver of all our mercies, to be the only true and living God, and to behave our selves toward him accordingly.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> How doth it beseem us creatures to behave our selves toward this our God?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Which is the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation of them that hate me, and shewing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49267:20"/>
mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What are we taught in the second Commandment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The second Commandment tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us to worship God according to his own appointment, and to take spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial heed that we make not any image or picture of him; nor give religious worship to an Image, upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What reason do you find given for the engaging our obedience to this Command?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The reason here given is, that God is a jealous God, who therefore will not suffer himself to be dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by mens making and worshipping any thing as an Image of him, but will severely punish such idolaters and their posterity; whilst the true lovers and worshippers of him shall be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously rewarded, even to many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What other reason do you find given in the repetition of the Law? <hi>Deut. 4. 12, 15, 16.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We there find this farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49267:21"/>
that when God spake to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel,</hi> they only heard a voice, but saw no similitude, (or bodily shape) and therefore it is unreasonable to make any image or resemblance of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How ought we then to conceive of God when we worship him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We ought not to conceive of him<note place="margin">Isa. 40. 18. Ioh. 4. 24. 1 Tim. 1. 17. Psal. 116. 5. Ier. 23, 23, 24.

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the third commandment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What are we taught in the third Commandment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The third Commandment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us to have so great reverence for God, as not to take his name in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Who are they that take Gods name in vain?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49267:21"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chiefly they who dare swear<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 12. Prov. 30. 9. Mat. 5. 33, 34, 35, 36.</note> falsly by the name of God, and they also who in their passion or ordinary discourse, break forth into swearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What Rule hath Christ given for our ordinary communication, that we may avoid swearing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That we should barely affirm<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 37. Iam. 5. 12.</note> or deny a thing, using yes or no, or the like expressions, without oaths or imprecations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it enough to justifie these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon oaths, that some men will not (as is pretended) believe others, except they swear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, this is but a vain excuse, since sober and good men are easily believed on their bare word, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon swearers are seldome thought to make conscience even of what they swear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not enough to justifie these oaths, that what is sworn is truth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, for an oath must be taken<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 16.</note> only when we are lawfully called thereto, in some weighty case which cannot otherwise be well determined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49267:22"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Who else may be said to take the name of God in vain?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They who are careless and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent in the worship of God, and they who upon every light occasion cry out, <hi>oh God,</hi> or <hi>oh Lord,</hi> when they have no sense nor thought of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majesty, whose sacred name they rashly mention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What reason is urged to keep us from this sin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The consideration of that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which, sooner or later, God will certainly execute upon those who are guilty of this profaneness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Majesty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Remember the Sabboth day to keep it holy; six days shalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabboth of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy Son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattel, nor the stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49267:22"/>
earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabboth day, and hallowed it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What are you taught in the fourth Commandment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The fourth Commandment tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us that it is our duty to set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part one day in seven, for the solemn worship and service of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What reason is here mentioned for the enforcing this Command?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Gods allowance of six days in the week for our worldly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his own example in resting on the seventh, when he had made the world in six days before.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why do we Christians keep the first day of the week?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In remembrance of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Mar. 16. 9.</note> wrought by the Lord Jesus, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of his Resurrection, which was upon the first day of the week.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The example of the Apostles<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 19. 26. Act. 2. 1. 1 Cor. 16. 2. Rev. 1. 10. 1 Cor. 11. 16.

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How ought we to spend the Lords day?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In the worship and Service of God, both publick and private; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in meditating on and praising him for his works of Creation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Are there no works lawful on this day?</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49267:23"/>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They, who, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, take journeys, or follow their employments on this day, or else spend the same in idleness and pleasure; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the service of God in publick, or in their Family, accounting it a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to spend a day in works of Piety and devotion.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> What especially is to be done by us that we may avoid the breach of this Commandment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We ought diligently to follow<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 28.

               <hi>A.</hi> Thou shalt not covet thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife, nor his man servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his asse, nor any thing that is thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>

their Servants, as they themselves were they servants, would in reason desire to be dealt with; we must not give that ill language to others, nor raise or entertain such stories of them, as we our selves cannot bear, when we are so us'd; The Seller must deal as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly and justly, as he desires to be dealt with, when he comes to buy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, but we need the assistance<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5. Iam. 1. 5.</note> of Gods grace, which we are to seek for by prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> To whom ought our prayers to be made?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To God only, in the name of<note place="margin">Psal. 65. 2. Col. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> May we not then pray to Angels and Saints?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, for we have no warrant<note place="margin">Col. 2. 18.</note> for it from Scripture, (which, in so weighty a matter of religion, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary) but very much against it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Name to me some one Text of Scripture, where we are commanded to worship God only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Mat.</hi> 4. 10. Thou shalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49267:27"/>
the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Where are we expresly forbidden the worship of Angels?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 9. when <hi>St. Iohn</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to worship the Angel, he said to him, see thou do it not, for I am thy sellow-servant, worship God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But may we not pray to Saints and Angels, as our Mediatours, that they would pray to God for us; as when we put up a petition to the King, we make use of some Courtier to present it for us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> No, for there is no likeness in<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 15. Ier. 23. 23.</note> the case, God himself being most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and always near to us; and moreover it tends to the great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Lord Jesus, who is our only Mediatour, by whom we are to offer up our prayers to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Name me some one Text to prove that Christ is our onely Mediatour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. There is one God, and one Mediatour betwixt God and Men, the Man <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What farther reason can you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge against praying to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49267:28"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is in vain to pray to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Iob. 14. 21. Isa. 63. 16. Ier. 23, 24.</note> we have no reason to believe that they can hear the prayers that are made to them from several parts of the world; it being proper to God only to be in all places at once.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it lawful before hand to know the words we intend to use in prayer, that is, to use a form of our own or others making?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, it is lawful, since it is no where forbidden in Scripture, and the directions there given concerning pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be practised either with or without a form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But we are taught in Scripture<note place="margin">Iude 20. Eph. 6. 18.</note> to pray with or in the Script; and does not that forbid the use of a Form?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, not at all, since we may pray with the Spirit, even then when we use a Form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> When therefore may a man be said to pray with the Spirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When in his prayers he is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and serious, his soul being filled with those holy desire and affections, which are wrought in him by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49267:28"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is there in the Gospel any Form given us for our direction in prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, that which Christ taught his Disciples, and therefore called the Lords prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Let me hear you repeat it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Our Father which art in heaven,<note place="margin">Mat 6. 9. &amp;c.</note> Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven, Give us this day our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us, and Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Into what parts may this prayer fitly be divided?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Preface, six petitions, and the Conclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What learn you from the Preface, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That in all our addresses to God we ought to come before him with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and reverence, and yet with a firm confidence in his fatherly mercy and goodness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What do you pray for in the first
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49267:29"/>
Petition, <hi>Hallowed be thy name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That God may be known, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and worshiped aright both by us, and the whole world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What do you pray for in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Petition, <hi>Thy kingdom come?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That God may rule in the hearts and lives of men by his Spirit and laws; that the Church may be enlarged by the conversion of Heathens and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and that the coming of Christ in glory may be hastned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What do you pray for in the third Petition, which is, <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We herein pray that God would so conform all our hearts to his will, that we may (in our measure) serve and honour him as faithfully, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unweariedly, as the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in heaven do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What pray you for in the sourth, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We herein pray that God would of his mercy afford to our Bodies such a measure of things needful and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, as our daily necessities call for.</p>
            <p>Q <hi>What pray you for in the fifth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49267:29"/>
Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We herein pray that God would be merciful unto us, and not inflict on us those punishments which we for our sins have deserved.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What means that expression,</hi> as we forgive them that trespass against us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We hereby profess both that it<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 14, 15.</note> is our duty and our practice, to forgive such as trespass against us; and are thence encouraged to hope for mercy from God, this forgiveness of others being one condition of his forgiving us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> When may we be said to forgive him that trespassed against us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When we bear no more grudg nor ill will to him than to any other; nor would revenge our selves, by doing him any injury, if it lay in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; nor do rejoyce in any hurt that does befall him, but are ready to do him good, if he stand in need of our help.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What then is their case, who, though they know this rule in the Gospel,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49267:30"/>
and daily say this prayer, yet will not forgive men their trespasses?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are guilty of lying to God in their prayers, and do moreover, in effect, desire God not to forgive their sins, but to punish them with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the best motive to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this so needful and difficult duty of forgiving Offendours?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Gods readiness to pardon us,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 32, 33, 34, 35.</note> who have yet done infinitely more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, than any of our fellow-creatures can possibly do against us; the serious consideration whereof, will be apt to make us such towards others, as we desire God should be toward us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. What do we pray for in the sixth petition,</hi> Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We herein pray, that God would not leave us to our selves, to run into temptation and sin, but that he would make us ever so watchful and diligent, that we may either avoid the occasions of sin, or, through the help of his grace, may overcome the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations we meet with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49267:30"/>
               <hi>Q. To what use serve those words in the conclusion,</hi> For thine is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> These words serve as our encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, to ask all these things from God, to whom alone belongs all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and dominion; and they direct us to render all praise and glory to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and ever-blessed Majesty.</p>
            <p>Q. Wherefore do we say <hi>Amen,</hi> at the end of this and other prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This word <hi>Amen</hi> (which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies as much as <hi>verily,</hi> or <hi>so be it</hi>) is used, to express the earnest desire and great hopes we have, that our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will be heard and answered.</p>

               <salute>Beloved Friends.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu might with some reason be displeased with me, should I question your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the being of a God, and of your relation to him, as he is your Creator, Ruler and Benefactor: but you can have no reason to be displeased with me for exhorting you to the performance of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which this belief doth strongly engage you to, that is, to testifie your acknowledgment of God and dependance upon him, by your dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offering up a sacrifice of prayer and praise to his Divine Majesty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49267:32"/>
For if you dare live at such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from God, as not to come before him, and worship him, its much to be feared, you do not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily believe <hi>that he is, or that he is a Rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently seek him.</hi> And this while, alas! how little do you differ from Heathens, though you may carry the name of Christians? And if <hi>wrath</hi> shall be <hi>poured</hi> out <hi>on the Heathen kingdoms and families, that know not God, nor call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name,</hi> (Ier. 10. 25.) do you think it shall sare any better with the Families of those who are called Christians, if, whilst they <hi>profess to know God,</hi> they do not worship and <hi>glorifie him as God?</hi> Nay rather shall they not have a greater condemnation?</p>
            <p>But I need not, I hope, stand arguing with you, to shew either the necessity, the reasonableness or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49267:32"/>
benefit of this duty of prayer in general, or of praying with your families. If there should be any so perverse and quarrelsome, as to call for arguments; instead thereof, to such let me only say, If indeed you think, that neither you nor yours are any way related to God, nor owe him any service, you may at your pleasure (and also at your peril) forbear to render him any. If you think you stand in no need of daily protection, or of any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy either for soul or body, or think that God cannot supply you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, then chuse whether you will pray to him or no. And if you are not every day beholden to God for some good thing or other, then you may neglect to give him thanks for his goodness. And if on a Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, or at a dying hour, you think there will be no need of prayer, you may then omit it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49267:33"/>
in the time of life and health.</p>
            <p>But for all those, who wouldnot be thought guilty of such Atheism and profaneness, I would beseech them to make conscience of this duty.</p>
            <p>To this end let me advise you, every day, morning, and evening, to take the most convenient time, when your whole family can come together, and then to joyn all in humble, solemn prayer and praise to that great and glorious God, who is the maker and preserver of us all. And for your more orderly performance of this duty, if you have no better helps at hand, you may, if you see good, make use of the Forms ensuing, compos'd for that purpose.</p>
            <p>Here fall not, I beseech you, to devising of excuses to shift off this work any more than you would do, if you and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49267:33"/>
were invited to a feast, or to share in some great Dole.</p>
            <p>For shame pretend not you are so poor, or so hard wrought, that you cannot spare time for this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, as if this was only for rich men, who have nothing else to do. I know, indeed, there is more required of them than of you that are poorer: but yet you have souls to save as well as they; and therefore, if you have any love for your selves, you will be as willing to take what pains you can to save them. You would not leave it to rich men only, to eat, and drink, and sleep; nor should you any more leave it to them only, to pray to God, and to read and hear his word: since these works of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are for your own interest, even for the health and happiness of your souls, as those common actions are for the preserving of your bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49267:34"/>Moreover I am fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if you cast up your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts right, you shall never find your selves one penny the poorer at the years end, for having spent every day one quarter or half an hour, in prayer to God, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and meditating on his holy word, or in any other such good employment. And yet more for your encouragement, I dare assure you, that at your lives end, you shall never repent of the time thus spent, no not though it had been twice as much, if in all other parts of religion you shall have been equally careful.</p>
            <p>Much more might be said; but I shall only add, to you that cry out, how little time you have, and therefore grudge to allow any of it for holy duties, I very much suspect, that you can every day spend much more than these would take up, in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49267:34"/>
idleness and vanity, nay perhaps in the Alehouse, to the great hurt of body, soul and estate. Bethink you then soberly, when all your time comes to be reckoned for, which way of spending it will be most to your comfort, and now do accordingly. Or if you say you have no time to throw away thus idly, yet what a great matter would it be, to rise one quarter of an hour sooner than usual, and to spend that time in prayer? you could do more than this for your own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or for a small profit; and shall not the love of God and your duty to him prevail as much with you?</p>
            <p>Nor yet think it will be enough for your excuse, to pretend, that your employment is of that nature, that your Family cannot come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for prayer, especially not in the morning, (which is like to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49267:35"/>
be the plea of the Husbandman rather than the Tradesman) This I say, will not excuse your neglect, since I question not, but that by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing your time of prayer a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle earlier, or by a prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of your affairs, you may ordinarily avoid this difficulty.</p>
            <p>This I speak upon good grounds, since there are many, whose busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the world is as great as yours, and their callings the very same, who can yet well enough keep up Family prayer, without any such inconvenience as you would pretend. And what, pray, should hinder, but you may do the same, if you have but the same love to God and zeal for his worship that they have.</p>
            <p>But however, when some of the Family are necessarily absent, let as many come together as can, and lay a charge upon your children or
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49267:35"/>
servants, when at any time they cannot joyn with you in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they be sure to take some time to pray to God by themselves in private; for which purpose I have added two shorter Forms for those of the younger sort.</p>
            <p>And indeed I would advise all, beside their performance of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-duties, to set apart some little time (once in a day at least) for their more secret prayer to God, which seems plainly enjoyned by our Saviour himself, <hi>Mat. 6. 6. When thou prayest, enter into thy Closet; and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</hi> Nor can I well see, how that man is ever like to hold on in a religious course of life, who is not wont thus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to betake himself to God,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49267:36"/>
there to make his particular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, petitions, and returns of praise, and to ease himself of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever burden lies on his mind, which before others he cannot so freely do. And in these private prayers, there is not commonly so much need of a Form: all our work now being to express the desires of our own souls to God only, even to such a God as looks at the sincerity of the heart, and not at the nimbleness or eloquence of our tongues. Nor indeed is it likely any Form should fully reach to every mans particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar case. But your best help will be, to get well acquainted with the state of your own souls; to know well your sins, your temptations, your necessities and dangers; and to get deeply affected with the sense of your spiritual and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments: and then do but with uprightness and humility represent
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49267:36"/>
the very inward sense of your souls to God, in the name of his Son Iesus, and you shall never fail of acceptance, through any weakness of expression: Yea, remember, it is this inward sincerity of heart that must at all times accompany your prayers, if ever you hope for acceptance.</p>
            <p>And therefore, before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, let me make it my earnest request to you, that you take speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al heed to the frame of your hearts, whenever you come before God in prayer, as in all other holy duties you ought. Think it not enough to speak a few good words upon your knees, evening and morning, with a seeming reverence, whilst in the mean time, your hearts are never moved or affected with what you are doing. This is such a lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service as neither will be acceptable to God, nor will do any good to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49267:37"/>
your selves. Leave it to poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and deluded <hi>Papists,</hi> to number their prayers by their beads, and to think they have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God very well, when they have patter'd over so many <hi>Creeds, Pater-nosters</hi> and <hi>Ave-maries;</hi> a <hi>devotion</hi> which a Parrot might go near to learn, and sufficiently shews that <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of it. but you who, through the mercy of God, do live in a Church, where you have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taught, do you shew forth the fruit of your teaching and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and that, by offering up to God those services which beseem reasonable creatures: and which are suited to the nature of him whom you serve, <hi>who is a spirit, and will be worshiped in spirit and truth;</hi> who is a living God, and will not be put off with a dead carkase, with the bare moving of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49267:37"/>
lips, the noise of words, or posture of the body, but will have all the powers and faculties of our souls employed in the duties we perform to him. This is part of that <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable service,</hi> which he now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially requires from us, instead of the sacrifice of beasts, and the burden of lifeless ceremonies, which were used in the Iewish Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christs coming, <hi>Rom. 12. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See, then, I beseech you, that your very hearts and souls go along with your tongues in prayer; and let your affections be suited to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts thereof. This is the true <hi>praying in the Spirit,</hi> whether with or without a Form. Let your confession of sin be attended with a deep sorrow and humiliation for it, with a bitter hatred of, and strong resolutions against it. Think what a frame you should be in, and what earnestness you should use, if
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49267:38"/>
begging for your life of a Prince or Iudge; and labour to be like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, whilst you are begging from God forgiveness of sins and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Whilst you are blessing God for his goodness, let your hearts be drawn sorth to the exercise of holy love and delight in him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly thirst after that grace you pray for, resolving with diligence to labour for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by what I have now said, you may plainly perceive, that the sincerity of your hearts in prayer is to be known, not so much by your present servour and affection, as by your behaviour afterward, and by the constant tenour of your lives. He, and he only is the true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of God, and prays to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, who, by his daily actions and endeavours, doth manifest the same inward setled apprehensions and desires, which his words
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49267:38"/>
express whil'st he is praying.</p>
            <p>For instance, you beg of God, to take off your hearts from the world, and all things here below, and to increase in you a love to himself, to his Son Iesus, and to the glory which is above. Now to manifest that you are sincere in this request, you must do your part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the obtaining of what you beg, that is, you must set your selves to the serious consideration of the vanity, the shortness and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of present things; you must consider the nature of your own souls, and the allsufficiency of God; you must reflect upon the goodness he hath already shown, the love of Christ in dying for us, and the great and precious promises of the Gospel: and by this means you shall find the Spirit of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in you those graces which you pray for. So when you pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49267:39"/>
this or that sin, to which you are most enclined, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of, you must both use particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar considerations against it, and must keep out of the temptations, avoid the place and company where you are like to be drawn to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Otherwise what do you but solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mock God? As if one man should come to another, and with a great deal of adoe beg his help in any labour, and then run away and never set's own hand to't. Or as if a man should pray to have his house kept from burning, and then straight way go and put fire to it. In prayers for temporal mercies you do not do thus: for beside praying for your <hi>daily bread,</hi> you take pains to get it, in your several trades and employments. And do you think you are not bound to do as much for your souls as for your bodies? Or have you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49267:39"/>
of <hi>grace,</hi> any more than of <hi>daily bread,</hi> without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring for it in the way God hath set you? Nay, rather, whereas you are oft restrained from too much care about the world, you are again and again enjoyned to <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the meat which endures to everlasting life,</hi> Ioh. 6. 27.</p>
            <p>For the Lords sake, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of cheating your souls with that common mistake, which is the ruine of thousands, both of this party and that, whilst they foolishly imagine, that their much praying and hearing will serve turn for their salvation, instead of an holy heart and life; and so they are but devout in the Church or Closet, it matters not what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they take in the market, in the shop, or at the Alehouse; and when they have but said a good prayer in the morning, they may
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49267:40"/>
do what they list all the day after, or at least, they can make all whole by praying devoutly at night.</p>
            <p>How grosly do such men abuse themselves and their services, who would by these excuse themselves from holiness, when as one great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of them is to help and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us for strict and holy living.</p>
            <p>And therefore have I endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so to contrive the ensuing Forms, that they who use them might even thereby find themselves instructed and engaged to be <hi>holy in all manner of Conversation.</hi> For which there seems sufficient warrant in our Blessed <hi>Saviours</hi> own example, in that most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Form which he hath given us, whilst, with the petition for that great and comprehensive mercy of the Gospel, <hi>Forgiveness of sins,</hi> he hath interwoven an engagement to that great duty (which will
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49267:40"/>
prove us to be Christians indeed) <hi>the forgiving of all those who who have trespast against us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this then be firmly believed, and deeply fixt in your minds; that as <hi>you</hi> would be loth to take up with a parcel of <hi>good words</hi> from your servants every day, instead of the <hi>work</hi> you set them; so no more will <hi>God</hi> be put off with prayers, Sermons, or any thing, instead of a sincere and hearty endeavour to render a constant, universal obedience to his pure and righteous commands. Christ himself hath plainly enough told us, what's like to become of all those, who only cry <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and yet do not obey the will of God, <hi>Mat. 7. 21.</hi> We must <hi>wash our hands in innocency, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass Gods Altar,</hi> if we would have our offerings accepted of him, <hi>Psal. 26. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49267:41"/>And beside our endeavours to <hi>glorifie God by offering up of praise,</hi> we must <hi>order our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation aright, if ever we would see the salvation of God,</hi> Psal. 50. 23. Of almost all men I know, I pray God deliver my soul from the state of those, who can pray devoutly, (be it with book or without) and yet go on in sin securely.</p>
            <p>But 'tis time for me to conclude, though I have much ado to confine my self on so needful a Subject. To shut up all then: who-ever thou art that readest this, <hi>Let thy soul</hi> (to use the Psalmists phrase, <hi>Psal. 63. 8.) follow hard after God,</hi> in earnest pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, both in the Church, thy Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, and thy Family: and beside this, do thou <hi>follow after peace and holiness,</hi> (Heb. 12. 14.) in thy life and conversation; so
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49267:41"/>
shalt thou certainly see and enjoy God in that glory, where prayers shall be turned into everlasting praises. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>MORNING PRAYER for a Family.</head>
               <p>MOst Holy and ever-blessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, Thou renewest thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon us every Morning; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morning we desire to renew our thanksgivings. And here we are now come before thee, humbly to offer up thanks and praise for our safety and refreshment this last night, to thee the God of love, who givest us daily cause to admire thy bounty, and to speak good of thy name. We acknowledge thee, oh God, to be our Maker and Preserver; thou didst at first give us life and reason; and from thee it is we have received all the comforts of life, from the very day of our birth to this present morning. Through thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it is we have enjoyed any measure of health and strength, and have been furnisht with things needfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for this present state. Thy good hand of providence hath still been over us, either in keeping us out of dangers and troubles, or else in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49267:42"/>
and helping us under them, or in delivering us out of the same. For these and all other thy mercies, at any time bestowed on us or ours, or any of the Sons of men, we desire to render humble and hearty praise to thy divine Majesty. Yea, blessed, and for ever praised be thy name oh God, that thou hast not only shewn much mercy to our bodies, but hast also made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant provision for the everlasting welfare and happiness of our precious souls. Most fully hast thou declared to the world, both in thy word and by thy works, that thou hast no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the death of sinners, but hadst rather that they would turn and live: For even then when we were fallen from thee, and from that blessed estate wherein our first Parents were created, and so stood liable to thy wrath and to everlasting damnation; then wast thou pleased to take pity on us, when none else in heaven or earth did pity or could relieve us; Even then didst thou give thine own Son <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> from heaven to be our Saviour and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to teach us thy will, to give us
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49267:43"/>
thy Spirit, and to die for our sins, that as many as believe on him and obey him, should not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life. Oh, what manner of love is this, which thou the Father hast shewn, and which thy Son <hi>Iesus</hi> hath shewn to us worthless creatures, to us vile sinners! The sense of our own unworthiness may justly encrease our admiration of thy kindness: and when we consider all this thy goodness, great cause we have to humble our souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, in the remembrance of our own sinful and most unsuitable carriage toward thee the God of love. We did indeed bring along into the world with us sinful natures and inclinations; for in sin we were conceived, and brought forth in iniquity. And alas! how many sins have we committed since we came to the use of our Reason! Though thou hast always been doing us good, yet, like foolish and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wretches we have returned evil for good. We have been far from loving thee and trusting in thee as beseems thy creatures: but rather have we wasted our love upon the vain and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49267:43"/>
enjoyments of this present world; in them have we delighted, and in them have we placed our confidence. Though we have called thee our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Owner, yet have we not qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly and patiently submitted to thy will, as we are therefore bound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are thy own: But very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy we have been, both to murmur and repine at thy providences, when they have gone cross to our carnal desires; and to find fault with thy laws, as if they were too strict and severe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are contrary to our foolish sensual inclinations. Oftentimes have we neglected the duties of thy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, mis-spent and profaned thy Holy day, and have look'd on prayers, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Sacraments as burthensome and needless things. And very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and careless have we been in those duties we have performed; not duly considering what an holy and glorious God thou art, with whom we have to do. Thou indeed hast commanded us to love our neighbours as our selves; but we, through the sinful and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive love of our selves and our own
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49267:44"/>
concernments, have been very much wanting in the duties of justice and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to others. Much of our precious time we have wasted in idleness and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in unprofitable and sinful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and too frequently we have abused thy good creatures, for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our own base lusts. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have we given way to our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly passions and sinful inclinations, breaking thy laws, and grieving thy Spirit, merely for the tasting those pleasures of sin that are but for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And these deeds of darkness, these sins of ours we have committed in the open light of thy Gospel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the plain commands of thy word, which we have often read and heard, yea contrary to the motions of thy Spirit, and the checks of our own consciences, which we have felt within us. Most justly therefore migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thou pour out the hottest of thy fury upon us, as having been of those disobedient servants, who have known thy will, and yet have not done the same. Nor can we expect any other than to be made infinitely and eternally
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49267:44"/>
miserable, if thou should'st deal with us after our deservings. But there is yet, through thy grace, a door of hope open for us; thou thy self hast provided a refuge, to which poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in this life-time, may fly for safety and comfort. For thou, oh most merciful Father, hast promised, that thou wilt, for thy Son <hi>Iesus</hi> sake, have mercy on all those, who are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved for their sins, humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing and speedily for saking the same. Now we must needs acknowledge those thy conditions of mercy are exceeding equal and gracious; and most just it is we should perish for ever, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the same. For we cannot, oh God, in reason expect, that our sins should be pardoned, if we wilfully continue in them; Nor can we ever hope that <hi>Christ</hi> should be our Saviour, if we do not own and obey him as our Lord; Nor can we look for the joys of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whilst we walk in those ways of wickedness, which lead to Hell and damnation. Oh wilt thou then make us sincerely willing to do what we our selves own to be so just and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49267:45"/>
that we may not dare in an hardned and impenitent manner, to go on in those ungodly courses, which we are convinced are so dangerous and mischievous. Let not our own vile lusts, nor the temptations of Satan, our malicious enemy, prevail with us to reject our blessed Saviour, and that eternal life which he purchast by his death, and now offers to us in the Gospel. How shall we then escape, if we neglect so great salvation? Or what shall we plead for our selves, at the last great day, if we that are called <hi>Christians</hi> should be found depisers of Christ? How justly may he then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy us, not only as enemies, but as Mockers; and may give us our porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the hottest place of the burning Lake, with Hypocrites and unbelievers. Wherefore we do now most humbly and earnestly beseech thee, oh thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies, and God of all grace, give us not up to such a reprobate mind and feared conscience: but together with enlightned minds, give us such soft and tender hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may look back on the sins we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49267:45"/>
with shame and sorrow; and may cast away from us even our most pleasant sins, with bitter loathing and hatred, never more to be reconciled to them. And for thy Son <hi>Iesus</hi> sake, be thou merciful to us, own us as thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones, and make us partakers of those great mercies and blessings, which he hath purchast for all his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful servants. For his sake alone we beg from thee the forgiveness of our sins, a freedome from thy wrath, and from everlasting damnation. And we do also beseech thee, by him to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from the evil of this present world, even from the snares of the Devil, and from the power of our own corruptions, that no sin may reign in our mortal bodies, so that we should yield obedience thereunto. Oh cleanse thou us from all secret sins, and let not presumptuous sins have dominion over us: But let thy holy Spirit ever rule in our hearts, and so guide us in all our thoughts, words and actions, that we may ever render a sincere and chearful obedience to all thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Fill us with such a sense of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49267:46"/>
thine infinite goodness, that we may love thee our God with all our heart and soul. And help us to shew this our love to thee, by our unfeigned love to thy people, and to all men. And make us still careful to deal with others so justly and charitably as we our selves desire to be dealt with. Keep us ever depending upon thy grace for strength and assistance, without which we can do nothing. Oh do not thou leave us to our selves; for then we perish. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake us not, oh God, at any time through our whole lives, nor suffer us to depart from thee; but keep us ever stedfast and unwearied in well doing. Wean our hearts from this world and all the comforts thereof; make us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways sensible that we are hasting away hence into eternity; and prepare us for that time when we must e're long be called away thither. Help us now to live in such frequent serious thoughts of death, that it may not be terrible nor hurtful when it comes. Now make us wise to set our affections on things above, and to lay up for our selves a treasure in the heavens, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49267:46"/>
when all things here below shall fail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may then be received into those everlasting habitations, which thou hast provided for them that love thee. With us shew mercy to the whole world. Let the Gospel of thy Son run and be glorified throughout all the earth: make it known to heathens and Infidels, and let it be obeyed by all that are called Christians. Let all Popish darkness, ignorance and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with all other errours and heresies, be driven away by the light and truth of thy pure Gospel; and let the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Christ</hi> in glory be hastned. Be merciful to these nations wherein we live, and grant we may be so hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and reformed, that we may be pardoned and spared. Be gracious to our dread Soveraign, and all his Royal Relations; enrich them with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thy holy Spirit: and make all our Magistrates faithful and zealous in punishing and suppressing wickedness, and in promoting vertue and godliness. Let thy blessing be upon the faithful Preachers of thy Gospel, encrease dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their number, and let their labours
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49267:47"/>
be blest and succeeded. Let all our differences be so compos'd, that we may live in peace and love, and with one heart and one mouth may glorifie thee our God. Bless our Friends and Relations, and make them thy faithful servants. Visit in mercy all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of affliction; whatever their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular necessities and burthens are, whether of soul or body, do thou sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably and suitably comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. And now, oh God, since through thy good providence, thou hast brought us to the beginning of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day, afford us we beseech thee thy gracious presence throughout the same. Let thy blessing be upon us in our lawful Callings and endeavours. Preserve us and all ours, if it be thy will, from all bodily dangers; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we beg that we may be kept from sin, the worst of evils. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are, or whatever we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, keep us sensible of thy eye that is ever upon us; that in all companies and employments, we may approve our selves to thee in well doing; and make us ever watchful against all sin
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49267:47"/>
and the temptations that lead to it. As we now have prayed to thee in the Morning, so let us remain in thy fear and service all the day long: And do thou so guide us, this day and all our days here on earth, by thy counsel, that we may at last be received to thy Glory. And all we humbly beg, for the Lord Jesus our dear Saviours sake; with whose words we conclude these our imperfect prayers, saying, as he himself hath taught us, <hi>Our Father which art</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>OH Eternal and ever-blessed God, thou art the maker and Lord of all things, who dost uphold the world by thy power, and govern it with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wisdome and justice: and we are the workmanship of thy hands, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon thy providence, and in thee live, move, and have our beings.

Oh what are we vile sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that thou shouldst have such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to us, and so earnestly invite us to thy service, who deserve not so much as to live on thy earth, or once to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in thy presence.

For we confess our selves to be by nature children of wrath, even as others being stained with that foul Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosy and pollution of sin, which was derived from our first Parents. But so little sense have we had of the evil and danger of this our estate, that we have even taken the direct course to make our selves more miserable, by adding daily our own actual sins to this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our natures. Oh how just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may we blush, and be confounded in our selves, when we look back upon our carriage in the world, from our childhood and youth up even until now. How much of this our time have we spent in sin and vanity, but how little in thy service? In every place and condition of life that we have been, we may easily remember the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sins we have been guilty of; but how little have we made it our business to obey thy laws, and honour thy name, either by doing good to others, or getting good to our own souls. We had soon learnt in words to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that we were made to serve thee our God; but in works we
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49267:49"/>
have denyed and disobeyed thee. We have been very forgetful of thee, and of thy authority over us; and have lived as if we owed thee no service, as if we thought thou hadst no regard to our actions now, nor wouldst ever call us to a reckoning for them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Though in our infancy we were baptized into thy name, and thereby bound to serve thee all our days in newness of life, yet we have often broke this Covenant, which we then entred into. Instead of performing our vows to renounce this world, and its pomps and vanities, with the flesh and the lusts thereof, we have been most eager lovers and followers of the world, and have made provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof. Oh how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hath the temptation of some world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit, or carnal sensual pleasure drawn us to cross thy will, and wound our own consciences, and to endanger the damning of our precious souls. And this whilst we have taken on us the name of <hi>Christians,</hi> and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to believe all that is revealed in the Gospel. Whilst we our selves have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49267:49"/>
spoken much against sin, and of the mischief and danger of it, yet have we securely allowed our selves in it; and have neglected those very duties, which we have confest to be just and reasonable, and for our own greatest good. Whilst we have seemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn this world as vanity, our chief business hath been to seek after it; and whilst we have spoke much of the joys of heaven, and with our tongues have extoll'd them, yet we have taken lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pains to make sure of them, by walking in those ways of holiness, which can only bring us to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. Yea, these and such like confessions as these have we often made before thee, and yet still have continued in the very same temper of mind and course of life, which we acknowledge to be so exceeding sinful and dangerous; as if we thought it enough for us, to condemn our ways without reforming them, to confess our sins without forsaking them. The very sins of our prayers themselves, the hypocrisie we have therein been guilty of, is enough for our condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49267:50"/>
Often have we prayed that thou wouldst vouchsafe to keep us without sin, and yet presently we our selves have carelesly and wilfully run into it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when we have been beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that the rest of our lives might be pure and holy, we have strait-way gone and polluted our selves with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and ungodly actions. And after we have gone from the hearing and reading of thy holy word, we have quickly forgotten and disobeyed it. What then shall we say unto the most righteous God, or wherewith shall we excuse our selves? For alas! our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins they do testify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. And if thou shouldst now be extream to mark what we have done amiss, and to deal with us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, how then shall we appear in thy presence, or whether shall we flee from thy wrath? But oh thou that art the Preserver of men, ever ready to shew mercy to the humble and penitent, look on us poor sinners with an eye of pity and tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion: And do thou now work in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49267:50"/>
our souls that unfeigned sorrow for the sins we stand guilty of, that we may be fitted for mercy and pardon, that so iniquity may not be our ruine. We come to thee, oh God, in the most blessed and prevailing name of thy Son Jesus, through him our Prince and our Saviour, begging both repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remission of sins. For his sake turn from us thy wrath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us into thy favour: Let his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, which he shed for sinners, cleanse us from all unrighteousness. And oh that this love which he hath shewn in dying for us may prevail with us to trust our souls with him; to love him and obey him, that so he may become to us the Author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal salvation. Oh Lord, grant we may never be so wickedly disingenuous and perverse, as to encourage our selves in sin, because Christ died for sinners; as if we might therefore hate him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath loved us: but make us ever so duly sensible of the ends of his death, that we may entirely give up our selves to him, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49267:51"/>
all iniquity, and purifie us to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Do thou graciously enable us, by our holy and unblameable walking, to adorn the doctrine of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in all things; and let this grace of thine which hath appeared to the world, bringing salvation, teach us to deny ungodliness and all worldly lusts, and to lead righteous, sober and godly lives, whilst we are in this present evil world. To this end, we beseech thee, oh God, through thy Son Jesus, to shed abroad thy holy Spirit into our hearts, and thereby to cleanse us from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, that we may perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in thy fear. Sanctifie us through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out both in body and soul, that we may be holy in heart and life, even in all manner of conversation. Take off our affections from all things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and six them on thy blessed self and the glory that is above; that we may never be so foolish, as to expect happiness from riches, pleasures, friends, or any worldly comforts, which are daily decaying and dying
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49267:51"/>
away: but let us ever trust in and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon thee the living God, who givest us all the good things we enjoy, and who alone canst make us perfectly happy, in the enjoyment of thy self for ever. Whilst we are here, in our travail through the world, we only beg of thee such a measure of outward comforts as thou seest most convenient for us and ours. Let us have thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with whatever we enjoy; and give us patient and contented minds under all thy dealings with us. Make us faithful in obeying thy Command, first to seek the Kingdom of Heaven and the righteousness thereof, and then we know thy promise shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, that all other things shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us, so as thou seest will be best for us. To thy will, oh God, we desire humbly to resign up our selves and all our affairs: only do thou keep us continually in thy fear and favour, and then deal with us as seems good in thy sight. Encrease in us a sincere love to all men, that we may carefully perform our duty to them, doing good to all, to the utmost of our power;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49267:52"/>
but never doing any kind of hurt or wrong to any, either in thought, word, or deed. Lord preserve us from envying the richest, or despising the poorest, and keep us ever free from hatred, malice, uncharitableness, and from all desire of revenge. Let thy grace so curb our passion, and change our corrupt natures, that we may not render evil for evil, but may always study to overcome evil with good. Whenever we receive injury from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do thou enable us from the heart so to forgive them, as we for <hi>Christs</hi> sake hope to be forgiven by thee. Let us all in this Family live in peace and love, and in the fear of thy great name, faithfully performing our duties one to another, in our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Relations. Help us, oh heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, to pass the time of our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here in fear, as Pilgrims and strangers, abstaining from those fleshly lusts which war against our souls; that laying aside every weight and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, we may with patience run the holy Race that is set before us. Keep us always mindful of that everlasting
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49267:52"/>
state toward which we are daily ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that we may spend this short life as beseems those who know that Death is hasting upon us, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death comes judgment, when thou the righteous God wilt call us to an account for all our deeds done in the body, and wilt accordingly dispose of us, either to happiness or misery for ever. Oh Lord make us in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in these our prayers; and help us to live as those that believe the great truths of thy Gospel; that we may ever have such a sense of them upon our minds, that we may not dare at any time, upon any account, to allow our selves in any one sin, or in the neglect of any known duty: but by patient continuance in well doing, may seek after, and make sure of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and immortality, which thou hast promised, through <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to them that love and serve thee. With us, shew mercy to the whole world. Let the Gospel of thy Son run and be glorified throughout all the earth; let it be made known to Heathens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; let it be obeyed by all that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49267:53"/>
are called Christians. Let all popish darkness, ignorance, and Idolatry, with all other errours and heresies be driven away by the light and truth of thy pure Gospel; and let the coming of <hi>Christ</hi> in glory be hastned. Be merciful to these nations wherein we live; and grant we may be so humbled and reformed, that we may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and spared. Be gracious to our dread Soveraign, with all his royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and enrich them with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thy holy Spirit. Make all our Magistrates faithful and zealous in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing and suppressing wickedness, and in promoting vertue and godliness: and make us and all other Subjects loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and obedient to our King, and to all in power under him. Let thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing be upon the faithful Preachers of thy Gospel, encrease daily their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and let their labours be blest and succeeded. Let all our differences be so composed, that we may live in peace and love, and with one heart and one mouth may glorifie thee our God. Bless ad our friends and relations, and make them thy faithful and obedient

servants. Visit in mercy all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of affliction, whatever their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular necessities and burthens are, whether of soul or body, do thou sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably and suitably comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. We humbly bless thy name for the mercies of this day, that thou hast safely brought us to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and earnestly we beg thy pardon of whatever sins we have been guilty, whether of omission or commission, in thought, word or deed. Take us we beseech thee, and all that is ours, into thy care this night, and keep us, if it be thy will, from all evil of body, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of soul: And so refresh us with rest and sleep, that we may be fitted for thy service and our lawful imployments in the following day: And all we humbly beg for Christ Jesus our Saviours sake, with whose words we conclude our imperfect prayers, saying, as he himself hath taught us, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>GReat and Glorious Lord God, Thou hast commanded us to remember thee our Creatour in the days of our youth: and here am I thy unworthy servant, desirous to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest my remembrance of thee, I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee, according to thine own appointment. My only hope of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance is in thy goodness and mercy, who art a loving and tender Father to us thy poor creatures, and art ready to accept of the weak services and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of those, who do heartily desire to please thee and obtain thy favour. Wherefore I now most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, to be gracious and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to me, a worthless, sinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49267:54"/>
I have indeed been a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour from the womb, and have shewn my evil and wicked nature, by my great forwardness to run into any kind of wickedness that I have been capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. When I could do little else, I had soon learnt to sin against thee; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early I began to be stubborn, and self-will'd, proud and slothful, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsome and revengeful. And to this very day have I continued in my sins, which have encreased together with my years; and have been given up to the pleasing of my self, and satisfying my own vain and childish inclinations, but have taken little thought for the pleasing and serving of thee my Maker and Preserver. Though I have had so much reason, that I could love my Parents and Friends, those that did me good, and have been afraid of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing them, and of being corrected by them, yet have I had little love for thee my God, who art the giver of all good; nor have I been afraid of thy wrath, who canst destroy both body and soul in Hell. This, oh Lord, hath been my great folly, and a very
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49267:55"/>
great cause of all my other sins, that I have lived most of all by sight, and have little minded any thing but what is now before me. Therefore have I forgotten thee, and lived as if there was no God, because I could not see thee with bodily eyes; and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd any foolish pleasure now in hand before the everlasting joys of heaven, which are yet to come; and because I could not see Hell-torments, nor hear the roarings and out-cries of those who are damned for their sins, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I made so light of sinning against thee. But of this my folly, and all my wickedness the fruit of it, I desire to to be ashamed before thee; confessing that I have herein behaved my self more like a bruit Beast than a reasonable creature, whilst I have been led by my senses more than by my reason, or by the belief of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word: And most justly mightest thou deal with me accordingly, and mightest shut me out of those joys, which I have so little loved and sought after; and mightest make me for ever feel those torments, of which I have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49267:55"/>
not been afraid. But I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, oh merciful Father, for thy Son <hi>Iesus</hi> sake, take pity on me, and freely forgive me all my sins, and save me from those miseries, which for my sins I have deserved. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee to give me thy holy Spirit, that I may thereby have my mind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, my heart softned, and my nature so throughly renewed and changed, that I may be taken off from the love of all sin, and may take such pleasure in thy service here, that I may live with thee in happiness for ever hereafter. Since, through thy great mercy, I have been baptized in my infancy, and thereby given up to thee my God, and engaged to be thy servant, do thou help me rightly to understand and carefully to perform the duties to which by my Baptism I am bound: that I may in heart and life renounce the Devil and all his works, the lusts of the flesh, and the pomps and vanities of this world, and may remain Christs faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant unto my lives end. Let thy grace preserve me from all those snares and temptations,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49267:56"/>
which in these my younger years I am most in danger of. Oh keep me that I may never fall into rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drunkenness, whoredom, or any kind of wantonness and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Do thou help me at all times to watch over my ways, that I may not wilfully run into any temptations and occasions of sin; that I may not be given up to idleness, gaming, nor the excessive love of any sports or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; nor may venture amongst such wicked companions as would entice me to ungodly courses; neither let their jeers and scorns ever make me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of a strict and holy life. Make me ever careful to hearken to the reproofs and instructions of godly friends, and to keep my self employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in honest and lawful labours, or in the duties of religion. And whilst I shall continue in this dangerous world, be thou oh God my upholder and my guide. I desire heartily to give up my self to thee, to be disposed of as seems good in thy sight, begging on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in every condition, through my whole life, I may be kept faithful
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49267:56"/>
to thee, and diligent in thy service, that so at length I may be brought safe through all difficulties and dangers, into that everlasting rest which remains for thy people. Be merciful to the whole world; fill the same with the knowledge of thy Gospel; and let the coming of Christ in glory be hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Be gracious to these nations, to our King, with all his royal Relations, and all Magistrates under him. Bless the Ministers of thy holy word, with all thy people, and my kindred and friends. Shew mercy to all them that are in affliction; and let thy blessing be upon this Family to which I belong. I praise thy name for the mercies of this last night; and beg thy presence with me this day, that I may not do any thing which is displeasing to thee, but may ever so live in thy fear, that I may be sure of thy favour, both here and to all eternity. And all I humbly beg for thy dear Son Jesus sake, who hath taught us to pray, saying, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <head>EVENING PRAYER.</head>
               <p>MOst great and glorious Lord God, Thou dwellest in the highest heavens, and yet thou regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest the meanest of thy creatures here on this earth, and art ever ready to shew mercy to such as do humbly and earnestly seek to thee for the same. Wherefore I do now most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee to take pity on me, a weak and worthless creature, and to deal with me, not after my deserts, but according to the multitude of thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compassions. I cannot, alas! plead any deserts of my own: for though I am thy creature, yet am I a vile sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, one that deserves not the least of all thy mercies. I was born into this world with a sinful and corrupt nature, which is prone to wickedness, and very backward and listless to any thing that is good: And I have already shewn forth the sinfulness of my nature, in those sins which I have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49267:57"/>
thee. Though my years have been but few, yet my sins have been many and very grievous. Of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time which I have lived in the world I have wasted much in folly and idleness, in sports and pleasures, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thinking what I was sent into the world for, or how I might do to make my self happy for ever. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been often taught, that I was made on purpose to serve thee, oh God, in obeying thy commandments, that so I might live with thee for ever in heaven; yet have I grievously neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected thy service, and have not made it my business to get acquainted with thy holy laws; and those plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which I have known, I have often wilfully broken. Little delight have I had in praying to thee, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or hearing thy holy word: but have greatly neglected these duties, and have oft spent the Lords day in idleness and playing. Yea, with shame I must confess, I have taken pleasure in reading any foolish book rather than in the holy Bible: And though I could well enough remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49267:58"/>
idle stories, vain and wanton songs, yet have I soon forgotten thy blessed word, after I have read or heard the same. Many times have I been diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to my Parents, and to those who have had rule over me; and when I have committed faults, I have been presently ready to tell lies for the excusing my self, though I knew I did ill therein. Very easily have I been drawn into ill company, and to joyn with them in doing evil: and though I have seen many of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, as young as I, die before me, yet have I seldome thought with my self how I should do to get fitted for death, or what would become of me after death in another world. Now, oh Lord, I beseech thee to open my eyes, and soften my heart, and work in me a true sorrow and repentance for these, and all other the sins which I have at any time committed against thee, that so I may find mercy and forgiveness from thee. Have mercy upon me, oh thou God of mercy, and for the Lord Jesus sake be at peace with me. Let his precious blood wash
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49267:58"/>
me from all my sins, and procure thy favour, that I may escape those eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments which I have most justly deserved. Through the Lord Jesus do thou become my gracious, loving Father, owning me as thy dutiful child: And help me to shew that I am so, by living in a careful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all thy holy laws. Oh that the time past of my life may suffice to have spent so vainly and carelesly; Lord make me for the time to come diligent and careful in serving thee, and in working out my own salvation. Make me so wise for my own good, that I may put off the amending of my ways, and leading a godly life till hereafter; Let me not think it too soon to set about that work for which all my life was given me, and is all lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough. Justly then maist thou shorten my days, if I should wilfully defer my repentance and reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea justly maist thou refuse to accept of me in old age, if now I spend my youth, and the best of my days in serving the Devil, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying my own lusts. Wherefore oh
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49267:59"/>
Lord, I beseech thee, now betimes to encline my heart to thy fear and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that when I am old, I may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart from thee. Make me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways sensible of the shortness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of my life, that numbring my days, I may apply my heart to wisdome; and through my whole life may make this my great study and care, to get an everlasting happiness in the world to come. Oh never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me, good God, to become so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, as for any pleasures of sin, to part with the hopes of eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to sell my soul into the hands of Satan, to be tormented with him for ever. But do thou, oh Lord, strengthen me by thy grace, against all his temptations, and against the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of the world and the flesh, that they may not prevail over me. Help me to flee all youthful lusts, and to follow after sobriety, chastity, and all manner of purity, virtue and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. When-ever I am ready to run into sin, oh then fill my mind with the thoughts of that Hell, to which sin leads; and let the hopes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49267:59"/>
make me ever chearful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in thy service. Let thy word be my chief study and delight, and thy people my constant companions; and let thy holy Spirit ever guide and assist me in the ways of Holiness, till at length I shall be advanced to that happiness which shall never end. Be merciful to the whole world, fill the same with the knowledge of thy Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and let the coming of Christ in glory be hastned. Be gracious to these nations, to our King and all his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Relations, and to all Magistrates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.
