         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For the satisfaction of thy conscience in this most needfull question, I haue in this first Treatise gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for thee, out of the whole Bible, a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of those sinnes, which in our repentance God will haue with speciall notice to be confessed and auoided. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21209:13"/>
these sinnes I haue set downe, as neere as I could, in the <hi>expresse words of the text,</hi> that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test see the Lord himselfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing thy offences: and so mightest haue no excuse or doubt, to imagine that it was but the iudgement of some men, that made such things to bee thought to bee sinnes. By this course of surueying the whole Scriptures, I haue both found out diuers particular offences plainely <hi>proued</hi> to be so, which I could not obserue to be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in any exposition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements which I had, and also diuers things proued cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be sinnes, which were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly barely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21209:14"/>
which God himselfe hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed vnto thee, if thy owne slothfulnesse &amp; proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And withall, I haue now added directions, how by the

helpe of those signes men may settle their <hi>assurance,</hi> and how such as yet want those signes, may attaine them.</p>

                  <p>The sixt and last thing which <note place="margin">6 The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the last booke.</note> ought to bee enquired after, is, how a man thus fitted to liue the life of God, may also <hi>bee cured of the feare of death;</hi> and to this end I haue published that Treatise of the Cure of the feare of Death, which shewes plaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable wayes, how any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may deliuer his heart from <note place="margin">Whom these Treatises concerne.</note> those feares.</p>

I answer; that in many of these Treatises the way is not made harder then is required; or in the doctrine of the Church mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested: but rather things are made more plaine, and so more easie.

And further thinke of it, that this is a course of wonderful comfort and safety: when a Christian followes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21209:17"/>
the euident directions of Gods Word in these most weighty things, he walks safely: He is in the <hi>good way, the way of life,</hi> the <hi>way of peace;</hi> he is sure to <hi>see the saluation of God.</hi> To follow those directions soundly, is to keepe our soules. All <hi>Gods waies</hi> will be <hi>mercy and truth</hi> to vs. God will cause vs <hi>to heare his louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the morning.</hi> Our way will be full of refreshing: Gods waies are <hi>wayes of pleasure,</hi> and if any man set himselfe exactly to take notice of Gods will in these things, and will be at paines to store his heart distinctly in such solid truths: it is certaine, the Lord will recompence his way vpon him, <hi>God will not cast away the exact man, till he fill his mouth with laughter,</hi> as it is said, <hi>Iob</hi> 8. 20, 21. Sure it is, that in the study of these things lyeth the way of eternity, and though thou thinke the way to be hard and narrow, yet this may somewhat case thee;

it is a <hi>plaine way:</hi> For the <hi>simple</hi> may profit by it, as is auouched to bee true of all the courses which God by his Word so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly required, <hi>Psal. 119.

                  <p>First, thou must giue ouer, and forsake vngodly company; for else it is in vaine to meddle with

any religious course, as these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will shew thee, Psal. 1. 1, 2. Prou. 4. 14, 15. &amp; 9. 6. &amp; 23. 19, 20, &amp; 29 27. Psal. 26. 2 Cor. 6.</p>

For this fellowship will take away the tediousnesse of the way, and much preserue thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst giuing ouer; and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples will bee as patternes for thee, and by acquaintance with them, thou wilt be brought into acquaintance with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, Isaiah 16. 23, 24. 2 Cor. 6. 16, 17, 18. Prou. 2. 20.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou must remember <hi>to pray vnto God</hi> by all meanes <hi>to</hi>

                     <hi>direct thee, and shew thee the way</hi> in all these things, thou must <hi>beg a way of God,</hi> and beseech him to <hi>remoue from thee all lying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull wayes,</hi> Ezra 8. 21. Psal, 119. 26. Ier. 2. 33.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21209:18"/>
Fourthly, thou must, when thou comest to Gods directions, <hi>lift</hi>

                     <hi>vp thy soule,</hi> and giue not way to thine owne <hi>carnall reason,</hi> and the sluggishnesse of thy owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the deceitfulnesse of thy owne heart: but let the Lord see thou art willing to doe any thing thou canst, Psal. 143. 8. Bring a <note place="margin">Note.</note> mind desirous to <hi>obey in all things.</hi> By any meanes take heed, thou be not like those complained of, Isaiah 58. 2. that haue a great mind to know Gods wayes, and to read all sorts of directions, as if they sought righteousnesse in a speciall manner of care, and yet do not follow any of the courses they so much desire to kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

walke in his paths; and to that end, beforehand beseech him <hi>to vnite thy heart to his feare, Psal.</hi> 86. 11. Thou shouldest bee of <hi>Dauids</hi> mind, to say, <hi>O that my way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore with so much the more willingnesse and vnchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of resolution, should hee with much desire set vpon these rules now to bee giuen, seeing they are but few in number, and such as he may performe, by the grace of God, with much ease and comfort. And the more may he encourage his owne heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when he hath done, he may clearely see he hath done distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which God required of him, and that, with which he is satisfied through Christ.

First, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath <note place="margin">3 Things he must be resolued of in his iudgement.</note> made a full and sufficient <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> for the sinnes of all men: As he became <hi>a sacrifice for sinne,</hi> he payed <hi>a price</hi> in his blood, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">1</note> to <hi>redeeme vs,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. <hi>He is the Lambe of God, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the sinnes of the world,</hi> Ioh. 1. 29. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Ephes. 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2</note> with this satisfaction made by Christ for our sins, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by that voyce from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, Mat. 3 and 17. &amp;c.

                  <p>Thirdly, that <hi>thou</hi> mayest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto this redemption by <note place="margin">3</note> Christ, if thou wilt practise those things which are required of thee: and this thou mayest bee assured of, both because Christ
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21209:20"/>
is said to take away the sinnes of <hi>the world,</hi> and because God offers this reconciliation in the Gospel <hi>to euery creature,</hi> and exempts none; and because the Apostle saith, <hi>If any man sinne,</hi> hee may haue <hi>an Aduocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen Iesus Christ the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> and besides, thou feelest the <hi>Spirit of God knocking</hi> at the doore of thy heart, and would come in, Iohn 1. 29.

                  <p>The first rule concernes the <note place="margin">1 Make a Catalogue of thy sins.</note> examination of thy selfe, and it is this: thou must take thee a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of all the sins thou canst discerne by thy selfe, and be sure
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21209:21"/>
thou doe this seriously and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; and for this purpose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire thy selfe into some secret place, and set thy selfe in Gods presence; and then call to minde all the sinnes thou canst remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by thy selfe particularly, write them downe as they come to thy mind; aske thy selfe this question: <hi>What haue I done all the dayes of my life, which if I were now to dye, would feare me if they were not forgiuen?</hi> Take the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this question, as thy sins come to thy mind, till thou canst remember no more, so as thou couldst in the sincerity of thy heart say, that thou dealest plainly before the Lord, and doest not hide any fault; and out of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thou hast of any sinne, doest not forbeare to set it downe.</p>
                  <p>Trouble not thy head with the thoughts of any other thing, till this be done: and thou needest not care for <hi>order</hi> or <hi>phrase</hi> in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it downe, but doe it in such

words as thou hast to vtter it in, and be sure to spare none of thy <hi>speciall knowne sinnes,</hi> but let the Lord see, <hi>that thou art as willing to indite thy selfe for them in his presence, as thou art willing hee should forgiue them.</hi> When thou hast in this manner taken a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of thy sinnes, then looke vpon the Catalogue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and examine thy selfe distinctly by it. For this Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue will be like a <hi>Looking glasse</hi> from all parts of Gods Law, to shew thee thy offences. And so thou mayest obserue what faults thou couldst not find or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by thy priuate examination; and withall see in what phrase or order to digest thy sins. Let not thy thoughts trouble thee, but chearefully endure this tryall of thy selfe; and take heed thou do it not cursorily, but take time enough, and so thou maiest, if thou wilt onely take one of the Chapters, or two of them, as they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21209:22"/>
lie in the <hi>Catalogue,</hi> and no more in a day, till thou come to the end of the <hi>Catalogue:</hi> neither needst thou to trouble thy selfe about such sinnes as thou doest not clearely see that thou art guilty of, but take onely such as thou art most sure thou hast offended in. It is enough in the practise of Repentance, to take particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice of knowne and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent euils: a generall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement will serue for the rest.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21209:22"/>
be guiltie of innumerable acts: as if it were a sinne in thought, it might be committed oftner then can be <hi>by vs</hi> numbred. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it is enough to humble our selues for the seuerall <hi>kindes</hi> of sinnes wee haue beene guiltie of, which will not bee so many, but they may be easily numbred. The seuerall acts of the same sin serue but as a generall aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the offence. Onely in this examination look to two things: The one, that thou beseech God by prayer, to shew thee the sins <note place="margin">Look to a things.</note> are most displeasing vnto him. The other is, that thou take heed thou leaue not out any speciall knowne sins; because else those sinnes so spared, may buffet thee a long time after thou hast fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed this course: and besides, they may get head and preuaile against thee in practice, if by this course they bee not brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>Now that thou oughtest thus <note place="margin">The proof</note>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:21209:23"/>
seriously to examine and call to minde thy sinnes, and that this is one of the things God requireth of thee to bee distinctly done, these places of Scripture do eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proue, and withall shew, that God doth take euen this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of thy repentance well, <hi>Lament. 3. 40.

of ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>In this proiect then, I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the triall of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <note place="margin">The signes ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Thirdly, in the gifts of his minde, with which he is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the workes of his obedience.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, in the entertainment he hath from God.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, in the manner of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>In all which hee differs from all the wicked men in the world, so as neuer any wicked man
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21209:70"/>
could finde these things in his condition, which are true of the weakest <hi>Christian</hi> in each of these signes.</p>
                  <p>And that the true Christian may not doubt of his estate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found these signes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <note place="margin">The infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the signes.</note> let him consider the proofes annexed to each signe: and that nothing may bee wanting to his aboundant consolation, I will tell him, how I found out these signes, and by what grounds I proceeded.</p>
                  <p>There are three sorts of places <note place="margin">3. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ies to find out the signes of a god<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>y man in Scripture</note> in Scripture (as I conceiue) which do point out the grounds of infallible assurance in those that can attaine vnto them: as first, such places as expresly doe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>firme, that such and such things are signes. As for example, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Hereby we know, that we are translated from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we loue the brethren.</hi> Here the holy Ghost shewes vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that the loue of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21209:71"/>
is a signe, by which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may know, that he is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated from death to life: and so the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> giues signes to know whether their <hi>sorrow</hi> were <hi>after God,</hi> or no, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. So doth the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psalme 15 giue diuers signes, by which the man that shall dwell in Gods holy hill, may be knowne. So the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> tells vs, how wee may know the wisedome from aboue, by reckning the fruits and effects of it, <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 17. So doth the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tell vs, how we may know, whether we haue the Spirit of Christ in vs, or no, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 15, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. and 4. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I find out signes, by marking what graces in man the promises of God are made vnto. For thus I reason: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer gift of God in man brings him within the compasse of Gods promises of eternall mercie, that gift must bee an infallible signe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21209:71"/>
of saluation. But such are such and such gifts, as the instances in diuers Scriptures shew: And therefore the man that can finde those gifts in himselfe, shall bee certainly saued. As for example: The Kingdome of heauen is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to such as are <hi>poore in spirit,</hi> Mathew 5. 3. From thence then I gather, that pouerty of spirit is an infallible signe. The like I may say of the <hi>loue of the Word,</hi> and of <hi>vprightnesse of heart,</hi> and <hi>of the loue of God,</hi> and <hi>the loue of the appearing of Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I finde out other signes, by obseruing what godly men in Scripture haue said for themselues, when they haue pleaded their owne euidence for their interest in Gods loue, or their hope of a better life. For looke how godly men in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue proued that they were not hypocrites: euen so may any Christian proue that he is not an
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21209:72"/>
hypocrite neither. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Iob</hi> being charged to bee an hypocrite, and lying vnder the heauy hand of God, pleades his cause, and proues that hee was not an hypocrite, by his constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in Gods wayes, and by his constant estimation of Gods Word, and <hi>desire after it, as after his appointed food,</hi> Iob 23. 10, 11, 12. More of this kinde thou maist find in the proofes of particular signes.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas some signes are general, and thou mightest doubt of the exposition, namely how that signe is infallible in such and such sences; for thy esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment heerein, thou mayest obserue, that I expound the signe as it is expounded in other seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Scriptures. As for example: The loue of the brethren, is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall signe. Now how shall I know that I haue the right loue of the brethren? This I explaine, by flying to diuers other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21209:72"/>
wherein the particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of this signe are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21209:79"/>
from God for any thing that is in vs, but onely because wee see the Word of God assuring such happinesse vnto such as lay hold vpon them. So that, that which breeds faith, is the <hi>reuelation of Gods promises,</hi> by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> Yet notwithstanding the assurance of faith is much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and confirmed by the sight of those signes of the truth of our faith, and other graces of God in vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that I stand not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely <note place="margin">A second c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Thirdly, that I intend especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

as agree in this, that they a<hi rend="sup">re</hi> perswaded that Christ died fo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> them; that so the true Christian may see reason to comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that his perswasion is no presumption, as is the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the most. It is true, that diuers of the signes of faith here to be handled, will shew faith in the weakest Christian; though he will not yet be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any perswasion. For this perswasion may bee secretly wrought vpon the heart: as it is when it relieth vpon the merits of Christ onely for saluation, though the iudgement of the Christian be not resolued against his doubts.</p>
                  <p>The question then is, how a Christian may trie his perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods mercy, and his interest of Christs mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>For answer hereunto, I say, <note place="margin">The true f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21209:80"/>
to bee right, by these signes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>First, His faith or perswasion was wrought by the hearing of <note place="margin">1. Was wrought by the Word preached.</note> the Word preached: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou must first aske thy selfe, how thou commest by thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion. For if thou say, thou wast alwayes so perswaded, or didst attaine it by meere naturall meanes or helpes, thou are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For, faith is first wrought by the Holy Ghost, in the preaching of the Gospel, as it is most cleare by the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>How shall they beleeue in him of whom they haue not heard? and how shall they heare without a Preacher?</hi> Romans 10. 14. And whereas it may bee, that many Christians haue not obserued the workings of their faith, and haue forgotten the time of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, &amp; haue not iudgement to discerne how the Lord by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of his seruants did change their hearts, and leade them to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21209:80"/>
Christ: therefore when this first signe cannot comfort, they must try themselues by the rest that follow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hee hath an high <hi>estimation of Iesus Christ.</hi> For <note place="margin">2. Esteems Christ aboue all things.</note> the man that hath true Faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts all things most base in comparison of the knowledge of Christ, and the loue of God in him. He had rather be sure of Christ, then to gaine the whole world. Christ is more <hi>precious</hi> then all the world: Yea, is the onely thing in request in the desires of the Christian. Now Christ is <hi>precious</hi> onely to <hi>them that beleeue, 1 Peter</hi> 2. 6. and by this signe <hi>Paul</hi> knew that he was growne farre beyond himselfe in his former life, and beyond all the Pharises in the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</p>

Receiues the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world.</note> the testimony of Gods Ministers speaking out of the Word, and stickes to it against all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21209:81"/>
of the World. The Apostle <hi>Paul, 2 Thess.</hi> 1. 10. shewes, that this signe will bee pleaded and acknowledged in the day of Christ: <hi>Christ,</hi> saith hee, <hi>will be made admirable in them that beleeue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now some may say, But how shall wee know that wee doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue?</p>
                  <p>Why, saith hee, you are true beleeuers, <hi>because yee receiued our testimonie;</hi> and this shall bee to your praise in that day.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Hee cannot abide <note place="margin">4 Casts out by pocrisie.</note> counterfetting and hypocrisie. If it bee a right perswasion, it is a faith vnfained: Vnfained, I say, as in other respects, so in effect, because it cannot abide fainting, but with speciall hatred purgeth out hypocrisie, which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of hypocrits neuer doth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This perswasion is <note place="margin">5. Will abide triall.</note> permanent: it will endure triall, it will hold out in the euill day;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21209:81"/>
it inclines the heart to cleaue to Iesus Christ, euen in the fire of tribulation, in the midst of <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold afflictions,</hi> and disgraces, and temptations. It is like the <hi>Gold</hi> in the Fornace <hi>that perisheth not:</hi> nor will it barely hold out; but a Christian by his faith comforts and supports himselfe in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so as his faith becomes to him both a <hi>brest-plate</hi> and an <hi>helmet:</hi> whereas the best faith, that is not <hi>the faith of Gods Elect,</hi> will proue but drosse, if it be cast into the Fornace of temptation, further then it is supported by carnall meanes and helpes, 1 <hi>Peter 1. 6, 7. 2 Tim. 1. 12. 1 Thess. 5. 8. Epho. 6. Luke</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Hee will beleeue all <note place="margin">6.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21209:82"/>
or wils, or affections, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of other men: But this is the glory of a liuely iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, it will giue glory to God in all things. <hi>What can God speake, it can beleeue,</hi> so soone as it knowes it is spoken of God, though it bee neuer so contrarie to the iudgement of flesh and blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 14.</p>

                     <hi>haste.</hi> This was the signe giuen in the Prophet <hi>Esayes</hi> time: He that beleeueth will not make haste. He had prophesied of hard times to fall vpon all the people: now this would shew amongst them, who were true beleeuers. For those that trusted in God, would <hi>not make haste</hi> to vse ill meanes to helpe themselues; they would stay their hearts in <hi>

                  <p>If faith be right, and thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21209:82"/>
a sound perswasion, and well grounded, there are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it these things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, His perswasion is <note place="margin">8. Is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> ioyned with a good and pure conscience; a conscience, I say, that makes him carefull to auoid sinne, and doe good duties, and to serue God in sinceritie, whereas the perswasion that is in wicked men, is not accompanied with a good conscience, they doe not make conscience of their wayes. Now this is a cleare rule of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5, 19. and 3. 9. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, He hath a <hi>spirit</hi> of discerning. There is a great deale <note place="margin">9. And a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning.</note> of light comes into the heart with faith. A man cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and bee ignorant still. The Christian that is endued with faith from aboue, is endued with <hi>wisedome from aboue:</hi> so as he can conceiue of the things of God that concerne saluation, which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21209:83"/>
                     <hi>the naturall man perceiueth not.</hi> Though he may want still in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knoledges, yet he hath skill in some measure to learne how to be saued. The doctrine of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation hee can now vnderstand, which is taught in the ministery of the Word; and hee now can make some good vse of reading the Scriptures, that before discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned little or nothing in them. <hi>The veile that lyeth vpon the hearts of all flesh, is now taken from his eyes;</hi> yea the very <hi>entrance into Gods Word giueth light to the simplest</hi> beleeuer. He that was stupid and vnteachable before, doth now <hi>heare as the learned,</hi> with an holy kind of in-sight and iudgement, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. Psalme 119. 130. Prou.</hi> 1. 4, 8. and 9. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Hee hath a witnesse <note place="margin">10. And the witnesse of the Spirit of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> within himselfe, <hi>He that beleeueth, hath a witnesse in himselfe, 1 Iohn</hi> 5. 10. For hee hath the Spirit of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to certifie him infallibly of Gods loue to him, and that he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21209:83"/>
is the child of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16. &amp; thus the beleeuers are said to be <hi>sealed by the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> Eph. 1. 13, 14. God leaues a pawne, a pledge with euery Christian that shall bee saued, to be as the earnest of his saluation, and this pledge and earnest is Gods spirit. And the Spirit testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to the beleeuer, partly by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing vnto him the certainty and truth of Gods promises in his Word; and partly by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon his heart these sauing graces, which distinguish him from all others; and partly by powring vpon him the ioyes, which are called the ioyes of the Holy Ghost, in the vse of Gods Ordinances, as the inward ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the assurance of Gods loue and goodnesse to the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Of which after.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Faith may be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">11. Beareth those fruits following.</note> by many things it worketh, which are the fruits of it: and by the fruits of Faith, wee may
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21209:84"/>
know faith it selfe. Faith is like the roote of a tree, that lyeth vnder the ground, and cannot be seene without much digging; but by the fruit the tree beareth, wee may know what kinde of roote it hath, and of what sort it is. Now the fruites of faith are these that follow, and such like, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Loue to God and the godly: <note place="margin">1. Loue</note> for <hi>faith worketh by loue,</hi> Gallat. 5. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Cleannesse of the thoughts <note place="margin">2. Purity of heart.</note> and affections. For <hi>faith purifieth the heart.</hi> It maketh a man striue after inward purity, as well as outward: to get a <hi>cleane heart,</hi> as well as <hi>cleane hands.</hi> It work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth humiliation for inward sins as well as outward, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. and driues a man to seeke pardon in the Name of Christ, for all sorts of inward perturbations and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret euils.</p>

5. 4, 5. and so it doth, when it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man so rest vpon God, and his truth and promise, as if he be put to it, to deny the respect of his owne credit, or profit, or pleasures, or the displeasure of carnall friends, or his hopes in matters of this world; resting satisfied with the expectation of the treasures and pleasures of a better world, yeelding himselfe ouer to be guided by Christ, and his truth, vnto the death, <hi>Psalme 18. 14.

                  <p n="7">7 It opens a spring of graces <note place="margin">7 A very spring of grace.</note> in the heart of a true Christian: he that is a true beleeuer, is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with sundry heauenly gifts which were not in him by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which gifts do daily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themselues in his heart, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, as if there were a spring of liuing water in his belly. <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit and faith of the truth,</hi> be insepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>Iohn 7. 38. 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 13.</p>

The true Christian differs from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Two sorts of graces in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</note> man, in two sorts of gifts: Some of them are such gifts as are bestowed vpon him from aboue, but serue him onely for spirituall vse, <hi>while he is on the way</hi> in his iourney to Heauen, and so onely in this life; such as are the <hi>sacred thirst: The loue to the word</hi> and meanes of his holinesse: <hi>The spirit of supplication: The loue of his enemies;</hi> and <hi>his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after the apparance of Iesus Christ.</hi> Other gifts hee hath, which will accompany him <hi>home

into his heauenly Countrey,</hi> and abide vpon him for euer, and are not abolished by death: such as are <hi>sauing knowledge, the loue of God,</hi> and <hi>the loue of the godly.</hi> First therefore of those heauenly gifts, which will passe away; and so he is qualified with fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e distinct ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifts, which cannot be found in any reprobate.</p>
                  <p>The first is, <hi>his holy thirst;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The holy thirst that is in the godly Christian, tryed by foure signes.</note> which is an heauenly kind of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, by which hee is carried to the desire of things aboue nature; such as are the merits and <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ:</hi> the <hi>fauour of God:</hi> the <hi>presence of God:</hi> the <hi>full deliuerance from all sin:</hi> the <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of spirituall iudgements:</hi> the <hi>saluation of other men,</hi> and the like; and this thirst is a signe the more infallible:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Because it is <hi>constant</hi> and indelible in this life. There is no part of this life, but it continueth either in the <hi>sense</hi> of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in the <hi>iudgement</hi> of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,

                  <p n="2">2. Because it is <hi>industrious.</hi> For this holy thirst will guide him to a carefull <hi>vse of all the meanes,</hi> by which good things may bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and doth not breathe it selfe out onely with sudden and vaine wishes, or flashes of desire, <hi>Psa. 27. 4. 1 Pet. 2. 2. Psa. 63. 1, 2. Psa. 1. 2. Acts</hi> 2. 37.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because it workes a constant and secret <hi>meditation</hi> of heauenly things desired, the heart fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently seekes after God day and night, <hi>Esa. 26. 9. Psal.</hi> 63. 1, 6. For what wee desire feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee thinke on almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually:</p>

                  <p>And thus much of the first gift.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The loue to the <note place="margin">His tryall by his loue to the Word.</note> Word is another signe that hee is the Child of God, and a cleare euidence of his saluation. Now because all sorts of wicked men may resort to the exercises of the Word, and those that haue but a temporarie faith may shew a great estimation of the VVord, and find ioy in the hearing of it, and shew much zeale in things that concerne the word, and may yeeld some obedience to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the VVord also: it is profitable to consider how the true Christian may proue that his affection to the VVord is more
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21209:87"/>
sincere then that affection which any wicked man can bring to the word. And thus he may find that his heart is sound in his loue to the Word, by these markes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 By his manner of receiuing <note place="margin">13. Signes to try his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Word by.</note> it, when hee doth receiue the Word, <hi>as the Word of God, and not of men:</hi> setting his heart before Gods presence, &amp; being affected as if the Lord himselfe should speake vnto him. This no wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man dares doe: he dares not present himselfe with the whole intendments of his heart before the Lord.

                  <p n="2">2 By his appetite to his Word. For there is in a godly man as true an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger after the Word, as the food of his soule; as there is in his stomacke after the food of his body; which shewes it selfe to be the more sincere, because it is constant; hee desires the

Word at all times, <hi>and as his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed foode daily;</hi> as it is in the bodily appetite, though after feeding, the stomack may seeme to bee full and satisfied, yet the hunger reuiues againe euery day, so is it with the heart of a Child of God: whereas wicked men regard the Word but by fits, and in a passion, and then at length fall cleane away from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to it, <hi>Psal. 119. 20.

                  <argument>
                     <p>The directions that shew him how to get assurance by the helpes of those signes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HItherto of the signes of the godly man. Now followes the course that the weak Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an should take by the vse of the former signes of tryall, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish his heart in the assurance of Gods fauour, and his owne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall saluation.</p>
                  <p>My aduice is therefore, that the weake Christian that findes want of establishment and cleare assurance, should take the former signes of tryall, and goe apart, and set himselfe in Gods presence, emptying his heart of worldly distractions, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider of euery rule of tryall apart; and gather out into some little paper-booke so much as in euery signe hee can clearely
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21209:102"/>
find to be in himselfe, and that which hee durst through Gods mercy resolutely auouch to bee wrought in him by the grace of God. And this I would haue him to doe with deliberation, trying himselfe by one or two of the chiefe heads at most in a day, spending no more time about it then he may well allow, without wearinesse or dulnesse.</p>
                  <p>Now because he may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps discouraged with the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of diuers things, which he may find wanting in himselfe in euery signe; hee must therefore take sound notice of the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christians made by the Apostle <hi>Iohn, 1 Iohn</hi> 2. who casts al true Christians into three sorts. Some are <hi>Infants,</hi> and either new borne, or but weakely qualified with the graces of Christ; yet are right, and haue true grace in some measure. Others are <hi>strong men,</hi> that is, such as haue the gifts of the Spirit
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21209:103"/>
liuely and in their power in them. Others are <hi>Fathers,</hi> that is, such as haue had long experience in the powerful practice of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and haue beene long exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in all kinds of well-doing. Now all these three sorts may be supposed to come to these signes. The weake Christian onely takes to a few of the plainest markes in the explication of each signe. The strong Christian he takes to the most of the markes. The Fathers they in a manner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all the particulars of Gods graces, and the seuerall workings of them. Each of these, euen the weake Christian, may see so much as may stay his heart in assurance, and so settle his faith and ioy.</p>
                  <p>When there are many signes of one and the selfe-same thing, it is sufficient if it can be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, though it be but a few wayes, seeing euery particular marke being warranted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21209:103"/>
hath force to conclude for assurance, and to proue that wee differ from all the wicked men in the world.</p>
                  <p>Though at the first in reading but a signe or two, thou get but a few things may comfort thee, yet hold out till thou come to the end of all the signes, and then thou shalt see a faire armie (as it were of arguments) to prooue thy election and saluation. For whereas the most and best of vs if wee be asked this question, By what markes doe we know that we are the true children of God, and not wicked men? If we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer on a sudden, and by present memory, we can scarce giue two sound reasons to prooue the infallibilitie of our happy estate: which shewes, that the most of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s liue at a great vncertaintie. Now he that hath gone through the signes, shall finde perhaps twenty, or thirty, or fortie seueral and distinct arguments or
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21209:104"/>
markes, which when he hath collected them all together, may serue to answer all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections of all the Diuels in Hell. <hi>The gates of hell cannot preuale against his faith:</hi> which I declare thus: If the Diuell say, Thou art a wicked man, and an hypocrite; thou mayest readily answer, that by the grace of God in Iesus Christ thou art none such; and mayest put the Diuel to proue by the Word of God; that euer any wicked man did attaine to all those signes thou hast collected. Which, because it cannot bee done, thou mayest with much rest and full assurance commit thy selfe to God, and bind thy selfe by Couenant, neuer more to dishonour him by such vnbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>efe, as to call his loue and his saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into question. If a three-fold cord cannot bee broken, how weake then should thy heart be, if thou shouldst feare thy estate, vnto which God hath so sealed,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21209:104"/>
and so many wayes marked thee out for himselfe?</p>
                  <p>And for thy further satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: after thou hast collected thy signes together, thou mayest car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie them to thy godly Pastor, and desire him to peruse them, and accordingly giue thee his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall testimonie concerning them in the name of Iesus Christ, and this may adde much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and rest to thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>If in reading any of the signes, thou finde any speciall doubts, at any hand suppresse them not, but seeke resolution from doubt to doubt, and from signe to signe. Thou mayst gaine much profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table knowledge by propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these cases of thy particular conscience.</p>
                  <p>The least gaine that can bee imagined by this course, is, that whereas before thou hadst few euidences or none for thy estate, thou shalt now haue many of all
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21209:105"/>
sorts: and it must needes bee thy owne way wardnesse, if assurance follow not. For these signes will ransacke thee, and try thy very heart and reignes, and all thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretest desire and practices.</p>
                  <p>Yea, this benefit thou maiest reape by the signes, that they wil tell thee all the dayes of thy life, how it is with thee, whether thou goe forward or backward. For if by examination now thou gather out all thou canst finde by thy selfe, these will not onely lie by thee to helpe thee against any temptation at any time; but besides, if thou try thy selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, either against the next Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or the next yeere, thou mayest discerne what ground thou hast gotten or lost. If thou prosper, thou wilt discerne it, by taking in diuers things in each signe, which before thou durst not acknowledge; and besides, it will exceedingly shew thee what thou wantest in each grace
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21209:105"/>
of God, and so what thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest set thy selfe about, and get thy wants supplyed. It will at all times make a true Anatomie of thy estate; which to the well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised Christian ought to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a matter of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The God of peace giue thee all peace and ioy in beleeuing. If thou receiue any good by this Treatise, praise God, and pray for me.</p>

I answer: That his principall care must be to vse, all meanes to get the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the godly Christian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his heart: And herein the Lord hath shewed vnto men sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular mercy, that as hee hath shewed wayes in his <hi>Word;</hi> how his seruants may <hi>discerne</hi> the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that are so many signes and pledges of Gods loue, and their owne saluation; so hath he in the same word laid downe cleere <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi> that shew how euery grace may be attained, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and nourished in the hearts of men.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Hee must in the first place <note place="margin">1.

He must take notice of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to beleeue.</note> in Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He must then consider <hi>Gods commandement</hi> concerning faith,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21209:129"/>
that God doth require him to beleeue; and is so farre from being displeased with him for beleeuing in Christ, that for this cause hee will damne him in hell if hee beleeue not, <hi>Iohn 3. 18. 1.

                  <p>First, make a Catalogue of thy <note place="margin">1 Gather a Catalogue of thy sins, either by memory.</note> sinnes, which thou m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>o, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by memory or by booke. By memory thus: Goe aside, set thy
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21209:130"/>
soule before the Lord, as if thou werest presently to be iudged of him; call to minde particularly whatsoeuer thou canst remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by thy selfe: consider thy want, thy omissions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions of euill, in youth or riper age, in heart or life, in things that concorne God, or man, or thy owne soule, and disposition, thoughts, affections, words or deeds. Thou mayest then see an armie of rebellious euils thou hast beene guilty of. By booke thus: Procure thee the labour of <note place="margin">Or by booke.</note> some reuerend Diuine, that hath briefly gathered the sins of euery commandement; &amp; from thence gather out so many sins as thou knowest by thy selfe that thou hast beene guilty of: lay those sins daily before thy conscience, and consider how many wayes thou hast made thy selfe guilty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, consider then the <note place="margin">2. Consider Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> iustice of God, how he hateth all sinne; which thou maiest be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21209:131"/>
of, if thou remember how he plagued our first parents, the old world, Sodom and Gomorrha; how fearefully he neglected the Gentiles, cast off the Iewes; yea how he <hi>spared not his owne Sonne</hi> Iesus Christ, when he became a surety for other mens sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thinke of the terrible <note place="margin">3 Think of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</note> woes, and threatnings, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which are denounced euery where in Scripture against such offences as thou art guilty of.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, force vpon thy selfe <note place="margin">4 Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end.</note> the remembrance of thy latter end, and thy appearance before <hi>the tribunall seat of Christ, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue according to all that thou hast done in thy flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, obserue with what iudgement the Lord euery day <note place="margin">5. Obserue Gods iudg ments vpon the wicked</note> fights against wicked men in all parts of the world, sometimes by common plagues, sometimes by speciall &amp; particular calamities.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, aboue all things, marke <note place="margin">6. Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods goodnesse to thee.</note> with all thy heart Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21209:131"/>
to thee in particular, in enduring all this at thy hands, his blessings, of all sorts daily bestowed vpon thee, chiefely his mercy offered to thee in Iesus Christ, that can be content to forgiue thee all thy debts, so thou bee sorry and weary of offending. Nothing can more breake thy heart, then to obserue how God dealeth with thee, euen with thee in particular, that hast deserued so much euill at his hands.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, Try thy selfe by a <note place="margin">7. Try thy selfe by the signes.</note> particular examination of thine owne estate, by euery particular of the signes of Gods children, and then thou mayest see, what a poore creature thou art, what shew soeuer thou makest in the world, and what naturall gifts or prayses soeuer thou hast: for then thou shalt find how exceeding emptie thy heart is of solid gifts and the best graces, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a poore creature, that maketh
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21209:132"/>
little shew in the world, hath an heart better graced by farre then thine.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, thou must beg hartily <note place="margin">8. Beg an humble heart of God.</note> an humble heart of God, and a greater discerning of thine owne vilenesse. The Lord wil be sought vnto, and he is ready to be found if thou seeke him constantly and diligently. It is not a small worke to breake the pride and stoninesse of thy heart: it needs power from aboue.</p>

the snare that is in gay Clothes, delicious fare, worldly titles, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Eleuenthly, Shun and auoide <note place="margin">11 Auoide the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer.</note> with detestation the flatterer, and seeke vnto thee a righteous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, that may smite thee for thy fallings, and <hi>reproue thee, and not hate thee in his heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, Labour to keepe in thy memory and thoughts, <note place="margin">12 Thinke still of some of thy worst fruits.</note> six, or eight, or more, or fewer of thy faults, that thou wouldest be more ashamed of, and hast more offended in, and compell thy selfe daily to remember them: this will wonderfully doe thee good, and tame thy pride, &amp; make thee more meeke, and more tractable, and mercifull all the day after thou hast duly thought of them.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the way how to get thy spirit to bee truly poore and humble.</p>
                  <p>The next question is, What a man should do to get a soft heart <note place="margin">Quest.</note> and true godly sorrow, that hee

can bethinke himselfe of no more. It is no great matter for the order how hee sets them downe, so hee be sure he haue the chiefe sinnes, in which hee daily offends, or hath offended.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 What would I haue the Lord doe for me, if I might haue what I wish? let him set the particulars downe, till he can remember no more. As for example, I would haue him forgiue mee my sinnes, and I would haue him giue mee strength against such and such sins, and I would haue him giue mee faith and assurance; and I would haue him giue me Heauen when I dye; and so goe on with all the things he feeles a desire in his heart to seeke of God, till he can remember no more: and if at any other time hee remember some speciall thing, which hee would further haue, which hee hath not in his Catalogue, let him set it downe, as from time to time he sees cause.</p>

3 What speciall fauours hath God shewed to mee, which I see I ought to take special notice of? Let him set them downe distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether they be deliuerances, or such and such spirituall or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercis, preseruing the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie principally of the chiefest of them.</p>
                  <p>Now when hee hath thus furnished these three heads with things that in particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne himselfe, they being all matters of weight, hee must now carry these things, or the chiefe of them in his mind, and frame his heart to speake to God in the best words he can get, to signifie his detestation of those sinnes, his humble requests for those graces, and his vnfained thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse for those blessings. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hee may be rude or vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his Language about these at the first, yet exercise will bring him to a ripenesse; and by this course hee shall be sure to speake
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21209:140"/>
of things that concerne himselfe neerely; and that God which hath taught Parents to regard the vnperfect language of their little Children when they begin to speak vnto them, will himselfe much more delight to <hi>heare the desires of his Seruants,</hi> that are grieued, that they cannot speake in a better sort vnto him. The profit and comfort of this course will appeare by experience to be exceeding great: besides it is an easie way, where there is in any a true desire to bee at the paines to learne this Language of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to God by prayer; and Gods Spirit will helpe and teach the poore Christian, and draw his petitions for him, and prompt him both with words and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: And the Christian must know this, that when hee hath confessed his sinnes, and shewed what hee should haue God doe for him, with the best words hee could in the truth of his heart,

he hath made a most effectuall prayer to God.</p>

                  <p>For the first, hee that would heartily bee affected towards all the godly with a brotherly loue, must obserue these Rules: <note place="margin">1 Auoide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note>

2. Thou must in a speciall manner watch and striue against hypocrisie, and that intwo things chiefly: First, that in thy setting out into religion, thou fashion not thy course more to get credit then grace. Secondly, that in Gods seruice thou by all meanes auoide distractions, and so resist and checke thy pronenesse of heart thereunto, iudging thy selfe seuercly, when thou so offendest, till thou bee able in some happie degree to serue God with thy spirit as well as with thy body. The habit of dissembling with God is extremely dangerous.</p>

When we are te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted with the pleasures of sinne, if we haue not a more delightfull proiect to offer to our hearts, it is easie for vs to bee seduced.

                  <p>The first may containe such <note place="margin">1.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:21209:162"/>
vpon none but them.</p>
                  <p>The second may containe <note place="margin">2. Comforts in afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                     <hi>comforts;</hi> that is, places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which doe foretell what goodnesse the Lord will shew to his people in affliction. For hither-vnto belong all those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises which are giuen of purpose for the comforting and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of the godly in all their tryals.</p>
                  <p>The third part may containe such <hi>Promises,</hi> as are made to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">3. Rewards of certaine graces.</note> 
                     <hi>particular graces</hi> in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as promises, made to prayer, faith, trusting in God, or such like It is the second part of promises, which I intend here more at large to intreate of. I should shew what variety of comforts they are, with which a godly man may inflame his hart according to the seuerall distresses may fall vpon him, and these may bee thus sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuided.</p>
                  <p>All afflictions are either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or inward. For outward <note place="margin">Sorts of afflictions.</note>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:21209:162"/>
afflictions, it were too tedious, and to little purpose, to gather comforts against euery particular crosse, and therefore one head may suffice for the generall, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>promises or consolations against all outward afflictions.</hi> Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause godly people are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more troubled with the stormes and reproaches of the world, which are cast vpon them for well-doing, then with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary afflictions of life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would in the second place gather the <hi>comforts against reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> and withall I would adde in the third place, <hi>consolations against aduersaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for inward afflictions; they are the afflictions of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man, and arise either from the temptations of Satan, or from the trouble of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnsatisfied in diuers scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. I would therefore in the fourth place shew how we might bee <hi>comforted against the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:21209:163"/>
of Satan;</hi> and because the trouble of conscience ariseth vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally either from the burthen of our daily infirmity, or from the feare of our falling away: I would in the fifth place shew how we may be <hi>comforted against our daily infirmities;</hi> and then in the last place I would vnfold those <hi>promises, that may assure vs of perseuerance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now suppose a Christian soule clearly informed with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Note.</note> of those priuiledges wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he excels all the people of the world; and withall that he knew how to comfort himselfe against any outward afflictions, and had store of consolations in his heart against the temptations of Satan, and did know how to support himselfe against the sense of his daily weaknesses, &amp; withall were settled and out of feare for falling away; Would you not thinke such a one wonderfull happy?

                     <hi>Esay's</hi> time had obserued such a thing as this. For the Prophet tels the godly, that <hi>their brethren had

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Thou knowest not how <note place="margin">Sol.</note> God dealeth with them, God can iudge them secretly, and consume them insensibly, so as the world shall take no notice of it, as the <hi>moth eateth vp the garment,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any great rent, <hi>Esay</hi> 51. 8. And for this reason, they are exhorted in that place, not to feare the reproach. Secondly, What knowest thou what God will yet doe with them? For God hath pleaded the cause of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants many times by bringing strange iudgements vpon the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> So was <hi>Iob</hi> deepely censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Sol.</note> by his godly friends: And so was <hi>Paul</hi> of his owne hearers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4, 10. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> was forsaken in his wrongs, so as none would comfort him, <hi>Psalme</hi> 69. 20.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Ob.</hi> But yet one thing much troubles me, that is, that <note place="margin">Ob. 10.</note> since these slanders, the hand of God hath been vpon me in diuers particular iudgements, and this makes people to thinke, sure I am guiltie:</p>

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> So they thought of <hi>Paul</hi> when the Viper fell on his hand, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> being a man that was before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, and now sent as it were a prisoner, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. So they iudged of <hi>Dauid</hi> when he was sicke, that <hi>some euill disease did cleaue to him, Psa.</hi> 41. 8. Yea, this was our Lord Iesus Christs case, <hi>For they iudged him as plagued and smitten of God, Esay</hi> 53. 4.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Ob.</hi> But the things obiected <note place="margin">Ob. 11.</note> against me, are so foule, that when I here those things spoken of publikely or priuatly, I blush, and that may cause mee to bee thought to be guilty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> This was <hi>Dauids</hi> case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent: he saith, <hi>Shame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The daily refuge against the scornes of reproaches, must be to get to God, &amp; hide thy selfe with him by prayer.

3. Looke to thy tongue, be silent, see thou render not reuiling for reuiling, but rather trust in God, and blesse them that curse thee, <hi>Psalme 37. 7. 1 Peter 3. 9. Psalme 31. 14. 1 Cor. 4. 12. Ier.</hi> 18. 20.</p>

                  <p>The second may bee taken <note place="margin">2. Of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> from the appointment of God herein: And this stands of two Branches.

                  <p>Three things must be granted <note place="margin">2. Things taken for granted.</note> concerning temptations.</p>
                  <p>First, that the doctrine of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations is obscure, because the disease lies inward in the soule, and is such as the vnregenerate world h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>th little care of, or iudgement in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that when God leaues his children to be tried by this affliction, and softens their hearts to feele this combate with
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:21209:187"/>
diuels, it doth wonderfully amaze and disquiet them, and therefore this is a point needfull to bee handled.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that there is sure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie in the Word of God, euen for this affliction also.</p>
                  <p>Now, because this doctrine of temptation is somewhat obscure, I would, before I intreate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts against them, consider of three things.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. One is, when hee <hi>tempts God against vs,</hi> labouring to bring God out of liking with vs. Thus he insinuated the dispraises of <hi>Iob</hi> to God, Iob Chap. 1. &amp; 2.

                  <p n="2">2. Another way is, when he appeares in some shape, and by voyce, or otherwayes terrifies men.</p>

                  <p>Now that there may bee the more abundant support vnto our hearts in this case of infirmities, I will open two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that doe meet with the most obiections of our hearts.</p>
                  <p>The first is, <hi>Exodus</hi> 34. 6, 7. where the Lord proclaimeth the <note place="margin">The full explication of the words in Exo 34. 6, 7.</note> goodnesse of his nature, that all men may take notice of it, and giue him the praise of his rich grace, where hee so describeth
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:21209:203"/>
the Lord, that in his titles hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth an answer to many obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If thou say, thy infirmities may alienate the Lord from thee:</p>
                  <p>He answers, that he is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> alwayes the same, vnchangeable. Hee will not alter his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, but loue thee to the end: and for the more assurance, he repeated that title twice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knowes, we most doubt of that, and haue most need to be succoured with that argument, as the foundation of all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou say, thou hast strong inclination to sinne, or strange temptations, or great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or many aduersaries and discouragements:</p>
                  <p>Hee answers, that hee is <hi>God,</hi> or strong; to signifie that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall hinder the worke of his grace towards thee, but hee will keepe thee by his power,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:21209:204"/>
and maketh his grace sufficient for thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If thou say, Hee is of pure eyes, and cannot but discerne thy faults, and sinne is sinne in the sight of God:</p>
                  <p>He answers, That he is <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 If thou say, Thou deseruest no such mercy:</p>
                  <p>He answers, That he is <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and doth not stand vpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert: He will shew mercy, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou art good, but because he is good.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If thou say, The daily repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and renewing of thy sinnes may prouoke him, though hee be mercifull and gracious.</p>
                  <p>He answers, That hee is <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 If thou say, Thou hast many defects and wants to bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed:</p>
                  <p>He answers, That he is <hi>full of goodnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7 It thou say, Thou art asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:21209:204"/>
of thy ignorance, which is more then can be conceiued.</p>
                  <p>Hee answers, That he is <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in truth</hi> to supply thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and to performe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, though thou haue but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If thou say, Thou doest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God is all this vnto some men; and that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and others that were in great fauour with God, haue found all this: But for thy selfe, thou art so vile a creature, and so meane a person, as it is not for thee to expect such great things of God.</p>
                  <p>He answers, That hee <hi>keepes mercy for thousands.</hi> He hath not spent all vpon <hi>Dauid,</hi> or the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, or Prophets, or Apostles, or Martyrs, or Ministers; but he hath an Ocean of goodnesse still to be shewed, without respect of persons, to al that come vnto him for mercy.</p>

guiltie of diuers sorts of sinnes and that it is not one offence onely, but many that lye vpon thee, and some of them such as thou darest not name, they are so vile.</p>
                  <p>He answers, that <hi>he forgiues iniquitie, transgression, and sinne,</hi> that is, all sorts of sinnes, of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of weaknes, or of presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If any other should say, this is a doctrine of liberty, and may embolden men to sinne:</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, the attributes of God: <note place="margin">3 Three attributes in God, viz.</note> and so there bee three things in God may wonderfully settle vs against this feare. The one is <hi>his faithfulnesse.</hi> The other is <hi>his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi> The third is <hi>his immutable loue:</hi> All three are laid to pawne for the performance of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, &amp; so pleaded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Cor. 1. 8, 6. and so he reasoneth writing to the Thessalonians: <hi>The Lord is faithfull, who shall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish you, and keepe you from euill, 2 Thess.</hi> 3. 3. And of the power of God these places speake, <hi>we are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">His power</note> 
                     <hi>kept by the power of God to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 Pet. 1. 5. I know</hi> (saith) <hi>Paul whom I haue beleeued, and I am

perswaded that hee is able to keepe that which I haue committed to him against that day, 2 Tim. 1. 12.

And for the loue of God, <note place="margin">His loue.</note> that it is vnchangeable, there is apparent proofe, <hi>Whom he loueth, he loueth to the end, Iohn</hi> 13. 1. so as we may bee confident in this, that <hi>hee which hath begun a good worke in vs, will performe it till the day of Christ, Philip.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, wee haue the seale of <note place="margin">4 His seale</note> God for it, and he hath giuen vs earnest, that we shal certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the inheritance purchased for vs. And thus euery one that bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, is <hi>sealed by the holy Spirit of promise,</hi> which is <hi>our earnest, Eph.</hi> 1. 14, 15. and therefore, we shall be established, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22.</p>

Now for the second; If any aske how God will doe this?</p>
                  <p>I answer, that the Scripture shewes how this will be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thus: For</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God will put his feare into their hearts, that they shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him:</hi> For this is his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with his people, that <hi>he will not turne away from them, to doe them good, and hee will put his feare into them, that they shall not depart from him,</hi> Ier. 32. 40, 41.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To make all the surer, he <hi>will put his Spirit into them, which shall leade them into all truth, and cause them to keepe his statutes, and to doe them,</hi> Iohn 14. Ezech. 36.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He will vphold them, and order their wayes, and keepe
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:21209:210"/>
their feet, that they fall not. <hi>The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way: Though he fall, he shall not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly bee cast downe: for the Lord vpholdeth him with his hand,</hi> Psal. 37. 23, 24. <hi>He holdeth our soule in life, and suffereth not our feet to bee moued,</hi> Psal. 66. 9. <hi>He will keepe the feet of his Saints,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 9.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lastly, God will worke their workes for them, and continually assist them with his presence, and blessings, <hi>Esa. 26. Ezech. 36. Phil.</hi> 2. 13. And thus the comforts that we may gather from God.</p>
                  <p>Now secondly, in Christ there <note place="margin">Three things in Christ may comfort vs</note> are three things may minister much establishment in our harts against this feare.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His intercession: hee hath specially prayed for vs, that God <note place="margin">1.

                  <p n="3">3. The power of Christ. <hi>None</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>our seed abideth in vs:</hi> It cannot be blotted out. <hi>Hee that is borne of God, sinneth not, because his seed remaineth in him,</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>eternall life</hi> is begun in vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 3. Now if it be life eternall, how can it end? How can we fall away from it? Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life may end, but Splrituall life can neuer end.</p>

and speedy, and matchlesse gaine it will bring vnto a man. For (besides that it only hath the promise of a better life) godlinesse were to bee desired, and with all possible diligence to be sought after, for the very gaine of it in this life. For (to omit the consideration of the fauour it breeds with God, and the vnspeakeable treasures of the grace of Christ, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes goe with it) it were to be desired for the immediate effects it workes vpon men in it selfe. For if men loue themselues, what should they desire more then that which tends to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues perfect? What should it aduantage a man to haue all things good about him, if himselfe bee ill and vile? If
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:21209:218"/>
men, that were onely guided by the light of nature, could (some of them) see clearely, that nothing was so good for a man, as to liue well (when yet they knew no other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing well, then what was prescribed in their naked and naturall Ethickes) then how much more happy must it be for a man to liue a <hi>Religious life,</hi> by which he is brought more neere to God himselfe, and farre aboue the condition of any naturall man? Yea if there were no more to be had by it, but the peace and rest it brings vnto a mans heart, it were aboue all outward things to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired. For no man walkes safely, that walkes not reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously; nor can any actions of men produce any sound
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:21209:219"/>
tranquillity and rest of heart, but such actions as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by true Religion. What shall I say? If for none of these, yet for it selfe were a godly life to bee had in singular request. For if men, with much expence of outward things, seeke but the skill of diuers naturall and artificiall knowledges, and thinke it worth their cost but to be able to attaine these skills; how much more ought man to bee at the paines, yea and cost too (if it were required) to get this admirable Skill, to liue a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life? This most gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full subiect is intreated of in this little Volume. I may truely say, that almost euery sentence in this little Treatise leads vs to much and rich
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:21209:219"/>
treasure, if the promises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to each dutie were annexed thereunto: And therefore no Christian that loues his owne soule, should thinke much of the paines of learning or practising these Rules.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE only thing inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">The scope</note> in this Treatise is, to collect for thy vse (Christian Reader) those directions scattered here and there in the Scripture, which may, throughout the whole course of thy life, tell thee, what thou must do in the right order of thy conuersation: how thou shouldest behaue thy self <hi>towards God,</hi> and how thou shouldest car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thy selfe <hi>towards men,</hi> in all the occasions of thy life: <hi>in company out of company:</hi> in all duties either

of <hi>righteousnesse</hi> or <hi>mercie:</hi> and how thou shouldest dispose of thy selfe <hi>in affliction,</hi> and <hi>out of affliction,</hi> at all times.</p>
                  <p>And thou maiest bee the more encouraged to studie and practise <note place="margin">Thy war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> these rules, because thou hast the most expresse and apparant word of God to warrant and require thy obedience herein.</p>
                  <p>Be not so profane, as to thinke, that heere is more to doe then needs, or that I burthen the liues of Christians with a multitude of vnnecessarie Precepts, and so make the way harder then it is: For I require thy obedience in nothing thou hast not reason to be perswaded to be enioyned thee by the pure Word of God: and thou must know, to the confusion of thy securitie, that he that will walke safely, must <hi>walke by rule,</hi> Gal. 6. 16. He is yet <hi>in darkenesse, and walkes on in darkenesse,</hi> and sees not what he doth, or whither he goeth, that doth not make <hi>the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:21209:237"/>
Word of God the light vnto his sect, and the Lanterne vnto his paths,</hi> Ps. 119. There is an holy <hi>order of life</hi> commended in the godly, Col. 2. 5. And Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are made to such as <hi>will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose of their whole wayes aright.</hi> A loose conuersation is an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation; and if euer we would <hi>see the saluation of God,</hi> we must be at the paines to dispose of our wayes, and to see to it, that wee dispose of our wayes aright, <hi>Psal. 50. vlt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The benefit thou maiest reape <note place="margin">The profit of the course.</note> by this Treatise, is much euery way, if the fault bee not in thy selfe: for here thou maiest briefly behold the substance of a godly life; thou maiest in a short time informe thy knowledge in that great Doctrine of practicall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie: But especially thou maiest by the helpe of this Treatise, see a sound way how to beautifie thy owne conuersation, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of diuers rules, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:21209:238"/>
hitherto thou hast not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of: God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>much peace,</hi> and comfort vnto <hi>such as will walke according vnto rule,</hi> Gal. 6. 16. Yea he hath promised, <hi>that they shall see the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of God, that dispose their way aright,</hi> Psal. 50. <hi>vlt.</hi> It is true, it is a greater labour to trauaile in the way, then to shew it; but yet it is a greater benefit to bee shewed the way. Howsoeuer, it may not bee denied, but it is a greater glory to obserue these Rules, then to know them, or prescribe them.</p>
                  <p>It may be thou wilt obiect, that the Rules are so many, thou canst <note place="margin">The easinesse of the course.</note> neuer remember them, and so not profit by them. I answer:</p>
                  <p>If I haue made the Rules no more in number then God hath made them in his Word, thou mayest not finde fault with me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, No man that is to learne any Trade or Science, but he meeteth with more directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:21209:238"/>
then he can on the suddain reach to, or practise, and yet he reiects not his Trade or Science, because in time hee hopes to learne it all. Would we put on a resolution to serue a Prentiship to Religion, and to worke hard one seuen yeeres: Oh what worke would we dispatch! How many Rules and knowledges would we grow skilfull in! But alas, after many yeeres profession of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the most of vs, if all were put together, haue not done the worke that might haue beene done in few dayes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I answer, that it is not <note place="margin">Marke this direction.</note> necessarie thou shouldest lay all these Rules before thee at once, but marke out certaine choise Rules, so many as thou canst well remember, and striue, by daily practise, to bring thy selfe to some kinde of dexteritie in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing them. There bee some Rules of each kinde, which, if thou bee a true Christian, thou
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:21209:239"/>
knowest and obseruest alreadie: These thou mayest continue to obserue still, without loading thy memory about them. Now if those be omitted, then consider of the rest that remaine, which of them do most concerne thee, or would most adorne thy practice and profession, or are such as thou neuer hitherto didst make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of: Extract or marke out so many of those at that time, as thou wouldest in daily practice striue to attaine, and when thou hast learned them, then goe on, and prescibe to thy selfe new Lessons. To a carnall mind all the way of godlinesse is impossible, but to a godly and willing mind, all things, through the power and assistance of God are possible. God will accept thy desire and endeuour, and will adde strength and might, and encourage thee in all his wayes. By prayer thou mayest forme any grace in thee, by reason of the power the Lord
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:21209:239"/>
Iesus hath to preuaile for any thing thou dost aske the Father in his name.</p>
                  <p>The last benefit may come to thee, if thou daily reade these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, is that they wil quicken thee to a great care of weldoing, and giue thee cause to <hi>walke hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with thy God,</hi> and abase thy selfe for thine owne insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. <hi>The Lord giue thee vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in all things,</hi> and <hi>vnite thy heart vnto his feare alwayes,</hi> that thou mayest <hi>obserue to doe,</hi> as hee commandeth thee, <hi>and not turne from the good way all the dayes of thy life.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>generall rules</hi> are likewise <note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules concerne either, The helps to a godly life.</note> of two sorts: some of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne certaine <hi>generall prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, helpes, or furtherances</hi> to an holy life, without which men in vaine beginne the cares or ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of a reformed life. And some of them comprehend those necessarie rules which are to bee obserued <hi>in the manner of doing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Or second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manner of wel doing.</note> all holy duties, and so are of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vse to bee alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, when wee goe about any seruice,</p>

                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:21209:240"/>
Of the first sort there are many <note place="margin">Who so will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to an holy course of life.</note> rules; for they that will addresse themselues to order their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation aright, must be sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carefull in the obseruation of these directions following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Hee <hi>must examine himselfe</hi> about his <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance;</hi> he must be sure hee is reconciled to God, and hath truely repented himselfe of his sinnes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. For vnlesse he be a <hi>new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> he is <hi>no creature,</hi> but a <hi>dead man,</hi> and so vtterly vnable for the practice of these rules following: And <hi>without God wee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> and without God wee are till we liue by faith. Besides, the pollution of our hearts or liues drawne vpon vs by the custome of sinne past and present, will so infect all we doe, that it will bee abominable to God, and so lost labour.</p>
                  <p>This is the first Rule.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His next care must bee to <hi>learne</hi> the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the rules

of life. Wee can neuer practise what we know not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our next care and paines must be to get the knowledge of Gods wayes distinctly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually into our heads and hearts. Our direction must not be in our bookes, but in our heads: and a Christian must haue his rules al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before him, that so hee may <hi>walke circumspectly,</hi> by line and leuell, Ephes. 5. 15. <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the will of God</hi> in what he is to do. <hi>He is in the way of life, that hath and keepeth instruction,</hi> how to liue, Prouerbs 10. 17. whereas hee <hi>that will not</hi> be at the paines of <hi>getting instruction, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must <hi>take fast hold of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and not let her goe, but keepe her for she is our life,</hi> Prou. 4. 13. Knowledge then, of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie must be had, or in vaine wee goe about to liue well. Now this is such a rule, as must not slightly bee passed ouer: and it
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:21209:241"/>
is not enough thus in generall to require knowledge, but withall, I would shew certaine choise rules to be obserued by vs, if wee would take a sound course to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge. Hee then that <note place="margin">And hee that would prosper in seeking knowledge must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue nine Rules</note> would prosperously seeke sound knowledg, must remember these directions.</p>
                  <p>First, hee must <hi>esteeme know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and labour to frame his <note place="margin">1. He must esteeme knowledge</note> heart to an high estimation of it, accounting it as <hi>great treasure,</hi> accounting the <hi>getting of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome aboue all gettings,</hi> Prou. 4. 7. Wee must <hi>seeke for knowledge as for siluer, and search for her as for treasure,</hi> and then with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full successe shall <hi>wee vnderstand the right feare of the Lord,</hi> Prou. 2. 4, 5. else our labour will bee blasted and fruitlesse, if we bring meane thoughts to the exercise of directions for the attaining of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee must take heede <note place="margin">2 He must not consult with flesh and blood.</note> that <hi>hee consult not with flesh and

blood, Gal.</hi> 1. 16. Hee must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard other mens opinions, or his owne carnall reason, but resolue to <hi>giue glory to God and his Word,</hi> as willing to beleeue or do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Lord saith vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee must <hi>redeeme the time, Ephes.</hi> 5. 16. Inasmuch as he <note place="margin">3. He must redeeme the time.</note> hath lost so much time past, hee must now prouide to allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe conuenient and certain time to bee spent this way for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of knowledge; else to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by snatches and vncertainely, will be to little or no purpose. To complaine of ignorance, will not serue the turne, nor will the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of worldly businesse excuse vs: and therefore we must <hi>buy so much time</hi> of our occasions as may be competent for the supply of our wants in knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in seeking know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <note place="margin">4. He must be wise for himselfe.</note> 
                     <hi>he must be wise for himselfe, Prou.</hi> 9. 12. Hee must striue to <hi>vnderstand his owne way,</hi> so to be carefull to know the generals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

Religion, as his speciall care bee in all things to referre what he reads or heares, to the particular directions of his own soule.

When the light of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was so great in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue times, this was one practice of Satan, to draw aside the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Christians from necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and solid truths, to Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, or quarrels about words or vaine controuersies, falsly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>oppositions of science.</hi> We must therefore be warned of this <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Satan;</hi> and till we know cleerely the wayes of life, allow our selues no time for more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote studies, or fruitlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies.

The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our accounts in the day of Christ, will wonderfully quicken men to the care of well-doing; and the cause of vicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and miserable neglect, and procrastinations of many, is, their forgetting of their latter end. A great reason why the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections about godlinesse are not entertained, is, because men <hi>put far away from them the Day of the Lord:</hi> whereas the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the reuelation of Iesus Christ, would put spirit and life into vs. He dares not say from the heart, Come, Lord Iesus, come quickly, that is not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued diligently to worke the works of Christ.</p>

                  <p>HItherto of the Rules that concerne the knowledge of God, as the <hi>foundation of our loue</hi> to God: The Rules that should order vs in the <hi>exercise of our loue</hi> to God, follow; those are of two sorts: for either they concerne the <hi>manifestation</hi> of our <note place="margin">Rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the exercise of our loue to God.</note> loue; or our <hi>preseruation</hi> in the loue of God: we must shew our loue to God, and we must keepe our selues in the loue of God, Iude 21.</p>

                  <p>For the first, there be diuers

                  <p n="1">1. We must <hi>auouch God to be</hi>

                     <hi>our God,</hi> Deuter. 26. 27. and so we doe, if we do not onely make choise of God aboue all things to set our hearts vpon him, but also maintaine our choise, by a constant refusall of all idols in the world, euen all things which might entice vs to loue them in stead of God, by sound affection and practice declaring our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to cleaue to God, as our sufficient happinesse, though all the world follow their profits or pleasures, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We must prouide and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi>

                     <hi>a place for God,</hi> that he may <hi>dwell with vs,</hi> wheresoeuer wee dwell, Exod. 15. 2. It is a signe of our true loue to God, why wee

cannot liue without him. Hee that can be content to liue in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place where he is not power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully present in his ordinances, shewes no loue to God. It should be our chiefe care to seate our selues so in the world, as the Lord and his presence may bee prouided for, that he may reigne amongst vs by the Scepter of his word.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We must shew our loue to <note place="margin">3.

Cor. 16. 22 Wee shew that wee loue God, when wee highly esteeme Iesus Christ, and make much of him in our hearts, and striue to fire our affections towards him; and this must bee our care through the passages of our life, to <hi>forme in vs the loue of the Lord Iesus,</hi> that we may long after him, and haue the desires of our soules af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p n="4">4. We must shew our loue to God, by <hi>walking with him,</hi> Gen. <note place="margin">4. By wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God.</note> 17. 1. Mic. 6. 8.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now we walke with God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. When we <hi>nourish the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit,</hi> and retire our selues of purpose to entertaine them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When wee daily haue <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to those meanes</hi> by which the Lord is pleased to conuerse with men, and not rest in the base vse of the meanes, but striue to finde out <hi>the Lord in his holy presence,</hi> in euery ordinance of

his, Psalme 63. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>When we vse our selues to <hi>Soliloquies</hi> with God, taking all occasions to speake to God by prayer, and priuate meditation of things offered to vs, out of which we could extract matter for frequent <hi>ciaculations,</hi> lifting vp our hearts vpon the very first motions of good vnto God, Psal. 63. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When our hearts are fired <hi>with longing desires after his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of glory in heauen,</hi> 2. Gor. 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>Thus of our walking with God.</p>

businesses that concerne his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> aboue all other businesses, and shewing our respect of the duties of the first Table that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne God, before the duties that concerne men in the second Table: wee honouring him by <hi>seeking his kingdome first:</hi> First (I say) in <hi>the precedencie of time,</hi> and first, in respect of the <hi>measure of our affections,</hi> Math. 6. shewing a desire to please him rather then all the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By making a bold and <hi>open profession</hi> of Gods truth vpon all occasions, without feare of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions or snares of the world.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. By our <hi>willingnesse to suffer</hi>

any thing for his sake, though it were extremities, euen the losse of all worldly things, yea and life it selfe, if it were called to it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>By honouring them that feare his Name,</hi> and are <hi>begotten of him,</hi> and beare his Image, receiuing them, and making much of them, and defending them for the loue we beare to God himselfe, Psal. 15. 4. 1. Ioh. 5. 1.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. By <hi>hating them that are his enemies,</hi> as if they were our own; conceiuing more dislike of them for dishonouring God, then for any wrongs they could doe vnto vs, Psal. 139. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We honour God when we speake of the <hi>Oracles of God</hi> with all reuerence, as may become the nature and glory of them, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement 3. 1. Pet. 4. 11.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We honour him by <hi>gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon him,</hi> when we bring to him our <hi>free-will offerings,</hi> such as are the <hi>first fruits</hi> of all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:21209:269"/>
when out of all things wherin God hath prospered vs, wee with gladnesse consecrate a part for the furtherance of his worship, or the maintenance of his poore: Prouerbs 3. 6. Esay 60. 6.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We honour him, <hi>when we praise him.</hi> One vsuall way by which we honour great persons in the world, is by taking all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to magnifie them, by commending their vertues, or their worthy acts: And this is likewise one great way of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God; and therefore with sorrow for our neglects herein, we should <hi>study his prayses</hi> for the time to come, and striue for language to be able readily to do so.</p>
                  <p>Now God is praysed diuers <note place="margin">Rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the praise of God.</note> wayes: some of them belong not properly to this place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will but touch them.</p>
                  <p>We praise God:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>wee keepe</hi> and obserue
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:21209:269"/>
carefully <hi>the solemnities</hi> set apart for his prayse; as when wee ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the Eucharist, because it is to be performed as a thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing and praysing of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When dayly we take all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions in priuate <hi>to blesse God for his dayly mercies:</hi> But let these and such like passe, as not proper to this place. We must prayse him in our discourse to others. This is required of vs in many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Psal. 33. 1. Iob 36. 24. Psal.</hi> 96. 4. But because this must <note place="margin">When wee commend God, diuers things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</note> not bee done cursorily, diuers rules are to be obserued: As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That wee may prayse him effectually, wee must <hi>wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of his workes,</hi> and so of his nature, to extract from thence sound <hi>arguments</hi> of prayse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 64. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We should do well, for this purpose, to <hi>keepe Records,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister</hi> vp the speciall glorious

works of God, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 24. &amp; 37. 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When we do prayse him, it must be done <hi>with our whole heart,</hi> speaking of his prayses with all possible affection, and not as if we speake of ordinarie things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We must thus prayse him, not once, or for one worke of his, but we must <hi>prayse him for all his workes,</hi> especially <hi>his wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous workes,</hi> Psal. 9. 1. and 105. 1, 2. and 106. 2.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We must prayse him from day to day, and continue to doe it, <hi>while wee liue,</hi> Psal. 63. 4. and 96. 23.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This is a dutie that <hi>all the kindreds of the people are bound to: All the people must prayse him,</hi> Psalme 148. 12, 13. and 96. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the fift way of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our loue to God: and that is by honouring him.</p>
                  <p>The sixt way by which wee

                     </gap> from all idols, that wee should not <hi>make mention of their names,</hi> and therefore daily confirme our hearts in that purpose to cleane to God alone, <hi>Mal. 2. 11. Exod.</hi> 34. 11, 14, 15. and 23. 13. <hi>Act. 11. 23. Iosh.</hi> 23. 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We must beware, that <hi>wee forget not God,</hi> nor goe too long without effectuall remembrance of him. They that can liue whole dayes and weekes without any care to thinke of God, may bee sure their hearts are voide of the loue of God; and as euer wee would continue to loue God, we must be carefull euery day to remember him, and thinke vpon him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 12. &amp; 32. 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We must labour <hi>to edifie our selues in our most holy faith;</hi> wee must build vp our hearts in the assurance of that wonderfull loue God hath shewed to vs: and this will preserue and keepe vs in our loue to him againe,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:21209:274"/>
                     <hi>Iude</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wee <hi>must pray in the holy Ghost,</hi> as is shewed in the same place: prayer preserues acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, and exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>quickens</hi> the heart; and besides, drawes from God new pledges of his loue to vs, which may serue to kindle our affections towards him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="6">6. In the vse of all Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, we must be carefull <hi>to seeke out the face of God,</hi> which is that speciall presence of his grace. For the loue of God will decay in vs, if once we come to vse the meanes only for forme, and an outward shew, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. 4. And if we misse of God in his

If we would be preserued in the loue of God, we must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to attaine to the abilitie <hi>to reioyce in God,</hi> and <hi>delight our selues in God.</hi> A wife that would increase her loue to her husband, must striue to solace her selfe often with her husband, and to forme in her heart a speciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him: So must wee doe to God. This is miserably neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and yet exceedingly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie. Nor is it an ordinarie ioy we should take in God, but
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:21209:275"/>
we should ioy in him, first, <hi>with all our hearts:</hi> secondly, not for a time, but alwaies, euery day; nor with common, but with <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioyes,</hi> Phil. 4. 4.

                  <p>For the first, this delight in <note place="margin">What it is to reioyce or delight our selues in God.</note> God hath in it foure things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, a ioyfull entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all passages of loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and vs; especially in the vse of his Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a <hi>delightfull contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi>
                     <pb n="520" facs="tcp:21209:276"/>
of God and his mercies.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a <hi>glorying in God,</hi> and extolling of his praises, as by discourse, so by <hi>singing of Psalmes,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 31. Psal. 33. 1. &amp; 105. 3. &amp; 68. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Now for the attainment of the ioying in God:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We must <hi>mourne often for our disabilities</hi> herein, and pray <note place="margin">What wee must doe that wee might bee able to ioy in God.</note> to God to forme this delight in vs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We must <hi>restraine carnall ioyes,</hi> and cares: for the excesse of both doth exceedingly dull the heart, and withdrawes it care of delight in God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wee must exercise our selues with all the ioy wee can <hi>in the Word of God,</hi> Psal. 119. 14, 16.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. Wee must restraine our owne beliefe about the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the good duties wee performe; and to this end wee must take heed, that we bee <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iust ouermuch,</hi> by attributing too much to our selues: nor yet <hi>wicked ouermuch,</hi> in condemning all wee doe, as hatefull to God.

The godly Christian ought with all care to lay before him the Rules that binde him to the good behauiour in Gods house, and to striue to fashion his nature and practice, as may become the glorie of Gods publike seruice and presence; and so there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things which in a speciall manner he must looke to, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Gods publike seruice.</p>
                  <p>For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning these publike du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, these rules must be obserued.</p>
                  <p>First, that all sorts and degrees <note place="margin">1. All must come.</note> of men must appeare before God publikely to do him homage and seruice. None must be spared or freed; men, women, and children must all take notice of it, that they are bound hereunto, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must come our selues <hi>with all possible reuerence,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. By confirming our owne hearts in a resolution, to resort to Gods house with ioy and gladnesse, notwithstanding the scornes &amp; oppositions of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men and persons.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. By making haste to Gods worship, going to the house of God with the first, and with willing hearts, with an holy thirst after the meanes, flocking and flying thither <hi>as the clouds,</hi> or <hi>as so many doues to their windowes,</hi> Zach. 8. 22.

                  <p>Thus of that speciall zeale we should shew about Gods publike worship.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, wee should in all <note place="margin">4. With one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</note> publike duties serue God <hi>with
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:21209:280"/>
one consent and one heart.</hi> There should appeare in Gods seruants a wonderfull desire of <hi>vnanimity</hi> and concord.

It is a maruellous glory in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when people can come once to this, <hi>to serue the Lord with one shoulder,</hi> Zeph. 3. 9.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, in the 52. <hi>Psalm.</hi> v. 8, 9. <note place="margin">Three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rules gathered out of the Ps. 52. 8, 9.</note> wee may gather three other rules, which in a speciall manner fit vs for a right behauiour in Gods house.</p>
                  <p>First, we should alwayes be <hi>as greene Oliue trees in the house of the Lord.</hi> Howsoeuer it goe with men in the world, yet when wee come before the Lord, our hearts shall reioyce and reuiue, and our spirits be fresh &amp; cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and our affections should be healed of all the cares or distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:21209:281"/>
were before in them: Gods Ordinances should haue such a power ouer vs, as to make a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fresh spring of desires and holy thoughts in vs. There is this power in the Ordinances of God to effect this, if the fault be not in vs: I meane, when these Ordinances are exercised in the power and life of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee must <hi>trust on the mercie of God,</hi> bringing an heart readie to beleeue euerie good Word of God: resoluing, that if the Lord will speake comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to his seruants, wee will not dishonour his consolations, through carelesnesse, or vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe; but receiue them with all our hearts, and establish our selues in the safe-keeping of his good Word.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee must resolue to be <hi>thankefull,</hi> with all tendernesse, for all experiences of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and goodnesse toward vs in the meanes, vowing with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:21209:281"/>
to praise him for euer</hi> for them. And if the Lord doe withhold his power and presence for a time, so as we feele not the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualnesse of his ordinances: yet wee should resolue without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, <hi>to waite vpon the Lord,</hi> and obserue him according to the <hi>seasons</hi> of his grace.</p>

                     <item>3. Some after we haue heard.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. Before we come to heare, wee must bring with vs two <note place="margin">1 Before we come</note> things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A resolution to deny our owne wits, reasons, opinions, and conceits, and emptie our heads of all perswasion of our owne skill, to iudge in the things of the kingdome of God, being ready to beleeue and thinke in all things, as God shall teach vs out of his Word. Wee must <hi>be fooles, that we may be wise,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 18. <hi>humbling our selues at his very feete to receiue his Law,</hi> Deut. 33. 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee must bring with vs a <hi>meeke and quiet spirit,</hi> a minde quieted from passions, lusts, and perturbations, and at rest from the turmoyling cares of this

world. The Word is able to doe great things in our hearts, if we <hi>receiue it with meeknesse,</hi> Iames 1. 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, at the time of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <note place="margin">1. In the time of hearing.</note> wee must looke to two rules.</p>
                  <p>First, we must hearken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distraction: we must heare, as if it were for our liues, wee must <hi>incline our eares,</hi> and shake off all impediments arising from our owne drowsinesse, preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or vaine thoughts, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting obiects, <hi>Esay 55. 3. Psal.</hi> 116. 113.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee must <hi>proue all things, and keepe that which is good.</hi> We must heare with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; hearken for our selues, hauing speciall care to looke to that doctrin which in particular concerns vs, to lay it vp in our hearts, and apply it effectually. This is a rule of singular thrift in godlines. If we did marke what sin in vs the Lord reproues, or
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:21209:283"/>
what comfort is speedily fitted to our hearts: or what direction doth specially concerne vs: He <note place="margin">No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>.</note> hath an honest memory that will bee sure to keepe these things, though he forget all the rest; and hee hath a wretched memory, and heart too, that forgets these things, though he could repeate all the Sermon <hi>verbatim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, after we haue heard, two things also must be further <note place="margin">3. After we haue heard</note> done.</p>
                  <p>First, we must by <hi>meditation</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make those things wee haue heard, which concerne vs, fast, that <hi>they runne not out</hi> of our mindes, and we must take heed that neither the diuell steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the good seed, nor our owne heart through negligence forget it. Neither is this a worke for an houre after, to keepe these things till we may repeate them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but ought to be our daily worke, especially the weeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to thinke so often of them,
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:21209:283"/>
till there be a sure impression of the Word in our hearts, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee must yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see to it, that we be <hi>doers of the Word,</hi> yea we must <hi>obserue to doe,</hi> as the phrase of the holy Ghost is. It is the wisedome of God so to dispose of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that we receiue our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections by parcels, and there is a time of <hi>interim</hi> betweene Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and Sabbath, Sermon and Sermon, that we might in that space learne to frame our selues to the obedience of the truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that so we might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receiue new lessons from the Lord. The surest way for the husband man to keepe his seede, is not to lay it vp in his ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, but to cast it into the ground: for what is sowed, he may receiue againe with aduantage; or if he might faile of an haruest from his seede in nature, yet godly men shall neuer faile to receiue what
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:21209:284"/>
they sow by practice, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. So much of the truth, as is put into practice, is sure for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; the rest may be lost: and it is a singular helpe to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, if he set vpon his obedience while the doctrine is yet fresh in his minde; for delay will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe him about with many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and he will want those inward incitations, that might stirre vp his heart with power and strength to obey.</p>

God occasion to neglect our seed.

                  <p>Secondly, for our selues, we <note place="margin">2.

feare of the forgiuenesse of our sinnes; or of the saluation of our soules: for <hi>Baptisme saueth vs,</hi> that is, effectually assures vs of our saluation; and we doe not offend in trusting Gods promise made in his word, &amp; signed and sealed in Baptisme. As certainly doth it saue our soules, as the <hi>Arke saued the</hi> bodies of <hi>Noah</hi> and his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; so as we cannot miscarry, if we leape not out of the Arke into the Seas of water. Let vs sticke to our Baptisme, and then we are safe: The washing in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme did assure the washing of our soules by the blood of Christ for our sinnes. If I be tempted to doubt of my saluation, I must say to my owne soule: Hath not the Lord prouided me the Arke of Baptisme to preserue me from the seas of his wrath? And if I doubt the forgiuenesse of sinnes, I must say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="540" facs="tcp:21209:286"/>
not shew mee so much in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme? We sin shamefully, in that we doe not make this vse, but neglect the confidence Baptisme should worke in vs, as if the Lord had but dallied with vs, or that Baptisme were but some i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Ceremony, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. 1 Cor. 15. 29. Acts</hi> 22. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the case of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">How Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme may help vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin.</note> to commit sin: we ought to fight against sin by this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>weapon</hi> of our Baptisme, and so we may do by diuers Arguments: As</p>
                  <p>First, in my Baptisme I haue made a vow to God, that I would cleaue to him in Iesus Christ, and renounce the world, the diuell, and sinne: and shall I breake my vow to God, that would be ashamed to breake my promise to men?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, my Baptisme was the <hi>Baptisme of repentance:</hi> and shall I yet liue in sinne? My body was washed: and shall my soule
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:21209:286"/>
be still impure? <hi>Mat. 3. 11. Mark. 1. 4. Acts</hi> 13. 24.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by Baptisme I was assured of the <hi>vertue of the death of Christ</hi> to kill sinne in me: and shall I not beleeue the <hi>operation of God,</hi> that he can deliuer mee from the powerfull temptations, or inclinations to any sinne? Shall I not seeke strength of Christ? or shall I betray my selfe to the diuell and the flesh? In Christ <hi>I am dead to sinne, and shall I yet liue therein?</hi> Rom. 6. 1, 3. Col. 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our Baptisme must bee vsed against the doubts of perseuering, or whether we shall be kept vnto saluation, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our body shall be raised againe at the last day: for God hath assured all this vnto vs in our Baptisme, that we haue our part not onely in the death of Christ, but also in the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ: and if Christ be raised in vs, <hi>Christ can dye no

consider, I say, thine owne <hi>strength,</hi> whether thou be able to doe it: and consider also the <hi>end,</hi> that it be to Gods glory: and consider the <hi>matter,</hi> that thou vow not things vnlawfull: and consider what may be the <hi>euents</hi> of thy vow, for all vowes being made <hi>before the Angell</hi> that takes notice of all couenants, it will be in vaine afterwards to pleade; It was an errour, thou wast mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: <hi>God may bee angry at thy voice, and destroy the worke of thy hands:</hi> Be not <hi>rash therefore, to cause thy flesh to sinne</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when thou hast vowed thy vow to God, <hi>deferre not to pay it;</hi> be sure thou performe it: it is a grieuous offence to breake a lawfull vow: <hi>Better it is thou shouldest not vow, then that thou shouldest vow, and not pay.</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, that thou <hi>sweare in righteousnesse,</hi> that is, about law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, and iust matters: Thou must not sweare to doe vniust things, as <hi>Dauid</hi> sware to kill <hi>Nabal:</hi> nor must thou sweare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout impossible things, or about things that are doubtfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, nor in the forme of thy oath must thou vse such words, as bee contumelious to God, or expresse not sufficient reuerence to the Diuine Maiesty,

                  <p>The former rule concernes onely the ceremony, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward exercise of the body: but this rule containes the substance of the dutie, without which a religious Fast is not kept vnto God; who regardeth not <hi>the hanging downe of the head like a bull-rush, if the soule be not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before God</hi> for sinne: <hi>Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus 16. 29.

                     <p>Rules about the Sabbath.</p>

                  <p>HItherto of the Rules that concerne <hi>the parts of Gods worship:</hi> The rules that concerne <hi>the time of Gods worship,</hi> follow: and this time especially is the Sabbath Day.</p>
                  <p>Now the rules that binde vs <note place="margin">Rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sabbath.</note> to the good behauiour concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sabbath, concerne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the preparation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or the manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming holy duties on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
                  <p>The preparation to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <note place="margin">1. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to it.</note> containes in it these things.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>the ending of all our works</hi> on the sixe dayes, as God did his, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>This example of God is set downe, not onely to shew what he did, but to prescribe vnto vs,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:21209:296"/>
what we should doe, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by vrging this example in the reason of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We must then take order to finish the works of the weeke dayes with such discretion, that neither our heads bee troubled with the cares of them, nor our hands tempted to worke about them on the Sabbath Day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the preuenting of domesticall grieuances, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. 3. Ye <hi>shall feare euery man his mother and his father, and keepe my Sabbath.</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and contentions, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings in the members of the family, extend their infection and hurt, euen to the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods Sabbath. The Lord lookes not to be serued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in <hi>his house,</hi> if people liue not quietly, and louingly, and dutifully in their owne houses.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must <hi>cleanse our selues, that wee keepe the Sabbath,</hi> Nehemiah 13. 22. Which place,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:21209:297"/>
though it speake of Legall clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, yet it shadowes out that Morall and perpetuall care of cleasing our selues, that ought euen to be found in vs. And thus we do cleanse our selues, when <hi>we humble our selues, that we may walke with God,</hi> confessing our sinnes, euen the sinnes of the weeke past, and making our peace with God, through the name of Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the duties of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <note place="margin">2. Of the celebration of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> Now for the manner of keeping the Sabbath, the rules prescribe vnto vs these things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Rest from all your works,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>works of labour,</hi> or workes <hi>of pleasure.</hi> Works of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the Scripture instanceth in such, as are <hi>selling of victuals. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah 13. 15. Carrying of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> Ier. 17. <hi>Iourneying from our places, Exod.</hi> 16. 29. the businesse of our callings done by our selues, our children, seruants; or cattell, which the words of the
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:21209:297"/>
Commandement forbid? And as workes of labour, so also <hi>workes of pleasure</hi> are forbidden, <hi>Esay</hi> 58. 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Readinesse and delight.</hi> We should <hi>loue to be Gods seruants</hi> on this day, <hi>Esay 56. and consecrate it with ioy, as a glorious</hi> priuiledge to vs, <hi>Esay</hi> 58. 13. abhorring wearinesse, or a desire to haue the Sabbath gone, and ended, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Care and watchfulnesse.</hi> We must <hi>obserue to keepe it, Exod.</hi> 31. 16. wee must <hi>take heed to our selues,</hi> that no duty bee omitted, and that wee no way prophane it, attending our hearts, and our words, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 21.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Sinceritie:</hi> and this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie wee should shew diuers wayes.</p>
                  <p>First, by doing Gods worke with as much care as we would do our owne; or rather shewing more care for the seruice of God. They had their double sacrifices
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:21209:298"/>
on the Sabbath, in the time of the Law; and we should studie, how wee might please God in especiall manner on that day, choosing out the things that might delight him. God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but one day of seuen for his worke; and shall wee not doe it willingly? Further, if we respect our selues, shall wee not bee as carefull to prouide for our soules on the Sabbath, as for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies on the weeke dayes?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By <hi>obseruing the whole day,</hi> as well as a part, and keepe the Sabbath <hi>in our dwellings,</hi> as well as in Gods house: God requires the whole day, and not a part. As wee would be contented our seruants should worke for vs onely an houre or two in the sixe daies: so neither should we yeeld lesse vnto God, then we require for our selues. Nor will it suffice to serue God by publike duties in his House, vnlesse we serue him also by priuate duties in our
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:21209:298"/>
owne dwellings, Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 4. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23. 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By auoiding the lesser vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Sabbath, as well as the greater, especially not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing of contempt, or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the least things we know to bee forbidden. The Prophet instanceth, <hi>Esay 58. 13. We must not speake our owne words.</hi> Thus of sincerity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth thing required of vs, is <hi>Faith:</hi> wee must glorifie God by beleeuing, that he will make it a day of blessing vnto vs, and performe that blessing he hath promised, accepting our desire to walke before him in the vprightnesse of our hearts, and passing by our infirmities, and frailties. Wee many times di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe the rest and Sabbath of our soules by vnbeleefe, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement 4. <hi>Gen. 2. 2. Exo. 31. 13. Ezech.</hi> 20. 20. &amp; 46. 2, 5.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The last thing is <hi>Deprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> we must beseech God, when
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:21209:299"/>
we haue done our best, to shew vs mercie, and spare vs for our defects and weakenesses. Thus we must end the day and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise our selues to God, that the Rest of Iesus Christ may bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished in our hearts, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 13. 22.

                  <p>First, we must neuer in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <hi>iustifie the wicked, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the righteous;</hi> all excesse in words is euill, but this is <hi>an abomination to the Lord:</hi> We must euer <hi>honour those that feare the Lord;</hi> and as for <hi>vile persons, they are to be contemned, Psal. 15. 4.

                  <p>Thirdly, thou must not <hi>walke about with tales;</hi> take heede of tale-bearing: <hi>He goeth about as a slanderer that reuealeth a secret,</hi> though it bee true hee speaketh.

                  <p>Wee must carry our selues humbly, discreetly, and honestly in our conuersation with others: so shall wee conuerse with much amiablenesse and reputation.</p>
                  <p>First, vnto the humility of <note place="margin">An humble behauiour hath three things in it.</note> our conuersation, belong these Rules.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>be soft, shew all meekenesse to all men,</hi> restraining the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <note place="margin">1.</note> of thy heart, endeuouring to shew thy selfe <hi>gentle,</hi> and <hi>peaceable,</hi> and <hi>harmelesse,</hi> and <hi>easie to be intreated, Tit. 3. 1, 2. Prou. 8. 13. Iam.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou must <hi>bow downe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>thine care, and heare the words of the wise,</hi> and apply thy heart, to get knowledge, and profit thy selfe by others, <hi>Prou.</hi> 23. 12. This is the same with that of <hi>Iames, Be swift to heare, and slow to speake, Iam.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, put not forth thy <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="576" facs="tcp:21209:304"/>
selfe, nor stand in the place of great men, till thou bee called, <hi>Prou.</hi> 25. 6.</p>
                  <p>In generall, concerning hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, the Apostle <hi>Peters</hi> phrase is much to be noted: he saith, we should <hi>clothe our selues with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie:</hi> which notes both the great measure of it, it should couer all our actions, and also the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it. When we goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, we should stirre vp our hearts, and fashion our selues to expresse his grace, and not dare to be seene without humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, <note place="margin">Note</note> no more then wee would be seene without our clothes. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie hides our nakednesse, and pride and passion lay it open to the view and contempt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, neither is humility all that is required to make our <note place="margin">8 Rules that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in our beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</note> conuersation without offence or prouocation; but wee must also carry our selues discreetly; and to this end there are these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:21209:304"/>
Rules.</p>
                  <p>First, thou must consider <hi>to speake what is acceptable,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid what may irritate; there is singular vse of this rule, if it were followed, <hi>Prou</hi> 10. 31, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. and 13. 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou must <hi>marke those that cause diuision and off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and auoide them,</hi> and shun the society of such, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17, 18. This will breed thee much peace, and deliuer thee from much sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition in others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou must <hi>make no friendship with the angry man;</hi> for either by much conuersing with him, thou maist learne his waies, or else it will be a snare to thee, that thou shalt neither know how to keepe his fauour, nor yet how to breake off from him, without much vnrest and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, <hi>Prou.</hi> 22. 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is a great discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in euill time to bee silent.</hi> In things wherein thou mayest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:21209:305"/>
thy selfe, and not profit others, it is thy best way, and a wise course, to forbeare speech of such things, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 13.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, so likewise it is thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in matters of dangers to <hi>forbeare the communicating of thy secret to any,</hi> though thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test be tempted to a perswasion of trust in those to whom thou wouldest reueale them. It may often repent thee to haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but seldome to haue held thy peace, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7. 5.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>withdraw thy feet from thy neighbours house, lest he be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of thee, and hate thee:</hi> this is an excellent rule giuen by <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Prou.</hi> 25. 17. If thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest conuerse with reputation, take heed of idle gadding from house to house, when thou hast no occasion or employment: thou mayest draw hereby much secret contempt and loathing of thee, when thy emptinesse and vanity shall be thereby discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:21209:305"/>
An empty conuersation, that hath in it no exercise of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie or vertue, if it bee frequent, occasioneth secret, and vnutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable scorne.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Restraine thine owne passions</hi> in conuersing. There are none so wise, but if they shew their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of immoderate anger, feare, griefe, yea, or ioy, they discouer much weaknes in their disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which would bee couered if they did bridle the excesse of their passions. <hi>A wise man coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth shame, when a foole is presently knowne:</hi> It is the best praise not to haue such weaknesses; but the next to this, is by discretion to bridle our selues, so as we may hide our weaknesses from brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, thou maist make good vse of that direction of <hi>Salomon</hi> about thy friend, <hi>Blesse not thy friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning; for it may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a curse to thee:</hi> Take heede
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:21209:306"/>
of flattery, which in stead of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting thine owne ends, may bring thee out of all respect. He doth not forbid the iust praise, and encouragement of friends, but the intending of praise of purpose to the vttermost notice of thy friend, (this is to praise him with a loud voice) and the affectation of preuenting others in praising; and of doing it in such things as are not yet su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently knowne to be praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and to set ones selfe so to praise, as if he studied to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but humour his friend; especially if it be but once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that thou doest it but for thy owne ends. It is a great part of wisedome, to know how to speake of the praise of others, so as neither sinister ends be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor the humouring of those we praise: to doe it sparingly and seasonably, is a great discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And thus of the Rules, that
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:21209:306"/>
make our conuersation amiable, in respect of discretion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that our conuersation <note place="margin">Three rules that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the purity of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation.</note> may not be hurtfull &amp; offensiue, we must looke to the <hi>purity</hi> of it: and so these rules following are of singular vse.</p>
                  <p>First, in generall, <hi>Refraine thy tongue from euill, and thy lips that they speake no guile,</hi> Psal. 34. 13. For <hi>he that keepeth his mouth, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his soule,</hi> Prou. 21. 23. Take heed of the vsuall vices of the tongue: for <hi>thereout may come much mischiefe,</hi> and discontent to thy selfe and others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in particular looke to thy selfe carefully, that thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide those three euils mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apostle, <hi>Ephes. 5. 4. viz. filthy speaking, foolish talking and iesting.</hi> By iesting he meanes those biting iests, that vnder pretence of shewing wittines, or conceit, doe secretly leaue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace vpon the persons whom they concerne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="582" facs="tcp:21209:307"/>
Thirdly, auoid with detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>the excesse in drinking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling,</hi> and suffer thy selfe vpon no pretence, to bee drawne to giue way to thine owne practice in them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3.</p>

vp to mercie, 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 8. 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By our <hi>penitencie,</hi> when we goe to God, after we haue done our best, and confesse the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that cleaues vnto vs, euen when we haue shewed our best desires to communicate to others; and withall striuing to <hi>plow vp the fallow ground of our</hi> hard <hi>hearts,</hi> that wee may bee more fit to expresse the <hi>bowels of mercie,</hi> Hos. 10. 12.</p>

                  <p>Thus of the Humilitie to bee shewed in doing works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
                  <p>A fifth thing required in shewing mercie, is <hi>Faith;</hi> and <note place="margin">5. Faith in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</note> faith is needfull in two respects.</p>

<pb n="588" facs="tcp:21209:310"/>
of the mercy shewed. For a godly Christian, that is not vaine-glorious, hath so meane an opinion of his best workes, that hee finds neede to flie to Gods promises, and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Secondly, to <hi>beleeue the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> and reward from God, and that wee shall not lose by what is so expended. Though the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to whom we shew mercie, should be so vngratefull, that it were <hi>as bread cast on the waters:</hi> yet we ought to beleeue, that our seed cast on the waters, shall bring vs a plentifull haruest, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 1.

Christian to think that to be lost that is giuen to the poor. Nature may disappoint the hope of the Husbandman, but in workes of mercy, there is no venture, but a sure increase from the Lord, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9, 10. and therefore our faith should make vs <hi>get bags</hi> to put vp the certaine treasure wee shall gaine by mercy from the Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 33.</p>

                  <p>First, by distributing our almes in the fittest course wee can, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a principall respect <hi>to godly poore. He that sheweth mercy, ought to haue a good eye,</hi> Prouerbs, 22. 9.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, by taking heede, that wee spend not vpon the rich by needlesse entertainments, what

                  <p>HItherto of the Rules that concerne all men: now the particular rules direct our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage either towards wicked men, or towards godly men.</p>
                  <p>Our conuersation towards wicked men may bee ordered by these rules:</p>
                  <p>First, we must <hi>auoid all needlesse societie with them,</hi> and shunne
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:21209:312"/>
their infectious fellowship, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">Needlesse socretie with them must bee auoyded.</note> wee must take heed of any speciall familiarity with them, or <hi>vnequall yoaking</hi> our selues with them, by marriage, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or leagues of amitie, <hi>Psalme 1. 1. 1 Cor. 6. 17. Ephes. 5. 7, 11. Prou.</hi> 23. 20. &amp; 4. 14, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when wee haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion <note place="margin">Great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in conuersing with them.</note> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerse with them, we must studie how to <hi>walke wisely towards</hi> them, so as we may be so farre from giuing scandall, as, if it be possible, wee may winne them to glorifie God and his truth in our profession. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much skill to order our selues aright in those things that are to be done in the presence of wicked men, or in such things as must come by report vnto them, and their scanning. Now there are diuers things of admirable <note place="margin">Diuers things that affect the hearts euen of the worst men, are:</note> vse in our carriage to put them to silence, and to take them in their consciences, at least to thinke well of vs: Such as are:</p>

                     <pb n="594" facs="tcp:21209:313"/>
2. <hi>Mortification.</hi> A sound care <note place="margin">1. A morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied life.</note> to reforme our wayes, and true hatred and griefe for our owne sinnes, will cause many times wicked wretches to say of vs, that wee are the people of the Lord, Esay 61. 3, 8. I say, <hi>a sound care of reformation;</hi> for to professe a mortified life, and yet in any thing to shew that we can liue in any fault without repentance, this prouokes them exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to speake euill of the good way of God. Therefore the first care of a Christian, that would be rightly ordered toward wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n, must be to liue <hi>without offence,</hi> and to discouer a true mortified minde, and an heart broken for sinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to speake <hi>with all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend speech of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                     <hi>reuerence and feare,</hi> when we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of matters of Religion, much amazeth the prophane conscience of a wicked man; whereas cursorie discourses of such grand mysteries, &amp; emptie
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:21209:313"/>
and vaine ianglings doe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly occasion a confirmed wilfulnesse and prophanenesse in such men, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. and <hi>Prou.</hi> 24. 26.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a most winning <note place="margin">3. Meekenes of wisdome</note> qualitie in all our carriage, to <hi>shew meekenesse of wisedome,</hi> to expresse a mind well gouerned, free from passions, and also from concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse, frowardnesse, affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the vaine shew of what wee haue not in substance. For each of these haue in them singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar matter of irritation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke wicked men to scorne, and hatred, and reuiling.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is an holy kind of <hi>Reseruednesse,</hi> which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the life of a Christian, in his carriage among wicked men: and this Reseruednesse is to be shewed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In <hi>not trusting our selues too</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uednesse in foure things.</note> 
                     <hi>farre with them,</hi> not <hi>beleeuing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery word,</hi> not bearing our selues vpon euery shew of fauour from
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:21209:314"/>
them. For as too much suspition of them breeds extreme alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if they perceiue it; so cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie is no safe way, <hi>Prou. 14. 15. Ioh.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By abstaining from <hi>iudging of them that are without.</hi> It is a most intemperate zeale, that spends it selfe in the vaine and bootlesse censure of the estate of those that are without. Those censures haue in them matter of prouocation and nothing of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. It were happy for some Christians, if they could with the Apostle, say often to their owne soules, <hi>What haue I to doe to iudge them that are without?</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By <hi>studying to be quiet, and meddle with our owne businesse;</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting about, how to cut off all occasions, by which we might bee tangled with any discord or contention, or much businesse with them. It is a godly <hi>ambition</hi> to thirst after this quietnesse of

life, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By <hi>our silence in euill times;</hi> alwayes auoyding all such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, as might bring vs into danger, without any calling for our owne edification, or the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of others. Many a man hath smarted sorely for want of this bridle for his tongue, when his words could doe no good to others, and much hurt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Amos 5. 13. Dauid</hi> held his peace while the wicked were present, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In forbearing to reprooue scorners, <hi>Prou.</hi> 9. 7, 8. and 23. 9.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In <hi>seasoning their words with salt,</hi> so as they discouer no vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, lightnesse, vainglory, malice, or desire of reuenge, or the like faults in their speeches.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In <hi>answering the foole, but not according to his follie,</hi> that is, not in such pride, passion, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiling fashion as the foole obiects in, <hi>Prou.</hi> 26. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In getting out of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,

when wee <hi>perceiue not in them the words of wisedome.</hi> If wee see they grow once to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, outragious, or wilfull in any notorious offence of words or workes, we must get from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the eight wayes wherein we should shew reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uednesse: they are of excellent vse, if men would studie them, and practise them.</p>

bee doing good to others, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly darkened in the glory of it, and many times extremely ill spoken of. A true Christian should hold it a great disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that any Papist, or carnall man in the world (in equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison) should put them downe for either the tendernesse or the abundance of workes of mercie, 1 <hi>Peter 1. 12.

                     </gap>ruile feares or flattery. To giue place to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men in Gods cause, or to feare their faces in the quarrell of Religion, or to shew a minde that would repent of wel-doing, or that basely would stoupe some way to honour vngodly persons for our owne ends, is so farre from gaining true fauour with euill-minded men, that it

makes them to scorne and hate vs and Religion so much the more: whereas a godly man, that is vnmoucable, and refuseth to <hi>praise the wicked, or iustifie the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly;</hi> and when he hath cause, <hi>will contend with them,</hi> as <hi>Salomons</hi> Phrase is, and not be like <hi>a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled fountaine, or acorrupt spring:</hi> hee may for the time receiue ill words from the wicked, but his heart is afraid of him, and his conscience doth admire him, <hi>Prou.</hi> 24. 25. and 28. 4. and 25. 26 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22.</p>

                  <p>THus of our carriage towards the wicked. How we should carry our selues toward the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, followeth to bee considered of.</p>
                  <p>The summe of all is, that we must <hi>walke in loue.</hi> If wee can soundly discharge our duty to the godly, in respect of louing them vnfainedly, and heartily, and constantly, we performe all
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:21209:317"/>
that is required of vs toward them. And this loue to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is so necessary, as that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon vs, as the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement giuen by Christ, who in one word tels vs the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of our duties, <hi>Ioh. 13. 34. Eph. 5. 2. 1 Pet. 2. 7. 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 14.</p>
                  <p>Now the rules which in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular bind vs to the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour in respect of our loue to the godly, concerne either <hi>the manifestation of our ioue to them;</hi> or the <hi>preseruation of our leue to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must shew our loue to <note place="margin">Sixe waies of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing our loue to the godly. 1 By cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie.</note> the godly diuers wayes:</p>
                  <p>First, by <hi>courtesie</hi> and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards them, and that in a speciall manner, being affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned towards them <hi>with a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue</hi> and kindnesse. No bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in nature should shew more kindnesse one to another, then Christians should, <hi>Eph. 4. 32. Rom.</hi> 12. 10.</p>

                     <pb n="605" facs="tcp:21209:317"/>
Secondly, by <hi>receiuing</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining them: we must <hi>receiue</hi>

                     <hi>one another,</hi> and be <hi>barbarous one to another;</hi> and this with entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of affection Negatiuely, it must be <hi>without grudging, 1. Pet.</hi> 4. 9. Affirmatiuely, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue one another, as <hi>Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vs into glory,</hi> that is, First, <hi>without respect of desert;</hi> We haue done nothing to deserue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; yet Christ hath receiued vs to glory: So, though the godly haue not pleasured vs any way greatly, yet because they are the children of God, wee should make much of them, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them gladly. Secondly, <hi>not thinking any thing too deare for them:</hi> Christ hath not ennied vs the very glory of heauen, and therefore what can we doe to the brethren, that should answer the example of Christ? <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by <hi>bearing their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi> for so we should <hi>fulfill the</hi>

<pb n="604" facs="tcp:21209:318"/>
are two sorts of <hi>burthens</hi> presse the godly: One <hi>inward,</hi> such as are temptations, and their owne corruptions; the other <hi>outward,</hi> such as are afflictions of all sorts. Now in both these, this rule holds; for when we see a godly Christian mourne and lament his distresse in respect of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is not to make our selues guilty of their sinnes, but to helpe them out of their griefe by consolation, out of their sin by direction. Note, <note place="margin">Note.</note> that this is charged vpon vs, when sinne is a burthen to them, not before; for till then wee are rather to reprooue them, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish them: But then we are to ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="605" facs="tcp:21209:318"/>
are weary of them, and sorry for them. And thus also in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward burthens wee must beare them, by comforting them, and aduising them, and helping them, and shewing our affection to them, as if it were our owne case, so farre as we haue a calling, and power to helpe them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by <hi>considering one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi>

                  <p>First, we must striue <hi>to be like minded</hi> in matters of opinion; many discords or abatements of affection grow among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for their offences of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in diuers things. It is true, that difference of <hi>Iudgement</hi> should not cause difference in <hi>affection:</hi> If we cannot be of <hi>one
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:21209:320"/>
minde,</hi> yet we should be of <hi>one heart:</hi> yet we see the contrary, and therefore euery Christian should make conscience of it, to be so wary and so humble in his opinions, especially in things doubtfull, or not so necessary, as to take heed of admitting what might shew dissent from the godly; or if he must needs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet to be very wary how he discouer it to the vexation or entanglement of others. Now because this is very hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade Christians vnto; marke how vehemently the Apostle speaks of it, Rom. 15. 5, 6. <hi>Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to bee like minded, that ye may with one mouth and one mind glorifie God.</hi> Wee must learne of the Apostle to pray <hi>feruently</hi> for this, that our natures, and the natures of others, with whom we conuerse, may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereunto: and, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. 10. the Apostle adi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

doth worke not onely compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but great increase of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in others towards vs: For acknowledgement preuents their secret loathing of vs for such frailties if they should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them.

                  <p>For the first, those that are fallen, are either fallen <hi>from God,</hi> or fallen <hi>from thee.</hi> Such as are fallen <hi>from God,</hi> are either fallen <hi>grosly</hi> and of habit, or by <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and suddenly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those that are fallen grosly, are either guilty of <hi>soule vices,</hi> or else of <hi>extreme omissions,</hi> such as that which the Apostle instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in, of <hi>idlenesse,</hi> and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall neglect of their callings.</p>
                  <p>Now towards both these, thou <note place="margin">How we must carry our selues towards such as are fallen from God.</note> must be thus ordered.</p>
                  <p>First, warne them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and <hi>reprooue them</hi> sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 14.</p>

                  <p>Now if they be fallen by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, either they are likely to offend againe, or not.

                     <hi>from thee,</hi> by trespassing against thee, thou must obserue these rules of carriage towards them.</p>
                  <p>First, in slighter wrongs <hi>do all things without reasonings or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings:</hi> either speake not of it, or so, as thou shew no repining or vexation about it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in great wrongs,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:21209:326"/>
thou must doe two things:</p>
                  <p>First, obserue the method of our Sauiour Christ: when the trespasse is secret, go and <hi>tell him of it betweene thee and him:</hi> if hee mend not, then <hi>take two or three</hi> other discreete godly persons with thee, and tell him of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If he yet mend not, then divulge it, and acquaint the Church with it; either seeke a publike sentence vpon him from authority, or acquaint the godly generally with it. And if these courses will not amend him, then abandon his society, as if hee were an Heathen or a Publican, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if by any of these courses <hi>he repent, forgiue him;</hi> yea, and that as often as he saith, <hi>it repenteth him,</hi> if hee should doe thee many iniuries, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 3, 4.</p>

                     </gap>ur repentance, 3. or our hope.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The rules that concerne our Faith (supposing the Christian to be informed in the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the former Treatises) are onely these two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="626" facs="tcp:21209:329"/>
First, thou must be expert in <hi>the Catalogue of Promises, that concerne infirmities,</hi> mentioned in the third Treatise. For those will preserue thy faith in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, against the daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of frailtie and infirmitie in thy selfe. For thou maist by them see, that thou hast no reason to doubt of the continuance of Gods loue to thee, onely because of thy many weaknesses. For in those promises, he hath and doth declare, how graciously he is inclined to his seruants, and passeth by their frailtie, and ac cepteth their desires and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, &amp;c. This rule will proue a maine support of the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy life: and therefore let not Satan make thee either despise, or neglect it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou shalt doe well to establish thy iudgement par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the doctrine <hi>of the Principles,</hi> expressed in the fifth Treatise; and by sound learning
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:21209:329"/>
of them settle thy self, so as thou be no more <hi>carried about with the wind of any contrary doctrine.</hi> It should be the labour and care of all good Christians to keepe the patterne of wholesome words, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <note place="margin">2 About thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning thy repentance, as now it is to bee vrged vpon thee after thy assurance, one rule is of singular vse, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the <hi>Catalogue of present sinnes.</hi> By the directions in the first Treatise, I suppose thou hast deliuered thy selfe from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of sinnes, so as the most of those euils mentioned in the first and great Catalogue, are shaken off, neuer to bee committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and so thou hast no more to do about them, but giue God thanks for thy deliuerance from them through Iesus Christ. Now because after thy first repentance there will remaine some corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which as yet are not roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out; thy course for thy whole
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:21209:330"/>
life, for these remainders of sin, would be this: Make thee a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of thy present sins, euen of such euils as thou findest thy selfe yet daily prone vnto. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy selfe seriously to this end: it may be thou wilt finde 6. or 8. or 10. or more, or fewer euils, which yet hang vpon thy nature and life. Thy course for the vse of this catalogue may be this: I suppose thou art instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so farre, as to know the profit of daily calling vpon God: Now whereas in prayer thou dost, or oughtest to make confession of thy sins, in stead of a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall confession, vse still thy Catalogue, that is, labour euery day to iudge thy selfe distinctly for those sins that doe presently annoy thee: Hold on this course constantly, till thou hast gotten power against al, or any of them, &amp; as thou findest vertue against any of them, so alter thy Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, giuing thankes for the
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:21209:330"/>
sinnes thou gettest head against, and putting them out of thy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue. The paines is little, it is once done for a long time, and thy memory will easily carry thy speciall present faults. Besides, this distinct daily remembrance of thy present sinnes, will make thee more watchfull against those sins; and thou maiest once a yeere, or once a quarter, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery communion, examine thy selfe anew, and mend thy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, by putting in any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which thou discouerest then, or at any time, to arise anew in thee, and putting out such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils as by prayer thou hast got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten victory against. Thus maiest thou see the state of thy soule di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly all the dayes of thy life, discerning when thou goest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward. Besides, this course of daily iudging thy selfe, keepes thee out of the danger of any wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>Concerning thy hope, there <note place="margin">3 About thy hope.</note>

                  <p>First, pray constantly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, for the <hi>knowledge of the great glory</hi> is prouided for thee. Thou must forme the admiration of heauen in thee, by prayer: for naturally it is not in vs, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 18, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou must <hi>vse all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to perfect thy assurance of heauen,</hi> when thou diest, Heb. 6. 12. 1. Pet. 1. 13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou must striue to accustome thy thoughts to the daily <hi>contemplation of heauen,</hi> that thy <hi>conuersation may be in heauen,</hi> Phil. 3. 20.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, thou must striue to direct thy heart, and enable thy selfe to the <hi>expectation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Iesus Christ;</hi> thou must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that skill distinctly, to be able to <hi>waite for the comming of Iesus Christ,</hi> and to shew that thou louest his appearing, 1.

                  <p>Fourthly, thou must be sure to shew thy <hi>trust in God, and cast thy burthen on the Lord,</hi> Iam. 5. 7, 8. Nahum 1. 7. Psal. 27. <hi>vlt.</hi> &amp; 37. 7. &amp; 55. 22.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THat which I intend in this <note place="margin">The drift of the whole Treatise.</note> Treatise, is to shew how a godly man might order himselfe against the feare of Death; or what course hee should take to liue so, as not to be <hi>afraid to die.</hi> This is a maine point, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding necessary.

not feare death. As death is the last enemy, so it workes the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest and last feares: and to dye happily, is to dye willingly. The maine worke of preparation is effected, when our hearts are perswaded to be willing to dye.</p>
                     <p>Now in the explication of this <note place="margin">The parts of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</note> point, I would distinctly handle three things.</p>
                     <p>First, I will proue, that to liue without feare of death, is a thing <hi>may bee obtained;</hi> one may be deliuered from it as certainly, as a sicke man may be cured of an ordinary disease.</p>

                        </gap>condly, I will shew, <hi>how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely a thing it is for a Christian to be afraid of death:</hi> that so wee may be stirred vp the more to seeke the cure for this disease.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I will shew <hi>by what m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>Prouing, that we may be cured of the feare of Death.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr the first: That the feare of <note place="margin">Eight ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prooue we may be helped against the feare of death. Christ died to this end</note> death may be remoued: and that we may attaine to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, to be willing to dye, without lothnesse, is apparent diuers wayes.</p>
                     <p>First, it is euident, <hi>Christ dyed to deliuer vs,</hi> not onely from <hi>the hurt</hi> of death, and from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, as the executioner; but also from <hi>the feare</hi> of death too. Now Christ may attaine to the end of his death, vnlesse we will deny the vertue of Christ, and his death, and thinke that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, it cannot be obtained, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. And the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in this, because in that place he shews, that there is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the death of Christ, to cure this feare of death in any of the Elect, if they wil vse the meanes:
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:21209:344"/>
For as our sins will not be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, though there be power in the death of Christ to kill them, vnlesse we vse the meanes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this vertue out of the death of Christ, so is it true, that the feare of death may be in some of Gods elect: but it is not because Christ cannot deliuer them; but because they are sluggish, and will not take the course to bee rid of those feares. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician is able to cure them, and vsually doth cure the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; but they will not take his Receipts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Apostle intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the desire of death, saith, <note place="margin">2. It was intended in our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note> 
                        <hi>That God hath wrought vs vnto the selfe same thing, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 5. We are againe created of God, that we might in our selues as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire vnto immortality; and are set in such an estate, as if we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the end of his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, we should neuer be well, till we be possessed of the happinesse
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:21209:344"/>
in another world: which hee shewes in those words of <hi>being absent from the body, and present with the Lord,</hi> verse 8.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the prophesies haue runne on this point. For it was <note place="margin">3 This cure hath bin foretold.</note> long since fore-told, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians knowing the victory of Christ ouer death, should bee so farre from fearing death, that they should tread vpon him, and insult ouer him: <hi>O death, where is thy sting? &amp;c. Esay 25. 8. Hosea 13. 14. 2 Corinthians</hi> 15. 54, 55.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it is a condition that Christ puts in, when he first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits <note place="margin">4 We were bound to it when we were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be Christs Disciples.</note> Disciples, that they must deny their owne liues: and not only be content to take vp their crosse in other things, but their liues must not bee deare vnto them, when he calls for it, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, We are taught in the <note place="margin">5 It is taught in the Lords Prayer.</note> Lords Prayer, to pray, <hi>That Gods kingdome may come:</hi> And by this
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:21209:345"/>
kingdome, he meanes the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Glory, as well as the kingdome of Grace. Now, in that wee are taught to pray for the kingdome, it shewes, wee should desire it, and that by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we should be more and more heated in our desires.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, wee <hi>are borne againe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Liuely hope doth include it.</note> 
                        <hi>to a liuely hope of our inheritance.</hi> Now if we be afraid of the time of our translation thither, how doe we hope for it after a liuely manner? A desire of going to heauen is a part of that <hi>Seed</hi> cast into our hearts in our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, we haue the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Examples of such as haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it.</note> of diuers men in particular, who haue desired to die, &amp; were out of feare in that respect: <hi>Gen. 49. 18.

And the Prophet in the name of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, said long before Christ: <hi>O that the saluation of Israel were come out of Sion!</hi> Psalme 14. 7. And we haue the example of the Martyrs in all ages, that accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it a singular glory to die: And in 2.

                     <p>Lastly, not onely some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular godly men haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">8.

                     <p n="1">1. By the feare of death we shame our Religion; while we professe it in our words, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it in our workes. Let <hi>Papists</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Wee shame our religion.</note> tremble at death, who are taught, that no man ordinarily can be sure he shall go to heauen when he dies. But for vs, that professe the knowledge of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, to bee astonished at the passage to it, shewes (at least) a great weakenesse of faith, and doth outwardly giue occasion of disgrace to

                     <p n="2">2. By that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we may see how vncomely it is to be afraid of death: For thereby we disable the death of Christ: wee frustrate the end of Gods workemanship: we stop the execution of the Prophesies: we renounce our first agreement with Christ: we mocke God in praying that his kingdome may come: we obscure the euidence of our owne regeneration; and wee transgresse against the example of the godly in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>

<pb n="694" facs="tcp:21209:363"/>
while wee liue here.</p>
                     <p>The first is, the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God; while <hi>the body is present, the Lord is absent,</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 8. And is not this enough to make vs loath life? Shall we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>asse, then our glorious God, whose onely presence in glory shall fill vs with eternall delight? O <hi>the vision of God!</hi> If we had but once seene God face to face, we would abhorre that absence that should hinder the fruition of such vnspeakable beauties, as would enamour the most secure heart to an vnquenchable loue.</p>

Who would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from <hi>the congregation of the first borne, from the societie with

                     <p>Thirdly, in this world we want <note place="margin">3 The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his nature.</note> the perfection of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: we are but maimed &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed creatures here; we shall neuer haue the sound vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of men in vs, till we bee in heauen; our holinesse of nature and gifts will neuer be consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, till we be dead.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THere are in the minds of all men certaine <hi>Obiections,</hi> which if they could be remoued, this feare of Death would bee stocked vp by the very rootes. I will instance in some of the chiefe of them, and set downe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to them.</p>
                     <p>Some men say, they should not <note place="margin">Ob. 1.</note> be afraid of death, considering the gaine of it, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse after death, but that they are afraide of the <hi>paine</hi> of dying:
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:21209:381"/>
It is the difficulty of the passage troubles them.</p>
                     <p>For answer hereunto, diuers things would be considered of, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> to shew men the folly of this feare.</p>
                     <p>First, thou likest not death, <note place="margin">Teareasons to shew the folly of men, in pretending the feare of the paine of death.</note> because of the paine of it. Why? there is paine in the curing of a wound, yet men will endure it: And shall death doe so great a cure, as to make thee whole of all thy wounds and diseases, and art thou so loth to come to the Cure?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is difficulty in getting into an Hauen. Hadst thou rather bee in the tempest still, then put into the hauen?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, thou likest not death, thou sayest, for the paine of it: Why then likest thou life, which puts thee to worse paine? Men obiect not at the paines of life, which they endure without death. There is almost no man, but he hath endured worse
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:21209:381"/>
paines in life, then he can endure in death, and yet we are content to loue life still: Yea, such is our folly, that whereas in some pains of life we call for death to come to our succours; yet when wee are well againe, we loue life, and loath death.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we are are manifestly mistaken concerning death; for <note place="margin">4.</note> the last gaspe is not death. To liue, is to dye; for how much wee liue, so much we die: euery step of life, is a step of death. He that hath liued halfe his dayes, is dead the halfe of himselfe. Death gets first our infancie, then our youth, and so forwards: All that thou hast liued, is dead.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, it is further euident, <note place="margin">5.</note> that in death there is no paine; it is our life that goeth out, with paine. Wee deale herein, as if a man, after sicknesse, should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse his health of the last paines. What is it to be dead? but not to be in the world. And it is any
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:21209:382"/>
paine to bee out of the world? Were wee in any paine before we were borne? Why then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse we death, for the paines our life giues vs at the parting? Is not sleepe a remembrance of death?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, if our comming into the world be with teares; is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wonder, if our going out be so too?</p>

of the loue of this world. Wee must leaue the world before the world leaue vs, and learne that lesson heartily, <hi>To vse the world as if wee vsed it not.</hi> Neither ought this to seeme too hard a precept: for <hi>they that striue for masterie, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from all things, when it is but to obtaine a corruptible crowne;</hi> how much more should we be willing to deny the delights of this world, and striue with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures herein, seeing it is <hi>to obtaine an incorruptible crowne?</hi> 1. Cor. 9 24, 25.</p>
                     <p>VVe must learne of <hi>Moses,</hi> who brought himselfe to it willingly, <hi>to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

into as narrow a scantling as our callings will permit. Secondly, we should auoid, as much as may be, the societie with the fauorites and minions of the World: I meane such persons, as admire nothing but worldly things, and know no other happinesse then in this life; that speake onely of this World, and commend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what tends to the praise of worldly things, and so to the enticing of our hearts after the World: And withall, wee should sort our selues with such Christians, as practise this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, as well as praise it, and can by their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course make vs more in loue with heauen. Thirdly, we should daily obserue, to what things in the world our hearts must run, and striue with God by prayer to get downe the too much liking and desire after those things. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we should daily be pondering on these meditations, that shew
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:21209:397"/>
vs the vanitie of the world, and the vilenesse of the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Thus of the first medicine.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we must in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice soundly mortifie our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">2. The mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued sins.</note> sins: our sins must dye before we dye, or else it will not be well with vs. The <hi>sting of death is sin,</hi> and when we haue pull'd out the <hi>sting,</hi> we need not feare to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the <hi>Serpent</hi> into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. It is the loue of some sin, and delight in it, that makes a man afraid to dye; or it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of some foule euill past, which accuseth the hearts of men: and therefore men must make sure their repentance, and iudge themselues for their sins, and then they neede not feare Gods condemning of them. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aske me, how they may know when they haue attained to this rule; I answer, VVhen they haue so long confessed their sinnes in <note place="margin">How wee may know when sin is morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> secret to God, that now they can truely say, there is no sinne they
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:21209:397"/>
know by themselues, but they are as desirous to haue God giue them strength to leaue it, as they would haue God to shew them grace to forgiue it. Hee hath soundly repented of all sin, that desires from his heart to liue in no sin. And vnto this rule, I must adde the care of an vpright and vnrebukeable conuersation. It is a maruellous encouragement to dye with peace, when a man can liue without offence, and can iustly plead his integrity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation; as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 3. and <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. 26, 27. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Assurance</hi> is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <note place="margin">3. Assurance</note> medicine to kill this feare: And to speake distinctly, wee should get the assurance first of Gods fauour, and our owne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election; for <hi>hereby an entrance will bee ministred into the Heauenly Kingdome:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I handled this doctrine of the Christians assurance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:21209:398"/>
I meddled with this point of the Feare of Death. <hi>Simeon</hi> can dye willingly, when <hi>his eyes haue seene the saluation.</hi> Feare of death is alwayes ioyned with a weake faith; and the full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith, doth maruellously establish the heart against these feares, and breeds a certaine desire of the comming of Christ. <hi>Paul</hi> can be <hi>confident,</hi> when he is able to say, <hi>I know whom I haue beleeued, and that hee, is able to keepe that which I haue committed to him,</hi> 2. Tim. 12.</p>
                     <p>Besides, wee should labour to get a particular knowledge and assurance of our happinesse in death, and of our saluation: Wee would study to this end, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that shew our felicitie in death. And to this purpose, it is of excellent vse to receiue the Sacrament often: For Christ by his Will, beq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>eathed heauen to vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. and by the death of the Testator, this Will is of
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:21209:398"/>
force, and is further daily sealed vnto vs, as internally by the Spirit, so externally by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
                     <p>Now if wee get our Charter sealed and confirmed to vs, how can we be afraid of the time of possession? He is fearelesse of death, that can say with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Whether I liue or dye, I am the Lords, Rom.</hi> 14. 8.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That charge giuen to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">4 The setting of our houses in order.</note> concerning the <hi>setting of his house in order, Esay</hi> 38. is of singular vse for this cure. Men should with sound aduice settle their outward estates, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of their worldly affaires, and according to their meanes prouide for their wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. A great part of the feare and trouble of mens hearts is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, when their Wills are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly made: but men are loth to dye, so long as their outward estates are vnsettled and vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. It is a most preposterous
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:21209:399"/>
course for men to leaue the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their Wils to their sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for besides their disabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of memory, or vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which may befall them, the trouble of it breedes vnrest to their mindes; and besides, they liue all the time in neglect of their duty of preparation for death.</p>

yea, remooue the feare of dying. Oh this <hi>remembring of our latter end,</hi> and learning to <hi>number our daies,</hi> is an admirable rule of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. It is the forgetfulnesse of death, that makes life sinfull, and death terrible, <hi>Deu. 32. 29. Psa.</hi> 90. 12. And wee should begin this exercise of meditation betimes; <hi>Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, Eccles.</hi> 12. 1. This is that is called for, when our Sauiour Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires vs, and all men, so to <hi>watch:</hi> and here in lay the praise of the <hi>fiue wise Virgins, Matth.</hi> 25. 3. Thus <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It were an admirable method, if we could make euery day a life to begin and end, as the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and ends.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Lastly, because yet we may find this feare cumbersome, and <note place="margin">7. Heartie prayer for this thing.</note>
                        <pb n="766" facs="tcp:21209:400"/>
our natures extremely deceitful; there is one thing left, which can neuer faile to preuaile, as farre as it is fit for vs; and that is hearty prayer to God for this very thing. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> prayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 4. and <hi>Moses, Psal.</hi> 90. 13. and <hi>Simeon, Luke</hi> 2. 19. And in as much as <hi>Christ dyed for this end, to deliuer vs from this feare,</hi> wee may sue out the priuiledge, and by prayer striue with God to get it framed in vs. It is a suite God will not deny them that aske in the name of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a thing that Christ e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially aimed at in his owne death.</p>
                     <p>To conclude then; wee haue prooued, that it is possible to be had, and most vncomely to want it; and likewise the way hath beene shewed how both by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and practice, this Cure may be effected. If then it be not wrought in any of vs, we may here finde out the cause in our
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:21209:400"/>
selues: For if wee would hereby be soundly aduised and ruled, we might attaine to it all the dayes of our life, to sing with the Saints, that triumphant Song mentioned both in the Old and New Testament: <hi>Oh death, where is thy sting? O hell, where is thy victory? so as we are now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors through him that loued vs, and gaue himselfe to death for vs,</hi> euen Iesus Christ the righteous; to whom with the Father and the holy Ghost, bee all praise in the Churches, throughout all ages for euer.</p>
