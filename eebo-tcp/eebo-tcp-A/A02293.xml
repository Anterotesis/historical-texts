            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst the Philoſophers,</hi> namely Mimus, Polyſtorus, Azuar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, and Pericles, there paſſed no ſmall contention, and no leſſe varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of argument, in the definition, what eſtate or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of men were moſt ſubiect vnto the inconſtancie of Fortune? &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome ſhe diſcouered her ſelfe moſt ſuſpicious, and leaſt worthy credite. The Philoſopher Polyſtorus ſaid that Fortune was not in any thing more vncerteine, &amp; wherein ſhe did leſſe keepe promiſe, then in the act of matrimonie: for ſo much as there had beene no mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age wherein there was not found ſome want, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or deceipt: which is to ſay, that the wife proued ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fooliſh, ſubtile, abſolute, of tedious pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, of dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vncerteine, ful of ſtrife, or ſuch other infirmitie. The Philoſopher Azuarchus held opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Fortune was not more vncerteine or ſuſpicious, then in the feate of armes, or martiall affayres: affirming, that it was in the hands of men to enter battell, but in God onely to giue victorie. The Philoſopher Pericles affirmed, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was not in any thing more inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant, or vnſound, then with the priuate and fauoured ſeruauntes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with whom ſhe ſtaid long in aduauncing of them, and after with a blaſt ſhe ouerthroweth them. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher Mimus auouched, that Fortune in any thing did not more vſe her will, and leſſe obſerue promiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:16116:5"/>
then in ſea matters &amp; Nauigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mariners: for there neither profiteth ſubſtance, or is wiſedome ſufficient: eyther doth ſhe reſpect perſons: but if Fortune fancie, ſhe leadeth a Lighter amonges the mounteines of the high ſeas, and after drowneth a Carrecke in the hauen. Applying that which is ſaid, vnto that which I would ſay, me ſeemeth (right noble) that of theſe foure maner of Fortunes, two of them are knocking at your gates, which is to ſay, the poſſeſſion of great fauour with our Caeſar, and the ofte ſayling whiche you vſe at ſea. Hee whoſe honour dependeth on the wil of others, &amp; many times commendeth his life vnto the ſea, the one is very daungerous, &amp; the other proceedeth of great raſhnes. Your honour performeth no ſmal attempt, to beard &amp; make head againſt the ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling blocks that Fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth vpon ſuch, as ſhe aduaunceth to great honour, but that you alſo hurle &amp; abandon your perſon ſo oft into the waues of ſo fierce ſeas?

Alwayes giue not credite &amp; yeld not faith vnto ſignes, likelyhoods, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures, either for that alwayes you are ſerued with a good gallie, or make your choice of a good capteine, or ſpecial Pilot, or ſerued with moſt chiefe prouiſion, and obſerue or watche moſt apteſt time.

<pb facs="tcp:16116:6"/>
onely as ſhe hath led many yeres in great ſecuritie. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Seneca writing vnto his mother, ſaid: O my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Albinia, if thou knowe not, I giue thee to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I neuer gaue credite vnto whatſoeuer For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did aduertiſe me, althogh at times there was truce betwixt vs: all thinges which ſhe ſent vnto my houſe, ſhe ſaid they were her abſolute giftes, but I neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued or receiued them but as lent: by which meane it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that when ſhe returneth to demaunde them, without any altercation willingly I do yeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: in ſuch wiſe, that if ſhe remoue them out of my cofers, at the leſt, ſhe ſhal not teare them out of mine entrailes. Hee that ſaid theſe and ſuch like wordes, was natiue of Cordoua, which is not farre diſtant from your citie of Vbeda: and further, he was as priuate with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Rome, as your honour is now in Spaine: And after fourtie two yeares that he had manured the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of Rome, in ambuſhe Fortune had placed ſo great miſchiefe, procured by her great deſpight, and no leſſe deceipte, that in one day hee loſt both life and goods. Sir beleeue me and be out of doubt, that in this life there is nothing more certeine, then that, what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it conteyneth is moſt vncerteine.</p>
            <p>The Emperour Titus on a day eating with great ioy, ſoudeinely at the table clapt his handes and gaue a great ſighe, and being demaunded, why he ſighed ſo deepely, made aunſwere: I may not ſatiſfie my ſelfe, with ſighing, either ceaſſe from weeping, ſo oft as I call to remembrance howe at the will and pleaſure of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, my honour is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, my goodes ſequeſtred, &amp; my life depoſed.

riches, high eſtates, and ſouereigne fauours, if I durſt ſay, I would ſay, that it is more honourable and alſo more ſafe to deſpiſe and hold them in ſmall eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, then to poſſeſſe them: becauſe to obteine them it is but fortune, but to contemne procedeth of valure. To giue you counſel to ceaſe to follow Caeſar, were of too great want of reuerence: and to perſuade you, not to returne into Italie, were raſhe ouerthwartnes: but that which I dare ſay, is, that you ſhould as much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to be a Chriſtian, as to be in fauour: and that firſt you accompliſhe with reaſon, and then with opinion. Not without conſideration, I did ſay &amp; aduenture my ſelfe to giue you this counſell: becauſe all the miſchiefe of Princes Courtes doth ariſe, that nation followeth nation, people followeth people, &amp; opinion followeth opinion: but reaſon neuer followeth reaſon. And for that vnto Princes we muſt giue our words by weight, &amp; vnto the fauoured by meaſure: my letter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth with this aduertiſement, that you commit truſt vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gallie but ſildom, but vnto Fortune neuer: becauſe they be matters much better to behold farre off then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with at hand to be conuerſant. I haue compoſed vnto your honour a booke, intituled, <hi>An aduiſe for the fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> at times when you ſhal be on land to peruſe: &amp; now haue compoſed this other treatiſe of the life of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: for when you ſhall paſſe the Seas, my intent hath bene, that the one may ſerue to paſſe the time, &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the profite of time. And if for that I am of ſmal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and leſſe valure, you hold my watchings in ſmall eſtimation, yet my intent is not to be reiected: for that none doeth ſo much deſire, that you be in fauour, as I deſire that you be ſaued.</p>

That whiche we terme in Spaniſhe, <hi>Retrans:</hi> is ſaid in Latine, <hi>Prouerbes:</hi> in Gréeke, is vnderſtood, <hi>Sentences:</hi> and in the Chaldean, is named <hi>Experiences:</hi> in ſuch maner, that <hi>Refrans,</hi> or <hi>Prouerbes</hi> is no other thing, but certeine Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Philoſophers, and aduertiſementes of men of experience.</p>
            <p>In this manner and kinde of prouerbes, many aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and learned perſons haue written, That is to ſay: <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> the <hi>Thebane, Pittacus</hi> the <hi>Greeke, Anacharſis</hi> the <hi>Numidian, Solomon</hi> the <hi>Hebrue, Mythas</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Seneca</hi> the <hi>Spaniard.

            <p>If <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> deceiue vs not, in the common wealthe of the <hi>Sicyonians,</hi> Philoſophie was neuer read,

The <hi>Sicyonians</hi> being demaunded by King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who they did not admitt Philoſophers, or giue themſelues in Philoſophie, made anſwere: O King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> we giue thée to vnderſtand, that this our countrie is paire, and full of mounteines, &amp; hath more neceſſitie of labourers and plowmen, then of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. And further, we finde by experience, that from ſtudies they procéede more vicious then Philoſophers: for which cauſe, we determine to gouerne our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth by the experience which old men poſſeſſe, &amp; not by the ſcience which Philoſophers do learne. That the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> ſhould vtterly reiect the learned, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them for brutiſhe: but ioyntly therewith, for their gouernement, by men of experience, I commend them as diſcréete: bycauſe for mine owne parte, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for thine that ſhalt either heare or reade this ſame, wée ſhall be muche better gouerned, by him that is of two yeares experience, then by him that hath tenne of ſcience.

            <p>We may ſafely and without preiudice ſweare, that it was not inuented by the Philoſophers of <hi>Athens,</hi> but by mariners at Sea: for which conſideration, it is great reaſon that we beléeue and giue them credite, &amp; holde it in eſtimation: ſince the inuention procéedeth of matter well proued, and not dreamed or diuined.</p>
            <p>But the matter is, that in this treatiſe we ſhal ſpeake of the originall, and firſt beginning, of the manner &amp; making of Gallies, and what prouiſion is to be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and vſed in them: all which things being ſaide and declared, I am aſſured that manie will woonder, and

               <p>Amongſt all old things, one of the moſte auncient is the arte of Nauigation: in which manie haue ſaide manie and variable things in their writings, wherin, for ſo much as they haue béene ſo diuerſe and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in opinions: it is verie credible, that they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feigned, then either ſéene or read.

               <p>Of <hi>Aurelianus</hi> the Emperour his Chroniclers doe recount, that after he triumphed of the Quéene <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> he cauſed on the riuer <hi>Tiber</hi> ſuche and ſo great a Gallie to be made, that the largeſt partes of <hi>Tiber</hi> hardly might conteine the ſame: in the waſte wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was roome ſufficient, with horſes to runne the Carrera, as alſo to torney and iuſt.</p>

               <p>This <hi>philopater</hi> came from <hi>Aſia</hi> to conquer <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> with an hundred Gallies, all rowing with ſeuen oares on a banke: certeinly, a thing verie monſtrous to beholde, and no leſſe difficult to ſuſteine.</p>

               <p>It is a priuilege of the Gallie, whether ſhée be of her owne condition, either ſtraight or large, &amp; of oares much peſtered, and no leſſe cumbred with other carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: the paſſenger that ſhall enter therein may holde

               <p>It is a priuilege of the Gallie, that if at any time, by deſcending on lande, the paſſenger ſhall obteine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall parcell of bread, that is newe, white, and well ſeaſoned, that he aduenture not to féede of it him ſelfe alone, but to make diuiſion thereof amongeſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions:

               <p>It is a priuilege of the Gallie, that if any paſſenger would eate with grauitie, that is to ſay, with cleane
<pb facs="tcp:16116:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
napkins, large towels, &amp; table clothes, he muſt bring them not onely all ready bought, but as well kept: for a merchandize ſo cleanly, is ſéeldome found in Gallie: &amp; if in this, as in the reſt, he be forgetfull, he may with a ſafe conſcience, as alſo with ſhame ynough, wipe on his ſhirte, and nowe and then on his beard.</p>
               <p>It is a priuilege of the Gallie, that therein is no bench to lye on, no ſtoole to repoſe on, no windowe to leane on, neither boorde to feede on: but ioyntly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that licence which they giue vnto the paſſenger which is dimme ſighted, that harde by the hearth, he may eate on the floore as a More: or vpon his knées, as a woman.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Omewhat being ſaid of the priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Gallie, and of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſea: there remaineth not, but to ſpeake of the neceſſarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion for Nauigation: for it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not that the paſſenger be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of all thinges, from which he hath to ſaue himſelfe: but that alſo he enter prouided of all things neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>It is a conuenient counſel for euery man that goeth to ſea, either in ſhip or Gallie, not as an Infidel, but as a Chriſtian to commend himſelfe vnto God: for that the ſailer leadeth his life in as great hazarde, as if he ſhould enter into a ſet battel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16116:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>Alſo it is a conuenient counſell, that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perſons, before they enter the Sea, do make their will, declare their debtes, accompliſhe with their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours, repart their goods, and reconcile them ſelues with their enimies, becauſe they may afterwards hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to finde them ſelues in ſo terrible a ſtorme, that for all the treaſure of this worlde, they would not be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with any ſcruple of conſcience.</p>
               <p>It is a conuenient counſell, for the curious paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either ſailer, tenne or fiftéene dayes before he goe aboorde, to clenſe and euacuate his bodie, either with Roſſid, Honnie, <hi>Roſa Alexandrina,</hi> good <hi>Canafiſtula,</hi> or elſe with ſome perfect Pill: for that naturally the Sea vſeth more pitie with emptie ſtomaches, then with ſuch as are repleate &amp; oppreſſed with yll humors.</p>
               <p>It is a conuenient counſell, and no vnſounde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, to ſaile in a Gallie of newe timber, and that the Thoughtes thereof be worne ſmoothe: for at the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of a point, paſſing any race or gulffe, or inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting with another Gallie, or at the chace of an armie, or in ſome furious ſtorme, the newe Gallie is more light and nimble to bee gouerned both with ſaile and oares, and beſt doth ſaue her ſelfe at Sea, &amp; the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Thoughtes helpeth much in rowing.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is ſounde counſell, that before the paſſenger do imbarke, he goe to viſite and talke with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, and to vſe him with faire termes, and no leſſe courteſie: which is to wéete, if hee be aboorde, to ſende him ſome refreſhing: and if on land, to banquet him, or to accompanie him: for as the Capteines of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies deſire winde, goe with the winde, liue with the winde, ſaile with the winde, alwayes there cleaueth vnto them ſome tache of the winde: wherewith they will of their friendes be honoured, of their enimies feared, and of their paſſengers ſerued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16116:28"/>It is ſounde counſell, that at the inſtant hee ſhall enter the Gallie, he frame friendſhip with the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and Boteſwane, to haue licence to walke on hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with ſome rower to attende him, &amp; to make him neate: with the Pylote, to accept him: with the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, for his fauour: with the Cooke, for his fire: with the ſwéepers, for attendaunce in the poope: with the pages, to rowe him to lande: for if he holde them not all well pleaſed, he is entred into the Gallie verie euil appointed.</p>
               <p>It is alſo conuenient counſell, before he be imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that he make him ſome garment, that is ſtrong and well furred, more profitable then comely: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he may without loſſe, vppon hatches, lye downe in the Croſſebowe roome, climbe into the poope, go on lande, defende him ſelfe from heate, ſuccour him ſelfe from raine, and alſo at night to vſe it for his bedd: for that, garmentes in the Gallie, ought rather to ſerue for profite, then honour.</p>
               <p>It is conuenient counſell, that the curious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate paſſenger, doe make his prouiſion of ſome halfe bed, of a doubled ſhéete, of a little mantell, and no more but one pillowe: for, any man to carrie an whole and a greate bed into the Gallie, is to giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion vnto ſome to deride, and vnto others to laugh: for on the day time, there is no place to lay it, and at night much leſſe to ſpread and make it.</p>
               <p>It is ſounde counſell, that for his prouiſion he haue white biſkett, olde Bacon, good cheeſe, powdered béefe, and alſo ſome fatt hennes: for theſe, and ſuche other thinges, he may not be excuſed to buy, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Sea.</p>
               <p>It is ſounde counſell, that the worſhipfull paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger make his prouiſion of ſome Barrell, Butt, or Skinne of good white wine of a yeare olde, cleare,
<pb facs="tcp:16116:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and fragrant: whereof, after he hath diſcharged his gorge, he ſhall more eſtéeme one droppe, then at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time an whole Barrell: and further, the ſauour thereof ſhall reforme his ſtomache, and the ſmell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his head.</p>
               <p>It is conuenient counſell, for him that woulde eate cleanly, to be prouided of ſome towell, napkin, pott, pitcher, and cuppe: becauſe theſe trifles are ſildome ſolde in Gallies, and much leſſe borrowed.</p>
               <p>It is ſounde counſell, eſpecially for that perſon, which is poareblinde, that if he carrie any cheſt with prouiſion, any Male with armour, any Barrell with wine, any packe with garmentes, or any Caſkett with writinges, preſently that he cauſe the Capteine to ſée it, the Purſſer to regiſter it, and the Steward to ſaue it: for that in the Gallie, for ſcruple of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they leaue not from a néedle vpwardes.</p>
               <p>It is ſound counſell, that he do verie well conſider with whome he is conuerſant, with whome he ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, in whome he truſteth, with whome he ſpeaketh, and alſo with whome he playeth: for, in the Gallie they are ſo handſome, and aduiſed, that if they finde the paſſenger but a little wittleſſe, there ſhall not want thrée, which by playing bootie, ſhall prouide him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of all his money.</p>
               <p>It is a conuenient counſell, that at the inſtant in which he is imbarked, he importune the Capteine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the Stewarde, intreate the Iuſtice, and recouer friendſhippe with ſome rower: to the ende, that if he may not obteine place in the poope, or be admitted to ſome cabinet, at the leaſt to aſſigne him to ſome croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe roome: for, if he be dull or negligent in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, let him holde it for certeine, and alſo condemned, that in the day he ſhall not finde where to ſitt, muche leſſe at night where to lodge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16116:29"/>It is conuenient counſell, for the paſſenger, that preſumeth either of wiſedome, or honeſtie, to procure bookes, both good and pleaſaunt, and ſome of prayers as matter of deuotion: for of thrée exerciſes which are vſed at Sea, which is to wéete, playe, talke, and reade, the moſte profitable and leaſt hurtfull is reading.</p>
               <p>It is conuenient counſell, that the paſſenger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be imbarked, do prouide hookes, lines, bayte, and canes: that when they are becalmed, or lying in any roade, or placed behinde ſome rocke, or the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtell being thruſt alande: to drawe foorth his trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and ſettle him ſelfe to take fiſhe: ſince in fiſhing he ſhall take recreation, and greate ſauour in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: for his minde peace and quietneſſe, and for his purſſe much more profite it is, to be fiſhing in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtell, then at dice in the poope.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is ſounde counſell, that the nice paſſenger make his prouiſion, of raiſons, figges, almondes, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citron, dates, comfites, and other delicate conſerues: for, when the Sea rolleth aloft, and the torment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, belches be practiſing, to caſt the gorge, and diſcharge the ſtomache, the eyes growe dimme, and the appetite is loſt: if in that conflict the poore paſſenger be vnprouided of ſome comfortable conſerue, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him ſome harde aduenture.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is conuenient counſell, not to be vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a bunche of garlike, of a rope of onyons, a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of vineger, a barrelet of oyle, and alſo of a boxe of ſalte: for, notwithſtanding they be ruſticall meates, and not delicate for ſaylers, or licoriſhe to be ſtolen. And further and beſides all this, it may happen that of ſoppes, water, ſalte, and oyle, there may be made a ſlampamp or an hotchepotch, that at ſome other time, ſhall excéede a Capon in taſte.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is conuenient counſell, that euery diſcréete
<pb facs="tcp:16116:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
paſſenger prouide him ſelfe of corked pantophels, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoled ſhoes, of Mariners ſloppes, of cloſe hunting cappes, and of foure or fiue cleane ſhirts: becauſe Sea water is of ſuch a qualitie, and the Gallie of ſuche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, that firſt thou ſhalte foule them all, before thou ſhalt waſhe one.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is ſound counſell, chiefely for nice &amp; delicate ſtomaches, to prouide them ſelues of perfumes, as of Beniamine, Storax, Amber, Aloes, or of Poman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſome ſpeciall good confection: for it many times happeneth, that the Pumpe yeldeth ſo cruell a ſtenche, that onely it diſmaith not, but alſo conſtraineth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſtomache.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a profitable and neceſſarie counſell, that euery paſſenger do carefully conſider, to haue his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach alwayes in temper, and not ouercharged with meates or drinkes: that is to ſay, to eate little, and drinke leſſe: for if on lande it be vnhoneſt, at Sea much more, and daungerous in tempeſt, to eate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he belche, and drinke vntill he caſt.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it ſhall not ſéeme, that wée ſpeake at large, paſſing the gulffe of <hi>Narbona</hi> in a greate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, there was in my Gallie, a gluttonous dronkard, whiche at two belches caſt vp his meate, and with the thirde he did yeld vp his ſoule.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is ſound counſell, and of experience, that to defende the ſtomache from the ſickeneſſe of the Sea: a paper of Saffron be placed vppon the breſt, neare vnto the heart, and in the furie of the tempeſt to kéepe him ſelfe both warme and quiet: wherevppon he may be aſſured, that his ſtomach ſhall neither wamble, nor his head growe giddie.</p>
               <p>In all the nauigation which we had with my Lord and maiſter <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when he attempted the conqueſt of the greate <hi>Tunes</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> theſe rules I vſed, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:16116:30"/>
did yeelde mée my life: I ſay, the life of the bodie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the life of the ſoule, is giuen vs in that glorie, <hi>Ad quam nos perducat Ieſus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus filius Dei, qui cum patre &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu ſancto viuit &amp; regnat in ſecula ſeculorum.
