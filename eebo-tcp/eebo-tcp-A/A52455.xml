            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IT could not be expected but that Dr. <hi>B.</hi> would bestir himself to Reflect, and Revy upon a piece that so nearly touch't his Person: 'Tis natural for men, when they are <hi>prest,</hi> to be uneasy; and since the Dr. will not put himself upon his <hi>Tryal,</hi> and our <hi>English</hi> Law cannot reach him for standing <hi>mute;</hi> 'tis Argument alone that must press him to yield up his Cause, or submit it to the Decision of Sense and Reason, and the Judgment of Persons impartial and <note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

(and as <hi>ill</hi> as he makes mine, that his Crimes may be the more illustrious) I will not say by the <hi>worst</hi> of Pens: This innocent Impartiality he does utterly disown, and declares himself, under hand, an a vow'd Enemy to the <hi>Perswasion</hi> of his PRINCE, and His <hi>Person</hi> too; this I hope, with men of sober and sedate Judgment, or men of common Sense and Reason, will have this weight, that I deal more fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Dr, than he does with his <hi>own</hi> Soveraign; that my Reasonings must be more the Result of the Merit of the Cause, and that, besides, his highest Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor against His Majesty, his greatest Insolency to the Soveraign Authority, (and what perhaps we may prove, not only from the Municipal Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but those of most Nations) his <hi>High Treason:</hi> I have nothing against him (and desire no more) of Resentment, Prejudice, or Provocation.</p>

the Dr. is very much deceiv'd, when he thinks his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor did not consider the defect, that according to the ancient constitution of Parliaments attended the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> (if he will call it so) of that assembled State. He, I'le assure him, sufficiently <hi>foresaw</hi> it, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd upon it when he put Pen to Paper; but could never <hi>foresee,</hi> or imagin, that even the Dr. could have been so improvidently peevish; as in such a point, to have made it an objection; why for GOD's sake, does it follow from a necessitated imperfection in nice Law; that unavoidably attended that Session, that therefore now none of its <hi>sober debates,</hi> or <hi>wholesome constitutions</hi> can be recommended to posterity for imitation, and when His Late Majesty commanded that it should; when even we are govern'd at present by some of the very Laws that it made: if only the passing an Act, assented to by the King, made it a Legal Session, and which did determine but by express proviso against it; sure then the Parliament must be reputed Legal too in which it was Past; so <hi>that necessity</hi> which might occasion a defect, did not make an <hi>Essential Nullity</hi> (as he is pleas'd to name it more by Metaphysical Phrase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, than any term of Law,) for then all its Acts must have been <hi>Null'd</hi> too, which by the next we saw were only <hi>Confirm'd.</hi>

contrary, he being then in War with his Brother <hi>Matthias,</hi> and indeed both sides striving which should most secure to them the Protestant Party, as by the Sequel will appear; for upon his Brothers being in Arms, the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> took a solemn Oath to assist the Emperor with their Lives and Fortunes; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he granted to them a further Confirmation of the Confession of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and though <hi>Matthias</hi> was prevail'd upon afterward by the Bishop of <hi>Passaw,</hi> and the Pope's Legate, Cardinal <hi>Melini</hi> to make an Edict to forbid it; yet he soon found his Error, and took occasion afterward to revoke it; for finding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants more favour'd by his Brother,<note place="margin">1608</note> and the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they had created him by their entering into an Union, occasion'd by his Prosecution, which wee'l say with the Dr. was set on by the House of <hi>Grats;</hi> why he presently thought it the wiser way to take a more moderate Course, and so permitted that the Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Passaw</hi> should be indulg'd not only to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, but the meanest Plebeians: The Emperor <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> when he saw some of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Party fall off to his Brother <hi>Matthias,</hi> and himself somewhat in a Condition not to value them, was animated so far, as for a time to forbid the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Profession of their Religion, and the Meeting of the States at <hi>Prague,</hi> thinking himself not oblig'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Priviledges that was granted then by <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian;</hi> but when he saw what a Disturbance it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, he soon Confirm'd to them, their Antient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and new Exercise of Religion, and that in a more extraordinary manner, <hi>viz.</hi> that none of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishops should oppose the Protestants in <hi>Prague,</hi> that both Religions should live peacibly together, and that those that disobey'd, shou'd be prosecuted as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45645:15"/>
of the Peace: (how near this comes to His <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Proportions, even his Enemies must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) upon this, Protestant Churches were built, both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and little of Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance created to the Church, all the dayes of <hi>Rudol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus.</hi>
