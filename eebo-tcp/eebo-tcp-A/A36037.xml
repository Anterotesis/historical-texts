            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of <hi>DIOGENES LAERTIUS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SInce our Author, <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> has ſo highly oblig'd Poſterity, by the Pains which he has taken in collecting the Lives of the moſt Famous <hi>Phyloſophers;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Aſſiſtance, we could never have attain'd the Knowledg of ſo many remarkable Diſcourſes, and Means to underſtand their Learning, my Opinion is, that it is but reaſonable to do him the ſame Juſtice, to publiſh whatever we have found, as well in Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as in Modern Authors, in reference to his own Life. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, becauſe there are but very few, who have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, we muſt be forc'd to do as they do, who not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſtare impudently in the
<pb facs="tcp:103504:3"/>
Face of any Lady, for that they never had the opportunity of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to ſpeak to her, are conſtrain'd to fix their Eyes upon her Hands; in like manner ſhall I ground my Diſcourſe, for the greater Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Reaſons which I bring upon his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Lives;</hi> from which we ſhall endeavour to collect his own, as we do the Cauſe from the Effect; not being able to compaſs more ample Teſtimonies of his Qualities, by reaſon of the great Diſtance between the Age he liv'd in, and our Times, and the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of thoſe who have writ the Lives of Remarkable Perſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making mention of His.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then, to remove<note place="margin">The Time wherein he flouriſh'd.</note> all Diſputes concerning the Time wherein he flouriſh'd, moſt certain it is, that it could not be but very few Years, that he preceded the more Modern <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> of whom he makes mention in certain Places
<pb facs="tcp:103504:3"/>
of his <hi>Lives;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Simon Apollonides,</hi> who liv'd in the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Tiberius; Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Sextus Empiricus,</hi> who liv'd in the Time of <hi>Marcus Antoninus.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs 'tis very probable, that he might ſurvive a long time after them; ſeeing that <hi>Eunapius</hi> the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> who liv'd under the Reign of <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperor, makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him in the Catalogue of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who have collected the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Ancient <hi>Philoſophers:</hi> which makes me queſtion, Whether the ſame Accident did not befal <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napius</hi> &amp; <hi>Diogenes,</hi> as befel <hi>Sotion</hi> &amp; <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius;</hi> the Elder whereof wrote the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> who liv'd neareſt to his Time; and the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the <hi>Lives</hi> of ſuch as were moſt remote from the Age wherein he liv'd. So that there is no Faith to be giv'n to <hi>Suidas,</hi> who aſſerts, that our Hiſtorian liv'd both before and after the Death of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103504:4"/>As for the Place of his Birth, I<note place="margin">The Place of his Birth.</note> am not of their Opinion, who will have it to be a Village of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> call'd <hi>Laertes;</hi> grounding their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion upon his Additional Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name; for their Conjecture is falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: in regard there is no reaſon to think, but that it ought to be either his Proper Name, or given him by reaſon of ſome Accident, without deriving it from the Place of his Nativity; nay, though they might have ſome reaſon to derive his Name from the Place of his Birth; yet there will another doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, whether there might not be ſome other Village in <hi>Greece,</hi> that bore the ſame Name, to prevent his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Cilician:</hi> for had they but read with Conſideration the Life of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the <hi>Phliaſian,</hi> they might there obſerve by his own Teſtimony, that he was of <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Macedonia;</hi> of the ſame Country with <hi>Timon Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniates;</hi> as is manifeſtly apparent
<pb facs="tcp:103504:4"/>
by that Expreſſion of his, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>our Countryman;</hi> which Words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood in any other Sence, as the Learned Reader may judge by the <hi>Greek</hi> Text in the ſame Place; for there is no Credit to be giv'n to the <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion.</p>
            <p>If it be a thing poſſible to judge<note place="margin">His Manners.</note> of the Manners of a Perſon by his Phyſiognomy, and of the Cauſe by the Effect, what ſhould hinder us to make a ſhrewd Conjecture of the Manners of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> in regard that Books much more manifeſtly diſcover the Inclinations of thoſe that wrote them, then Words; and Words more clearly then the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance? It is impoſſible to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Diſcourſe of a Man by his Face, unleſs he ſpeaks; nor whether he can play on the Lute or no, unleſs you hear him touch the Strings: But we may appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently diſcover his Manners in his Works, as we may his Face in a
<pb facs="tcp:103504:5"/>
Mirror; in regard that by his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſetting down in Writing what Men have done and ſaid, we find, that he never approves their Vicious Acts; but on the other ſide, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them by ſome Explication or other: As when he tells us that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> entertain'd his Friends with lewd Diſcourſe, which he had learn'd in the School of Prophane <hi>Theodorus:</hi> Or by ſome Epigram of his own making; as, when in the ſame place, he laughs at the Folly of <hi>Bion,</hi> who had all along liv'd an impious Life; yet dy'd at length in the height of Superſtition. In the next place, we may obſerve his Humanity, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true Morality in other places; while he overthrows the Impoſtures of Backbiters and Slanderers, and makes it his Buſineſs to defend the Virtue of others; as we mayſee in the Life of <hi>Epicurus.</hi> His Juſtice is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo remarkable in this; that he never diſſembles what is truly good,
<pb facs="tcp:103504:5"/>
nor the Errors of any Perſon; which is obſervable in the Life of <hi>Zeno</hi> the <hi>Cittean,</hi> and <hi>Chryſippus;</hi> and in this; That in all his Writings, he is never obſerv'd to be a rigid Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter or Favourer of any Sect. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he ſhews himſelf ſo much an Abhorrer of all manner of Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Exceſs, that he never lets any Perſon eſcape unbranded who was guilty of that Vice; yet in Terms ſo modeſt, as not to offend the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as we may obſerve in the Life of <hi>Crates,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>As to the Sects then in Being, it<note place="margin">What Sect he was of.</note> is more eaſie for us to tell, of which he was not, then to make him a Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of any one; for that he ſhews himſelf a Neuter in all his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Nevertheleſs, if we may ſpeak by Conjecture our own Sentiments, we have ſome Reaſon to believe him a Follower of <hi>Potamon</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> who after all the reſt, and a little before his Time, ſet up a Sect
<pb facs="tcp:103504:6"/>
of thoſe that were call'd <hi>Chooſers,</hi> or <hi>Eclectics;</hi> and bore the Title alſo of <hi>Lovers of Truth;</hi> becauſe they made Choice out of every Sect, of that which they thought was beſt to ſtick to. Which was the Reaſon that <hi>Clement, Potamon's</hi> Countryman, ſays in one Place, <hi>We ought neither to be</hi> Zenonians, <hi>nor</hi> Platonics, <hi>nor</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans, <hi>nor</hi> Ariſtotelics, <hi>but rather</hi> Eclectics; <hi>chuſing out of every Sect that is moſt Noble, and neareſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Learning appears by his<note place="margin">His Learning.</note> Writings: For if we obſerve his Style, we ſhall find it conciſe, and full of Efficacy; his Words well choſen, and his Diſcourſe eloquent. Yet is he not altogether exempt from blame, as to the Diſpoſal, Superfluity or Defect of Matter; which ſome excuſe by laying the Fault upon his Memory; others, upon his Multiplicity of Buſineſs, which would not permit him to
<pb facs="tcp:103504:6"/>
take a Review of what he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Nevertheleſs he keeps his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among thoſe that may be thought moſt accompliſh'd in all manner of Learning; ſo that if I may ſpeak my own Thoughts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Life of <hi>Plato,</hi> nor the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the <hi>Zenonian Dogma's,</hi> nor the three Epiſtles of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> ſeem to be of his weaving.</p>
            <p>Certain it is he wrote his <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Writings.</note> before his <hi>Lives;</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Volume of <hi>Poems</hi> and <hi>Epigrams,</hi> in all ſorts of Meter, in the Praiſe of ſeveral Perſons; which was divided, as he teſtifies himſelf, in the Life of <hi>Thales,</hi> into ſeveral Books. Some time after he had publiſht it, he collected out of ſeveral Authors, the Lives of the moſt Illuſtrious Philoſophers, and dedicated them to a certain Lady; as appears in the Life of <hi>Plato;</hi> where he has this Expreſſion; <hi>Since you are ſo great an Admirer of</hi> Plato, <hi>and a
<pb facs="tcp:103504:7"/>
Lover of his Doctrine, above any other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> Beſides theſe Works of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have no Authentic Teſtimony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to confirm that he ever wrote any Thing more.</p>
            <p>I alſo find ſeveral Remarkable Perſons, who bear the Name of <hi>Diogenes.</hi> The Firſt, was a <hi>Spora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic</hi> Philoſopher, a Native of <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and a Diſciple of <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> in the Seventieth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> whoſe Life is recorded in the Ninth Book of this Hiſtory; and of whom <hi>Cicero</hi> makes mention in his Firſt Book of the <hi>Nature of the Gods;</hi> where, he ſays, <hi>But what kind of Thing can that Ayr be, which</hi> Diogenes Apolloniates <hi>will have to be a God? What Sence can it have, or what Form?</hi> The Second, was the <hi>Cynic;</hi> who was in his Declenſion about the 113th. <hi>Olympiad;</hi> whoſe Life is related at large in the Sixth Book of this Hiſtory. The Third was an <hi>Epicuredn,</hi> born at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> and a Diſciple of <hi>Epicuriis;</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:103504:7"/>
wrote a Treatiſe of the <hi>Most Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Schools.</hi> The Fourth, a <hi>Stoic;</hi> Sirnam'd, the <hi>Babylonian;</hi> though he were of <hi>Seleucia;</hi> he flouriſh'd ſome Years before <hi>Cicero;</hi> who te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies in the Fourth Book of his <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culane Queſtions,</hi> that he was ſent with <hi>Carneades,</hi> by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to <hi>Rome.</hi> You may ſee his Opinions in the Third Book, <hi>De Finibus;</hi> and the Firſt, <hi>De Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Deorum;</hi> the Second, Of <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> the Third, <hi>De Officiis;</hi> and the Fourth, <hi>De Oratore.</hi> The laſt was our <hi>Laertius;</hi> whoſe Life we here conclude.</p>

of <hi>Nilus;</hi> from whom, among them, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy firſt commenc'd; and over which they who preſided as Preſidents and Guardians, were both Prieſts and Prophets.

For among the <hi>Athenians</hi> we behold the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Muſaeus;</hi> among the <hi>Thebans, Linus;</hi> Ofwhich two, the former, reported to be the Son of <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> is ſaid to have firſt made

out the Pedigree of the Gods; to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Sphere; and firſt to have taught the World that All things were created of one Matter, and ſhould again be diſſolv'd into the ſame. This great Perſon ended his days at Phalerae, where the following Elegy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grav'd upon his Tomb,
<q>
                        <l>Here in Phalerian Duſt, beneath this ſtone,</l>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103504:10"/>
                     <hi>Linus</hi> ended his Life in <hi>Euboea,</hi> being ſhot with an Arrow by <hi>Apollo.</hi> After which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, this Epitaph was inſcrib'd upon his Monument:
<q>
                        <l>Here Theban Linus reſts in Sacred Ground,</l>
                        <l>

                  </p>
                  <p>And thus Philoſophy had its Beginning among the <hi>Greeks:</hi> which is alſo the more apparent from hence, That in the very name it ſelf there is not the leaſt of barbarous Sound or Etymology. True it is, they who aſcribe the Invention of it to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Thracian Orpheus,</hi> to make good their Aſſertion; whom they averr to have been a Philoſopher, and of great Antiquity. But for my part, I cannot underſtand how we can think him to be a Philoſopher who utters ſuch things as he does, concerning the Gods; while he aſperſes the Deities as guilty of all humane Paſſions, and loads 'em with thoſe Vices which are ſeldom diſcours'd of, leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently committed by the worſt of Men. And therefore though the Fable reports him to have periſh'd by the fury of enrag'd Women, yet the Epigram at <hi>Dios</hi> in <hi>Macedon,</hi> ſpeaks him to have been ſtruck with Thunder, in theſe words,
<q>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:103504:10"/>
                        <l>With footy Thunder all beſinear'd,</l>

                        <l>Together with his Gold'n Lyre,</l>
                        <l>The Thracian Orpheus, he whom Jove</l>
                        <l>High Heav'n commanding, from above</l>
                        <l>Struck dead with his Celeſtial Fire.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now they who affirm Philoſophy to have deriv'd its Original from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſhew us the form and manner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that every one made uſe of, together with their Cuſtoms and Inſtitutions; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> and <hi>Druids</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their Philoſaphy in Riddles and obſcure Problems, exhorting Men to worſhip the Gods, to do nothing that was Evil, and to practiſe Fortitude. <hi>Clitarchus</hi> alſo in his twelfth Book aſserts the firſt to have been great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of Death: That the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> wholly employ'd themſelves in <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> and <hi>Predictions:</hi> That the <hi>Magi</hi> were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive altogether upon the Ceremonies of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, Sacrifices and Prayers to the Gods, as liſt'ning to none but only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: They alſo diſcours'd of the Subſtance and Generation of the Gods; which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to be Fire, Earth, and Water; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all manner of Images and Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; more eſpecially thoſe that aſſerted the Gods to be Male and Female. They taught
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103504:11"/>
alſo ſeveral things in reference to Juſtice; accounting it impious to burn the Dead, but held it a vertue to ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a Mother, or a Daughter, as <hi>Sotion</hi> relates in his Thirteenth Book. More than this, they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> practiſed Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Fortune-telling, affirming not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Gods appeared to 'em, but that the Air was alſo full of Specters, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ndancy of mix'd and various Exhalations, forming themſelves, and piercing the Opticks of thoſe that were ſharp ſighted. However they forbid external Worſhip, and the uſe of Gold. Their Veſtment's were white; they lay upon the Ground; their Food was only Herbs, Bread and Cheeſe. Inſtead of Wands, they made uſe of Reeds, with the ſharp ends of which they took up their Cheeſe, and ſo put it to their mouths. But as for Incantation, or Conjuration, they underſtood it not, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> teſtifies in his <hi>Magic,</hi> and <hi>Dinon</hi> in his Fifth Book of Hiſtory; where the ſame Author obſerves that the name of <hi>Zoroaſtres,</hi> being interpreted, ſignifies a Worſhipper of the Stars; which <hi>Hermodorus</hi> alſo confirms. Moreover <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his Firſt Book of Philoſophy, declares the <hi>Magi</hi> to have been more Ancient than the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they believ'd there were two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all Things, a Good, and an Evil Daemon; of which they call'd the firſt by the name of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Oromaſdes;</hi> the other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103504:11"/>
                     <hi>Hades</hi> and <hi>Arimanius;</hi> which <hi>Hermippus</hi> alſo witneſſes in his Firſt Book of the <hi>Magi; Eudoxus</hi> in his <hi>Periodus,</hi> and <hi>Theopom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> likewiſe in his Eighth Book of <hi>Philippics.</hi> Which laſt Author farther declares it to have been the Opinion of the <hi>Magi,</hi> that Men ſhould riſe again and be Immortal, and that all Things ſubſiſted by their Interceſſions. Which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> the <hi>Rhodian</hi> alſo relates. <hi>Hecataeus</hi> aſſerts, That they believ'd the Gods to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. <hi>Clearchus</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Solenſis</hi> in his Book of Education affirms the <hi>Gymnoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts</hi> to have ſprung from the <hi>Magi;</hi> and ſome there are, who derive the <hi>Jews</hi> from the ſame Original.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, they who write concerning the <hi>Magi</hi> condemn <hi>Herodotus,</hi> denying that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Xerxes</hi> darted his Javelins againſt the Sun, or that he ever offer'd to fetter the Sea, which by the <hi>Magi</hi> were both held for Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but that their forbidding of Statues and Images might probably be true. However they grant the Philoſophy of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to be the ſame, as well in reference to the Gods, as to Juſtice; and that they held <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to be the Beginning of All things; out of which they diſtinguiſh'd the four Elements, and allowed the Production of ſeveral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: That they worſhip'd the Sun and Moon for Gods, the firſt by the name of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> the other by the name of <hi>Iſis,</hi> whoſe myſterious
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103504:12"/>
worſhip they conceal'd under the ſimilitudes of Beetles, Dragons, Hawks, and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to <hi>Manethus</hi> in his <hi>Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> of <hi>Natural Things;</hi> and <hi>Hecataeus</hi> in his Firſt Book of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Philoſophy: And farther, that they erected Temples and Images, becauſe they underſtood not the Form of the Deity. That they believ'd the World to have had a Beginning, to be Corruptible and Sphaerical; that the Stars were of a fiery ſubſtance, and that their temperate mixture produc'd all things upon Earth: That the Moon was Eclips'd by the ſhadow of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Globe: That the Soul was immortal, and frequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tranſmigrated: That Rain was produc'd by the alteration of the Air; with ſeveral other Philoſophical Opinions and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conjectures of the ſame nature, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd from <hi>Hecataeus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtagoras.</hi> They alſo constituted ſeveral Laws in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Justice; the honour of all which they gave to <hi>Mercury:</hi> Alſo to ſeveral Creatures, that were generally uſeful to Mankind, they attributed Divine Worſhip: If we may credit their own Relations, they boast themſelves to have been the first inventors of <hi>Geometry, Aſtrology,</hi> and <hi>Arithmetick.</hi> And thus much concerning the first invention of theſe things.</p>
                  <p>But as to the Name of <hi>Philoſophy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> was the first that call'd it ſo; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103504:12"/>
aſſum'd to himſelf the Title of <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> when he diſputed at <hi>Sicyon</hi> with the Tyrant of the <hi>Sicyonians,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Phliaſians,</hi> according to <hi>Heraclides</hi> of <hi>Pontus;</hi> for he would not allow any mortal Man to be truly wiſe but only God. Before that time, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> was call'd <hi>Sophia,</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> and he who profeſs'd it was dignify'd with the Title of <hi>Sophos</hi> or Wiſe, as one that had reach'd the ſublimest vertues of the Soul. Now more modestly he is called <hi>Philoſophos,</hi> an Embracer of Wiſdom. Nevertheleſs Wiſe Men still retain the name of <hi>Sophiſts;</hi> and not only they, but the Poets alſo. For ſo <hi>Cratinus</hi> in <hi>Archelochus</hi> calls both <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Heſiod,</hi> as the highest Encomium he could give thoſe famous Authors.</p>
                  <p>Now they who particularly obtain'd the more eminent Title of <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> were theſe that follow; <hi>Thales, Solon, Periander, Cleobulus, Chilo, Bias,</hi> and <hi>Pittacus;</hi> in which number there are ſome that reckn Anacharſis the <hi>Scythian, Myſo</hi> the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean, Pherecydes</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> and <hi>Epimeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> the <hi>Cretan;</hi> and ſome others needs will alſo add <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> the Tyrant.

                  </p>
                  <p>As for Philoſophy, it is ſaid to have had its first Foundations laid by two Perſons of equal Fame, <hi>Anaximander</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras;</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:103504:13"/>
the one the Scholar of <hi>Thales,</hi> the other the Diſciple of <hi>Pherecydes.</hi> By which means <hi>Philoſophy</hi> being thus divided, that which was founded by <hi>Anaximander</hi> was call'd the <hi>Ionian Philoſophy;</hi> in regard that <hi>Thales,</hi> who was <hi>Anaximander</hi>'s.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ionian Philoſophy</hi> terminates in <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomachus, Chryſippus</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus:</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> with <hi>Epicurus.</hi> For to <hi>Thales</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Anaximander;</hi> to <hi>Anaximander, Anaximenes; Anaxagoras</hi> followed <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes;</hi> and <hi>Archelaus</hi> follow'd <hi>Anaxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras;</hi> after whom came <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was the first that invented <hi>Ethics;</hi> to whom among the reſt of the <hi>Socratics,</hi> in the firſt place ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Plato,</hi> who founded the <hi>Ancient Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy.</hi> To him ſucceeded <hi>Speuſippus</hi> and <hi>Xenocrates;</hi> to them <hi>Polemon;</hi> to <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Crantor</hi> and <hi>Crates.</hi> Then followed <hi>Archelaus,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Middlemoſt Academy;</hi> and his Succeſſor was <hi>Lacydes,</hi> who instituted the <hi>New Academy.</hi> After <hi>Lacydes</hi> flouriſh'd <hi>Carneades,</hi> ſucceded by <hi>Clitomachus.</hi> Thus the <hi>Ionian Philoſophy</hi> terminated with <hi>Clitomachus;</hi> but with <hi>Chryſippus</hi> in this manner: To <hi>Socrates</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Antiſthenes;</hi> to <hi>Antiſthenes, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>

To <hi>Plato</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> to <hi>Ariſtotle Theophraſtus.</hi> And thus ended the <hi>Ionic Philoſophy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Series of the <hi>Italian Philoſophy</hi> was this: <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Pherecydes;</hi> to him his Son <hi>Telauges,</hi> to whom <hi>Xenopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> to him <hi>Parmenides,</hi> to whom <hi>Zeno</hi> of <hi>Eleate;</hi> to <hi>Zeno, Leucippus;</hi> to <hi>Leucip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Democritus.</hi> After <hi>Democritus</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral, and among the rest <hi>Nauſiphanes</hi> and <hi>Naucydes</hi> became most Celebrated; and were next in order ſucceeded by <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>

                  <p>Now to diſtinguiſh theſe Philoſophers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally into two ſorts; ſome were Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, who determin'd of Things, as fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and understood. Others <hi>Ephec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> who doubted of every thing, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to underſtand nothing. Of the one, the moſt part have left behind 'em ſeveral Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of their Ingenuity: others have writ nothing at all. In which number, as ſome will have it, are <hi>Socrates, Stilpo, Philip, Menedemus, Pyrrho, Theodorus, Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and <hi>Bryſo;</hi> and ſome there are who will allow neither <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> nor <hi>Ariſto</hi> the <hi>Chyan,</hi> to have publiſh'd any more than ſome few Epiſtles.</p>

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103504:14"/>Others there are famous only for ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Treatiſes; as <hi>Meliſſus, Parmenides,</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras.

                  </p>
                  <p>Others of theſe Philoſophers were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by their additional Names; of which ſome were given 'em from the place of their Birth: as of <hi>Elia, Megara, Eretricum, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renae.</hi> Others from the places where they kept their Exerciſes, as the <hi>Academics</hi> and <hi>Stoicks.</hi> Some from Cuſtom and Habit, as the <hi>Peripateticks.</hi> Others in Deriſion, as the <hi>Cynics.</hi> Others from the Effect, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonics.</hi> Others from their Pride and Vain-glory, ſuch were they that call'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Lovers of Truth,</hi> and <hi>Eclectici,</hi> as pretending only, like Bees, to ſuck the flowers of Philoſophy.

                  <p>The Parts of Philoſophy are three; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy, or Phyſics, Ethics, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103504:14"/>
                     <hi>Phyſics</hi> properly treat of the World, and the things therein contain'd. <hi>Ethics</hi> diſcourſe of the management of our Lives both in Civil and Political Affairs: And <hi>Logic</hi> furniſhes both with Arguments and Reaſons. Till the time of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> Phyſics flouriſh'd alone. From <hi>Socrates</hi> Ethics had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. And <hi>Zeno</hi> of <hi>Elea,</hi> was the firſt that reduc'd Logic into Form. Of Ethic Philoſophers there were no leſs than ten Sects, the <hi>Academic, Cyrenaic, Elean, Megaric, Cynic, Eretric, Dialectical, Peripatetic, Stoic,</hi> and <hi>Epicurean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the Ancient Academy <hi>Plato</hi> was the chief: of the Middlemoſt, <hi>Arceſilaus:</hi> and of the New Academy, <hi>Lacides.</hi> Of the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renean</hi> Sect <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> was the Head: of the <hi>Elean, Phaedon</hi> of <hi>Elea:</hi> of the <hi>Megaric, Euclid</hi> of <hi>Elea:</hi> of the <hi>Cynic, Antiſthenes</hi> of <hi>Athens:</hi> of the <hi>Eretric, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedemus</hi> of <hi>Eretria:</hi> of the <hi>Dialectic, Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomachus</hi> the <hi>Chalcedonian:</hi> of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetic, Ariſtotle</hi> the <hi>Stagerite:</hi> of the <hi>Stoic, Zeno</hi> the <hi>Cittian:</hi> and the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> from <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who was the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. However <hi>Hippobotus</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Philoſophical Sects, denies there were any more than nine Sects, or Inſtitutions; and places the <hi>Megaric</hi> firſt, the <hi>Eretric</hi> next: the third place he aſſigns to the <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naic;</hi> the fourth to the <hi>Epicurean;</hi> the fifth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103504:15"/>
to the <hi>Annicerean;</hi> the ſixth to the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorean:</hi> in the ſeventh place he ranks the <hi>Zenonian;</hi> in the eighth the Old Academy; and in the ninth the <hi>Peripatetic:</hi> Nor does he make any mention of the <hi>Cynic,</hi> the <hi>Elean,</hi> or the <hi>Dialectic.</hi> As for the <hi>Pyrrhonian,</hi> it is rejected by moſt, by reaſon of its Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Yet ſome allow it to be partly a Sect, and partly not; as ſeeming to be a kind of a Sect. For, ſay they, we call that a Sect which either follows or pretends to follow ſome ſort of Reaſon, according to outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In which ſenſe it may not improperly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be call'd a Sceptic Sect. But if we may call a Sect, a propenſity to adhere to Opinions that have ſome congruency one with another, it cannot be call'd a Sect, in regard it has no Opinions or Determinations belonging to it. And thus much in few words concerning the Beginning, the Increaſe, the Parts and Sects of Philoſophy. Although it is not long ſince, that another Sect, which is calld the <hi>Eclec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> has been ſtarted among the learned by <hi>Potamo</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which pretends to cull the flowers of all the other Sects; and whatever ſeems moſt pleaſing to their fancies. For, as he ſays himſelf in his <hi>Rudiments,</hi> there ought to be a twofold Examination of Truth; one, from whence we ſhould make our judgment, which is the Principal; and the other by which we ſhould make the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103504:15"/>
which conſiſts in the force and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ratiocination and Fancy. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtrength of theſe ſcrutinies he aſſerts Matter, Quality, Action and Place to be the Beginnings of All things; that is, <hi>of what,</hi> and <hi>from what; where</hi> and <hi>wherein.</hi> The <hi>End</hi> alſo to which all things are refer'd he affirms to be a life perfect in all Vertue, not without ſome natural and external Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the Body. But we are now to give an Account of the Men themſelves; and of <hi>Thales</hi> in the firſt Place.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THALES</hi> therefore (as <hi>Herodotus, Doris,</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> concurring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly report) was of a noble Extraction; having for his Father <hi>Examius,</hi> for his Mother <hi>Cleobulina,</hi> both of the Family of the <hi>Thelidae,</hi> the moſt illuſtrious among the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> being deſcended from <hi>Cadmus</hi> and <hi>Agenor,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> teſtifies; and he firſt obtain'd the Title of <hi>Wiſe,</hi> at what time <hi>Damaſius</hi> rul'd as Prince in <hi>Athens:</hi> During whoſe Government, the reſt of the <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> were dignified with the ſame Appellation, as <hi>Demetrius Phalareus</hi> relates in his <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>Athenian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chontes.</hi> He was made free of the City of <hi>Miletum,</hi> whither he accompany'd <hi>Neleus,</hi> who was expell'd his native Country <hi>Phoenicia.</hi> But as ſeveral others affirm, he was a <hi>Mileſian</hi> born, yet ſtill of a noble Deſcent. Where after he had manag'd the Public Affairs for ſome time, he betook himſelf to the Contemplation of Nature; though moſt agree, that he never left any Monument of his Induſtry behind him. For that ſame Treatiſe of <hi>Naval Aſtrology,</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:103504:17"/>
reputed to be his, is more probably aver'd to be the work of <hi>Phocus</hi> the <hi>Samian.</hi> Yet <hi>Callimachus</hi> makes him ſo skilful in the Heavens, as to have found out the <hi>Leſſer Bear,</hi> by which means the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuch exquiſite Saylors. His <hi>Iambics</hi> are theſe:
<q>
                        <l>He firſt deſcry'd the Northern Team of Stars,</l>
                        <l>That draw the Artic Wain about the Pole,</l>
                        <l>By which <hi>Phoenician</hi> Pilot fearleſs dares,</l>
                        <l>To ſteer through pathleſs Seas, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, as others ſay, he only wrote two Treatiſes concerning the <hi>Tropic</hi> and the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> believing it no difficult thing to apprehend the reſt. However moſt allow, that he was the firſt that div'd into the Myſteries of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and foretold the Eclipſes of the Sun, as <hi>Eudemus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in his <hi>Hiſtory of Aſtrology;</hi> which was the reaſon that <hi>Zenophanes</hi> and <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> ſo much admir'd him; beſides that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> teſtifie the ſame thing. Some there are who affirm him to be the firſt who held the Immortality of the Soul; of which number is <hi>Choerilus</hi> the Poet. As others report, he was the firſt that found out the courſe of the Sun,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103504:17"/>
from <hi>Tropic</hi> to <hi>Tropic;</hi> and comparing the Orb of the Moon with that of the Sun, diſcover'd the one to be no more than the ſeven hundred and twentieth Part of the other. He was alſo the firſt that limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Month to thirty days. He was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the firſt that diſcours'd of nature, as ſome affirm. Moreover <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Hippias</hi> teſtify, that he was the firſt who taught, that inanimate Things were endu'd with Souls, which he prov'd from the Vertues of the <hi>Magnet</hi> and <hi>Amber.</hi> Having learnt the Art of <hi>Geometry</hi> among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he was the firſt that invented the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angl'd Triangle of a Circle, for which he offer'd an Ox in Sacrifice; according to the relation of <hi>Pamphilus;</hi> though others attribute that invention to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and among the reſt <hi>Apollodorus</hi> the Accompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. And if it were true what <hi>Callima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> vouches in his Iambics, that <hi>Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> the <hi>Phrygian</hi> invented the <hi>Scalenum,</hi> and <hi>Trigonum,</hi> with many other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Speculation of Lines, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that <hi>Thales</hi> gave much more light to that ſort of <hi>Theory</hi> by many Additions of his own.</p>
                  <p>As to what concern'd Affairs of State, apparent it is, that he was a moſt prudent Counſellor; for when <hi>Croeſus</hi> ſent to make a League with the <hi>Mileſians,</hi> he oppos'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103504:18"/>
it with all his might; which afterwards, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> obtain'd the Victory, prov'd the preſervation of the City. <hi>Heraclides</hi> reports him greatly addicted to a ſolitary and private Life. Some there are who ſay he was marry'd, and that he had a Son, whom he call'd <hi>Cibiſſus:</hi> But others affirm that he perſevered a Batchelor, and made his Siſters Son his Heir by Adoption. Inſomuch that being demanded why he took no care to leave Off-ſpring behind him? His reply was, <hi>becauſe he lov'd his Children too well.</hi> At another time his Mother preſſing him to marry, he anſwer'd, <hi>It was too ſoon:</hi> Afterwards, when he grew in years, his Mother ſtill urg'd him to Matrimony with greater importunity, he told her, <hi>'twas then too late.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hieronymus</hi> the <hi>Rhodian</hi> in his ſecond Book of <hi>Memorandums,</hi> relates, how that being deſirous to ſhew how eaſie it was to grow rich, foreſeeing the great plenty of Oyl that would happen the next year, he farm'd all the Plantations of Olives round about, and by that means gain'd a vaſt ſumm of money.</p>
                  <p>He affirm'd that Water was the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all things, and that the World was a Living Creature full of Spirits and Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. He alſo diſtinguiſh'd the Seaſons of the Year, which he divided into three
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103504:18"/>
hundred ſixty five Days. Nor had he any perſon to inſtruct him; only while he continu'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he held a ſtrict fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with the Prieſts of that Country. The ſame <hi>Hieronymus</hi> relates, That he meaſur'd the Pyramids, by obſerving the ſhadows at what time they ſeem'd not to exceed human Proportion. As <hi>Minyes</hi> relates, he liv'd with <hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> Tyrant of the <hi>Mileſians.</hi> As for what is recorded concerning the <hi>Tripos</hi> found out by the Fiſhermen, and ſent to the <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> by the <hi>Mileſians,</hi> it ſtill remains an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truth. For they ſay, that certain <hi>Ionian</hi> young Gentlemen having bought of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Fiſhermen a ſingle Caſt of a Net, ſo ſoon as the Net was drawn up, and the <hi>Tripos</hi> appear'd, a quarrel aroſe, which could by no means be pacify'd, till the <hi>Mileſians</hi> ſending to <hi>Delphos,</hi> had this Anſwer return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d by the Goddeſs:
<q>
                        <l>Is't your Deſire, <hi>Mileſian</hi> youth, to know</l>
                        <l>How you the Golden <hi>Tripos</hi> muſt beſtow?</l>
                        <l>Return, and ſay what <hi>Phoebus</hi> here reveals;</l>
                        <l>Give it to Him in wiſdom that excells.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They give it therefore to <hi>Thales;</hi> he to another; the other to a third, until it came to <hi>Solon:</hi> Who ſaying that only God excell'd in Wiſdom, advis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d that it ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103504:19"/>
be forthwith ſent to the Temple of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos.</hi> This ſtory <hi>Callimachus</hi> relates ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, as he had it from <hi>Leander</hi> the <hi>Mileſian;</hi> how that a certain <hi>Arcadian,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Bathycles</hi> bequeath'd a Bottle of Gold to be given to the chiefeſt of the <hi>Wiſe Men:</hi> Which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to <hi>Thales,</hi> and ſo from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till it came to <hi>Thales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> again; who thereupon ſent it to <hi>Didymean Apollo,</hi> with this Inſcription, according to the words of <hi>Callimachus.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Me <hi>Thales</hi> ſends to Sacred <hi>Nilean</hi> King,</l>
                        <l>Twice to him fell the <hi>Grecian</hi> Offering.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Proſe ran thus. <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſian,</hi> Son of <hi>Examius,</hi> to <hi>Delphinian Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> twice receiving the Guerdon of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And <hi>Eleuſis</hi> in his Book of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> farther tells us, That the perſon entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to carry the Preſent from one <hi>Wiſe Man</hi> to the other, being the Son of <hi>Bathy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> was call'd by the name of <hi>Thyrio,</hi> with whom <hi>Alexo</hi> the <hi>Myndian</hi> alſo agrees. However <hi>Eudemus</hi> the <hi>Gnidian,</hi> and <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> the <hi>Mileſian,</hi> affirm, That it was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain friend of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> who receiv'd a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cup from the King, with a command to preſent it to the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> who gave it to <hi>Thales,</hi> and ſo he went
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103504:19"/>
from one to another, till he came to <hi>Chilo;</hi> to whom, when he ſent to enquire of the Oracle, who was wiſer than himſelf, it was anſwered, <hi>Miſo;</hi> of whom more in due place. Which perſon <hi>Eudemus</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> will have to be <hi>Periander;</hi> and concerning whom <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> made this return to <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> who was ſent to conſult the Oracle.
<q>
                        <l>OEtaean <hi>Myſo,</hi> born in <hi>Chenes,</hi> I,</l>
                        <l>Beyond thy Fame for wiſdom magnifie.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide <hi>Daedachus</hi> the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic,</hi> and <hi>Clearchus</hi> affirm, that the Golden Preſent was ſent by <hi>Croeſus</hi> to <hi>Pittacus,</hi> and ſo from one to another, till it came to <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus</hi> again. Moreover, <hi>Andron</hi> in his <hi>Tripos</hi> relates, That the <hi>Argives</hi> made a <hi>Tripos</hi> to be preſented to the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as the Guerdon of his Vertue; and that <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd the wiſeſt Perſon, who nevertheleſs ſubmitted to <hi>Chilo. Alceus</hi> alſo makes mention of <hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> aſcribing to him that famous ſaying among the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
                     <q>

                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:103504:20"/>Some there are who relate a Story of a Ship, full fraighted, that was ſent to <hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> Tyrant of the <hi>Mileſians;</hi> which Veſſel afterwards was Shipwrackt in the <hi>Coan</hi> Sea, where the <hi>Tripos</hi> was afterwards found by certain Fiſher-men, as being part of the Lading. Though <hi>Phanodicus</hi> averrs the <hi>Tripos</hi> to have been found in the <hi>Attick</hi> Sea, and brought to <hi>Athens,</hi> where after long debate in a full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, it was decreed to be ſent to <hi>Bias.</hi> Others ſay, That it was the Workmanſhip of <hi>Vulcan</hi> himſelf, by whom it was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Pelops</hi> on his wedding day: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it deſcended to <hi>Menelaus,</hi> from whom it was violently taken away by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> when he made the famous Rape upon <hi>Helena,</hi> and by him thrown into the <hi>Coan</hi> Sea, by the advice of a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byl, who foretold him it would prove the occaſion of much Miſchief and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some time after this certain of the <hi>Lebedians</hi> having bought the Caſt of a Net, the <hi>Tripos</hi> was drawn up; upon which a Quarrel ariſing between the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers and the Fiſher-men, both Parties came to a Hearing at <hi>Cos;</hi> which proving ineffectual, they appeal'd to <hi>Miletum,</hi> the Metropolis of the Country.

Upon which, the <hi>Mileſians</hi> reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the contempt of their Ambaſſadors, reſolv'd to revenge the Affront upon the <hi>Coans</hi> by force of Arms: in which conteſt, after many had loſt their lives on both ſides, it was decreed by the Oracle, that the <hi>Tripos</hi> ſhould be preſented to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon moſt famous at that time for his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

that after ſuch a proſperous Beginning, he ſo eaſily paſt his other Laws, which it would be too tedious to recite, beſides that they are to be ſeen, inſcrib'd in the publick Tables of Wood. But the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt act of his was this, that when the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> and <hi>Megareans</hi> had fought even to the utter extirpation of each other, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the claim which both laid to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country of <hi>Salamine,</hi> and that after ſeveral overthrows of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> it was generally decreed, that it ſhould be death for any Man to propoſe another <hi>Salaminian</hi> War, <hi>Solon</hi> counterfeiting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Mad, with a Crown upon his head threw himſelf into the Market-place; where the people being aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he caus'd the Cryer to read with a loud Voice certain Heroic Verſes, which he had compos'd in reference to the Grand Affair of <hi>Salamine;</hi> which ſo enliven'd and animated the courage of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they renewed the War with the <hi>Megareans,</hi> and became Victorious by <hi>Solon</hi>'s means.

                        <p>This was that great <hi>Solon,</hi> who limited the bounds of Humane Life to Eighty years; and who appears to have been a moſt famous and prudent Lawgiver. For he moſt nobly enacted, That whoever refus'd to provide for his Parents, ſhould be accounted ignoble and worthleſs. The ſame was the puniſhment of thoſe that waſted their Patrimony. Idle perſons were liable to the proſecution of any one that would Indict 'em. Which Law was written by <hi>Draco,</hi> as <hi>Lyſias</hi> declares in his Oration againſt <hi>Nicias,</hi> but enacted by

                           <hi>Solon.</hi> Perſons notoriouſly debauch'd and wicked, he would not ſuffer to come near the Tribunal, and expell'd out of all Aſſemblies.

For though he thought it not amiſs to abate their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, yet he did not think that only they who were ſlain in Battel were to be recompenced; whoſe Children however he ordered to be provided for, and brought up at the public Charge. Which encouraged others to behave themſelves bravely and couragiouſly in the Wars. As did <hi>Polyzelus, Cynaegyrus,</hi> and all that fought at the Battle of <hi>Marathon.</hi> As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Harmodius, Aristogiton, Miltiades,</hi> and others innumerable. But theſe Wreſtlers in their Exerciſes were extreamly expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and being Victors no leſs noxious to the Public, and were Crown'd rather as vanquiſhers of their Country, than the Public Enemy: and when they grew old, according to <hi>Euripides,</hi>

That it ſhould be death for a Magiſtrate to be taken in drink. <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poems he ordain'd to be tranſcrib'd in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture, that where the firſt verſe ended, the next ſhould begin.

He began with his complements to the People; then, after he had ſtab'd himſelf, he ran woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the <hi>Eliaean</hi> Piazza, crying, That he had been ſet upon by his Enemies, and therefore deſired a Guard of four hundred Men only for the ſecurity of his Perſon. Preſently the People, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the oppoſition I could make, granted him his requeſt: And then he ſet up for himſelf, after he had diſſolv'd the Government. And thus they who in vain endeavour'd to free their Poor from ſerving for Hire, are now all the Slaves of <hi>Piſistratus.</hi>

                     <hi>THE</hi> Life of <hi>CHILO.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CHILO</hi> the <hi>Lacaedemonian</hi> was the Son of <hi>Demagetus.</hi> He wrote ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Elegies to the number of about two Hundred Verſes; and taught, that Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg was attain'd by Ratiocination, according to the Vertue of the Perſon. To his Brother, who took it ill, he was not made an <hi>Ephorus,</hi> or one of the Grand Council of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> as well as He, <hi>I know,</hi> ſaid He, <hi>how to put up Injuries, which thou doſt not do.</hi> He was made one of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> in the fifty Sixth <hi>Olympiad;</hi> and the firſt <hi>Ephorus</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thydemus,</hi> according to <hi>Soſicrates:</hi> and the firſt who cauſed it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that the <hi>Ephori</hi> ſhould be joined in Authority with the Kings of <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> tho' <hi>Satyrus</hi> aſcribes that Honour to <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> This was he, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates, who adviſed <hi>Hippocrates</hi> offering Sacrifice at <hi>Olympia,</hi> when the Caldrons boiled without Fire, either not to Marry, or if he had a Wife already, to renounce his Children. It is farther reported, that when <hi>Aeſopus</hi> asked him what <hi>Jupiter</hi> was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103504:34"/>
doing? He made anſwer, <hi>Humbling the lofty, and exalting the lowly.</hi> He was won tto ſay, that the Learned differed from the unlearned, <hi>in good hopes.</hi> To the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what was difficult? he replied, <hi>To keep a Secret, to ſpend a Man's leiſure-time well, and being wrong'd to brook the Injury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Precepts were theſe. For a Man to govern his Tongue, eſpecially at Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, not to ſpeak evil of our Neighbours, not to uſe threatning Language, for it was Effeminate: ſooner to viſit our Friends in their Misfortunes, than in their Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; to chuſe a Wife with a moderate Dowry: Not to ſpeak Evil of the Dead, to reverence old Age, to put a Guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf: to prefer loſs, before ſordid Gain; for by the one, a Man ſuffers but once, by the other, always: never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the Unfortunate, being ſtrong and valiant, to be meek and humble; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much better to be beloved than fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: to govern his family ſoberly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly: not to let his Tongue run before his Wit: to maſter his Paſſion: not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Divination: not to deſire Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: in the Street not to make ſo much haſte, as if a Man were always going up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Life and Death: in familiar diſcourſe, not to uſe ſo much motion of the Hands; for it denotes a kind of Frenzy, to be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103504:35"/>
obedient to the Law, and to ſtudy Peace and Quiet.</p>
                  <p>Among the reſt of his Apothegms, one of the moſt approved was this; That Gold was tryed by the Touchſtone, but the Tryal of Men, whether good or bad, was by Gold. It is reported of him, that when he was very old he ſhould ſay, that he was no way conſcious to himſelf of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done an ill or unjuſt act. One thing only troubled him, as doubting whether he had done well or no. For that being to determine a difference between two Friends, he adviſed 'em to appeal from him to the Law, to the end he might act legally, and not loſe his Friend. His Prophecy concerning the Iſland of <hi>Cythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> gained him a high Renown among the <hi>Grecians.</hi> For when he underſtood the Nature and Situation of it; <hi>I wiſh,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it never had been;</hi> or <hi>elſe that when it firſt appeared, it had been ſwallowed up in the Abyſs:</hi> and he was right in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For <hi>Demaratus,</hi> a <hi>Lacedaemonian Renegade,</hi> adviſed <hi>Xerxes</hi> to keep a Navy always in that Iſland, which had been the ruin of <hi>Greece,</hi> had <hi>Xerxes</hi> followed his Counſel. Afterwards during the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſian</hi> War, <hi>Nicias,</hi> having laid the Iſland deſolate, placed a Garriſon of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> therein, which proved a continual Plague to the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:103504:35"/>He was a Perſon of few words; for which reaſon <hi>Ariſtagoras</hi> the <hi>Mileſian,</hi> gives to Brevity of Speech, the Epithete of <hi>Chilonean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was an old Man in the fifty Second <hi>Olympiad,</hi> at what time <hi>Aeſopus</hi> the Orator was in his Prime. He died as <hi>Hermippus</hi> reports at <hi>Piſſa,</hi> embracing his Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning victorious from the Olympic Games, himſelf o'recome with Joy, and the infirmity of his Years. And he was no ſooner dead, but all Men ſtrove to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate his Obſequies with all the Honours and Encomiums they could deviſe befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Renown. Among the reſt, the following Offering was our own.

                     <hi>THE</hi> LIFE of <hi>PITTACUS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PIttacus,</hi> born at <hi>Mitylene,</hi> was the Son of <hi>Hyrrhadius;</hi> yet <hi>Doris</hi> aſſerts his Father to have been a <hi>Thracian.</hi> This was he, who together with the Brothers of <hi>Alcanus,</hi> utterly ruined <hi>Melancher</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Lesbos.</hi> And in the Conteſt between the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Mityleneans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Territory of <hi>Achillitis,</hi> he being General of the <hi>Mityleneans,</hi> challenged <hi>Phryno</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Chieftain, to fight with him Hand to Hand; at what time carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103504:36"/>
a Net under his Buckler, he threw it over <hi>Phryno's</hi> Shoulders, when he leaſt dreamed of any ſuch thing; and by that means having ſlain his Antagoniſt, he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Land to the <hi>Mityleneans.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards according to the relation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollodorus</hi> in his Chronicle, another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute happening between the <hi>Mityleneans</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> about the ſame Land, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander,</hi> who was made Judg of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, gave it for the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then it was that the <hi>Mityleneans</hi> held <hi>Pittacus</hi> in high Eſteem, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Supream Government into his Hands, which after he had managed for ten Years, and eſtabliſhed thoſe Orders and Regulations that he thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, he again reſigned into the Hands of the People, and lived ten Years after that. For theſe great Benefits done to his Country, the <hi>Mityleneans</hi> conferred on him a quantity of Land, which he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his latter End conſecrated to Pious Uſes. <hi>Soſicrates</hi> writes, that he reſtored back the one half of the Land, ſaying at the ſame time, <hi>That the half was more than the whole.</hi> Sometime after, when <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſent him a Summ of Money, he refuſed to accept it, ſaying that he had twice as much more as he deſired. For his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dying without Iſſue, the Eſtate fell
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103504:37"/>
to him. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> in his firſt Book of <hi>Memorandums</hi> relates that he had a Son, whoſe name was <hi>Pyrrhaeus,</hi> who was kill'd as he was ſitting in a Barbers Chair at <hi>Cumae,</hi> by a Smith that threw a Hatchet into the Shop, for which the Murtherer was ſent in Fetters by the <hi>Cumans</hi> to <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus,</hi> that he might puniſh him as he pleaſed himſelf. But <hi>Pittacus</hi> after he had fully examined the Matter, releaſed and pardoned the Priſoner, with this Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Indulgence was to be preferred before Repentance. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> alſo relates that when he had taken <hi>Alcaeus</hi> Priſoner, he let him go, ſaying, that Pardon was to be preferred before Puniſhment. He ordained that Drunkards offending in their Drink, ſhould be doubly Puniſhed, to make Men the more wary how they got tipſy; for the Iſland abounds in Wine.</p>
                  <p>Among his Apothegms, theſe were ſome of the choiceſt. <hi>That it was a difficult thing to be Vertuous.</hi> Of which <hi>Simonides</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Protagoras</hi> make mention. <hi>That the Gods could not withſtand Neceſſity. That Command and Rule declare the Genius of the Man.</hi> Being demanded what was beſt? he anſwered, <hi>To do well what a Man is about.</hi> To <hi>Croeſus</hi>'s Queſtion, which was the largeſt Dominion? he anſwered <hi>That of the Varie-coloured Wood;</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103504:37"/>
the Laws written upon wooden Tables. He applauded thoſe Victories that were obtained without Bloodſhed.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Phocaicus,</hi> who told him they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a diligent frugal Man; <hi>We may ſeek</hi> ſaid he, <hi>long enough before we find one.</hi> To them that asked him what was moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? He anſwered, <hi>Time.</hi> To what was moſt obſcure? <hi>Futurity.</hi> To what was moſt Faithful? <hi>The Earth.</hi> To what was moſt Faithleſs? <hi>The Sea.</hi> He was wont to ſay, that it was the Duty of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Men, before Misfortunes happened, to foreſee, and prevent 'em. Of Stout and Couragious Men, to bear their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity Patiently. Never, ſaid he, talk of thy deſigns beforehand; leſt thy miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be derided: never to upbraid the misfortunes of any Man, for fear of juſt Reprehenſion: always to reſtore a Truſt committed to thy Care: never to backbite an Enemy, much leſs a Friend: to practiſe Piety, and honour Temperance, to love Truth, Fidelity, Experience, Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banity, Friendſhip and Diligence.</p>
                  <p>His Axioms were chiefly theſe: to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter a wicked Man with a Bow and Quiver full of Arrows; for that there was no truth to be expected from a loqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Tongue, where the Breaſt conceal'd a double Heart.</p>

                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:103504:38"/>He compoſed about ſix hundred Elegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac Verſes, and ſeveral Laws in Proſe for the Benefit of his Fellow-Citizens.</p>
                  <p>He flouriſhed in the forty ſecond Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad; and died in the third Year of the fifty ſecond <hi>Olympiad,</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Ariſtomenes,</hi> after he had lived above ſeventy Years, worn out and broken with old Age, and being buried in <hi>Lesbos,</hi> this Epitaph was engrav'd upon his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument.

                  <head>THE LIFE of <hi>BIAS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BIAS</hi> of <hi>Priene</hi> was the Son of <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus,</hi> and by <hi>Satyrus,</hi> preferred before all the reſt of the ſeven Wiſeman. <hi>Doris</hi> will not allow him to be born at <hi>Priene,</hi> but ſays he was a Stranger. But
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103504:39"/>
ſeveral affirm him to have been very Rich; and <hi>Phanodicus</hi> tells us, That he redeem'd the <hi>Meſſenian</hi> Virgins, being taken Captive, bred 'em at home as his own Daughters, and then ſent 'em back to their Parents, with every one a Portion in mony. Soon after the Golden <hi>Tripos</hi> being found, as we have already declar'd, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, To the <hi>Wiſeſt. Satyrus</hi> relates how that the <hi>Meſſenian</hi> Virgins, but others, and among the reſt <hi>Phanodicus,</hi> that their Parents came into the Aſſembly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what he had done, pronounced him the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> Man. Whereupon the <hi>Tripos</hi> was ſent to <hi>Bias,</hi> who beholding it, declar'd <hi>Apollo</hi> to be wiſer than himſelf, and ſo refus'd it. Others report that he Conſecrated it to <hi>Theban Hercules,</hi> for that either he was there born, or elſe becauſe <hi>Priene</hi> was a Colony of the <hi>Thebans;</hi> which <hi>Phanodicus</hi> alſo teſtifies.</p>
                  <p>It is reported, when <hi>Priene</hi> his native Country was beſieged by <hi>Alyattes,</hi> that <hi>Bias</hi> fatted two Mules for the nonce, and drave 'em into the Enemies Camp. Which <hi>Alyattes</hi> ſeeing, began to be amaz'd to ſee the pamper'd Beaſts ſo plump and ſmooth: However before he rais'd his Siege, he reſolv'd to ſend ſome perſon under the pretence of certain Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſpy the condition of the City. But
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103504:40"/>
                     <hi>Bias</hi> well aware of the King's deſign, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caus'd ſeveral heaps of Sand to be cover'd with Wheat, led the Meſſenger about to ſatisfie his Curioſity. Which being reported to the King, he preſently made a Peace with the <hi>Prieneans.</hi> Soon after when the King ſent for <hi>Bias</hi> to come to him, <hi>Bid him,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>go eat Onions, and that would make him weep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is reported to have been a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table pleader of Cauſes; but that ſtill he us'd the force of his Eloquence on the right ſide. Which <hi>Demodocus</hi> intimated when he ſaid, that an Orator was to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>Prienaean</hi> manner of Pleading: And <hi>Hipponax,</hi> when he gave this applauſe to any one, That he pleaded better than <hi>Bias</hi> of <hi>Priene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His death happen'd after this manner. He had in his old Age pleaded a Cauſe for a friend of his. After he had done, being tired with declaming, he reſted his Head in the Boſom of his Siſter's Son. In the mean time his Adverſary having plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt him, the Judges gave Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for his Client. But then ſo ſoon as the Court roſe, he was found dead in the Boſom of his Nephew. The City how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever made a ſumptuous Funeral for him, and caus'd this Anagram to be inſcrib'd upon his Monument.

                  <p>The choiceſt of his Sentences were theſe.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103504:41"/>
to a Man's Country was the gift of a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Mind; but that Wealth was to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the benignity of Fortune. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted him unfortunate that could not brook misfortune; and ſaid it was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the Soul to love and deſire impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, and to be unmindful of other Mens miſeries. Being ask'd what was difficult? He anſwer'd, <hi>Generouſly to brook an alteration for the worſe.</hi> Going a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age once with certain irreligious Perſons, who in the height of a raging Tempeſt loudly invok'd the Gods, <hi>Peace,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>leſt they come to underſtand that you are here.</hi> Being ask'd by an irreligious perſon, what irreligion was?

For that of two Friends, the one would prove an Enemy: but of two Enemies, the other would become a Friend. To the queſtion, What was moſt delightful for a Man to do?

his deſcent from <hi>Hercules;</hi> but that he excell'd the Hero in ſtrength and beauty: That he learn'd his Philoſophy in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that he had a Daughter, <hi>Cleobuline,</hi> who compos'd ſeveral <hi>Enigmaes</hi> in Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter Verſe: Of whom alſo <hi>Cratinus</hi> makes mention; in a Poem of the ſame name, writing in the Plural Number.

Cleobulus <hi>the</hi> Lindian, <hi>for equalling a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in diuturnity, to the courſe of Rivers, Vernal Flowers, the Beams of the Sun, the Light of the Moon, and Waves of the Sea? For all theſe things,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are inferiour to the Gods; but for a Stone, how eaſily is it broken by mortal hands?</hi> So that at laſt he calls <hi>Cleobulus</hi> in plain Terms a meer mad Man.

                  <p>His chiefeſt and moſt celebrated Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were theſe. That ignorance and multitude of words predominates in the greateſt part of Mankind; whereas Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and Seaſon would ſuffice. That vertue and honour ought to be our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtudy; and that we ought to avoid Vanity and Ingratitude. That we ought to give our Daughters that Education, that when they come to be married, they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103504:43"/>
ſhould be Virgins in Age, but Women in Prudence. That we ought to be kind to our Friends, to make 'em more our Friends; and to our Enemies, to gain their Friendſhip. That we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware being upbraided by our Friends, and enſnared by our Enemies. That when a Man goes abroad he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he has to do, and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns home, what he has done. That it was the duty of all Men to be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to hear than ſpeak; and to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Inſtruction rather than Illiterate. To reſtrain the Tongue from Slander and Back-biting; fly injuſtice, and adviſe the Public to the beſt advantage. To refrain voluptuous Pleaſure; act nothing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; give Children good Education, and reconcile Enmity. Neither to flatter nor contend with a Woman in the preſence of Strangers; the one being a ſign of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the other of Madneſs. To marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Equals; for he that marries a Wife ſuperiour to himſelf, muſt be a ſlave to her Relations. Not to be puft up with proſperity, nor to deſpair in want; and generouſly to brook the Changes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>

After ſome time, in the height of his Paſſion he threw his Wiſe under the Stairs, being then big with Child, and ſpurn'd her to death, incenſed thereto by his Harlots; which afterwards, nevertheleſ, he flung into the fire and burnt: And then renounc'd his Son <hi>Lycophron,</hi> and ſent him into <hi>Corcyra,</hi> for weeping at his Mother's Funeral.

                        <l>Extinct, and in the Grave laid low; for all</l>
                        <l>His Art and Wit could not prevent his Fall.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was one of his Admonitions to do nothing for Money's ſake, and to Princes that deſigned to reign ſecurely, to guard themſelves with the good Will of their Subjects, not with Arms. Being asked why he perſiſted to govern ſingly? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Becauſe 'twas equally dangerous to reſign, whether willingly or by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:103504:45"/>Some of his Apothegms were theſe. <hi>That Peace was a good thing, Precipitancy dangerous: That Democracy was better than Tyranny: That Pleaſure was Corruptible and Tranſitory; but Honour Immortal. In Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſaid he, be moderate, in Adverſity Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Be the ſame to thy Friends, as well in their Misfortunes as in all their Splendour. Be punctual to thy Promiſes. Beware of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Secret. Puniſh not only Offenders, but thoſe that deſign to Offend.</hi> He was the firſt that made uſe of a Life-guard, and that changed Democratical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into Tyranny, nor would he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit every one that deſired it, to live in the City, as <hi>Euphorus</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy.</p>
                  <p>He flouriſhed in his Prime, about the thirty third Olympiad, and reigned full Forty Years. Nevertheleſs <hi>Sotion Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and <hi>Pamphila</hi> affirm, That there were two <hi>Perianders,</hi> one a Tyrant, the other a <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> and that the Tyrant was an <hi>Ambraciote;</hi> however <hi>Neanthes</hi> of <hi>Cyzicum</hi> will have 'em to be Couſin Germans. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> alſo aſſerts the <hi>Corinthian</hi> to be the <hi>Wiſe Man;</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> denies it. Whoever it were he deſigned it ſeems to have digged down the Neck of the <hi>Iſthmus:</hi> and his Motto was this, <hi>Premeditation does all things.</hi> There are alſo extant ſeveral Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles

                  <p>
                     <hi>ANACHARSIS,</hi> a <hi>Scythian,</hi> was the Son of <hi>Gnurus,</hi> and Brother of <hi>Cadovidas</hi> King of the <hi>Scythians;</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being a <hi>Grecian;</hi> by which means he ſpoke both the Languages.</p>
                  <p>He wrote concerning the Laws of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> the Rites and Solemnities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Grecians,</hi> concerning a Frugal Life, and military affairs, to the Number
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103504:47"/>
of nine Hundred Verſes. Being bold and reſolute in Speaking, he gave occaſion to the Proverb, That whoever imitated his reſolution, was ſaid to ſpeak like a <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Soſicrates</hi> affirms that he arrived at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> about the Forty ſeventh <hi>Olympiad,</hi> at what time <hi>Eucrates</hi> was chief Magiſtrate of the City. <hi>Hermippus</hi> relates, That at the ſame time he went to <hi>Solon</hi>'s Houſe, and bid one of the Servants tell his Maſter, that <hi>Anacharſis</hi> was at the Door, deſirous of his Acquaintance, and, if it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, to be his Gueſt; which Meſſage the Servant repeating to <hi>Solon,</hi> was ſent back with this Anſwer, That Gueſts were made by thoſe that were in their own Country. Upon which, <hi>Anacharſis</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Houſe with this Complement; <hi>Now then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am in my own Country, and it belongs to me to make the Gueſts.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Solon</hi> admiring the dexterity of the Perſon, not only gave him admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but made him one of his moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends. Sometime after return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Scythia,</hi> while he endeavoured to alter the Laws of his Country, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the <hi>Grecian</hi> Conſtitutions, he was ſhot through the Body by his Brother, as he rode a Hunting, breathing forth theſe laſt words as he expired: For my Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103504:47"/>
ſake I was preſerved in <hi>Greece,</hi> but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, through Envy at Home, and in my Country. Others ſay that he was ſlain, as he was offering to the Gods after the <hi>Greek</hi> manner. However it were, the firſt report produced this Anagram of ours.
<q>
                        <l>Through many Regions view'd, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers paſt,</l>
                        <l>Great <hi>Anacharſis</hi> home returns at last;</l>

                        <l>The ruder <hi>Scythians</hi> to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Law.</l>
                        <l>But ere th' imperfect words he could impart,</l>
                        <l>A feather'd Arrow pierc'd his bleeding heart.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>He was wont to ſay, that the Vine bare three ſorts of Cluſters: the firſt of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the ſecond of Debauchery; and the third of Diſcontent and Repentance. He admired how it came to paſs, that in the Contentions among the <hi>Grecian</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, the worſt Artiſts were ſtill made the Judges of the Diſpute. Being asked how a Man might beſt preſerve himſelf Sober? He anſwered, <hi>By ſetting before the Eyes the evil Behaviour of thoſe that drank to Exceſs.</hi> He wondred why the <hi>Grecian</hi> Legiſlators enacting Laws againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, honoured the Wreſtlers, that daily miſchiefed one another. When he underſtood the Plancks of a Ship to be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103504:48"/>
but four Fingers thick, he ſaid that was the diſtance between Death, and thoſe that went by Sea. He called Oil the <hi>Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Madneſs,</hi> obſerving that the Wreſtlers being anointed with it, were the more enraged one againſt another. <hi>How comes it to paſs,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that they who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Lying, Lye ſo frequently in the common Victualling-Houſes?</hi> He was wont to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why the <hi>Greeks</hi> at the beginning of their Banquets, drank in little Cups; but when their Stomachs were full, ſtill quaff'd on in large Bowls? Upon his Statues this admonition is generally engraved, <hi>to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Tongue, the Belly, and the Privy-Members.</hi> Being asked whether there were any Fifes in <hi>Scythia,</hi> he made anſwer, <hi>No, nor any Vines neither.</hi> To the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion what ſort of Ships were ſafeſt? He anſwered, <hi>Thoſe that were come into Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another thing he alſo admired among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that they left the Smoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the Mountains, and brought the Wood into the City. To the queſtion which were moſt, the Living or the Dead? he replied with another Queſtion, in the number of which they ranked thoſe that ventured by Sea? To an <hi>Athenian</hi> that upbraided him for being a <hi>Scythian,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, <hi>My Country indeed is a reproach to

me, but thou to thy Country.</hi> To the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, What was good or bad in Men? He anſwer'd, <hi>The Tongue.</hi> He us'd to ſay, 'twas better to have one good friend, than many that were Men of no worth. He accounted the Market a place appointed for Men to deceive one another, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play their Avarice.

                  <p>
                     <hi>EPimenides</hi> (according to <hi>Theopompus</hi> and ſeveral others) was the Son of <hi>Phaeſtius:</hi> Of <hi>Doſiades,</hi> as ſome ſay; as others, of <hi>Ageſarchus:</hi> However it were, he was by Birth a <hi>Cretan,</hi> born in <hi>Gnoſſus,</hi> where according to the nature of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, he is ſaid to have chang'd his ſhape.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of him, that when he was young, his Father ſent him a field to fetch home a Wether; but that he in the heat of the day, turning aſide out of the way enter'd into a Cave, and there falling a ſleep, ſlept on for fifty ſeven years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When he awak'd, he went to ſeek the Wether, as one that believ'd he had ſlept not above an hour or two; but not finding it, he return'd to the Village. Where when he ſaw an unexpected change of unknown Faces, and found the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103504:50"/>
Land in the poſſeſſion of a ſtranger, he haſten'd to the City. At what time when he enter'd his own Houſe, he was ask'd who he was, and what he would have? He began to be in a deep amaze, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much ado known by his younger Brother, who was now grown into years, from him he underſtood the whole Truth. Upon which his fame flying over all <hi>Greece,</hi> he was look't upon as one belov'd of the Gods. Whence it came to paſs, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> being afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a ſore Peſtilence, upon the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which they receiv'd from the <hi>Oracle,</hi> that their City was to be purify'd, they ſent <hi>Nicias,</hi> the Son of <hi>Niceratus,</hi> into <hi>Creet</hi> to bring away <hi>Epimenides.</hi> Who coming in the forty ſeventh <hi>Olympiad,</hi> purify'd the City, and ſo the Plague ceas'd. To which purpoſe he took certain black and white Sheep, and driving 'em to the next Village, let 'em go which way they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their own accord, ordering thoſe that follow'd 'em, to kill 'em in the place where they reſted, and then to Sacrifice 'em to the peculiar Deity. Inſomuch that to this day there are to be ſeen ſeveral Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars in ſeveral of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Villages, erected to an unknown Deity, in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Expiation. But by others, the cauſe of that Peſtilence is attributed to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103504:51"/>
the <hi>Cylonian</hi> Fact, for which two young Men <hi>Cratinus</hi> and <hi>Cteſibius</hi> dy'd, and ſo the City was freed from the preſent Calamity. Thereupon the <hi>Athenians</hi> order'd a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to <hi>Epimenides,</hi> and provided him a Ship to carry him back to <hi>Creet.</hi> But he refuſing the money, deſired only to make a League of Friendſhip between the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and the <hi>Gnoſſians;</hi> and ſo returning home, within a ſhort time after he dy'd, in the hundred fifty ſeventh year of his Age, according to <hi>Phaſgo,</hi> in his Hiſtory of long Livers: As the <hi>Cretans</hi> relate, in his two hundred ninety ninth year: But, as <hi>Xenophanes</hi> the <hi>Colophonian</hi> teſtifies that he heard by report, in his hundred fifty fourth.</p>
                  <p>He wrote the Hiſtory of the <hi>Curetes,</hi> and <hi>Corybants,</hi> and the Pedigree of the Gods, to the number of ſix thouſand Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Alſo concerning the building and furniture of the Ship <hi>Argos,</hi> and <hi>Jaſon</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>Colchos</hi> to the number of ſix thouſand five hundred Verſes. In Proſe he wrote of the Sacrifices and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the <hi>Cretans;</hi> and of <hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> to the number of four thouſand Verſes. He alſo erected among the <hi>Athenians</hi> a Temple to the Venerable Gods, as <hi>Lobon</hi> teſtifies in his Treatiſe of the Poets. He is alſo ſaid to be the firſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103504:51"/>
that erected Temples, and purify'd Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Fields by Proceſſions and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
                  <p>Some there are, who aſſert that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſlept, but only retir'd himſelf out of the way, buſily employ'd about the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Roots. There is alſo an Epiſtle of his to <hi>Solon,</hi> concerning the Republic which <hi>Minos</hi> erected among the <hi>Cretans.</hi> But <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Magneſian,</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Poets, denies the Epiſtle to be Legitimate, as not being writt'n in the <hi>Cretan,</hi> but <hi>Attic</hi> Language, and that not very ancient neither. However I found another Epiſtle of his in theſe words.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103504:53"/>
and the Gods; more than that, he is famous for many wonderful things; for as he was walking near the Sea-ſhoar upon the Sand, ſeeing a Ship under Sail right afore the Wind, he foretold, that the Veſſel would ſink in a ſhort time; which ſoon after happen'd in his ſight. Another time, after he had drank a draught of Water drawn out of a Well, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told an Earthquake within three days, which fell out, as he ſaid. Travelling thro' <hi>Meſſana</hi> to <hi>Olympia,</hi> he advis'd his Friend and Hoſt <hi>Perilaus</hi> to depart from thence with all his Family; which he neglecting to do, <hi>Meſſana</hi> was ſoon after taken by the Enemy. He was wont to tell the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi> that neither Gold or Silver were to be valu'd or admir'd. And the ſame night that <hi>Hercules</hi> commanded the Kings to obey <hi>Pherecydes,</hi> the Deity gave him notice of it in a Dream. However, ſome there are do aſcribe theſe things to <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Hermippus</hi> hath this further of <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recydes;</hi> that in the War between the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſians</hi> and <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he being deſirous that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſhould have the better, demanded of one that travel'd upon the Road, of what place he was? who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Then draw me, ſaid he, by the Legs, and lay me in the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

of the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> and bid thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens, after they have obtain'd the Victory, take care to bury me in that place; adding withal that he was <hi>Phere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydes:</hi> which when the Paſſenger had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to his Neighbours, they were in great hopes of victory. The next day they overthrew the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> and being Victors found <hi>Pherecydes</hi> dead, whom they not only honourably interr'd, but held in great veneration afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay that going to <hi>Delphos</hi> from <hi>Corycium,</hi> he threw himſelf from the top of a Mountain. But <hi>Ariſtoxenus</hi> writing of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and his familiar Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, affirms, that he dy'd of a ſickneſs, and was buried by <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> Some ſay that he ended his days of the Lowſie Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and that when <hi>Pythagoras</hi> coming to viſit him, ask'd him how he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he anſwer'd, thruſting his finger through the door, <hi>my skin will tell thee.</hi> Whence the Expreſſion was ever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken by the Philoſophers in a bad ſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Andro</hi> the <hi>Epheſian</hi> aſſerts that there were two of the ſame name, both <hi>Syrians.</hi> One, an Aſtrologer; the other a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt, whom <hi>Pythagoras</hi> admir'd.

the other was an <hi>Athenian,</hi> and a writer of Genealogies. Moreover there is yet extant a little Treatiſe written by <hi>Phere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydes</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> concerning the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all things, which begins thus.</p>

                  <p>This Perſon was not only eminent for his Birth and Riches, but for the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of his aſpiring Mind. For he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd his Patrimony to his Relations; at what time being by them tax'd for neglecting his Eſtate; <hi>What then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>are not you ſufficiently able to take care of it?</hi> Soon after he left 'em all, and retir'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Contemplation of Nature, not minding publick or private Affairs.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103504:58"/>
Country? Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>no Man more,</hi> poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Heav'ns.</p>
                  <p>He is ſaid to have been twenty years of Age when <hi>Xerxes</hi> invaded <hi>Greece,</hi> and to have liv'd ſeventy two. But <hi>Apollodorus</hi> in his Chronicle, affirms him to have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in his prime in the Seventieth <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad,</hi> and that in the firſt year of the Se-Seventy eighth <hi>Olympiad</hi> he ended his days.</p>
                  <p>He began to divulge his Philoſophical Exerciſes at <hi>Athens,</hi> under <hi>Callias,</hi> in the twentieth year of his Age, as <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> reports, in his Compendium of the <hi>Athenian Rulers:</hi> Where, they ſay, he continu'd thirty years.</p>
                  <p>He affirm'd the Sun to be a maſſy Plate of Red-hot Iron, bigger than the <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus.</hi> Which ſome aſſert to have been the Opinion of <hi>Tantalus</hi> before him. He held that the Moon was full of Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Mountains and Vallies; and that the Principles of all things were endu'd with ſimilitude of Parts. For that as the duſt and filings of Gold might be embody'd into a Maſs; ſo was the Univerſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of little Bodies conſiſting of ſimilar Particles. That heavy Bodies poſſeſs'd the lowermoſt place, as the Earth; Light things the uppermoſt, as Fire; and the Middlemoſt he aſſign'd to Air and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103504:59"/>
That the Sea lay below the Earth, which was broad; the moiſture being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled by the Sun. That the motions of the Stars were at firſt diſorderly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, as it were over the Top of the Earth, or the <hi>Pole</hi> which always appears: but that afterwards, the change of <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> happen'd: That the Milky-way was only the Reflexion of the Sun, where none of the Stars could caſt their Light. That Comets were only the Meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or Conjunctions of all the Planets ſending forth flames of Fire, which danc'd to and fro according to the Motion of the Air. That the Rarifying the Air by the Sun was the occaſion of Winds. That Thunder was a compreſſion of the Clouds; Light'ning a bruſhing of the Clouds one againſt another. That an Earthquake was the return of the Air from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Parts. That all Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſprung at firſt from a mixture of Moiſt, Hot and Earthy; and then begat each other. That Males were generated in the right, Females in the left ſide of the Womb.</p>
                  <p>It is reported that he foretold the fall of the Stone, near the River of <hi>Aegos,</hi> call'd <hi>Aegos-Potamos,</hi> which he ſaid would fall from the <hi>Sun.</hi> Whence <hi>Euripides,</hi> who was his <hi>Diſciple,</hi> in his fable of <hi>Phaeton,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:103504:59"/>
calls the Sun a <hi>Golden Maſs,</hi> or <hi>Clod of Gold.</hi> Coming to <hi>Olympia,</hi> he ſate himſelf down, covered with a Leathern Hide, as if it had been going to rain; and being asked, whether he thought the Sea would ever overflow the Mountains of <hi>Lampſacus? Yes;</hi> ſaid he, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it want time.</hi> To the queſtion, to what purpoſe he was Born? He replied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>To contemplate the Sun, the Moon, and the Heavens.</hi> To one that told him, he had loſt the <hi>Athenians. Not ſo,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>but they me.</hi> Beholding <hi>Mauſolus</hi>'s Tomb, <hi>Aſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Monument,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is a great Eſtate Metamorphoſed into Stone.</hi> To one who griev'd that he ſhould dye in a foreign Country, <hi>The Deſcent,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Shades is every where alike.</hi> He was the firſt, as <hi>Phavorinus</hi> relates in his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Hiſtory, who affirmed that <hi>Homer's</hi> Poem was compoſed of Vertue and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. To which Opinion of his <hi>Metrodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> of <hi>Lampſacus,</hi> his intimate Friend, is ſaid to have contributed very much, who was the firſt that eſſayed to write of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things in Poetry. However <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> was the firſt who ever publiſhed any Treatiſe written upon that Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Silenus</hi> alſo farther reports, in his firſt Book of Hiſtory, that a Stone fell from Heaven in the time that <hi>Dimylus</hi> Ruled;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103504:60"/>
at what time <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> aver'd, that the whole Heaven was Compoſed of Stones; only that the Swiftneſs of the Circumrota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fixed 'em in their Places, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would ſuddenly looſen and fall down.</p>
                  <p>But as to his being called in Queſtion, there are various Reports. For <hi>Sotion</hi> in his Succeſſion of the Philoſophers, aſſerts that he was accuſed of Irreligion by <hi>Cleo,</hi> becauſe he held the Sun to be a Red-hot Maſs of Iron: for which, when <hi>Pericles</hi> his Scholar defended him, he was fin'd fifty Talents, and exiled his Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Satyrus</hi> alſo in his <hi>Lives,</hi> reports that he was accuſed by <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who always oppoſed <hi>Pericles,</hi> not only of Impiety, but Treaſon; and in his abſence was Condemned to Death. At what time when he received the News, both of the Sentence pronounced againſt him, and the Death of his Sons; as to his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he anſwered, <hi>That it was no more than what Nature had long before decreed, that both he and they ſhould Dye.</hi> As to the Death of his Sons, he replied, <hi>That he well knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had not begotten 'em to be Immortal.</hi> Yet ſome there are, who attribute theſe Sayings to <hi>Salon,</hi> others to <hi>Zenophon.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Demetrius Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>areus</hi> records in his Treatiſe of old Age, that he buried his Sons with his own Hands. On the other
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103504:60"/>
ſide <hi>Hermippus</hi> relates, that he was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, in order to his Execution. But then <hi>Pericles</hi> coming into the Aſſembly, asked the Rulers, whether they could accuſe him of anything that reached his Life? who returning no anſwer; Why then ſaid he, I am his Diſciple, and therefore beware how ye deſtroy a Man impeached only by Malice and Calumny, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take my Advice, and let him go. Which was accordingly done. However he took the affront ſo hainouſly, that he would not ſtay in the City.</p>
                  <p>In oppoſition to this, <hi>Jerome</hi> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of <hi>Commentaries,</hi> aſſerts, That <hi>Pericles</hi> cauſed him to be brought into Court, tottering every Step he went, as being ſpent with Age and long Sickneſs; and that he was acquitted rather through the Compaſſion of the Judges, than that he was found innocent of what was laid to his Charge. So ſtrangely do Authors vary in their Reports concerning his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                  <p>He was alſo thought to have born <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> a grudge, for refuſing him a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which he deſired. At length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring to <hi>Lampſacus,</hi> he there ended his days. And being asked by the Magiſtrates of the City whether he had any particular Command to lay upon 'em, he deſired
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103504:61"/>
that the Boys might have Liberty to Play, every Year during the Month wherein he died, which Cuſtom is obſerved to this Day. He was honourably interred by the <hi>Lampſacenſes,</hi> who cauſed this Epigram to be engraved upon his Monument.

He was the firſt that introduced natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy out of <hi>Ionia</hi> into <hi>Athens,</hi> and was therefore called the Naturaliſt. However he was the laſt Profeſſor of natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, <hi>Socrates</hi> ſoon after advancing the Study of <hi>Ethics,</hi> of which nevertheleſs, he himſelf, in his Life-time, did not ſeem to have been utterly Ignorant; for he made ſeveral of his publick Readings, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subjects of Law, of Morality and Juſtice. Which being borrowed from him, and propagated by <hi>Socrates,</hi> he was therefore look'd upon as the firſt Inventor of <hi>Ethics.</hi> He aſſerted two Principles of Generation, Heat and Cold; and that Living Animals were firſt created out of Mud; and that <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> did not proceed from Nature, but from the Law. For all which he gave theſe particular Reaſons; Firſt, that the Water being melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſſolved by the Heat, when it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103504:62"/>
came to be thickned by the fiery Mixture, made the Earth; but being fluid, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Air: whence it came to paſs, that the one was curbed by the circular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air, the other by that of the Fire. Then, that living Animals were begotten out of the hot Earth, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Mud into a Subſtance, almoſt like Milk, for their Nouriſhment: and that after the ſame manner Men were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. He was the firſt who defined the Voice of Man to be the Repercuſſion of the Air; and affirmed that the Sea was a vaſt Body of Water, ſtrained through the Earth, into the Cavities of the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Globe, that the Sun was the bigger of the Stars, and the <hi>whole</hi> was infinite.</p>

                  <p>For as <hi>Idomeneus</hi> relates, he was a very ſmart, and ready Orator; only the thirty Tyrants forbid all teaching or practiſing the Art of Rhetoric, as <hi>Zenophon</hi> teſtifies: And he is ſeverely cenſur'd by <hi>Ariſtopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> as one that could make a good Cauſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103504:63"/>
of a bad one. Moreover, as <hi>Phavorinus</hi> writes in his <hi>General Hiſtory,</hi> he was the firſt who, together with <hi>Aeſchines,</hi> his Scholar, taught <hi>Rhetorick</hi> in his Publick School. Which <hi>Idomeneus</hi> alſo teſtifies in his Life of <hi>Socrates.</hi> He was alſo the firſt who diſcours'd of the Government to be obſerv'd in Humane Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and the firſt of the Philoſophers who was publickly Executed after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. And <hi>Aristoxenus</hi> alſo the Son of <hi>Spintharus</hi> reports him to have been the firſt that demanded money for teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But <hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Byzantium</hi> relates, that <hi>Crito</hi> brought him off from that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Trade of begging, and growing in love with his great Parts, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his Mind, became his bountiful Scholar. After he had cry'd down Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy, as neither beneficial nor profitable to Mankind, he introduc'd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks, which he publickly taught in the Work-Houſes, and Market-places; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the People only to ſtudy that, which according to the Verſe in <hi>Homer,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſuch was his vehemency in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that he would frequently bend
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103504:64"/>
his fiſts, knock his knuckles one againſt another, and twitch the hairs of his Beard from his Chin, after ſuch a ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the People contemning his antic Geſtures, would laugh at him, and offer him twenty affronts; which nevertheleſs he bore with an extraordinary Patience. Inſomuch that once being ſpurn'd and kick'd by a certain Perſon, to another that admir'd at his forbearance, he made anſwer, <hi>What if an Aſs had kick'd me, ſhould I have preſently ſu'd him for it?</hi> Thus much <hi>Demetrius.</hi> He never thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to travel, unleſs, when any occaſion call'd him to the Wars. All the reſt of his time he ſtaid at home, and ſpent it wholly in converſing and diſputing with his familiar Friends; not ſo much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their own Opinions, as to find out the Truth himſelf. To <hi>Euripides,</hi> who ask'd him what he thought of a Treatiſe of <hi>Heraclitus</hi>'s, which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to read, he reply'd, <hi>Thoſe things that I underſtand are Genuine and Maſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He alſo ſerv'd in the War againſt <hi>Potidaea</hi> by Sea; in which Expedition he is reported to have ſtood a whole night in one Poſture. More than that, after a ſingle Victory obtain'd by his own Valour, he yielded the honour of the action to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> by whom he was highly eſteem'd, as <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> relates, in his fourth Book of <hi>Ancient Delights.

                  </p>
                  <p>He was a perſon reſolv'd and obſtinate in his Opinions, and a great Champion of <hi>Democracy,</hi> which is apparent from hence, that he withſtood both <hi>Critias,</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who commanded <hi>Leontes</hi> the <hi>Salami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> a rich Man, to be ſent for, that he might be put to death; and was the ſole Perſon that adventur'd to pronounce judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contrary to the ten moſt powerful Captains; and when the Priſon doors
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103504:65"/>
were ſet open to him, to go where he pleas'd, refus'd; ſeverely chid thoſe that wept for him; and when fetter'd, molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the fury of his Enemies with his ſoft and ſmooth Language. He was a perſon contented with his preſent condition, and Majeſtic. So that, as <hi>Pamphila</hi> relates, when <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had giv'n him a large piece of ground whereon to build him a Houſe; ſaid he to his Benefactor, <hi>Hadst thou given me a pair of Shoes, and a Hide to make 'em my ſelf, would it not appear very ridiculous in me to accept it?</hi> And when he ſaw the vaſt variety of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that were put to ſale among the Multitude, he was wont to ſay to himſelf, <hi>How many things are there in the World of which I have no need!</hi> And it was his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom frequently to repeat the following <hi>Tambicks.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Silver and Purple, breeding ſo much ſtrife,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>He deſpis'd <hi>Archelaus</hi> the <hi>Macedonian, Scopas</hi> the <hi>Crannonian,</hi> and <hi>Eurylochus</hi> the <hi>Lariſſaean,</hi> refuſing the money which they ſent him, nor vouchſafing ſo much as to give 'em a viſit. So orderly and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his Dyet, that in all the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions which happen'd at <hi>Athens</hi> in his time, he never was ſick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:103504:65"/>
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, that he married two Wives; the firſt <hi>Xantippe,</hi> by whom he had a Son call'd <hi>Lamprocles.</hi> The ſecond <hi>Myrto,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Aristides</hi> the <hi>Just;</hi> whom he marry'd without any Portion; and by whom he had <hi>Sophroniſcus,</hi> and <hi>Menexenus.</hi> Some there are who affirm, That <hi>Myrto</hi> was his firſt Wife; though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers report that he was marry'd to both at the ſame time; and among the reſt <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrus,</hi> and <hi>Hieronymus</hi> the <hi>Rhodian.</hi> For it is ſaid, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> finding a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Men, and that there was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of propagation, made a Decree, that any Man might marry one Town-born Wife, and get Children of another; which <hi>Socrates</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>He had a loftineſs of mind that ſcorn'd all thoſe who ridicul'd him. He glory'd in his frugality, and was frequently wont to ſay, That he who eat with an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, had the leaſt need of variety of Food. And he that drank with a Guſto, leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired change of Liquor: And that he who wanted leaſt, came neareſt to the Gods. And this we may learn from the Comoedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not aware of the Encomiums which they give him, while they labour to vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie him. As for Example in <hi>Ariſtopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Amipſias</hi> introducing him in a long Thread-bare Cloak, thus beſpeaks him: <q>O <hi>Socrates,</hi> of a few Men the beſt, of many the vaineſt, and art thou at laſt come amongſt us with thy wonted patience? How cameſt thou by this Winter Cloak? Certainly this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune befell thee through the Villany of the Leather-Dreſſer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we muſt ſay this of him, that he would never flatter any Man for a Meals Meat. And <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> does but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Grandeur and Loftineſs of his mind, where he ſays,
<q>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:103504:66"/>
                        <l>With pompous Gate he ſtruts along the ſtreets,</l>
                        <l>And frowns and ſcowles on every one he meets.</l>
                        <l>And though no Shoes upon his Feet he wears,</l>
                        <l>Yet ſtill his haughty Count'nance nothing fears.</l>

                  <p>However ſometimes, to humour the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, you ſhould ſee him appear in ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and modeſt Habit: as when he went to viſit <hi>Agatho,</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Sympoſium.</hi> And ſuch was his Eloquence, that it was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevalent whether to perſwade or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſame thing. Inſomuch that when he diſputed with <hi>Theaetetus,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Knowledge, he ſent him away like one that thought himſelf inſpir'd. And with <hi>Euthyphron</hi> who proſecuted his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had ſummoned him for Tryal at ſuch a day, diſcourſing concerning Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Piety, he diverted him from his purpoſe, and made him let fall his Suit. Convincing <hi>Lyſis</hi> alſo, he made him a moſt Moral Man. For he had a peculiar facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to adapt his words to his matter. And <hi>Lamprocles,</hi> ſo undutiful and cruel to his Mother, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> relates, by ſoft per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion he overcame, and brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence her. The ſame <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> alſo teſtifies, that he diverted <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Plato,</hi> from medling with State Affairs, by convincing him of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103504:67"/>
his Ignorance, and want of Experience. On the other ſide, he admoniſh'd and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-perſwaded <hi>Charmides</hi> to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to public buſineſs, as being fit for it. He alſo encourag'd the great Captain <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> by ſhewing him the Cocks of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> the <hi>Barber,</hi> and <hi>Callias,</hi> fighting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore <hi>Glauconides</hi> thought him fit to walk about the City, but no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than a <hi>Pheaſant</hi> or a <hi>Peacock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was wont to ſay, 'twas to him a wonder, that every Man ſhould be able to utter thoſe things which he has in his mind; but could not be able to tell how many Friends he had: So negligent we were in the obſervance of our Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Euclides</hi> that apply'd himſelf with a more than ordinary diligence to cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Diſputes, <hi>O</hi> Euclides, ſaid he, <hi>thou knoweſt how to make uſe of Sophiſters, but not of Men.</hi> For he look'd upon it as an idle ſtudy for a Man to mind thoſe things, as <hi>Plato</hi> records in his <hi>Euthydemus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He refus'd the Servants that <hi>Charmides</hi> offer'd him, to attend him when he went abroad; and ſome there are who report, that he deſpis'd the beauty of <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> Only he extoll'd Leiſure, as the beſt thing which a Man could enjoy, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> witneſſes, in his <hi>Sympoſium.</hi>

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:103504:67"/>He farther held, that there was but one <hi>Chief Good,</hi> which was <hi>Knowledge:</hi> And one thing Evil above all the reſt, and that was <hi>Ignorance.</hi> Riches and Nobility of Birth, he ſaid, were ſo far from deſerving to be valu'd or eſteem'd, that they were rather the Fountain of all miſchief. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to one who told him that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> was a <hi>Thracian, Why, couldſt thou believe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that ſuch a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſon could have been born of two</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians? He order'd <hi>Crito</hi> to redeem <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> whom Captivity had reduc'd to ply at the Brothel-Houſes for a Livelihood, and made him a great Philoſopher. At his leiſure hours he learn'd to ſing to the Harp; affirming it was no ſhame for a Man to learn what he knew not before. He accuſtom'd himſelf very much to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, eſteeming that ſort of Exerciſe, as very much conducing to Health. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, That the Deity had endu'd him with the gift of Fore-knowledge: And it was one of his Maxims, That <hi>to begin well</hi> was not only no ſmall thing, but the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing of all; and that he only knew this, that he knew <hi>Nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being ask'd, What was the Vertue of a young Man? He anſwer'd, <hi>Nothing to Exceſs.</hi> Then for Geometry, he ſaid, it behov'd Men to ſtudy it ſo long, till
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103504:68"/>
they were able to give and take Land.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Euripides</hi> in his <hi>Auga</hi> repeated this Expreſſion concerning Vertue, '<hi>Twas beſt to let her go at Random;</hi> He roſe up and left the Stage, ſaying as he went off, <hi>That it was a ridiculous thing to deem a loſt Slave worthy to be ſought after and found out again, but to ſuffer vertue to periſh.</hi> To the Queſtion, whether beſt to marry or not, he anſwer'd, <hi>Let a Man do which he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he will repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a ſaying that he wonder'd at Stone-Cutters, who endeavour'd to make the Stones as like to Men as they could, but never took care to prevent their being like Stones themſelves.</p>
                  <p>He would be always exhorting young Men to view themſelves in their Looking-Glaſſes; that if they ſaw themſelves fair and comely, they might render themſelves worthy of their Beauty: But if deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they might hide the defects of the Body, by improvements of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>Having invited certain wealthy Perſons to Supper, and perceiving <hi>Xantippe</hi> aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his ſhort Commons, <hi>Come, come,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>never let it trouble thee; If they be moderate and thrifty Men, they will bear with me: If they be proud and luxurious, we ſhall have no occaſion to mind 'em.</hi>

When <hi>Aeſchines</hi> told him he was poor, and had nothing elſe to give him but himſelf; <hi>How!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and art thou not ſenſible that thou giveſt me the greatest gift thou can'st e'er expect to be Maſter of in this World?</hi>

But then the Sons of <hi>Xenophon</hi> privately withdrew themſelves with a ſmall retinue, and came to <hi>Lepreum.

At the ſame time the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> having reſolv'd to aſſiſt the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> he ſent his Sons to <hi>Athens</hi> to ſerve in the Wars. For they had been both bred up at <hi>Sparta,</hi> as <hi>Diocles</hi> relates in his Lives of the Philoſophers. As for <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> he eſcap'd out of the Battel, without performing any remarkable Atchievment. But <hi>Gryllus,</hi> ſerving among the Cavalry (for it was at the Battle of <hi>Mantinea</hi>) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had behav'd himſelf with a more than ordinary courage, dy'd valiantly in the Throng of his Enemies, as <hi>Euphorus</hi> relates in the five and twentieth Book of his Hiſtory, <hi>Ctephiſodotus</hi> then leading the Horſe, and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> commanding the Foot: And the ſame Fate befalling the <hi>Theban</hi> General; for <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was ſlain in the ſame fight.</p>
                  <p>It is reported, That when the news of the defeat was brought to <hi>Xenophon,</hi> he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103504:75"/>
was then offering Sacrifices with a Crown upon his Head; at what time, when he heard that his Son <hi>Gryllus</hi> was ſlain, he laid aſide his Crown; but afterwards, finding by the continuance of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he had bravely fought, and dy'd honourably, he put on his Crown again. Some report; that he did not ſo much as ſhed a Tear, only ſigh'd out theſe words, <hi>I know that my Son was not Immortal. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> alſo tells us, That an infinite number of Perſons wrote the Praiſes of <hi>Gryllus,</hi> and beſtow'd Epitaphs upon him, partly to celebrate his Name, and partly to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his Father. <hi>Hermippus</hi> moreover aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, That <hi>Socrates</hi> wrote an Encomium of <hi>Gryllus,</hi> which <hi>Timon</hi> thus derides;

                  <p>He was very Religious, a conſtant Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer of Sacrifices; one who was able to judge of Religion, and an exact Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Socrates</hi> in every thing. He wrote about forty ſeveral Treatiſes; the <hi>Aſcent</hi> of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> annexing a Prologue to every particular Book, but not any to the <hi>Whole;</hi> the Education of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> the Tranſactions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and ſeveral Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; his <hi>Sympoſium,</hi> and <hi>Oeconomics.</hi> He wrote alſo of <hi>Horſemanſhip,</hi> and of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;</hi> an Apology for <hi>Socrates;</hi> of <hi>Seeds; Hiero,</hi> or the Tyrant; <hi>Ageſilaus;</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemon:</hi> Which latter <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Magneſian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to be <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s. It is reported alſo, that when it was in his power to have ſtifl'd the Works of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> he was the firſt who made 'em public to the World, for the honour of the Author. He was call'd the <hi>Athenian</hi> Muſe, for the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103504:76"/>
ſweetneſs of his Style. For which he was envy'd by <hi>Plato,</hi> as we ſhall declare in his Life. Nor could we our ſelves refrain his commendations in the following Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams.

                  <p>Neither had <hi>Aristippus</hi> a good opinion of his Dialogues; for as he was reading 'em at <hi>Megara,</hi> he cry'd out in a kind of a Paſſion, <hi>Curſed Rogue, what put thee into this humour?</hi>

                  <p>However it were, moſt certain it is, that he was an exact and exquiſite Orator, as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103504:78"/>
appears by the Oration which he made in defence of the Father of <hi>Phaeax,</hi> who was General of the Horſe; and for that he ſtrove to imitate <hi>Gorgias Leontinus,</hi> not without good Succeſs.

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Panaetius</hi> could not be his Enemy, for he is the only perſon of all the <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,</hi> who will allow ſo much as thoſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues to be Legitimate, where the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is fram'd under the names of <hi>Plato, Xenophon, Antiſthenes,</hi> and <hi>Aeſchines;</hi> but very much queſtions thoſe that go under the names of <hi>Phaedo,</hi> and <hi>Euclid;</hi> and for all the reſt, he utterly rejects 'em.</p>

Antipater</hi>'s Diſciple was <hi>Epitimedes</hi> the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renean;</hi> whoſe Hearer was <hi>Paraebates;</hi> and his Diſciple <hi>Hegeſias,</hi> Surnam'd <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanatus,</hi> and <hi>Aniceris,</hi> by whom <hi>Plato</hi> was redeem'd.</p>
                  <p>Now they who embrace the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> and are from him call'd <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaics,</hi> hold theſe following Opinions. In the firſt place they aſſert two pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the Mind, <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> the one a ſmooth, the other a rough Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Pleaſure and Pleaſure; and that no Pleaſure has any thing more peculiar to it than another, as being that which all living Creatures deſire: The other, which is Pain, they all endeavour to avoid. As for the pleaſure of the Body, which they aſſert to be a ſort of <hi>End,</hi> as <hi>Panae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> relates in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Sects,</hi> they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103504:87"/>
do not allow it to be that ſedate Pleaſure occaſion'd by the privation of Pain, and ceſſation of Trouble, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, and maintains to be the End. For they hold that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Felicity:</hi> For the End is only pleaſure in part; but Felicity is a compos'd Body conſiſting of all the parts of Pleaſure, into which number are to be reckon'd both <hi>past</hi> and <hi>preſent,</hi> Moreover that Pleaſure in part is to be deſir'd for it ſelf; happineſs, not for it ſelf, but for the ſake of all the pleaſures divided. Now for proof that the End is Pleaſure, we find our ſelves all accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to it from Children, not of our own choice, but by the Impulſe of Nature, and that when we enjoy it, we ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther. On the other ſide, that there is nothing which we ſeek more to avoid than its contrary, <hi>Pain.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that Pleaſure is a <hi>Good,</hi> though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the vileſt Actions, as <hi>Hipp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us</hi> relates in his Treatiſe of Sects. For though the act be Evil, yet the Pleaſure that proceeds from it, is deſirable and good. But the removal of Pain, is not by them, as by <hi>Epicurus,</hi> taken for Pleaſure; nor is the ceſſation of Pleaſure by them accounted Pain; for that both conſiſt in Motion; but neither ceſſation of Pain,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103504:87"/>
nor privation of Pleaſure are Motions; ſeeing that ceſſation of Pain, is no more than as it were the condition of him that ſleeps. Moreover they affirm that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of Mind can make no choice of Pleaſure, nor do they believe that all the Pleaſures and Pains of the Mind proceed from the Pains and Pleaſures of the Body. For that in the Soul, there is a joy for the Proſperity of our Country, beſides the pleaſure we take in our own private hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Nor do they believe the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of paſt, or the expectance of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoyments to be Pleaſure, which was the Opinion of <hi>Epicurus:</hi> for time puts a ſtop to the motion of the Soul. Nor will they allow Pleaſure to conſiſt in ſeeing or hearing only: For we hear with delight thoſe that feign a Lamentation, but a real Mourning is diſpleaſing to our Ears. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they call the privation of Pain or Pleaſure the <hi>Middle Condition</hi> between Both. However they hold the Pleaſures of the Body far to excell thoſe of the Mind, and that therefore the pains of the Body are more grievous; and whence it happens that offenders are more tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with corporeal Puniſhment. For pain is more grievous to endure, pleaſure more familiar and grateful; which was the reaſon that ſome took greater care of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103504:88"/>
their Bodies than of their Souls. And therefore, ſeeing pleaſure is to be deſir'd for the ſake of this Pleaſure, the efficient cauſes of ſome pleaſures many times are troubleſome; and a croud of pleaſures becomes moſt irkſome, as not creating any true Felicity.</p>
                  <p>They would not have a Wiſe Man to live always in pleaſure, nor a Fool alway<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in pain; but for the moſt part: And they think it ſufficient for a Man to enjoy the ſatisfaction of one Pleaſure at a time.</p>
                  <p>As for Wiſdom, they hold it to be a Bleſſing, but not to be deſir'd of it ſelf, but for the ſake of thoſe things that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from it.</p>
                  <p>That a Friend is to be loved for the uſe we make of him, for that he is a part of the Body, ſo long as he continues a Friend.</p>
                  <p>That ſome Vertues are common to Fools, as well as Wiſe Men.</p>
                  <p>That Bodily exerciſe conduces to the attaining of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>That a Wiſe Man will never give way to Envy, Incontinency, nor Superſtition for they proceed from want of Judgment. But they allow him to grieve and fear, as being natural to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>That Wealth is an efficient cauſe of Pleaſure, but not to be deſir'd for it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:103504:88"/>That the affections were alſo to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but they did not pretend to tell us from whence they proceeded.</p>
                  <p>They made little inquiry into Natural Philoſophy, by reaſon of its difficulty and obſcurity: But for Logick they had a kindneſs, as being ſo ſingularly uſeful. Yet <hi>Meleager</hi> in his Second Book of <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>Clitomachus</hi> in his Firſt Book of <hi>Sects,</hi> both deny that they minded, at all, either Natural Philoſophy or Logic. For they thought that he who rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the nature of Good and Evil, might be able both to argue and ſpeak well; that he was out of the danger of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and had no reaſon to be afraid of Death.</p>
                  <p>That there was nothing juſt, honeſt, or diſhoneſt by Nature; but only by Law and Cuſtom. However a good Man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears to act any thing abſur'd or wicked by reaſon of the Cenſures of the World and Puniſhments to which Offenders are liable.</p>
                  <p>That to be wiſe, was to make a progreſs in Philoſophy and other things, wherein a Man was deficient before.</p>
                  <p>They held that one Man was more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with grief than another, and that the Senſes did not always give true Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:103504:89"/>They alſo, that call'd themſelves <hi>Hege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiacs,</hi> had the ſame proſpects of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Pain.</hi> Beſides they held, that there was nothing of Kindneſs, nothing of Friendſhip or Beneficence; becauſe they do not deſire theſe things for their own, but for the ſake of benefit and neceſſity; and for the ſake of thoſe occaſions which give them Life and Being.</p>
                  <p>That for a Man to enjoy a Life of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Felicity, was abſolutely impoſſible; for that the Body was ſubject to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Diſtempers; and the Soul ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiz'd with the Body; beſides that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fruſtrated our expectations in many things.</p>
                  <p>That Life and Death were both to be deſired, and that nothing was either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant or unpleaſant by Nature; but that through Scarcity, Novelty and Satiety, ſome things were delightful, others diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>That Wealth and Poverty had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> for that the Peaſures of the Rich, and the Pleaſures of the Poor were ſtill the ſame.</p>
                  <p>That there was no difference between Servitude and Freedom, Nobility and meanneſs of Extraction, Honour and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, according to the Standard of Pleaſure. That it was expedient for a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103504:89"/>
Fool to live, but indifferent to a Wiſe Man.</p>
                  <p>That a Wiſe Man in all his actions had a regard to himſelf, not believing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Men to be his equals.</p>
                  <p>They alſo deny'd the Senſes, becauſe they are ſo uncertain in their Information, and ſeem to act without any care or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection.</p>
                  <p>They were of opinion, That the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of Men were to be pardoned, for that no Man committed a voluntary ſin, but by the Impulſe of ſome natural paſſion or other.</p>
                  <p>That it became Men to inſtruct, and not to bear Enmity one to another. That a wiſe Man ought to be more ſedulous in avoiding Evils, than in the choice of delightful Enjoyments; propoſing to himſelf, as his chiefeſt End, to live a Life the freeſt that may be from Trouble and Pain: which happens to them who are not over eager in the Chace of Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Annicerians</hi> in other things differ nothing from the former. Only they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Friendſhip, Benevolence and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards Parents, and acting bravely for the honour of our Country. In the performance of which Duties if any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune ſhould befal a Wiſe Man, they account him never a jot the leſs happy,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103504:90"/>
though he miſs a few Pleaſures that he covets.</p>
                  <p>That the felicity of a Friend is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in it ſelf; for though near it, we do not rightly apprehend it; nor have we reaſon ſufficient to be confident, and advance our ſelves above the opinion of others.</p>
                  <p>That it behoves us to habituate our ſelves to Vertue, by reaſon of that evil diſpoſition with which we are born into the World. And therefore we ought to embrace a Friend, not only for profits ſake, which if it fail, our affection vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, but out of that inbred kindneſs, which carries us to undergo all manner of hardſhips, ſtill propoſing pleaſure for our <hi>End.</hi> For while we propoſe pleaſure for the End, and are ſorry to be deprived of it, yet we willingly undergo the trouble out of our affection for our Friend, becauſe our ſervice is a Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Theodorus,</hi> he deny'd all Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning the Gods; and we met with a Book of his Entitl'd, <hi>Concerning the Gods,</hi> no way to be contemn'd, out of which, they ſay, <hi>Epicurus</hi> borrow'd the greateſt part of what he wrote upon that ſubject.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Theodorus</hi> was a Hearer of <hi>Annice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Logician, as <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</hi>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:103504:90"/>
teſtifies in his <hi>Succeſſions of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.</hi> He held the <hi>End</hi> to be <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Grief;</hi> the one conſiſting in Prudence, the other in Folly. That Prudence and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were good things; the contrary Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, evil: And for Pleaſure and Pain, he plac'd 'em in the middle. He deny'd Friendſhip, as really appearing neither in Fools nor Wiſe Men. For in the firſt, as ſoon as the benefit ceas'd, their friendſhip dy'd. And for Wiſe Men, they truſting to their own abilities, ſtood in need of none.</p>
                  <p>He did not think it rational, That a Vertuous Man ſhould hazard himſelf for his Country, for it was not fit that he ſhould throw away his prudence for the folly and miſcarriages of others; beſides that, the whole World was his Country; and that it was lawful for a Wiſe Man to Steal, commit Adultery and Sacriledge when opportunity offer'd. For that none of thoſe actions were naturally evil, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but aſide the vulgar Opinion which was introduc'd into the World by ſilly and illiterate People.</p>
                  <p>That a Wiſe Man might publickly, without ſhame or ſcandal, keep company with common Harlots, if his inclinations led him to it. <q>For, ſaid he, ſhall a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Woman be of no uſe, becauſe ſhe is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103504:91"/>
learned? Or a Boy, or a Youth be laid aſide, becauſe he has been well Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Surely, No—Then again, may not a, beautiful Woman be made uſe of, becauſe ſhe is fair? Or a Boy, or a Youth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is lovely? Moſt certainly they may—Now then you will allow that a lovely Boy or Youth is uſeful for that end for which he was born lovely. If ſo, then to be enjoy'd. Whence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, That if any one made uſe of that enjoyment, when it was requiſite for him, it was no Tranſgreſſion. Neither is he alſo guilty of any Crime, if he makes uſe of beauty, when it is for his Advantage.</q> And theſe were the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms which he impos'd upon his Hearers.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why he was Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Theos,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> was this: For that when <hi>Stilpo</hi> put the Queſtion to him, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought himſelf to be the ſame that he was call'd?</hi> And he was ſo vain as not to deny it: <hi>Why then,</hi> ſaid <hi>Stilpo, Thou art God.</hi> At which when he ſeem'd to be highly pleas'd, the other with a ſmile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>Alas poor miſerable wretch as thou art, by the ſame reaſon thou might'ſt as well aſſert thy ſelf to be a</hi> Jack-Daw.</p>
                  <p>Another time, as he was ſitting by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to inſtruct the young Probationers in the holy Myſteries

                  <p>He forſook <hi>Theophrastus</hi> to follow <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodorus,</hi> who was altogether addicted to Contemplation, and <hi>Timagoras</hi> of <hi>Gelos:</hi> And at the ſame time <hi>Clitarchus</hi> and <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ptolomy Soter</hi> kindly entertain'd him, when the victorious Enemy had ſubdu'd his Native Country; and giving him a round Sum of Money, requeſted his Company into <hi>Aegypt:</hi> Thereupon he return'd the beſt part of the Money, refuſing the Voyage, and retir'd to <hi>Aegina,</hi> till <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s return. Nor was <hi>Demetrius</hi> leſs kind; for after he had taken <hi>Megara,</hi> he took particular care to ſave the Philoſopher's Houſe, and that the Plunder taken out of it ſhould be reſtor'd him. But when the Victor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an Inventory of his Goods, to ſee whether he miſs'd nothing, he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that every thing was ſafe, for no Man could deprive him of his Eloquence, and his Learning: And after this diſcourſing to the Conqueror concerning <hi>Humane Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence,</hi> he did it with that force of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the vanquiſh'd Victor became not only his Admirer but his Hearer.</p>

At which time <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> nick-nam'd the God, is reported to have droll'd upon him, asking him, <hi>How he came to be ſo knowing;</hi> or <hi>whether he took up her Coats and look'd?</hi> For he was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a daring confidence; but <hi>Stilpo</hi> a Man very reſerv'd, yet extreamly faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And therefore when <hi>Crates</hi> ask'd him whether the Gods were pleas'd with the Prayers of Mortals, and the Divine Honours continually paid 'em? <hi>Fool,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>never ask Queſtions concerning theſe things in the Street, but when thou art pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in thy Study.</hi>

And therefore when <hi>Crates</hi> the <hi>Cynic</hi> would not anſwer to a queſtion propounded to him, only let a fart; <hi>I knew,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou wouldst ſpeak any thing rather than what it behov'd thee to do.</hi>

                  <p>Being a moſt ſharp and quick Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, he deny'd all manner of <hi>Species;</hi> and affirm'd, That he who ſaid he was a Man, was no Man.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103504:101"/>
Which was the reaſon, that when he had made a certain Decree, he was reproved by one <hi>Alexinus,</hi> who told him, that it did not become a Wiſe Man to make ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Tent or a Decree.

                        <p>This liberty of ſpeech which he us'd had like to have coſt him and his Friend <hi>Aſclepias</hi> their lives at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Nicocreon:</hi> For the King having invited both them, and ſeveral other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers to a monthly Feſtival, <hi>Menede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> could not forbear, but with his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted freedom publickly at the Table, <hi>If there be any benefit,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in ſuch Society,

theſe Feasts ought to be kept every day: If not, this is now ſuperfluous.</hi> To which the Tyrant anſwering, That he ſet apart ſuch leiſure Holidays to hear the Philoſophers: <hi>Menedemus</hi> more ſharply inſiſted, <hi>That it behov'd him to hear the Philoſophers at all times:</hi> Inſomuch that they had both dy'd for it, had not one of the Muſicians given 'em private intelligence of the miſchief deſign'd, and ſent 'em privately away.

                        </p>
                        <p>He was a perſon that little regarded any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> order in his School; where there were no Benches fix'd round the Room as in a Theatre, but every one ſate or ſtood as they could find a Place or Seat convenient. Otherwiſe timorous, and jealous of his Reputation, ſo that when <hi>Aſclepias</hi> and he both wrought with a Bricklayer, and <hi>Aſclepias</hi> never ſcrupl'd to be ſeen in his Shirt, carrying Mortar in a Hodd to the top of the Tiles, he would always hide himſelf when any Paſſenger came by.</p>
                        <p>When he took upon him the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Public Affairs, he was ſo timorous,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103504:103"/>
that being to put the Incenſe into the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> he let it fall beſide.</p>
                        <p>Much about the ſame time when <hi>Crates</hi> reproach'd him for medling with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he order'd him to be carry'd to Priſon. Where <hi>Crates</hi> nevertheleſs would ſtill watch him as he paſs'd to and again, and taunt him with the Nick-names of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Menedemus:</hi> For, to ſpeak the Truth, he was ſomewhat addicted to Superſtition.</p>
                        <p>Another time, <hi>Aſclepias</hi> and he having din'd in an Inn upon a Diſh of fleſh, as the Proverb is, of <hi>Goda'mighty</hi>'s Killing, when <hi>Menedemus</hi> came to underſtand it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow pale, and fall a puking, till <hi>Aſclepias,</hi> rebuking him ſeverely, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, that 'twas not the fleſh, but his own ſqueamiſh conceit that caus'd his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But ſetting theſe humours aſide, he was both Magnanimous and Liberal.</p>
                        <p>His habit and condition of Body was the ſame in his Old Age and in his Youth, ſtrong and luſty as a Wreſtler; of a ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Complexion; fat and ſmooth; of a middle Stature, as appears by his Statue in the Street call'd the old <hi>Stadium</hi> in <hi>Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria.</hi> For it is carv'd for the nonce, half naked, diſcovering the chiefeſt parts of his Body. He was a moſt courteous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainer of his Friends; and becauſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103504:103"/>
                           <hi>Eretria</hi> was an unhealthy place, he was wont to feaſt often. He was a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of <hi>Aratus Lycophron</hi> the Tragic Poet, and <hi>Antagoras</hi> the <hi>Rhodian.</hi> But <hi>Homer</hi> was his chiefeſt delight. The <hi>Lyrics</hi> he lov'd, as alſo <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Achaeus,</hi> among the Satyriſts; but he preferr'd <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> above all the reſt. Therefore to thoſe that oppos'd him at the Council Table, he would always repeat theſe lines:
<q>

                              <l>And Tortoiſes may Eagles overtake.</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>Which was a Sentence of <hi>Achaeus,</hi> taken out of his Satyr entitl'd <hi>Omphale.</hi> So that they were foully miſtaken, who affirm'd that he never read any other Books but <hi>Euripides</hi>'s <hi>Medea,</hi> which is ſaid by ſome to have been written by <hi>Neophron</hi> the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonian.</hi> But he ſlighted his Maſters <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Xenocrates,</hi> and <hi>Parecbates</hi> the <hi>Cyrenaic.</hi> However he was an admirer of <hi>Stilpo;</hi> concerning whom the queſtion being once put to him, what his Conditions were, he only anſwer'd, <hi>He is liberal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover he was a perſon not eaſily to be underſtood; and in Diſputations an Adverſary troubleſome to be encounter'd. He was ready upon all ſubjects, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a copious Elegancy of words.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103504:104"/>
Much addicted to Syllogiſms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was wont to argue thus. <q>Is one thing different from another? Yes. Does Profitable differ from Good? Yes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is good, is not that which is Profitable.</q> He rejected all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, making uſe of Affirmatives only; and thoſe ſimple, not compound, which he ſaid were intricate and complex'd.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Heraclides</hi> aſſerts that in his Doctrine and Opinions he was a <hi>Platonic,</hi> but that he ſported with Logic. So that <hi>Alexinus</hi> asking him whether he had left off beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father: He anſwer'd, <hi>I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther struck him, nor have I left off.</hi> Upon which the other deſiring him to explain himſelf by ſaying <hi>I,</hi> or <hi>No. 'Tis a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to obey your Laws, that will permit a Man to brawl and wrangle in the open Market-places.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He complain'd that <hi>Bion</hi> murder'd the dead, when he exclaim'd ſo induſtriouſly againſt the Southſayers.</p>
                        <p>Hearing another maintain, that there could be no greater good than for a Man to enjoy whatever he deſired: <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a much greater, for a Man to deſire no more than is needful.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antigonus</hi> the <hi>Caristyan</hi> poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that he never wrote or compos'd any. Treatiſe in his life, nor that he ever
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103504:104"/>
ſet up any Opinion, as a fundamental Truth: But that he was ſo obſtinate and quarrelſome in his Queſtions and Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories, that he would never give over till the Blood ſtarted out of his Eyes. Yet though he were ſo paſſionate in words, his actions beſpake him the meekeſt Man i'the World. And therefore though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexinus</hi> laught at him, and abus'd him where-ever he met him, yet he was always kind to him, and accompany'd his Wife from <hi>Delphos</hi> to <hi>Chalcis,</hi> becauſe ſhe was afraid of being rob'd upon the Road. He was alſo a true and conſtant friend, as appears by his ſtrict League with <hi>Aſclepias,</hi> almoſt as ſignal as that between <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes.</hi> But <hi>Aſclepias</hi> being the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they liken'd him to the Poet, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedemus</hi> to the Actor. And it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when <hi>Archeopolis</hi> had once told 'em out three thouſand pieces of Money, becauſe there was a friendly diſpute who ſhould take firſt, neither would touch it.</p>
                        <p>They were both marry'd, <hi>Aſclepias</hi> to the Daughter, and <hi>Menedemus</hi> to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Moreover they tell us, that when <hi>Aſclepias</hi>'s Wife dy'd, he took his friend <hi>Menedemus</hi>'s; for that he being advanc'd to preferment, had marry'd another more Noble and Wealthy: However, becauſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103504:105"/>
they kept Houſe together, <hi>Menedemus</hi> gave his firſt Wife leave to manage the Family.</p>
                        <p>Now as <hi>Aſclepias</hi> was the Elder, ſo he dy'd long before him in <hi>Eretria,</hi> being far ſtrick'n in years, after they had liv'd long and happily together, and with ſo much love; that when, ſometime after, a young Lad that had been <hi>Aſclepias</hi>'s Minion, coming to <hi>Menedemus</hi>'s Houſe to a Feaſt, was ſhut out of Doors by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he bid 'em let him in, for that <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepias</hi> though dead, had ſtill the power to open his Doors.</p>

He ſeems to have been ſent to <hi>Demetrius</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Oropus,</hi> which Embaſſy was by him manag'd with ſingular Gravity, as <hi>Euphantus</hi> in his Hiſtory records. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> alſo had a particular eſteem for him, and own'd himſelf to be his Diſciple, and when he had vanquiſh'd the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> about <hi>Lyſimachia, Menedemus</hi> ſent him a Decree written in a plain Style, and free from any flattery, which thus began.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>The Captains and chief Counſellors to <hi>Antigonus.</hi> Seeing that King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> victorious over the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> is now advanc'd to <hi>Elia,</hi> proſperous in all things elſe according to his wiſhes, therefore the Senate and People have thought fit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>This Decree, and his intimate familari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the King were the Reaſons that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103504:106"/>
he was ſuſpected for having a deſign to betray the City. And being accus'd by <hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> he retir'd privately to the Temple of <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> in <hi>Oropus,</hi> from whence after the loſs of the Golden Cups, as <hi>Hermippus</hi> relates, he was by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Decree of the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> commanded to depart. Removing therefore from thence with a heavy heart, he privately return'd into his Country, ſent for his Wife and Children, and retiring to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi> under his Protection ended his Days, for grief and anguiſh of mind. On the other ſide <hi>Heraclides</hi> tells us a ſtory quite contrary; how that being made Preſident of the Senate, he freed the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrians</hi> ſeveral times from the attempts of thoſe that affected the Tyranny, by calling in <hi>Demetrius</hi> to his aſſiſtance. And that therefore it was not likely he ſhould have any deſign to betray the City to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> which was a meer Calumny thrown upon him: But that he went to <hi>Antigonus</hi> with another deſign, was true; for when he could not prevail with him to ſet his Country at liberty, he abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all manner of Food for ſeven days together, and ſo ended his life. And this is alſo teſtified by <hi>Antigonus</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſtian.</hi> Only againſt <hi>Perſaeus</hi> he profeſs'd an inexorable hatred; for when <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

would have reſtor'd to the <hi>Eretrians,</hi> their former Republican Government, for the ſake of <hi>Menedemus,</hi> he was the only Perſon that diſſwaded him. For which reaſon <hi>Menedemus</hi> bitterly incens'd againſt him, in the hearing of a full Aſſembly, at a great Feaſt. <hi>'Tis true,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>he is a Philoſopher, but of all Men that are, or ever were, or ever will be, aſſuredly the moſt vile and wicked.</hi>

For he was then full of money, having receiv'd from <hi>Dionyſius</hi> above fourſcore Talents, as <hi>Onetor</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in his Treatiſe entitl'd, <hi>Whether a Wiſe Man ſhould be Rich.</hi> For many other things he was alſo beholding to <hi>Epichar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> the <hi>Comedian,</hi> moſt of whoſe Writings he tranſcrib'd, as <hi>Alcimus</hi> aſſures us in his Books that he wrote to <hi>Amyntas,</hi> which are four in number: In the firſt of which he runs on in theſe words, It is apparent, ſays he, that <hi>Plato</hi> took many things out of <hi>Epicharmus.</hi> 
                     <q>As for Example, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> is that which never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues permanent either in Quality or
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103504:111"/>
Quantity, but is alſo perpetually flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lyable to the inconſtancy of Change. As if we ſhould ſubſtract Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber out of thoſe things which are neither <hi>equal</hi> nor <hi>ſuch,</hi> nor ſubjected to Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Quality. And theſe are ſuch things, of which there is a continual Generation; but never any Subſtance. <hi>Intelligible</hi> is that which neither encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or diminiſhes. And this is the nature of things Sempiternal, as being always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and ever the ſame.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That the Soul did apprehend ſome things by the Help of the Body, as it happen'd in Seeing and Hearing; but that for the underſtanding of other things, ſhe needed no aſſiſtance of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Organs, as being endu'd with a ſufficient Penetration of her ſelf. Which is the reaſon that <hi>Plato,</hi> from <hi>Epicharmus</hi> affirms, That they who have a deſire to collect the Beginnings and Principles of the <hi>Whole,</hi> muſt firſt make a diſtribution of the ſeveral <hi>Ideas</hi> by themſelves; as <hi>Likeneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Multitude, Magnitude, Rest</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> In the next place he ought to conſider <hi>Honeſt, Good</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> every one by themſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <q>It behoves him to compare the <hi>Ideas</hi> one with another, and obſerve which have the trueſt Agreement and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103504:111"/>
Correſpondence one with another; as <hi>Knowledge, Magnitude,</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> As likewiſe, whether thoſe things which are exiſting in our ſelves, in regard that we partake of their Qualities, are <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous</hi> to thoſe other things? For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, juſt things are thoſe that partake of Juſtice: honeſt, that partake of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. Now every Species is Eternal, and the underſtanding in reference to theſe things, is void of all Perturbation: And therefore the <hi>Ideas</hi> ſubſiſt in Nature, like ſo many Exemplars. But as for thoſe other things which are like to theſe, they ſubſiſt according to their neareſt reſemblance to the other. And therefore <hi>Epicharmus</hi> diſcourſes of <hi>Good</hi> and of <hi>Ideas,</hi> in this manner. Can play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Flute be ſaid to be any thing? Moſt ſurely. Why then, playing upon the Flute is a Man. Not ſo neither. Go too then: Doſt not thou think a player upon a Flute to be a Man? Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. And does not the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hold concerning Good? This is Good; that is the Thing; which he who ſtudies by it ſelf ſhall become Good. For as he that pipes is call'd a Piper, he that dances, a Dancer; ſo whoever he be that learns any other Art or Myſtery, is not call'd the Art it ſelf, but the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer that profeſſes it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:103504:112"/>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Ideas</hi> thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: <q>If there be ſuch a thing as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the Ideas have their Being in the ſeveral Entities; in regard the memory relates to ſomething that is ſedate and permanent. For how, adds he, could living Creatures be preſerv'd, had they not annex'd to themſelves their ſeveral <hi>Ideas,</hi> or if they were not endu'd with the <hi>Natural Intelligence.</hi> Now they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their memories their Similitude, and the nouriſhment, whatever it be, which is proper to every one. Which ſhews that the Contemplation of <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> is inherent to all Creatures by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inſtinct: By which means they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand themſelves to be of the ſame kind.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover <hi>Epicharmus</hi> aſſerts, That wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does not predominate altogether in one kind, but that all living Creatures have a certain Sence and Notion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And thus, if we firſt obſerve the Hen, ſhe does not bring forth live Chick'ns, but firſt ſhe lays the Eggs, then ſits and enlivens her young ones with her natural Heat. Now this is a ſort of Wiſdom which only nature infuſes and teaches. <q>Therefore it is no wonder that all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aſſociate with their Like, and think their Productions faireſt. For a Dogg
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103504:112"/>
is to a Dog moſt beautiful, the Cow to the Cow, the Aſs to the Aſs, and Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd together, as admiring their own kind above all others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, and ſeveral other Paſſages of this nature are recited by <hi>Alcimus</hi> in his four Books, to ſhew how much <hi>Plato</hi> was indebted to <hi>Epicharmus.</hi> Now that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charmus</hi> was not ignorant of <hi>Plato</hi>'s inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, may be conjectur'd from hence, that he does as it were propheſie, that he would be his Emulator, in theſe words: <q>I am of opinion, ſays he, nay more, I am well confirm'd, ſuch will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my Words and Sentences, that ſome one perſon or other will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain 'em in this rude dreſs, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring 'em in more pompous Colours, will himſelf, inſuperable, become a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor over many others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover there is good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Plato</hi> was the firſt who brought the writings of <hi>Sophron</hi> the <hi>Mimic</hi> into <hi>Athens,</hi> and fram'd his own Geſtures and Poſtures from thence; for that the Books were found under his Pillow.</p>
                  <p>He made three Voyages into <hi>Sicily;</hi> the firſt only to ſee the Iſland, and the Rarities that made it famous; when <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius</hi> the Tyrant, and Son of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> compell'd him to a Conference. At
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103504:113"/>
what time, when he diſcours'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and alledg'd, That what was profitable to him alone, made little or nothing for his advantage, unleſs he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd in vertue; the Tyrant growing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, <hi>Thou talk'ſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>like an old doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fool:</hi> To whom <hi>Plato, And thou like a Tyrant.</hi> Which ſo enrag'd the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, that he was about to have put him to Death; but altering his reſolution, at the Interceſſion of <hi>Dio,</hi> and <hi>Aristomenes,</hi> he gave him to <hi>Polis,</hi> then Ambaſſador from the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> to ſell him for a Slave; who carry'd him to <hi>Aegina,</hi> and there ſold him. At what time <hi>Charman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charmandrides,</hi> proſecuted him for his Life, having indicted him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Statute in force among the Iſlanders, That the firſt <hi>Athenian</hi> that landed in the Iſland ſhould dye without mercy. But upon the ſaying of ſome body, though by way of a jeer, that he was a Philoſopher, he was diſmiſs'd.</p>
                  <p>Others affirm, that he was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Court; where being obſerv'd not to ſpeak a word in his own defence, but ſtand as one couragiouſly reſolv'd to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer whatever happen'd, they determin'd not to kill him, but to ſell him as a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive taken in War. When by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <hi>Aniceris</hi> the <hi>Cyrenean,</hi> being then in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103504:113"/>

Nor could <hi>Dionyſius</hi> be at reſt, but underſtanding what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him, he wrote to <hi>Plato,</hi> deſiring him not to reproach him with what he had done: To whom <hi>Plato</hi> return'd for anſwer, <hi>That he had not ſo much leiſure, as to think of</hi> Dionyſius.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Voyage was to the younger <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> of whom he requeſted a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Land, and a certain number of People to live under ſuch a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth as he ſhould Erect. Which though <hi>Dionyſius</hi> promis'd him, he never was ſo good as his word. More than that, as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103504:114"/>
ſome ſay, he had like to have run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his life for tampering with <hi>Dio</hi> and <hi>Theotas</hi> to recover the former liberty of the Iſland; at what time, <hi>Archytas</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> clearing him of that ſuſpicion, ſav'd him from the danger; ſo that he was ſent back to <hi>Athens.</hi> The purport of which Epiſtle was this.</p>

Collection of all the Opinions of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Philoſopher, I thought it expedient to ſet 'em down, according to the nature of the Diſcoutſes, the order of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, and the method of Expoſition, as it were reduc'd under ſeveral Heads and Chapters, to the end there may be nothing omitted materially conducing to the ſtory of his Life. Otherwiſe, knowing to whom I write, to be more curious and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar than is requiſite, would be only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Proverb, <hi>To carry an Owl to</hi> Athens.</p>
                        <p>Now therefore <hi>Zeno</hi> of <hi>Elea</hi> is reported to have been the firſt Compoſer of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues. Though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his firſt Book of the Poets, aſſerts <hi>Alexamenus</hi> the <hi>Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,</hi> or according to <hi>Phavorinus</hi> the <hi>Tei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> to have been the firſt that wrote in that manner. However in my judgment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <hi>Plato</hi> was the firſt who poliſh'd that way of writing, and brought it to perfection: So that not only the adorning part, but the invention it ſelf may be juſtly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him.</p>
                        <p>A Dialogue then is a diſcourſe by way of Queſtion and Anſwer, upon the ſubjects either of Politics, or Philoſophy, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of decent and apt expreſſions of the Perſons introduc'd, and a Methodical Compoſition of the whole.</p>

                           <pb n="231" facs="tcp:103504:123"/>Logic is the Art of Ratiocination, by which we refute or confirm by Queſtions and Anſwers between the perſons that diſpute. Now then there are two ſorts of <hi>Platonic</hi> Ratiocination, the one for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the other for Enquiry. The firſt of which is again divided into Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and Practical; and the Speculative into Phyſical, or Natural, and Logical; and the Practical into Ethical and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical.</p>
                        <p>Of inquiſitive Ratiocination, there are alſo two ſorts, the one <hi>Gymnaſtic,</hi> which conſiſts in Exerciſe; the other <hi>Agoniſtic,</hi> which conſiſts in Conteſt and Diſpute. <hi>Gymnaſtic</hi> is alſo twofold, <hi>Maieutic,</hi> which nurſes and foſters the firſt Rudiments of Science; the other, when it begins to feel its own ſtrength, and is call'd <hi>Peiraſtic,</hi> as attempting upon the ſcore of its own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Agoniſtic</hi> alſo is diſtinguiſh'd into Demonſtrative and Perſwaſive.</p>
                        <p>True it is, there are others who make a quite different diviſion of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues; for ſome they call <hi>Dramatic;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Diegematic,</hi> and others Mixt. But that diſtinction is more proper for a Stage than a Philoſophers School.</p>
                        <p>More particularly therefore there are ſome of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dialogues that treat of Phyſics, as <hi>Timaeus;</hi> others of Logic, as

                           <hi>Politicus, Cratylus, Parmenides,</hi> and the <hi>Sophiſt.</hi> Others of Morality, as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, Crito, Phaedo, Phaedias,</hi> the <hi>Sympoſium; Menexenus, Clitophon,</hi> his Epiſtles, <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebus, Hipparchus,</hi> and <hi>Anteraſtae;</hi> others of Politics, as his Commonwealth, his Laws, <hi>Minos, Epinomis,</hi> and his <hi>Atlanticus.</hi> Of the Rudiments of Learning. The two <hi>Alcibiades</hi>'s, <hi>Theages, Lyſis, Laches.</hi> Of the firſt Attempts to Practiſe, <hi>Euthyphron, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Ion, Charmides, Thetaetus.</hi> Of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, <hi>Protagoras;</hi> of Perſwaſion, <hi>Ethydemus,</hi> the two <hi>Hippiae</hi> and <hi>Gorgias.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now becauſe there is a very hot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention among Writers, while ſome affirm <hi>Plato</hi> to be the Author of new Opinions, others deny it, let us a little conſider how it ſtands. A Dogmatiſt is properly ſaid to be ſuch a Perſon who ſtarts a new Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he is ſaid to be a Legiſlator that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces new Laws. Now the <hi>Dogma</hi> is ſaid to indifferently, either the thing about which the Opinion is raiſed, or the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it ſelf. The thing about which the Opinion is raiſed, is called the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> But the opinion, is called the <hi>Suppoſition. Plato</hi> therefore, whatever he apprehends to be true; thoſe things he expounds, and refutes what he believes to be falſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his own Sentiments, he diſcourſes under the Perſons of <hi>Socrates, Timaeus,</hi>

His <hi>Athenian</hi> Gueſt, and the Stranger of <hi>Elea.</hi> Which Strangers were not as ſome Conjecture, <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Parmenides;</hi> but fictitious and anonymous Perſons. When he quotes the words of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus,</hi> then he <hi>Dogmatizes,</hi> or aſſerts ſome new Opinion of his own. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes thoſe things which he believes to be falſe, he introduces <hi>Thraſymachus, Callicles, Polus, Gorgias, Protagoras, Hippias, Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> and ſome others. When he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, he makes uſe of <hi>Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for the moſt part, and that not only ſingle, but twoſold. For <hi>Induction</hi> is an Argument inferring from certain undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Truths, that whatever is like to one of thoſe Truths, muſt be True. Of which there are two ſorts. The one proceeding from Contrariety, the other from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                        <p>Induction from Contrariety, when through the whole Queſtion the contrary follows to what is asked. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, My Father is either the ſame Man with mine, or another. If then thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a different Perſon from my Father, ſeeing he is another Man than your Father, he is no Father. But if he be the ſame with my Father, being the ſame with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he muſt be my Father. Again, if Man were not a living Creature, he would
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103504:125"/>
be either a piece of Wood, or a Stone. But he is neither Stone nor a Piece of Wood, for he has Life and moves of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; therefore he is a Creature. If then he be a Creature, and that a Creature be a Dog, or a Bull, Man being a Creature is either a Dog or a Bull. And this is that ſort of contention by Contrariety, where there is an Opportunity to Cavil, which <hi>Plato</hi> makes uſe of, not to aſſert any Opinions, but to refute thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men.</p>
                        <p>Induction by Conſequence is twofold, the one demonſtrating in part the queſtion that is propounded in part. The other proving generally by the particular; the firſt is Rhetorical, the ſecond Logical.</p>
                        <p>For example, the Queſtion is, whether ſuch a Perſon ſlew ſuch a Man. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration is, that he was apprehended with his Cloaths all Bloody about ſuch a time. But the Rhetorical manner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction is this. For that Rhetoric is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Particulars, not in Univerſals. For it does not enquire into Juſtice it ſelf, but into the parts of Juſtice, or what things are particularly juſt. The other is Logical, and proves the General by the Particulars. As when the Queſtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soul be immortal, and whether there be any of the Deceaſed that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103504:125"/>
Which in his Book of the Soul is proved by a certain General, that Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are produced by Contraries, and the Univerſal is compoſed of certain Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as when Sleep is compoſed out of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or quite the contrary. Or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out of the leſs; or the leſs out of the greater; which ſort of Argument he made uſe of to aſſert his own Sentiments. For as formerly in Tragedies the <hi>Chorus</hi> acted alone; afterwards <hi>Theſpis</hi> brought in one more <hi>Actor,</hi> to give the Chorus ſome reſpite; after whom <hi>Eſchylus</hi> added a Second, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles</hi> a third, and ſo Tragedy was brought to Perfection. So Phyſical Arguments and diſcourſes were employed at firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one ſingle ſort of Natural Philoſophy; when <hi>Socrates</hi> came and made an Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ethics, to which <hi>Plato</hi> added a third, which was Logic, and by that means brought Philoſophy to its full perfection. However<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Thraſylus</hi> aſſerts, that he made uſe of the <hi>Quadriloquie</hi> of the <hi>Tragedians</hi> in moſt of his Dialogues. For there were four manners of Repreſentation among the Tragedians, the <hi>Dionyſian, Lenaean, Pan-Athenaean</hi> and <hi>Chytrian,</hi> of which the fourth was Satyrical, and theſe four ſorts of <hi>Repreſentation</hi> were called the <hi>Quadrilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie,</hi> or the four ſorts of Interlocution.</p>
                        <p>As for the number of Dialogues, which
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:103504:126"/>
are acknowledged to be his, they are in all fifty ſix. His <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten Books, which is to be found almoſt entire in the Contradictions of <hi>Protago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> as <hi>Phavorinus</hi> relates in his ſecond Book of Univerſal Hiſtory.</p>
                        <p>His Laws are divided into twelve Books, and his <hi>Quadriloquies</hi> are nine in number, his Commonwealth, making one Volume, and his Laws another. Now then his firſt <hi>Quadroloquy</hi> is that which comprehends the common Hypotheſis, ſhewing what manner of Life, the Life of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ought to be. Moreover he puts two Titles to every one of his Books, the one from the Name, the other from the Subject. And thus the firſt in this <hi>Quadriloquie</hi> is called <hi>Euthyphron,</hi> or of Sanctity; being a Dialogue written to try what he could do. The next is the defence of <hi>Socrates;</hi> the third <hi>Crito,</hi> concerning what is to be practiſed, a moral Dialogue, the fourth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Phaedo,</hi> or concerning the Soul, a moral Dialogue alſo.</p>

                        <p>This is the diviſion of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Writings, according to <hi>Thraſylus,</hi> which is agreed to by moſt.

                        <p>That there were two Beginnings of all Things, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Matter;</hi> which he calls Intelligence, and nominates to be the Cauſe. That Matter is without form and immenſe; from the coalition and conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Forms. That this Matter at firſt
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103504:129"/>
being hurried up and down without order, was at length rammaſſed together into one Place, by the wiſe God, who deem'd Ordel more ſeemly than Diſorder. That this exiſtent Matter is divided into four Elements, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. Out of which, the World, and all things therein were Created; only that the Earth is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable; believing it to be the cauſe of that Diverſity of Forms, whereof it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: for that the Forms of all other things are of the ſame kind, being all compoſed of one <hi>Oblong</hi> Triangle, tho' the Figure of the Earth be peculiar to it ſelf: ſeeing the Figure of Fire is Pyramidical: the Air reſembles an <hi>Octae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi> the Water an <hi>Icoſaedron,</hi> but the Form of the Earth is Cubical. Which is the reaſon that the Earth never changes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Them,</hi> nor they into the Earth. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he denies every Element to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to its proper place: for that the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Motion by conſtraining and depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Center, congregates the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, but ſeparates the more bulky things; which is the reaſon that when they change their forms, they alſo change their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                        <p>That the World was Created ſingle and one, and was made a ſenſible Being by the Creator; as being for its greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103504:130"/>
endued with Life; and as the moſt glorious of Fabricks proceeding from the beſt of Cauſes, and therefore but one, though not Infinite, becauſe the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar, by which it was Created, is but one.</p>
                        <p>That it is of a Sphaerical Figure, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Form of the Creator. For he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſes the whole Creation, and the World contains all other Forms of all things. Moreover that it is ſmooth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Circular Organ, as having no need of any ſuch thing; farther, that the World is Immortal, becauſe it cannot be diſſolv'd again into God. But that Cod was the cauſe of the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince only that which was good, could do good.</p>
                        <p>That the beſt of cauſes was alſo the cauſe of the Creation of Heaven. For that there could be no other cauſe of the moſt lovely part of the Creation than the beſt and moſt excellent of intelligible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; which it being certain that God himſelf is, and that the Heaven is alſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt to him, as being the next that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends in Beauty, there can be no Creature that it can reſemble but only God.</p>
                        <p>That the World conſiſts of Fire, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Air and Earth. Of Fire, to the end it might be viſible. Of Earth, that it might be ſolid; of Air and Water, that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103504:130"/>
it might not want Proportion. For ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid things derive their Solidity from two <hi>Mediums,</hi> to the end the <hi>whole</hi> may be made <hi>One.</hi> But then it takes its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all things, that ſo it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perfect and incorruptible.</p>
                        <p>That time is the Image of Sempiternity, which always endures; but that time is the Circumrotation of the Heavens. For that Nights, and Days, and Months, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but parts of Time: and therefore there could be no time without the nature of the World. That after the Creation of Time, were alſo Created the Sun, the Moon, and Planets; and that God kindl'd the Light of the Sun, that the number of the Hours might be manifeſt and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that the Creatures might be capable to underſtand Number.</p>
                        <p>That the Moon moves above the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Earth, next to her the Sun, and over them the Planets. That they are all endued with Life, as being all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated by a Lively Motion.</p>
                        <p>That for the greater Perfection of the World being made like to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the nature of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was made, which the Earth enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Heavens alſo muſt of Neceſſity enjoy.</p>

                           <pb n="246" facs="tcp:103504:131"/>That the Gods were for the moſt part of a fiery Subſtance.</p>
                        <p>That the various ſorts of Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were divided into three diſtinct Kinds; ſuch as lived in the Air, ſuch as the Water nouriſhed, and ſuch as bred upon the Earth. But that the Earth was the Eldeſt of all the Deities in Heaven. The Structure of which was reared for the variation of Day and Night, and that the Earth being in the Center, is moved about the Center.</p>
                        <p>Now in regard he aſſerted two Cauſes, therefore he ſaid ſome things were Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal, others proceeded from the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cauſe, thoſe were Fire, Water, Earth and Air, not Elements exactly neither, but capable of Impreſſion; which conſiſted of Triangles joined together, and would be reſolved again into the ſame; and that the Elements from which they ſprang, were the oblong Triangle, and the <hi>Iſoſoeles.</hi> And theſe were the Beginnings and two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Cauſes of all things, whoſe Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar and Pattern were God and Matter; which of Neceſſity muſt be void of Form, as all other Subſtances, capable of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. That the cauſe of theſe things was a neceſſary cauſe, which receiving the <hi>Ideas,</hi> begat the Subſtances, and was moved by the diſſimilitude of its Power,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:103504:131"/>
and by its own Motion compelled thoſe things that were moved by it, to move contrary to it.</p>
                        <p>That theſe Cauſes at firſt moved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Order, but when the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be embelliſhed, and adorn'd, they received their Symmetry and Order from God. For there were alſo two Cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creation of Heaven, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſcure and irregular, till the World was brought to Perfection: and then the Heaven was made of a Mixture, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials choſen out of all Exiſtences then Created.</p>
                        <p>He held that God and the Soul were Immaterial; for that as being ſuch and no otherwiſe, it could be free from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Perturbation. And for <hi>Ideas</hi> he ſuppoſes 'em to be certain Principles and Cauſes that ſuch and ſuch things are by Nature what they are.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Good and Evil, his Tenents were theſe, that the End was to be like God. That vertue was ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Life happy; though it wanted theſe Utenſils of the Body, as Health, Strength, quickneſs of the Senſes, and the like; or the exteriour advantages of Wealth, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For that without theſe, a wiſe and vertuous Man might be happy; moreover he may be admitted

to the Government, he may Marry, and he will be ſure to obſerve the Laws; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he will make as wholeſome Laws for the Benefit of his Country, according to the utmoſt of his Ability, unleſs the perverſeneſs of the People fruſtrate his good Intentions.</p>

                        <p>He firſt deſign'd the Notion of Honeſt to be that which is contiguous to lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, rational, profitable and ſeemly, as they are imprinted by Nature, and taken ſo to be.</p>
                        <p>He alſo diſcourſed of the truth of Words; and may be ſaid to have been the firſt that had the true Art of putting and anſwering Queſtions, as being his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Practice.</p>
                        <p>Moreover in his Dialogues, he allowed the Juſtice of God to be a Law; to the end he might render his Perſwaſions to Juſtice the more prevalent, and prevent the Puniſhment of Evil-Doers after Death. Which was the Reaſon that he was look'd upon as fabulous and trivial by ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, while he intermixed in his Works ſuch Stories as thoſe, as if the uncertainty of what ſhould happen after Death, would be a means to deter Men from injuſtice and injury.</p>

                        <p>He alſo divided Friendſhip into three ſorts, Natural, Sociable, and Hoſpitable. Natural, the Friendſhip of Parents to their Children, and Kindred one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of which alſo other Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures participate.</p>

                        <p>As for the Forms of Civil Government, he allowed five ſorts, <hi>Democratical, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical, Oligarchical, Regal,</hi> and <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</hi>

                        <p>In ſpeaking Truth, he ſaid four things were to be conſider'd: What it behoves us to ſpeak; how much; to whom, and when.</p>
                        <p>What it behoves us to ſpeak, is only that which we think may be profitable, and uſeful, as well to the Speaker as the Hearer.</p>
                        <p>As to how much; not more than was requiſite, nor leſs than was ſufficient.</p>
                        <p>As to whom we were to ſpeak; if it were to our Seniours that had been tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſuch words became us as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be ſpoken to perſons of their Age: If to our Juniors, we might be bold to take a greater liberty.</p>
                        <p>As to the Seaſon when? neither too ſoon, nor too late; in regard there was nothing more ridiculous than to ſpeak out of Seaſon.</p>
                        <p>Beneficence he ſaid, was fourfold: for that kindneſſes were to be done either with our money, with our Bodies, with our Skill, or with our Words.</p>
                        <p>With our Money, when we relieve the pinching neceſſities of thoſe that are in want.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="257" facs="tcp:103504:136"/>With our Bodies, when we protect and defend the leſs able from violence and miſchiefs offer'd to their Perſons.</p>
                        <p>With our Skill, when we inſtruct the Ignorant, cure the Sick, or put a Man in a way to get a Livelihood.</p>
                        <p>With our Words, when a Man is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd for his life, and another procures his pardon by ſpeaking in his behalf; or gets him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acquitted by the force of his Eloquence.</p>
                        <p>He affirm'd, That buſineſs was brought to an end four ways; either Legally, as when a Decree is confirm'd and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by Law:</p>
                        <p>Or according to Nature, and thus the days, the hours, and years come to an end:</p>
                        <p>Or Artificially, as when an Architect has finiſh'd a Houſe; or a Ship-wright has done building a Ship:</p>
                        <p>Or Accidentally; as when a thing comes to paſs, otherwiſe than we expected.</p>
                        <p>Power he divided alſo into four kinds; of which one had relation to the Mind, as ability to Think, to Meditate, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond in reference to the ſtrength of Body; as a power to walk, to ſtrike, to give and receive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third, when we are Potent in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Forces, and wealthy in Money,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103504:137"/>
which enables us for great undertakings. And therefore he that abounds with Men and Riches, is call'd a Potent Prince.</p>
                        <p>The fourth ſort of Power, is to be able to do or ſuffer well or ill: And thus we have a power to live in health, to be taught, to ſing or play, and the like.</p>
                        <p>He made Humanity to be threefold: The firſt conſiſting in Salutation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, as when a Man meeting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſalutes him kindly, and freely give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> him his right hand.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond ſort is, when we compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately relieve the diſtreſſed in their Afflictions.</p>
                        <p>The third ſort conſiſts in Feaſting and Invitations, and cordial Entertainments.</p>
                        <p>He numbred five ſorts of Felicity. The firſt happineſs and ſucceſs in Counſel.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond, vigour of Mind and Body, found judgment and ſtrength of Body.</p>
                        <p>The third, Succeſs and Proſperity in our Undertakings.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, Precedency in Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Authority among Men.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, Affluence of Wealth, and all other accommodations of Life.</p>
                        <p>That ſound and wholſome counſel ſprang from Learning and Experience: Vigour of Mind and Body from a ſound conſtitution of health, and perfection in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103504:137"/>
the members, as ſharpneſs of Sight, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Proſperity proceeds from hence, That a wiſe Man conſiders what he has to do, before he puts his deſigns in Execution.</p>
                        <p>That Fame and Glory flow'd from the Opinion of Men.</p>
                        <p>That Plenty conſiſted in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things uſeful and requiſite for Human Life, ſo as to be able to entertain his Friends, and to be magnificent and liberal in all his Actions: And theſe Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities whoever enjoy'd, might be ſaid to be perfectly happy.</p>
                        <p>The Arts he divided into three ſorts; of which ſome were employ'd in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Metals, and ſquaring of Timber, and generally in the preparation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond ſort of Arts are ſuch as frame and ſhape theſe Materials; as the Smith forges Arms out of Iron; and the Muſical Artiſt, Pipes and Harps out of Wood. The third ſort of Arts, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to thoſe that have learn'd the uſe of what the others make; Thus the Art of Horſemanſhip, makes uſe of Bridles; the Art of War, of Arms; and Muſic of Pipes and Harps.</p>
                        <p>He reckon'd that the ſignification of Good might be apply'd four ways.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="260" facs="tcp:103504:138"/>Firſt, We call him a good Man, who is endu'd with Vertue.</p>
                        <p>In the next place we deem Vertue it ſelf, and Juſtice to be good things.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, We account Food, Exerciſe, and Phyſick, to be good things.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth place, as when we ſay a good Actor, a good Lutiniſt, a good Singer.</p>
                        <p>Many things he affirm'd to be good, others to be evil; and other things to be ſometimes good, ſometimes bad.</p>
                        <p>Evil things were ſuch as were abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurtful, as Intemperance, Madneſs, Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the like. Things to be deſired were ſuch as were contrary to theſe. Things good or bad were <hi>Walking, Sitting, Feeding,</hi> which ſometimes did good, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times harm.</p>
                        <p>Equity and moderation in the Law he alledged to be threefold. For firſt if the Laws were juſt, they were to be deem'd equal. Secondly, when the People were careful to obſerve the Laws as they were eſtabliſh'd. Thirdly, if the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were rightly govern'd, without written Laws, according to the Cuſtoms and Manners of the People.</p>
                        <p>Irregularity alſo he diſtinguiſh'd in the ſame manner, firſt, if ſuch Laws were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed as were prejudicial both to the Natives and Foreigners. Secondly, if the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103504:138"/>
People refus'd to obey the ſettl'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. And thirdly, where there was no Law at all.</p>
                        <p>Contraries he made to be threefold: Firſt, good things are ſaid to be contrary to evil, as Juſtice to Injuſtice, Prudence to Folly.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place; when bad is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to evil. Thus Prodigality is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Penuriouſneſs; and unjuſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to unjuſt Impunity.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, when there is a contrariety between things neither good nor bad. As Poverty and Riches; for neither are good in themſelves, yet contrary one to another. In like manner, Ponderoſity and Levity, ſwift and ſlow, black and white, which are all neither good nor bad, yet contrary to each other.</p>
                        <p>Of good things he averr'd three ſorts; of which ſome were to be acquired; ſome of which we might partake; and others exiſtent.</p>
                        <p>The good things which might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired were Juſtice, Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond ſort were ſuch things as could not be acquired, yet of which we might be made partakers. Thus it was impoſſible to attain the real Good it ſelf, yet was it not impoſſible to enjoy the Communication of Good.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="262" facs="tcp:103504:139"/>The third ſort were ſuch things as were exiſlent; which we could neither poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor participate, and yet the thing ought to be. Thus a Man ought to be Juſt, to be Honeſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which are things that a Man can neither enjoy nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; only it is ſufficient for a Man to be Honeſt, and Juſt.</p>
                        <p>Counſel alſo he alledged to be three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as being taken from the time paſt, the time preſent, and the time to come.</p>
                        <p>The time Paſt affords us Examples, when we conſider what the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſuffer'd through their over Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: what they bravely acted, for our Imitation.</p>
                        <p>The Preſent Time admoniſhes us to conſider the Decay of the City Walls; the faint-heartedneſs and preſent diſmay of the People, and the ſcarcity of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                        <p>The Future puts us in mind to beware of violating the Priviledges of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to the diſhonour of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Voice he ſaid was either <hi>Animate,</hi> or <hi>Inanimate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Animate,</hi> were the ſeveral Cries, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowings, and Howlings of living Creatures.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Inanimate</hi> were the various ſounds of things Inanimate, thumping and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one againſt the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="263" facs="tcp:103504:139"/>
                           <hi>Animate</hi> he divided into <hi>Articulate,</hi> ſuch as was the Speech of Men; and <hi>Inarticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> ſuch as were the ſeveral noiſes of Mute Creatures.</p>
                        <p>Of all <hi>Beings,</hi> ſome he ſaid were ſubject to diviſion, others were not to be divided. And of thoſe things that might be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome conſiſted of <hi>ſimilar,</hi> ſome of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar</hi> parts.</p>
                        <p>As for thoſe things that do not admit of diviſion, they are ſimple, unmixt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any compoſition at all; as an Unite, a Point, a Sound.</p>
                        <p>But thoſe things which are ſubject to be divided, are compounded, as Syllables, Conſonants, Animals, Water and Gold.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Similar</hi> things are ſuch as are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of like Parts, and of which the Whole differs not from the Part, but in Bulk or Quantity: As Water and Gold.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Diſſimilars</hi> are ſuch as conſiſt of Parts that are unlike, as a <hi>Houſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Some things alſo he defin'd to be ſuch things as needed no farther interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than only the bare naming, to make us underſtand what they were, as a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Horſe,</hi> and ſo of all other Creatures.</p>
                        <p>Other things there were that could not be underſtood without an Additional Interpretation; as Better than, Bigger than, Fairer than; For Better is Better
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:103504:140"/>
than that which is Worſe. Bigger, is Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that which is Leſs, and ſo of the reſt. And thus he divided the firſt <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's</hi> of things according to <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There were alſo beſides our famous <hi>Plato,</hi> ſeveral others of the ſame name.</p>
                        <p>One that was a Philoſopher likewiſe, and born at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the Diſciple of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> as <hi>Seleucus</hi> the <hi>Grammarian</hi> records in his Treatiſe of Philoſophy; another that was a <hi>Peripatetic,</hi> and the Diſciple of <hi>Aristotle:</hi> And one more, the Son of <hi>Praxiphanes,</hi> a Comic Poet, that wrote after the Ancient manner of freedom without reſpect of Perſons, in imitation of <hi>Ariſtophanes.</hi>

for eight years together, beginning from the hundred and eighth <hi>Olympiad.</hi> He plac'd the Statues of the Graces alſo in the School, which was erected by <hi>Plato</hi> in the Academy. He likewiſe perſever'd in the ſame Opinions with <hi>Plato,</hi> but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his Manners. For he was haſty, and addicted to pleaſure: Therefore it is reported of him, that in his Paſſion he threw a little whelp into a Well, and that to indulge his pleaſure, he made a Journey into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to be preſent at the Nuptials of <hi>Caſſander.</hi> He is alſo ſaid to have been a hearer of <hi>Plato</hi>'s ſhe Diſciples <hi>Laſthenia</hi> the Propheteſs, and <hi>Axiothea</hi> the <hi>Phliaſian.</hi> Whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> thus derides him; <hi>And we may learn Philoſophy from thy Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> Arcadian <hi>Diſciple.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Plato</hi> taught for nothing all that came to his houſe, but thou exacteſt pay, and ſcrap'ſt as well from the unwilling as the willing.

In

his life alſo he was very communicative, and ready to do kindneſſes, ſcorning to boaſt of his courteſies which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to conceal as much as in him lay. So that going to viſit <hi>Kteſibus</hi> in a fit of ſickneſs, and finding him diſtreſſed with Poverty, he privately convey'd a Purſe of Money under his Pillow; which the other finding, cry'd out, this is one of <hi>Arceſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>'s childiſh tricks. And by his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Archias</hi> the <hi>Arcadian</hi> to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> he got him into great preferment. Being alſo very liberal, and one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned Mony, he lov'd to ſhew his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur in Silver Plate, wherein, while he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to out-vy <hi>Archecrates</hi> and <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> he would not be at quiet till he was ſerv'd in Gold; and lent his Plate to many with whom he frequently Supp'd and Feaſted.

                  <p>To which he anſwer'd (finding himſelf touched to the quick by the King's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, upon the report of ſome of his ill-willers) my Father was a <hi>Boryſthenite,</hi> who wore in his diſ-figur'd forehead the engraven marks of his cruel Maſter; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards being free from Bondage, he learnt to wipe his mouth with his Sleeve, (intimating that he ſold Bacon and Suet) and he took my Mother out of a Brothel Houſe, ſuch a one as was ſuitable to his condition, and he could ask to have him. Afterwards being behind hand in his pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Toll-gatherers, he was ſold
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:103504:159"/>
with all his family. In that place there liv'd an Orator, who ſeeing me to be young, and a very handſome youth, bought me for a Sum of Money, and at his death left me his whole Eſtate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I, taking all his Pictures and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, tore the one half, and ſet fire to the other, with a reſolution to come to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> where I ſtudy'd Philoſophy ever ſince.

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is all that I can ſay, in few words, concerning my ſelf: And therefore there was no need for <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Philonides</hi> to break their Brains about inſerting my Genealogy into their Hiſtory: If thou haſt any more to ſay to me, look upon me, and let my Anceſtors alone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bion</hi> was a very ſubtle Man, full of wiles and tricks, and one that for niceties and evaſions had not his Equal among the Sophiſters: For he began, when he was but very young, to challenge the field of diſpute with any that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their gifts in Philoſophy. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs in ſeveral other things he knew well how to confine his humour, and was extreamly civil and pleaſing in his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>

                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:103504:160"/>He has left to Poſterity ſeveral remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tracts, and an infinite number of Sentences very grave and profitable, as for example: He was upbraided by a certain perſon, That he had not detained a certain young man at his Houſe: To whom returning this anſwer, <hi>'Tis not an eaſie thing,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to hang a green Cheeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

(for this Repartee is alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to him) <hi>If thou marrieſt a deformed Woman,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou wilt always be in diſcontent; and if thou marrieſt a beautiful Woman, ſhe will be common.</hi> He call'd old Age the Haven of all Diſeaſes (for that all our miſeries and ſufferings ſeem to be unladen, and put there aſhore.) That Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was the Mother of Years, Beauty a good Paſſenger, and Riches the Sinew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Buſineſs. To one that had ſpent his Eſtate in Lands, <hi>The Earth,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſwallowed</hi> Amphiaraus, <hi>but thou hast devoured the Earth.</hi> He was wont to ſay, 'twas a great evil not to be able to ſuffer Evil. He reprehended thoſe that buried the Bodies of the dead, as if there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained no feeling after death. He was
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:103504:160"/>
us'd to ſay, that 'twas better to pleaſure others with his Beauty, than to ſeek the ſatisfaction of his own Luſt, for that he who did otherwiſe, waſted both his Body and his Underſtanding. He argued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Socrates</hi> in this manner; Either he might make uſe of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> or he might not: If he could and would not, he was a Fool: If he had a mind and could not, 'twas no Vertue in him. He ſaid, that certainly the way to Hell was eaſie to find, becauſe all men went thither blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. He blam'd <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> ſaying, that in his Youth he had debauch'd Men from their Wives, but that when he came to be a Man, he debauch'd Women from their Husbands.</p>
                  <p>Thus, as ſome of the <hi>Athenians</hi> with whom he met at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> profeſs'd the Art of Oratory, he taught Philoſophy; and being ask'd why he did ſo, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I brought Wheat hither, but I ſell Barley.</hi> He was wont to ſay, that 'twas a greater pain to the damn'd to carry water in ſound Veſſels, than in ſuch as were bor'd thorough.</p>
                  <p>To a certain talkative perſon that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd him to lend him his aſſiſtance in ſome buſineſs he had to do: <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I will, provided thou wilt ſtay at home, and ſend me i'thy stead.</hi> Another time as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:103504:161"/>
to Sea, very meanly habited, he fell into Pyrats hands; at what time, the reſt whiſpering among themſelves, <hi>We are loſt, if we ſhould be known: And I,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>am lost on the other ſide, if we are not known.</hi> He was wont to ſay that Arrogance was a great hinderance to a Man in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Knowledge. And talking of a Covetous Man, he is not Maſter of his Wealth, but his Wealth is Maſter of him: That covetous Men were careful of their Riches, as belonging to 'em; but made uſe of their Wealth as if it were none of their own. That prudence is as far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the other vertues, as the ſight from the reſt of the Senſes: That we make uſe of our Strength in our Youth, of our Prudence in our old Age; and that we ought not to upbraid old Age, as being that to which we all aſpire. To a certain envious perſon that look'd with a ſowre and penſive Aſpect; <hi>The queſtion is,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>whether thy misfortune be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the others good luck.</hi> He was alſo wont to ſay, that Impiety was an ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for Fidelity. For,
<q>
                        <l>'Twill gain the Man, how ſtout ſo e're he be.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>And that a Man ought to preſerve his friends, in whatſoever condition they are,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103504:161"/>
that we may not give people an occaſion that we ſhun the good, becauſe they will not humour our bad Manners; or if they be bad, that wicked familiarity cannot laſt long.</p>
                  <p>At firſt he contemned the Statutes of the Academy, at the ſame time that he was a Hearer of <hi>Crates;</hi> afterwards he made choice of the Stoics manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, walking with a ſtick in his Hand, and a Wallet about his Neck. But who could have perſwaded him to that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Courage, but <hi>Crates?</hi> Then he would needs underſtand the Doctrine of the <hi>Theodorians,</hi> upon which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he frequented the diſputing Place of prophane <hi>Theodorus,</hi> being allured thither by the floridneſs of his Language: for he enriched, and embelliſhed it with all manner of Figures. And laſtly, he went to hear <hi>Theophrastus</hi> the <hi>Peripatetic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now he was ambitious of Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors himſelf, whom he entertain'd with lively and pleaſant Propoſals, ſo as to move the Auditory to Laughter; for he diſcourſed of every thing in extravagant Terms. But in regard he interlarded his Diſcourſes partly with Philoſophical Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, partly with Rhetorical Gayety; 'tis reported that <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> ſaid of him, that <hi>Bion</hi> was the firſt that had accouter'd

Philoſophy in a Garment, embroidered with ſeveral Flowers pluck'd from the Garden of Oratory. His natural Genius inclined him to make Verſes, as you may ſee by this ſhort sketch of his Wit.

                  <p>As for Muſic and Geometry, his Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes were but Paſtimes to him. He was alſo greatly delighted to be in good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, eſpecially where there was Mirth and good Chear; which was the Reaſon that he frequently travelled from City to City. Sometimes he would ſtrive to delude his Spectators with ſome genteel Illuſion; as when at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Seamen to put on long Garments, and go along with him to the Colledge, that he might ſeem to appear in State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a train of Philoſophers. His cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom alſo was to adopt youngmen, that he might make uſe of their Bodies for his Kindneſs, and be Protected by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:103504:162"/>As to what remains, he was a perſon that did all for the love of himſelf, and who had this Expreſſion frequently in his Mouth, That all things ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among Friends. And this was the Reaſon, that among ſo great a number of Scholars, there was not one that would acknowledge himſelf to be his Diſciple, becauſe he was noted for debauching ſeveral, and tempting 'em to Impudence. For it is reported, that <hi>Bution</hi> one of his familiar Acquaintance could not forbear ſaying one day to <hi>Menedemus,</hi> every Night I am linked to <hi>Bion,</hi> and yet I cannot think I act any thing that unbeſeems me. Moreover he entertained thoſe that went to viſit him, with lewd Diſcourſes, full of Impiety; which he had learned at Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Theodorus</hi>'s School.</p>
                  <p>At length falling ſick at <hi>Chal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And at laſt he fell into great want of all things neceſſary for the Comfort of the Sick, until <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſent two of his own Servants to attend him. But as <hi>Phavori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> reports in his various Hiſtory, he died
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:103504:163"/>
in a Litter upon the Road, where <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> himſelf was coming to meet him, and bear him Company. However after his Death we diſplayed him to the World in theſe nipping Verſes of our own.

From his Youth he was much addicted to ſtudy, but very Poor, which made him the more complaiſant, and delightful in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:103504:164"/>'Tis reported that he had a cuſtom to fix his Seal upon the Keyhole of his But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and then threw the Ring into the Buttery again, through a ſmall ſlit in the Door, that no Body might get to his Victuals but himſelf. Which his Servants obſerving, did the ſame as he did; for they took off the Seal, ſtole his Meat, then fixing the Impreſſion of his Seal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lock, threw the Key into the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery again; which little Theft, though they frequently practiſed, yet could they never be caught.</p>
                  <p>But now <hi>Lacydes,</hi> being Head of the new Academy, retired to the Garden, which King <hi>Attalus</hi> cauſed to be made, where he ſet up his School, and call'd it <hi>Lacydion,</hi> from his own Name. He was the only Perſon, who in his Life ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Charge of his School to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for they report that he turned it over to two <hi>Phoceans, Teleclus,</hi> and <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> to whom ſucceeded <hi>Hegeſinus</hi> a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamenian,</hi> and from <hi>Hegeſinus, Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chiefeſt of his Repartees were theſe. <hi>Attalus</hi> ſent for him one day to come to him; to whom he returned for anſwer, That Images were to be view'd afar off. To one that check'd another for ſtudying Geometry in his old Age, and

crying to him, Is this a time to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? <hi>Lacydes</hi> replied, When wouldſt thou have him learn then? after he is Dead?</p>
                  <p>As to his death, he ended his days preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he was made chief of the School, which was in the fourth Year of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty fourth <hi>Olympiad;</hi> after he had ſpent ſix and twenty Years in the Schools.

                  </p>
                  <p>He diligently employed his time in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Books of <hi>Speuſippus</hi> and other Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics; which having done, he was not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily drawn to conſent to their opinions, though if he were conſtrained to oppoſe 'em; he did it with all the Modeſty ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, as he that was wont to ſay, unleſs <hi>Chryſippus</hi> were, I could not be. He was wonderfully ſtudious, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in moral Philoſophy; for of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy he made no great reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nay he was ſo intent at his Study, that he would not allow himſelf leiſure to Comb his hair, and pair his Nails. So that at length his Diſcourſes were ſo Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newy in matters of Philoſophy, that the Orators flocked from all parts to his School, on purpoſe to hear him.

                  <p>However he was a violent Man, and almoſt inſupportable in his Diſputes, and therefore never cared to appear at great Meetings and Feſtivals.</p>

                  <p>From thence he retired into <hi>Macedon</hi> to King <hi>Philip,</hi> where he made his abode after he had received his Son <hi>Alexander</hi> into his Tuition.

                  <p>At length finding that <hi>Alexander</hi> had acquired no ſmall Benefit by his Precepts, and that he had made him greatly behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, he reſolved to return to <hi>Athens,</hi> after he had recommended his Nephew <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> the <hi>Olynthian</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Of whom they report, that upon his preſuming to ſpeak more peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Prince than became him, and little regarding his Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he was reproved by him in the words of a little Diſtick, admoniſhing him to take Care how he behaved himſelf; for that if he did not change his manners, it might chance to coſt him his Life. The Diſtick was this:
<q>
                        <l>The words thou ſpeak'ſt, no Mortal can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Which happened to be a true Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for being diſcovered to have been in the Conſpiracy of <hi>Hermolaus,</hi> againſt <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Life, he was carried about in an Iron Cage, wherein being at length over-run with Naſtineſs and Lice.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:103504:171"/>
he was thrown to a hungry Lyon, and ſo ended his miſerable days.</p>
                  <p>Now after <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was come to <hi>Athens</hi> and had taught in that City thirteen Years, he went, without diſcloſing his intentions, to <hi>Chalcis,</hi> for that he was accus'd of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety by <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> the Inquiſitor, or rather Over-ſeer of the ſacred Myſteries; tho' <hi>Phavorinus</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtorical Oglio,</hi> reports him to have been ſummoned by <hi>Demophilus,</hi> becauſe he had made a Hymn in Praiſe of <hi>Hermias,</hi> and cauſed this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Epigram to be engraved upon one of the Statues in the Temple of <hi>Delphos.</hi>

                  <p>So that being almoſt out of hopes to ſave himſelf, as <hi>Eumolus</hi> ſays in his <hi>fifth Book of Hiſtories,</hi> he poyſoned himſelf at <hi>Chalcis,</hi> and dyed in the ſeventieth Year of his Age.

                  <p>The moſt remarkable of his Sayings were theſe. Being asked, what Lyers got by their Babbling; Never to be believ'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid he, when they ſpeak Truth. In like manner, when he was reproved for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Pity upon a vicious Perſon, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him Alms; I did not pity his evil man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſaid he, but I pitied him as a Man. He was wont to ſay, where-ever he was, either among his Friends, or among his Scholars, That the Eye received the Light by means of the Medium Air that environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and that the Soul received Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:103504:175"/>
by means of the Liberal Arts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often offended againſt the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> he was wont to ſay, That the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were the inventers of Laws and Wheat; and that they made good uſe of their Wheat, but not of their Laws. Farther he was wont to ſay, That the root of Learning was bitter, but the fruit was ſweet. Being asked what ſooneſt grew old; The kindneſs, ſaid he, which is done to others. Being asked what hope was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The dream, ſaid he, of one that awakes. When <hi>Diogenes</hi> preſented him a Fig, as the Reward if he unfolded ſome hard queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believing he would not receive it without uttering ſome notable Sentence; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> taking the Fig, told <hi>Diogenes</hi> he had loſt his Fig, and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Another time, when <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> preſented him another Fig upon the ſame Condition, he took the Fig, hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it in his Arms, as they do little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and then crying out, <hi>O brave Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> gave it him again. He was wont to ſay, That three things were neceſſary for Children, Wit, Exerciſe and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Being told that an idel Perſon was always abuſing him; let him beat me too, ſaid he, when I'm out of the way. He held, That Beauty had more Power to recommend any Perſon, than
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:103504:176"/>
all the Epiſtles in the World. Others attribute this Sentence to <hi>Diogenes:</hi> But that he preferr'd the gift of Form; <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> a Tyranny of ſhort Continuance; <hi>Plato,</hi> the privilege of Nature; <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus,</hi> a conceal'd piece of Knavery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Being asked what was the difference between learned and ignorant Men; The ſame, ſaid he, as between living Beaſts and dead Beaſts. He was wont to ſay. That Learning was an Ornament to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and a Refuge in Adverſity. That Parents who bred up their Children in Learning, deſerv'd more honour than thoſe who had only begot 'em. For the one gives them only a Being, the other not only a Being, but a means to live well.</p>
                  <p>To one that vaunted himſelf to be a Citizen of a great City: Let that alone, ſaid he, and rather boaſt of ſomething that renders thee worthy of a noble and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Country.</p>
                  <p>To one that asked him what a Friend was; One Soul, ſaid he, abiding in two Bodies.</p>
                  <p>He was wont to ſay, there were ſome Men ſo Covetous as if they were to live always<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others ſo Prodigal, as if they were to die the next Hour.</p>

                  <p>Being asked how we ſhould behave our ſelves to our Friends; As we would ſaid he, that our Friends ſhould behave themſelves towards us. He was wont to ſay, that Juſtice was a vertue of the Soul, that rendered to every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Merit. Moreover that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was a good Paſtport to bring a Man to old Age. <hi>Phavorinus</hi> alſo in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of Commentaries, recites a Saying of his, which he had always in his Mouth.

                  <p>In ſhort, we alſo find twelve Books of things without order, and fourteen of thoſe things that have been briefly ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up. And this is the number of his
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:103504:179"/>
Writings, amounting in all to Forty five Thouſand, three Hundred and thirty Verſes; of which we are now briefly to ſum up the Matter and Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contain'd; which may be called an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>He held, That Philoſophy was to be divided into two Principal Members; of which the one was Practical, and the other Theoretical. That Practical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy was to be divided into Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical and Political, to which all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of this World, both private and public may be referr'd; and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diviſion into Phyſical and Logical, belonged to Speculation.</p>
                  <p>As for Logic, he propoſes it as an exact Inſtrument for the handling of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sciences; and will have it to have a double End, that is to ſay, Truth and Probability: Each of which is of ſome principal uſe to the two faculties: For the uſe of <hi>Rhetoric</hi> and <hi>Logic</hi> tends to Probability, <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Analytics,</hi> to Truth. Moreover he has omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which appertains either to Invention or Judgment, or to the uſe of either; for he ſets before Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great number of Propoſitions, from whence, by way of Method and common Places an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:103504:179"/>
of probable Arguments may he drawn for every Queſtion. In reference to Judgment he has wrote his firſt and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſecond <hi>Analytics.</hi> The firſt to ſhew how to make a right Judgment of the Agreement of one Propoſition with another; and the latter to examine the Conſequences of them, by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting what went before, and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after. As to the uſe of things which are in Controverſy, and under diſpute, either among the Logicians, or the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters, he has ſhewn how to ſatisfy the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as well of the one as the other.</p>
                  <p>He holds that Sence is the Rule upon which the Judgment of Truth relies, as to actions that are in the Imagination. But that the Judgment is the rule of Truth, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Moral Vertues, whether in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to public or domeſtic affairs, or in the Compoſition and making of Laws. He propoſes the uſe of Vertue in a perfect Life, to be the end of all Mens Living.</p>
                  <p>He holds Felicity to be an Aſſemblage of three things really beneficial; of that which depends upon the Soul, which is the beſt and moſt powerful; of that which proceeds from the Body, as Health, Strength, Beauty, and the like; and laſtly upon that which is grounded upon outward Conveniences; as Riches, Nobility,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:103504:180"/>
Reputatation, and the like, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Fortune. But that Vice is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of it ſelf to render Life miſerable, though accompanied with all outward and Corporeal Conveniences. That a wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Man might be miſerable, being afflicted ſometimes with Pain, ſometimes with Poverty, and ſometimes with other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences. That the Vertues do not depend one upon another. For it may happen, ſays he, that a Man may be Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Juſt, and yet addicted to Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Incontinency. That a wiſe Man can never be wholly exempt from Paſſions, but only he may be able to govern 'em with more Moderation than another. That Friendſhip is the Reciprocal Juſtice of good-will, of which he makes three ſorts; of Parents, of Lovers, of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. That Love does not only concern the Converſation of other Men, but of Philoſophers; for ſays he, a Wiſe Man may love as well as another, mind the public affairs, marry a Wife, and live with a King. And laſtly having eſtabliſhed three ſeveral manners of Living, the firſt in Contemplation, the ſecond in Action, and the third in Pleaſure, he always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Contemplation before the reſt. He held that the Knowledge of the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arts was of little Importance toward the attaining of Vertue.</p>

                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:103504:180"/>There never was any Philoſopher, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <p>He adds <hi>Natural Bodies,</hi> becauſe there are ſome Bodies that are either wrought by the Hand, as are all the Manifactures of Artiſans, as a Tower or a Ship: or elſe others that are produced from the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Plants and Animals.

                  <p>Such were his Philoſophical Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings concerning theſe and many other things, which would be here too long to recite. For he was ſo Laborious and Induſtrious in all things, and ſo acute in finding out Arguments for his Diſcourſes,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:103504:181"/>
that it was a thing almoſt incredible: as may be ſeen by the great number of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, which we have already number'd up; exceeding in all four hundred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes: together with ſeveral others, and an infinite Number of Sentences; though I queſtion whether all that are aſcribed to him be his own.</p>

                     </hi> he got into that Credit by means of his Parts, that he was called to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City; where he continued in the firſt rank of Dignity for ten whole Years, during which time, there were erected three Hundred and ſixty Statues in his Honour, the moſt part of which were on Horſeback, or drawn by Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, with two Horſes a-breaſt, and all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in ten Months.</p>

To which we may add his Speeches and Orations, as well at the Council-Table, as when employed in foreign Embaſſies. To give ye then a Catalogue of his Writings, They were theſe; Five Books of Laws;

two of the Citizens of <hi>Athens;</hi> one of Laws; two of Rhetoric; two of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſcipline; two of the Iliads; four of the Odyſſes; one of a Republic; one of an Employment for ten Years; one of the <hi>Ionians;</hi> one of Embaſſies; one of Fidelity; one of Favour; one of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; one of Magnificence; one of Laws; one of Marriage; one of Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; one of Peace; one of Studies; one of time; one of <hi>Antiphanes;</hi> one of Time; <hi>Topics</hi> one; one of Sentences.

                  <p>He was wont to ſay, that the Eye-brows were Members, which were not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed becauſe of their ſmallneſs; for that by them we might underſtand the whole courſe of our Lives; that Riches were

Theſe Children alſo got by Heart many things out of the Poets and Hiſtorians, and ſome things out of <hi>Diogenes</hi>'s own Writings. And he was uſed to reduce every thing to an Abridgment for the eaſe of their Memories. He taught them within doors to be ſerved with a ſlender Diet, and to drink Water.

                     <hi>ZENO,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mnaſeas,</hi> or <hi>Demeas,</hi> a <hi>Cittiean,</hi> was born in a City of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was wry-neck'd, with his Head leaning more to one Shoulder than the other; as <hi>Timotheus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> relates;
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:103504:239"/>
in his <hi>Lives of the Philoſophers.</hi> And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius,</hi> the <hi>Tyrian,</hi> reports him to have been very lean and ſlender of Body, very tall, and of a ſwarthy Complexion.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as <hi>Perſeus</hi> writes in his <hi>Sympoſiacs,</hi> he declin'd all Invitations to plentiful Feaſts; feeding moſt heartily upon Figs, either green, or dry'd in the Sun.</p>

Afterwards he adher'd to <hi>Stilpo</hi> and <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> for Ten Years together; as <hi>Timocrates</hi> aſſerts in his <hi>Dio.</hi> At what time, he alſo very much frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Polemo</hi>'s School. <hi>Hecaton</hi> likewiſe, and <hi>Apollonius</hi> the <hi>Tyrian,</hi> report, that upon his conſulting the Oracle, What Courſe was fitteſt for a Man to take, that intended to regulate and govern his Life after the beſt manner? The Deity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd for Anſwer, That he ſhould keep Conſortſhip with the Dead. Upon which, he fell to reading the Writings of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Crates,</hi> he met with him by this Accident: Being bound for <hi>Greece,</hi> in a

Veſſel from <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> which he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Purple, he was caſt away not far from the <hi>Piraeum.</hi> Thereupon, in a deep Melancholy for his <hi>Loſs,</hi> he came to <hi>Athens,</hi> at that time Thirty years of Age; he ſate himſelf down in a Book-Seller's Shop. When, after he had read a while in the Second Book of <hi>Xenophon's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,</hi> pleas'd with the Subject, he enquir'd where any ſuch Men dwelt? The Words were no ſooner out of his Mouth, but <hi>Crates</hi> accidentally paſſing by, the Book-ſeller pointing to him, bid him follow that man. And ſo from that time forward he became a Hearer of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> whoſe Philoſophy, as being that for which he had a great Reverence, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and quickly learnt; but his Modeſty would never permit him to affect the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Behaviour of <hi>Cynic</hi> Moroſeneſs <hi>Crates</hi> therefore, having a mind to cure him of that ſame Baſhfulneſs, gave him a Pot of Lentil-Potage to carry through the Street call'd <note n="*" place="margin">A Street in <hi>Athens,</hi> where all the common Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſans liv'd.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Several other Treatiſes he wrote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on various Subjects, under the following Titles: <hi>Of Life according to Nature.

                  <p>At length he left <hi>Crates,</hi> and for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years together heard the Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-nam'd; at what time he is reported to have us'd this Expreſſion: <hi>'Twas then that I only ſail'd with a proſperous Gale, when I ſuffer'd Shipwrack.</hi> Some aſſert, that he ſpoke thus when he ſojourn'd with <hi>Crates.</hi> But others aſcertain us, that he liv'd at <hi>Athens</hi> when his Ship was caſt away; and that when he heard the

                  <p>Thither a great Number of Diſciples flock'd to him; and for that reaſon they were call'd <hi>Stoics,</hi> who before from his own Name were call'd <hi>Zenonians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the ſame Honours his own Countrymen conferr'd upon him; believing his Statue to be an Ornament to their City.

collective from all things. Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion explains what is the leaſt apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by what is beſt underſtood. Fancy is the forming of Things in the Mind. Of which, the one is that which eaſily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends; the other with more difficulty, or not at all. That which eaſily apprehends, is that which they call the Diſcernment of Things, proceeding from that which is, according as it is, and deeply Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter'd and imprinted in the Mind. Where the Fancy cannot apprehend, it happens, that either the Thing is not, or not as it is; according to that which is call'd <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> and <hi>Form;</hi> or not as it is conceiv'd in the Soul and Fancy.

a wiſe man may be apt to ſtumble in his Reaſon without the help of <hi>Logic;</hi> for that he is not able to diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſhood, but by her Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; nor to diſcern between Probable and Ambiguous; nor is there any putting or anſwering a Queſtion without it.

                        <p>A <hi>Probable Enunciate,</hi> is that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to a Conſent: As thus; <hi>Whatever ſhe be, that brings forth, is the Mother of that Birth.</hi> This is falſe; for no Bird is the Mother of an Egg.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, there are ſome things Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, others Impoſſible; ſome things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily muſt be; others, for which there is no neceſſity they ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Poſſible,</hi> is that which demonſtrates a Thing to be true, ſo that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing external which oppoſes that Truth; as thus; Diocles <hi>lives.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> is that which cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be true; as, that <hi>the Earth flies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> is that which being true, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prov'd to be falſe: Or, may be ſo prov'd, but that certain external things convince us to the contrary: as, <hi>Virtue is profitable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Not <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> is that which is true, yet may be falſe, if external things do not oppoſe it; as, Dio <hi>walks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Likely Enunciate,</hi> is that, for which there are ſeveral Reaſons that it may be
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:103504:263"/>
true; as, <hi>That we ſhall live till the next Day.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are other Diſtinctions, Tranſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Converſions of <hi>Enunciates</hi> out of one into another; of which we ſhall ſpeak more at large.</p>
                        <p>But now, an <hi>Argument,</hi> as <hi>Crinis</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, is that which conſiſts of a Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an Aſſumption, and an Inference: as thus; <hi>If it be Day, 'tis Light: But it is Day;</hi> there's the Aſſumption; therefore <hi>it is Light;</hi> and that's the Inference.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Mood,</hi> is, as it were, the Figure of an Argument: as for example; <hi>If it be the first, then the ſecond; but it is the firſt, therefore the ſecond.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Hypothetic Argument</hi> is compos'd out of both, as thus; <hi>If</hi> Plato <hi>lives, be breaths;</hi> but the firſt is true; therefore the latter. Which ſort of Argument was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd to avoid Prolixity of Words in the Compoſition of Arguments, that might otherwiſe require a long Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a long Inference; and therefore it is more conciſe to ſay, If <hi>B.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>A.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, there are ſome Syllogiſms ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Concluſion; others, not.</p>
                        <p>They admit no Concluſion, where the Oppoſite in the Concluſion is repugnant to the Connexion of the Propoſition: as
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:103504:264"/>
thus; <hi>If it be Day, 'tis Light; but it is Day; therefore</hi> Dio <hi>walks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of <hi>Concluſive Syllogiſms,</hi> ſome are ſaid to be Concluſive equivocally to the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> others, collectively.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Collective Arguments,</hi> are ſuch as either need no Demonſtration, or leading to Demonſtration, by the means of one or more Poſitions; as, <hi>If</hi> Dio <hi>walks, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Dio <hi>moves.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Concluſive Arguments</hi> in <hi>Specie,</hi> are ſuch as do not collect Syllogiſtically: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; This is falſe: <hi>'Tis either Day, or 'tis Night: But it is Day; therefore 'tis not Night.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arguments not Syllogiſtical,</hi> are ſuch as reſemble Syllogiſms, but conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: For example; <hi>If</hi> Dio <hi>be a Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> Dio <hi>is a Creature; therefore</hi> Dio <hi>is no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arguments</hi> are either true or falſe.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that are <hi>True,</hi> are collected from true Things: as thus; <hi>If Virtue be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, Vice is hurtful.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Falſe,</hi> are they that contain ſomething of Falſhood in the Propoſitions; or elſe, ſuch as conclude nothing: For example; <hi>If it be Day, 'tis Light; but it is Day; therefore</hi> Dio <hi>walks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arguments,</hi> alſo are either Poſſible, or Impoſſible; Neceſſary, or Unneceſſary.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="513" facs="tcp:103504:264"/>There are others call'd <hi>Anopodeicti;</hi> becauſe they require no Demonſtration.</p>
                        <p>Other Sorts are enumerated by others; but <hi>Chryſippus</hi> reduces them to five <hi>Sorts;</hi> from which all manner of Arguments may be taken.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is <hi>Demonſtrative;</hi> where the whole Argument is compos'd of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd and Antecedent; and where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conjoyn'd begins, and the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion infers. <hi>If the First, the Second; but the Firſt; therefore the Second.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second <hi>Mood</hi> is, where there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Oppoſites in the Proportion, the Concluſion is oppoſite to the Aſſumption; as, <hi>If it be Day, 'tis Light; but it is Night; therefore it is not Day.</hi> Where the Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption riſes from the oppoſite Conſequent, and the Concluſion from the Antecedent conſequent.</p>
                        <p>The Third <hi>Mood,</hi> is that which infers from a Negative Complication in the Propoſition, and from one of thoſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in the Complication, infers ſomething oppoſite to all the reſt. <hi>Plato is not dead, and yet living; but</hi> Plato <hi>is dead; therefore he is not alive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Fourth is, which from a disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Propoſition, and ſomething contain'd in the Disjunctives, concludes in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reſt. <hi>Either it is first or ſecond;
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:103504:265"/>
but it is the firſt; therefore it is not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Fifth is, where the whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being disjunctive, the Concluſion infers from the Disjunctive, and one of thoſe things which are oppoſite in the Disjunctive: as thus; <hi>Either it is Day, or it is Night; but it is not Night; therefore it is Day.</hi> For from Truth, Truth follows, according to the Opinion of the <hi>Stoics. It is Day, therefore 'tis Light.</hi> And Falſhood follows Falſhood: as thus; <hi>'Tis falſe that it is Night, therefore 'tis falſe that it is dark.</hi> Nor do they infer a Truth from what is falſe. <hi>The Earth flies, therefore the Earth is.</hi> For when we affirm the Earth to be, it is not neceſſary that it ſhould fly.</p>
                        <p>There are other Arguments, which are call'd <hi>Involv'd,</hi> and <hi>Latens;</hi> other <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                           </note> 
                           <hi>Involv'd:</hi> as thus; <hi>Two are not a few, nor Three; if not theſe, then not Four;</hi> and ſo to <hi>Ten: But Two are a few; therefore Ten.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Otis,</hi> is a Conjunctive Argument, conſiſting of Finite, and Infinite; having both Aſſumption, and Concluſion: as, <hi>If he be not here, he is not at</hi> Rhodes.</p>
                        <p>This is the <hi>Logic</hi> of the <hi>Stoics;</hi> to which they are ſo bigotted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Logician</hi> to be the only Wiſe
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:103504:265"/>
Man; for that all things are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd by the Speculation of Words; and for that all Natural and Moral Studies ſtand in need of <hi>Logical Aſſiſtance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus much of the <hi>Rational</hi> Part of their <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> Now their <hi>Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> they divide under ſeveral Heads, or <hi>Places;</hi> under the Titles of Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, of Good and Evil Things; of the Affections, of Virtue, of the End, of Primary Dignity, of Actions, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of Exhortations, and Dehortations: which are the more nice Diſtinctions of <hi>Chryſippus, Archedemus, Zeno</hi> of <hi>Tarſus, Apollodorus, Diogenes, Antipater,</hi> and <hi>Poſſidonius.</hi> For <hi>Zeno</hi> the <hi>Cittian,</hi> and <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> as being more ancient, handled theſe Matters more plainly, and with leſs Subtilty. However, they divided this Part of Philoſophy into <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical;</hi> and held, that <hi>Self preſervation</hi> was the firſt of all Deſires infus'd into all Creatures, by the Dictates and Inſtinct of Nature: as <hi>Chryſippus</hi> aſſerts in his Firſt Book <hi>De Finibus;</hi> alledging, That the firſt thing which was familiar and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to every Creature, was the Notion of that Sympathy and Concord which is between every Creature: which it was not probable, that the Creature could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alienate or create in himſelf; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:103504:266"/>
that all Creatures accord by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And thus it comes to paſs, that they withſtand and repel what is hurtful, and embrace what is delightful and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.</p>
                        <p>But whereas there are ſome who affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Deſire of Pleaſure was the firſt Appetency infus'd into the Creatures, the <hi>Stoics</hi> deny it: For, ſay they, If there be any ſuch Thing as Pleaſure, it is only an additional Thing, which Nature ſeeking of her ſelf, receives, as pleaſing to the Conſtitution of the Body. And hence it is, that the Creatures become chearful and vigorous, and that Plants and Trees ſpread and flouriſh. Neither has Nature, they ſay, made any Diſtinction between Plants and Animals, ſo as to diſtribute thoſe Deſires into either, without Sence and Appetite; ſo that we our ſelves covet many things after the nature of Plants: But this Deſire being augmented in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, the Uſe of which leads 'em to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet things moſt familiar to their Notions; in them Nature, and a ſort of Reaſon governs this Appetite: for Animals are a ſort of Rational Creatures, to whom Reaſon is bequeath'd in a more perfect manner then to Plants; therefore Nature prompts 'em by a kind of Reaſon, to live the moſt commodiouſly they can. And
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:103504:266"/>
therefore <hi>Zeno,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man,</hi> affirms the <hi>End,</hi> to be no more then to live correſpondent to the Laws of Nature; which i, to live virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: Which was alſo the Opinion of <hi>Cleanthes, Poſſidonius,</hi> and <hi>Hecato.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, That it was the ſame Thing to live virtuouſly, as to live according to the Experience of thoſe things that fall out according to Nature. And therefore the <hi>End,</hi> is to live cloſe up to Nature, that is, according to his own, and the Nature of all Things, acting nothing which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of Nature forbids; which is the true Law diffus'd through all the Creatures, and the ſame in <hi>Jove,</hi> the principal Governor and Upholder of all things. And hence the Virtue of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Man, and the Proſperity of Life, when he acts all things according to the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony and Agreement of that <hi>Daemon</hi> in every one, with the Will of the Supream Governor. <hi>Diogenes</hi> therefore aſſerts the <hi>End</hi> to be no other, then to acquieſce in the Reaſon of thoſe things which are according to Nature. <hi>Archedemus,</hi> That it is to live in the Obſervance of all things that are decent. <hi>Chryſippus</hi> alſo aſſerts, That we ought to live according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well that which is Common, as that which is properly humane. But <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes</hi>
                           <pb n="518" facs="tcp:103504:267"/>
admits only Common, and not any Particular Nature, to be our Guide; That Virtue is an acknowledg'd <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> and that it is deſirable for its own ſake, and not out of Fear, or Hope, or for the ſake of any external Thing; and that Happineſs conſiſts in it, the Soul being made for the convenience of the whole Life: but that the Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſometimes perverted by the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Outward Things, ſometimes by the Perſwaſions of Education and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; for that Nature infuſes innocent Deſires.</p>
                        <p>There is another ſort of Vertue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and every where a Perfection, as that of a <hi>Statue:</hi> another inviſible, as <hi>Health:</hi> another ſort ſpeculative, as <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Hecato</hi> alſo aſſerts, That there are certain Scientifical and Speculative <hi>Virtues,</hi> that derive their Being from <hi>Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> as <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Juſtice:</hi> others, that come not within the Verge of Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as <hi>Health:</hi> for that Health may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon a Mad Man, who has a kind of defective Speculation; and there may be Strength in the Arches and Buttreſſes of Buildings: And they are therefore ſaid not to appertain to <hi>Contemplation;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not admitted by <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>Conſent,</hi> but only as they happen; and
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:103504:267"/>
for that they are common as well to the Bad, as to the Good; as <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi> Now that Virtue is ſubſtantial, <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> draws his Argument from hence; That <hi>Socrates, Calliſthenes, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> and the reſt, made a Progreſs in Learning, and increas'd their Knowledg; and that Evil is Subſtantial, becauſe it is the Contrary to Virtue. Then again, That Virtue is to be taught, appears from hence, That Bad Men are brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Good; as <hi>Chryſippus, Cleanthes, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidonius</hi> and <hi>Hecato</hi> affirm.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Panaetius</hi> aſſerts two ſorts of Virtue; <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Active.</hi> Others will have three ſorts; <hi>Rational, Natural</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Poſſidonius</hi> reckons four ſorts; <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes, Chryſippus,</hi> and <hi>Antipater,</hi> more. <hi>Apollophanes</hi> allows no more then one, which is <hi>Prudence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then again, of the <hi>Virtues,</hi> they affirm ſome to be <hi>Primary,</hi> others inferior to them: That the <hi>Primary</hi> Virtues are <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Fortitude, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Temperance;</hi> of which, <hi>Magnanimity, Continence, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Sagacity,</hi> and <hi>Dexterity in Advice,</hi> are <hi>Species's.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That <hi>Prudence</hi> is the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and of Things Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="520" facs="tcp:103504:268"/>That <hi>Juſtice</hi> was the Knowledge of what was to be deſir'd of Choice, and what to be ſhnnn'd, and of what was in the midſt between both.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Magnanimity</hi> was a Knowledge that rais'd the Habit above all Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, common as well to the Bad, as to the Good.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Continency</hi> was an invincible Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, not to be overcome by Pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Patience</hi> was the Knowledge where and when to perſevere.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Sagacity</hi> was an Inventive Habit, and quick Apprehenſion of our Duty.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Dexterity in Advice,</hi> was a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which inſtructed us, when and what to act for the beſt advantage.</p>
                        <p>In like manner, they held <hi>Vices,</hi> ſome to be Cardinal, others of a lower Form: as, <hi>Folly, Cowardice, Injuſtice, Intemperance, Incontinence, Blockiſhneſs,</hi> and <hi>Imprudence in Advice:</hi> and that Evil is the Ignorance of thoſe things, of which Virtue is the Knowledge.</p>
                        <p>That the General Good was what was Uſeful and Beneficial: the Particular Good, either the ſame, or not deviating from it. And therefore they make a threefold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and that <hi>Good</hi> which partakes of it: <hi>Good,</hi> from whence; as, in a Virtuous Action: <hi>Good,</hi> from whom;
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:103504:268"/>
as, from a ſincere Perſon, delighting in Virtue.</p>
                        <p>Another way they define <hi>Good,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nature of <hi>Rational,</hi> or as it were <hi>Rational.</hi> Such is that <hi>Virtue,</hi> of which while we partake, we act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Virtue,</hi> and become <hi>good.</hi> The Acceſſions to which, were <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And ſo it is in <hi>Evil</hi> Things; <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, Fear, Injuſtice,</hi> &amp;c. Of which they that partake, commit <hi>Evil</hi> Actions.</p>

                        <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of <hi>Vices;</hi> for <hi>Vices</hi> and vicious Actions proceed from the <hi>Mind: Extrinſecal,</hi> are Treaſon to a Man's Country, &amp; Falſeneſs to his Friend; but <hi>Evil,</hi> that neither concerns the <hi>Mind,</hi> nor is <hi>Extrinſecal,</hi> is that Infelicity, to be a Devil to himſelf.</p>

                        </p>

Juſt, Stout, Modeſt, and Scientifical; for that in theſe all Honeſt Actions are contain'd.</p>
                        <p>And by the ſame Reaſon, they divided <hi>Diſhonest</hi> into Four Parts; Unjuſt, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, Immodeſt, and Senceleſs.</p>
                        <p>But ſingly, they define <hi>Honeſty</hi> to be that which raiſes Men to Eſteem, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing a Good that deſerves the general Applauſe: or otherwiſe, as truly born to do their own Work; or after another manner, by way of Ornament; as when they pronounce a Wiſe Man only to be honourably Good.

                        <p>Thus they hold all good things to be equal; and that all <hi>Good</hi> is chiefly to be deſir'd, and that it neither admits of leſs or more.</p>
                        <p>All <hi>Beings,</hi> they affirm ſome to be good, ſome to be bad, and others indifferent.</p>
                        <p>Among <hi>Beings</hi> that are good, they number <hi>Wiſdom, Juſtice, Fortitude, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>But neither will <hi>Hecato</hi> nor <hi>Chryſippus</hi> allow <hi>Pleaſure</hi> to be good; for that there are ſome filthy and unlawful Pleaſures; and nothing that is filthy and unlawful can be good.

Third is to be preferr'd: For that a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature was created by Nature, ſufficient for Contemplation and Practice. Farther, they ſay, That a Wiſe man will readily ſurrender his Life for his Country and his Friend, though he ſuffer Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mutilation of Members, or the moſt incurable Diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>'Tis their Opinion alſo, That Wives ſhould be in common; ſo that a man might make Uſe of the firſt he met by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; for thus <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Chryſippus</hi> both ordain'd in their <hi>Common-Wealths;</hi> for that they will all have the ſame Charity and Affection for their Offspring; and by that means Adultery and Jealouſie will be remov'd out of the World.</p>
                        <p>They affirm that Common wealth to be the beſt, which is a mixture of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Popular Power. And this is a Brief Accompt of their <hi>Morality;</hi> though they have aſſerted many other Opinions, not without probable Grounds.</p>
                        <p>As for their <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> it is comprehended under the <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Bodies, Principles, Elements, Deities,</hi> the <hi>End, Place,</hi> and <hi>Vacuum:</hi> Thus ſpecifically. But generally they divide it into Three <hi>Places:</hi> Of the <hi>World;</hi> of the <hi>Elements;</hi> and of <hi>Cauſes.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="543" facs="tcp:103504:279"/>The Place of the <hi>World,</hi> they divide into two Parts. For by the means of one Conſideration, they aſſociate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the <hi>Mathematics;</hi> which teach 'em to enquire into the Nature of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and fix'd Stars, and the like. As, Whether the <hi>Sun</hi> be as big as he ſeems to be? And the ſame concerning the <hi>Moon;</hi> the Riſing and Setting of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and the like. By means of the other Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is only proper for <hi>Naturaliſts,</hi> they enquire, What is the Subſtance of <hi>Natural Philoſophy?</hi> what the Sun is? and what the Stars are as to Matter and Form? whether Created or not? whether Living Bodies or no? whether corruptible or not? whether govern'd by Providence? and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Cauſes,</hi> alſo they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh into two Parts. Under one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration falls the Queſtion common to <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> concerning the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dominion of the Soul; what things are exiſtent in the Soul; of the Seed, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> What remains, is common alſo to the <hi>Mathematics;</hi> as, How we ſee what's the Cauſe of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Fancy; what the Cauſe of Clouds, Thunder, Rainbows, <hi>Halo's,</hi> Comets, and the like.</p>
                        <p>They aſſert two Principles of all Things, the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive.</hi> The <hi>Paſſive,</hi> that

This is the Opinion of <hi>Zeno</hi> the <hi>Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With whom agree <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Atoms;</hi> and <hi>Chryſiyppus,</hi> in his <hi>Firſt Book</hi> of <hi>Phyſics,</hi> toward the End; <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Elements;</hi> and <hi>Poſſidonius,</hi> in his <hi>Second Book</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>However, they make a Diſtinction between <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Elements;</hi> for the one they hold to be without beginning, the other, Corruption; that the <hi>Elements</hi> ſhall periſh by Fire; for that the <hi>Elements</hi> are corporeal; but the <hi>Principles</hi> incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real and incorruptible.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Body,</hi> as <hi>Apollodorus</hi> defines it, is that which conſiſts of <hi>Longitude, Latitude</hi> and <hi>Depth:</hi> and this he calls a <hi>Solid Body.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Superſicies</hi> is the Termination of a Body; or that which has only Length and Latitude; but no Depth: And this falls as well under <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Line</hi> is the End of a <hi>Superſicies,</hi> or Length without Breadth, or having only Length.</p>

                        <p>They hold but one God; to whom they give the Names of <hi>Intelligence, Fate, Jove,</hi> and ſundry other Appellations. This God, at the Beginning, when he was alone by himſelf, turn'd all Subſtance into Water; having rarify'd it firſt into Ayr. And as the Sperm is contain'd in the Birth, thus this Spermatic Reaſon of the World remain'd in the Water, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Matter for the Generation of external Beings; and then the four Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were created; <hi>Fire, Water, Ayr,</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> This is the Diſcourſe of <hi>Zeno,</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> of <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> in his <hi>first Book</hi> of <hi>Phyſics;</hi> and of <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> in a certain <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Elements.</hi>

                        <p>An <hi>Element</hi> is that, out of which all things were at firſt produc'd; and into which they are to be diſſolv'd again.

                           <pb n="546" facs="tcp:103504:281"/>They affirm the World to be God three manner of ways.</p>

<pb n="557" facs="tcp:103504:286"/>
the <hi>Summer Tropic;</hi> the <hi>Equinoctial;</hi> the <hi>Winter-Tropic;</hi> and the <hi>Antarctic.</hi> They are alſo call'd <hi>Parallels;</hi> becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meet one another.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Zodiac</hi> is an oblique Circle; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it touches the <hi>Parallels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They alſo reckon five <hi>Zones:</hi> the <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Zone;</hi> beyond the Arctic Pole, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, through extremity of Cold; the <hi>Temperate Zone,</hi> the <hi>Torrid Zone;</hi> the Southern <hi>Temperate Zone;</hi> and the Southern <hi>Frigid Zone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They further conceive Nature to be an artificial Fire, tending her own way to Generation; which is alſo a fiery and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Spirit.</p>
                        <p>That the Soul is ſenſible, and is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bred within us: therefore it is a Body, and remains after Death; but is liable however to Corruption. But the Soul of the whole is incorruptible, the Parts of which are Souls of Beaſts. <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> affirm the Soul to be a <hi>Hot Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> as being that with which we breath, and by which we are mov'd. <hi>Cleanthes</hi> alſo aſſerts, That all ſouls are ſo long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, till they loſe their Heat. But <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus</hi> allows that Pre-eminency to none but the Souls of Wiſe men.</p>
                        <p>As to the Senſes, they affirm <hi>Sight</hi> to be the Interval between the Sight, and the
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:103504:287"/>
ſubjected Light conically extended; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Chryſippus.</hi> But as <hi>Apollodorus</hi> defines it, that Part of the <hi>Air,</hi> which reſembles a Conical Figure next the Sight, of which the <hi>Baſis</hi> is the Object next the Sight; which is apparent to be ſeen when the Air is ſmitten with a Wand.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hearing</hi> is the interval of Air between the Speaker and the Heurer, ſmitten into Circles; which upon that Agitation flows into the Ears; like the Circles made by a Stone in a Ciſtern of Water.</p>
                        <p>That Sleep proceeds from the Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſenſible Faculty being put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtreſs in the <hi>Principality</hi> of the Soul.</p>
                        <p>That the Paſſions are occaſion'd by the Alterations of the Spirit.</p>
                        <p>The Seed is that which was appointed by Nature to generate the like to that by which it was begotten; and that the Seed of Man mixes its Moiſture with ſome Parts of the Soul, thereby to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Reaſon of the Parent to the Thing generated; which <hi>Chryſippus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms to be a Spiritual Subſtance; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Seeds that are ſown in the Earth; which being too old, never grow; becauſe their Virtue is exhal'd: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Sphaerus</hi> affirms, that this Seed flows from all Parts of the Body; by which
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:103504:287"/>
means it comes to generate all the Parts of the Body.</p>
                        <p>That the Seed of a Woman conduces nothing to Generation, being but ſmall in Quantity, and watery; as <hi>Sphaerus</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</p>
                        <p>That the <hi>Hegemonicum</hi> is the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Part of the Soul; where the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Deſires reſide, and from whence the Reaſon proceeds; which is the Heart.</p>
                        <p>And thus much for their Opinions in <hi>Natural Philoſophy;</hi> which is ſufficient, conſidering the Brevity deſign'd in this preſent Undertaking. We are next to obſerve wherein they have differ'd and contradicted one another.</p>

                  <head>The LIFE of ARISTO.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ARISTO</hi> the <hi>Chiote,</hi> and <hi>Phalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> Sirnam'd the <hi>Syren,</hi> affirm'd, that the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of Mankind, was to live in differently between Virtue and Vice; obſerving no diſtinction between 'em, but an equality in every one.</p>
                  <p>That a Wiſe Man was like a Famous Actor; who, whether he acted <hi>Thyrſites,</hi> or <hi>Aganiemnon,</hi> did both Parts well. So that he rejected the <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Rational;</hi> ſaying, <hi>That what was above us, nothing concern'd us:</hi> That therefore only <hi>Morals</hi> concern'd us.</p>
                  <p>He compar'd the Subtleties of <hi>Logic</hi> to Spiders Web, which though Artificial to Sight, were yet of no Uſe.</p>
                  <p>He neither introduc'd many Virtues, like <hi>Zeno;</hi> neither did he advance any one particularly above the reſt, giving to it particular Titles or Names, like the <hi>Megarics:</hi> And thus profeſſing this kind of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and diſputing in the <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>A Public Place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, <hi>ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from a White Dog.</hi>

for he had an extraordinary perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Eloquence, and very taking among the vulgar ſort.</p>
                  <p>However, as <hi>Diocles</hi> reports, he was worſted by <hi>Polemo,</hi> in a Diſpute, at what time <hi>Zeno</hi> fell into a tedious Fit of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yet he was a great Admirer of that Opinion of the <hi>Stoics,</hi> That a wiſe man could never doubt. Thereupon, <hi>Perſaeus</hi> brought him two Twins, and order'd the one to deliver him a Truſt, with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the other, to demand it again ſoon after from him; at what time ſeeing him in a Doubt which to reſtore it to, he convinc'd him of his Error.</p>
                  <p>He was an utter Enemy to <hi>Arteſilaus.</hi> So that it being his Chance to ſee a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Bull that carry'd a <hi>Matrix; Wo is me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to</hi> Arteſilaus, <hi>as an Argument againſt Evidence.</hi> To an <hi>Academic,</hi> that deny'd, he apprehended any thing, <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Doſt thou not ſee that Rich Man ſitting by thee?</hi> Who anſwering, <hi>No,</hi> he retorted upon him this Verſe:
<q>
                        <l>Who ſtruck thee blind, or from thy ſight</l>
                        <l>Remov'd the glittering Lamps of Light?</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>He is ſaid to have been the Author of all the following Volumes. Of <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in two Books. <hi>Dialogues</hi> concerning

                  <p>But <hi>Panatius</hi> and <hi>Soſicrates</hi> will allow no more then the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to be his own.</p>
                  <p>The Report is, that being Bald, the Heat of the Sun pierc'd his Skull; which brought him to his End.

                        <l>Old as thou wer't and Bald, it was ill done</l>

                  <p>He defin'd Knowledge, to be a Habit proceeding from a Crowd of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not to be expreſs'd in Words. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he held there was no End, as being alter'd and chang'd, as various Accidents and Buſineſſes alter'd the Reſolutions of Men. As if the ſame Metal may ſerve to make a Statue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Socrates.</hi> But he diſtinguiſh'd between the End, and the thing ſubjected to the End: For the one, Fools, as well as Wiſe Men appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; the other, only the Wiſe can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                  <p>He alſo maintain'd, that there were things Indifferent between Virtue and Vice. His Treatiſes are but ſhort; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

full of Pith and Sence, and full of Contradictions of <hi>Zeno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is reported, that when he was a Boy, he was belov'd by ſeveral Men; whom <hi>Socrates</hi> not being willing to admit, caus'd <hi>Erillus</hi> to be ſhav'd, and then they ceas'd to make any farther Addreſſes.</p>
                  <p>He wrote ſeveral Dialogues under the following Titles: Of <hi>Exerciſe;</hi> of the <hi>Affections;</hi> of <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> the <hi>Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> the <hi>Midwife; Antiphero;</hi> the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter; Preparatives; Direction, Mercury, Medea;</hi> and <hi>Moral Queſtions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> Sirnam'd <hi>Metathemenus,</hi> aſſerted Pleaſure to be the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Aim</hi> of all men: For having a Pain in his Eyes, he was ſo tormented with it, that he cry'd out, that Pain could not be a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
                  <p>His Father's Name was <hi>Theophantus,</hi> of the City of <hi>Heraclea;</hi> and when he came of Age, he was firſt of all, a Hearer of <hi>Heraclides,</hi> his Fellow-Citizen; after that, of <hi>Alexinis,</hi> and <hi>Menedemus;</hi> and laſtly, of <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Diſcourſing to a Young Man, he ask'd him, <hi>Whether he underſtood him or no?</hi> Who anſwering <hi>Yes: Why then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>do not I underſtand that thou doſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand?</hi>

                  <p>When <hi>Soſitheus</hi> put the following <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſm</hi> upon him in the Public Theatre,

                  <p>He never alter'd his Countenance nor his Geſture; which when the whole Pit took notice of, they applauded <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> and laugh'd at <hi>Soſitheus,</hi> as one that had
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:103504:293"/>
ſpent his Jeſt in vain. Whereupon, the other begging his Pardon for the Injury he had done him, he made Anſwer, That <hi>'twould be ill done in him to take notice of a ſlight Injury, when</hi> Hercules <hi>and</hi> Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus <hi>were ſo frequently injur'd by the Poets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He compar'd the <hi>Peripatetics</hi> to Harps, which though they yielded ne'er ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sound, yet never heard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is reported, That as he was openly maintaining the Opinion of <hi>Zeno,</hi> that the Diſpoſition and Inclinations might be diſcover'd by the Shape and Form of the Party, certain abuſive Young Men brought him an old <hi>Catamite,</hi> that had been long worn out, and ask'd him what he thought of his Inclinations? Which he perceiving, after a ſhort Pauſe, bid the Fellow be gone; but as he was going, he fell a ſneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whereupon, he cry'd out, <hi>Hold, I ſmell him now; he's a Raſcal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To one that upbraided him with his Old Age, <hi>Truly,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am willing to depart; but then again, when I conſider my ſelf to be perfectly in Health, and that I am ſtill able to write and read, methinks I am as willing to ſtay yet a little longer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is reported that he wrote down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Potſherds and Blade-bones of Oxen, the Sayings of <hi>Zeno,</hi> for want of Money
<pb facs="tcp:103504:293"/>
to buy Paper; and by this means he grew ſo famous, that though <hi>Zeno</hi> had ſeveral other Scholars, Men of great Parts and Learning, yet he was only thought worthy to ſucceed him in his School.</p>
                  <p>He left ſeveral moſt excellent Pieces behind him; as, his <hi>Treatiſes</hi> of <hi>Time;</hi> of <hi>Zeno's Phyſiology,</hi> in two Volumes; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> of <hi>Heraclitus;</hi> Four Books of the <hi>Senſes;</hi> of <hi>Art;</hi> againſt <hi>Democritus;</hi> againſt <hi>Ariſtarchus;</hi> againſt <hi>Erillus;</hi> of <hi>Natural Inclination,</hi> two Volumes; <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities;</hi> of the <hi>Gods;</hi> of the <hi>Gyants;</hi> of <hi>Marriage;</hi> of a <hi>Poet;</hi> of <hi>Offices,</hi> three Books; of <hi>Council;</hi> of <hi>Favour;</hi> of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;</hi> of the <hi>Virtues;</hi> of the <hi>Art of Love;</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> of <hi>Glory;</hi> of <hi>Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> of <hi>Gorgippus;</hi> of <hi>Malevolence;</hi> of the <hi>Mind;</hi> of <hi>Liberty;</hi> of <hi>Politicks;</hi> of <hi>Counſel;</hi> of <hi>Law;</hi> of <hi>Judicature;</hi> of <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> of the <hi>End;</hi> of <hi>Things Noble;</hi> of <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Buſineſs;</hi> of <hi>Regal Dominion; Sympoſiacs;</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip;</hi> That the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Men and Women is the ſame;</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry in Wiſe Men:</hi> of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> two Books; of <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> of <hi>Property;</hi> of <hi>Ambiguity;</hi> of <hi>Logic;</hi> of the <hi>Moods</hi> and <hi>Predicaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The manner of his Death was thus: It happen'd that his Gums ſwell'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to putrifie; whereupon, the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:103504:294"/>
order'd him to abſtain from Meat for two Days; which recover'd him ſo well again, that the Phyſicians allow'd him to eat what he pleas'd: But he was ſo far from making Uſe of that Liberty, that on the other ſide, he was reſolv'd to eat nothing at all; ſaying, <hi>He was at the End of his Journey, 'twas to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;</hi> and ſo ſtarv'd himſelf to Death, after he had liv'd to <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Years; of which he had been Nineteen his Scholar.
