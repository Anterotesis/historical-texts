            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Of all kind of men, GOD is the least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding unto them, for he doth most for them, and they doe ordinarily least for him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A King that would not feel his Crown too heavie for him, must weare it every day, but if he think it too light, he knoweth not of what metall it is made of.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He must make Religion the Rule of Government, and not to Ballance the Scale, for he that casteth in Religion onely to make the Scales even, his own weight is couteined in these Characters; <hi>Tekel uprasin,</hi> he is found too light, his Kingdom shall be taken from him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And that King that holds not Religion the best reason of of State, is void of all Piety and Justice, the supporters of a King.</p>

6. He must be able to give Counsell himself, but not to rely thereupon; for though happy events justifie their Counsells, yet it is better that the evill event of good advice be rather imputed to a Subject then a Soveraigne.</p>

            <p n="8">8. Hee is the life of the Law, not onely, as he is, <hi>Lex loquens</hi> himselfe, but because he animateth the dead letter making it active towards all his subjects, <hi>premio &amp; poena.</hi>

            <p n="9">9. A wise King must doe lesse in altering his Laws then he may, for new government is even dangerous, it being true in the body politick as in, the corporall, that <hi>omnis subditi imitatio est periculosa,</hi> and though it be for the better, yet it is not without a fearfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, for he that changeth the fundamentall Lawes of a Kingdome, thinketh there is no good title to a Crown but by conquest.</p>
            <p n="10">10. A King that setteth to sale seates of justice, oppresseth the People, for he teacheth his Judges to sell justice; and <hi>Precis parata precia vincitur justitia.</hi>

            <p n="11">11. Bounty and magnificence are vertues very <hi>Rege,</hi> but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall King is neerer a Tyrant, then a parcimonious, for store at home draweth his contemplations abroad, but want supplyeth it selfe of what is next, and many times the next way, and herein must be wise and know what he may justly do.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That King which is not feared is not loved, and hee that is well seen in his craft must as well study to be feared as loved, yet not loved for feare, but feared for love.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Therefore, as he, must alwayes resemble him whose great name he beareth, and that in manifesting the sweet influence of his mercy on the severe stroke of his Justice sometimes, so in this not to suster a man of death to live; for besides that the land doth mourne the restraint of Justice; towards sinne doth more retard the affection of Love then the extent of mercy doth enflame it, and sure where love is bestowed feare is quite loft.</p>
            <p n="14">14. His greatest enemies, are his flatterers, for though they ever

speake on his side yet their words still make against him.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The Love which a King oweth to a weale publike should not be restrained to any one perticular, yet that his more speciall favour do reflect upon some worthy ones, is somewhat necessary because there are few of that capacitie.</p>

               <p>Therefore it may seeme they rather desire to be <hi>Kings,</hi> then to rule the People under the <hi>King,</hi> which will not administer justice by Law, but by their own will.</p>
               <p>This administration in a Subject is derogative to the <hi>Kings</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, for he administreth justice out of a private direction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not capable of a generall direction how to use the <hi>Kings</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in pleasure, in causes of perticular respect, which if no other th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then is not any Prerogative oppugned but maintained, though it be desired, that every subordinate Magistrate may not be made supreame, whereby he may seale up the hearts of the people, take from the <hi>King</hi> the respect due unto him only, or to judge the people other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the <hi>King</hi> doth himself.</p>
               <p>And although the Prince be not bound to render any accompt to the Law, which in person administreth it selfe, yet every subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Judge must render an accompt to the <hi>King,</hi> by his Lawes, how he hath administred justice in his place where he is set. But if he hath power to rule by private direction, for which there is no Law, how can he be questioned by a Law, if in his private cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he offends.</p>
               <p>Therefore, it seemeth, that in giving such authority, the <hi>King</hi> ordaineth not subordinate Magistrates, but absolute <hi>Kings;</hi> and what doth the <hi>King</hi> leave to himselfe, who giveth so much to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as he hath himself. Nei her is there a greater bond to tye the Subject to his Prince in perticular, then when he shall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto him, in his person, or in his power, for reliefe of the wrongs which from private men be offered, or for reformation of the oppressions of any subordinate Magistrate, shall impose upon the people, There can be no offence in the Judge, who hath power to execute according to his discretion, when the discretion of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So we see death exempts not a man from being, but only presents an alteration; yet there are some men (I think) that stand other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perswaded, Death findes not a worse friend then an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to whose door I never knew him welcome; but he is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Guest and will not be said nay.</p>
               <p>And though they themselves shall affirme, that they are not within, yet the answer will not be taken; and that which heightens their feare is, that they know they are in danger to forfeit their flesh, but are not wise of the payment day; which sickly uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the occasion that (for the most part) they step out of this

               <p>Thus I gather, that Death is unagreeable to most Citizens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they commonly dy intestate; this being a rule, that when their Will is made, they think themselvs neerer a Grave then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: now they out of the wisdom of thousands, think to sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>No these are not the men which have bespoken death, or whose looks are assured to entertain a thought of him.</p>

               <p>This cometh into my mind upon this Act of Mr. <hi>Suttons,</hi> which seemeth to me as a Sacrifice without Salt, having the materials of a good intention, but not powdered with any such Ordinances and institutions, as may preserve the same from turning corrupt, or at the least from becoming unsavorie and of little use; for although the choyce of the Feo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And the like hath been the fortune of much of the Almes of the Roman Religion in their great Foundations, which being in vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory and ostentation, have had their judgment upon them in the end, in corruption and abuse.</p>
               <p>This meditation hath made me presume to write these few lines to your Majesty, being no better then good wishes, which your Majesties great wisdom may make something or nothing of, wherein I desire to be thus understood, that if this foundation (such as it is) be perfect and good in Law, then I am too well ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your Majesties disposition. To advise my course of power, or profit, that is not grounded upon a right, nay further, if the defects are such, as a Court of Equity may remedy and cure, then I wish, that as St. <hi>Peters</hi> shaddow did cure Diseases, so the very shadow of a good intention, may cure defects of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But if there be a right and birth-right planted in the Heire, and not remediable by Courts of Equity, and that right be submitted to your Majesty, whereby it is both in your power and grace what to do; then I doe wish that this rude Masse and Chaos of good deed, were directed rather to a solid merit and durable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then to a blaze of glory, that will not crackle a little in talk, and quickly extinguish.</p>

Now then if I shall see before your Majesty, in every of these three kinds, what it is that is most wanting in your Kingdom, and what is like to be the most fruitfull and effectuall use of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and like to be least perverted. That I think should be no ill scope of any labour how meanly soever performed, for out of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety presented election may be best grounded.</p>
               <p>Concerniug the relief of the Poor, I hold some number of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals with competent good, then any Hospitall of an exorbitant greatnesse; for though the course will be the more seen, yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will be the more felt.</p>
               <p>For if your Majesty erect many, besides observing the ordinary maxime, <hi>bonum quo communius deo melius,</hi> choice may be made of those Towns and places, where there is most need, and so the remedy may be distributed, as the Disease is dispiersed.</p>
               <p>Again, greatnesse of relief accumulated in one place, doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invite a swarm and surcharge of Poor, then relieve those that are naturally bred in that place, like to ill tempered medicines, that draw more humour to the part, then they evacuate from it. But chiefly I rely upon the reason that I touched in the begining, that in those great Hospitals the Revenue will draw the use, and not the use the Revenues, and so through the mass of their wealth they will swiftly tumble down to a mis-employment. And if any man say, that in the two Hospi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>als of <hi>London</hi> there is a president of greatnesse concurring with good employment, let him consider, that these Hospitals have Annuall Governours, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the superiour care and policy of such a State, as the City of <hi>London;</hi> and chiefly, that the Reuenues consist not upon certainties but upon casualties, and free gifts would be missing, if they appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red once to be perverted: so as it keeps them in a continuall good behaviour and awe to employ them aright; none of which points, do match with the present Case. The next consideration may be, whether this intended Hospital, as it hath a more ample endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then other Hospitals, should not likewise work more in a better subject then other poor, as that it should be converted to the use of maymed Souldiers, decayed Merchants, and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sholds, Age and destitute Church-men, and the like,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51161:12"/>
whose condition being of a better sort then loose people and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, deserveth both a more liberall stipend, and some proper place of reliefe not intermingled and coupled with the basest sort of people, which project (though spacious) yet in my judgment will not answer the designment in the event, in these our times; for certainly, few men which have been some body, and beare a mind somewhat according to the Conscience and remembrance of that they have been, will ever descend to their condition, as to professe to live upon Almes, and to become a Corporation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Beggars, but rather will chuse to live obscurely, and as it were to hide themselves with some private friends; so that the end will be of such an intention, that it will make the place a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of the worst, idlest, and most desolate persons of every profession, and to become a Cell of Loyterers and cast Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Drunkards, which will rather give a scandall, then yeeld any fruit of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>And of this kind, I can find but one example with us, which is the Almes Knights of <hi>Winsor,</hi> which particular would give a man small encouragement to follow that president.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the best effect of Hospitality is to make the Kingdom [if it were possible] capable of that Law, that there be no Beggar in <hi>Israel;</hi> for it is that kind of people that is a burden, an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore, a scandal, and a sort of peril and tumult in a State; but chiefly it were to be wished, that such a Beneficencie towards the relief of the poore, were so bestowed, as not onely the needy and naked poore should be sustained; but also that the honest person which hath had meanes to live upon, with whom the poor are now char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged should be in some sort eased, for that were a work general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acceptable to the Kingdome, if the publick hand of Almes migh spare the private hand of Taxe.</p>
               <p>And therefore, of all other employments of that kind, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend most the Houses of reliefe and correction, which are mixt Hospitals, where the impotent person is relieved, and the sturdy Beggar buckled to work, and the unable person also not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to be idle, which is ever joyned with drunkennesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, but is sorted with such worke, as he can mannage and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51161:12"/>
and where the uses are not distinguished, as in other Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, whereof some are for aged and imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

And thus the poor themselves shall find the provision, and other good people the sweetnesse, of the abatement of the Tax.</p>
               <p>Now if it be objected, that houses of correction in all places, have not done the good expected [as it cannot be denyed, but in most places they have done much good] it must be remembred, that there is a great difference between that which is done by a setled Ordinance subject to regular Visitation, as this may; and besides this, the want hath been commonly in houses of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of a competent sum and certain estate, for the materials of the labour, which in this case may be likewise supplyed.</p>
               <p>Concerning the advancement of Learning. I do subscribe to the opinion of one of the wisest and greatest men of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, That for Grammar Schools there are already too many; and therefore it is no providence to add where there is excesse: For the great number of Schools within your Highnesse Realm, doth cause a want, and likewise causeth an overflowing, both of them being inconvenient, and one of them dangerous; for by meanes whereof, they find want in the Country and Towns, both of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for Husbandry, and Apprentices for Trade; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, there being more Schollers bred then the State can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and employ, and the active part of that life not bearing propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the preparative, it must needs fall out, that many persons will be bred unfit for other vocations, and unprofitable for that which they are brought up which fills the Realm full of indigent, idle, and wanton people which are but <hi>materia rerum nova.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, in this point, I could wish Mr. <hi>Suttons</hi> intention were exalted a degree higher, that, that which he meant for Teachers of children, your Majesty should make for Teachers of men, wherein it hath been my ancient opinion and observation, that in the Vniversities of this Realm, which I take to be both of the best pol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed, and of the best endowed Universities of Europe, there is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51161:13"/>
nothing more wanting towards the flourishing state of Learning, then the honourable and plentifull Salaries of Readers, in Arts and Professions.</p>
               <p>In which point, as your Majesties bounty hath already made a beginning, so this occasion is offered of God to make a procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Surely, Readers, in the Chair, are as Parents in Sciences, and desire to enjoy a condition not inferiour to the children that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the particular part, else no man will sit longer in the Chair, then he can walk to a better preferment, and it will come to passe, as <hi>Virgil</hi> saith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vt Patrum invalidi referant tenina nati,</hi> for if the principall. Readers through the means of their entertainment, be but men of superficiall Learning, and that they shall take their place, but ju passage it will make the masse of Sciences, want the chief and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid dimension which is death, and to become but pretty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious habits of practise.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I could wish, that in both the Universities, the Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as well of the three Professions, <hi>Divinity, Law,</hi> and <hi>Physicke,</hi> as of the Arts of Speech, the Mathimatiques and others, were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their Pensions to 100. l. <hi>per annum</hi> a piece, which though it be not neer so great as they are in some other places, where the greatnesse of the reward doth wish for the ablest men out of all Forrain Parts to supply the Chair; yet it may be a portion to content a worthy and able man, if he be contemplative in nature, as most of those spirits are that are fittest for Lectures.</p>
               <p>Thus may Learning in your Kingdom be advanced to a further heigth; for Learning, which I say under your Majesty the most learned of Kings, is so cherished, may also claim some degree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation thereby.</p>
               <p>Concerning propagation of Religion, I shall in few words set before your Majesty three Propositions, none of them devices of mine own, otherwise then as Fever approved them; two of which have been in agitation of speech, and the third acted.</p>

2. The second is a Receipt (not Seminary in respect of the vain vowes, and implicite obedience, and other things tending to the perturbation of States (involved in that term) of Converts to the Reformed Religion, either of youth, or otherwise: for I like not the word Seminary, in respect of the vain vows, and implicite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and other things tending to the perturbation of States involved in that term) of Converts to the Reformed Religion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of youth, or otherwise: for I doubt not but there are in Spain, Italy and other Countries of the Papists many, whose hearts are touched with a sence of those corruptions, and acknowledgment of a better way; which grace is many times smothered, and choked through a worldly consideration of necessity to live there, men not knowing where to have succour and resuge here.</p>
               <p>This likewise I hold a work both of great piety and consequence, that we also may be wise in our Generation, and that the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and silent night may be used as well for sowing of good seed, as tears.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing is an imitation of a memorable and religious Act of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who finding a part of <hi>Lancashire</hi> to be extreamly backward in Religion, and the Benefices swallowed up in impropriations, did by decree in the Dutchy Court, erect four stipends of 50. l. <hi>per annum</hi> a piece for Preachers well chosen to help the Harvest, which have done a great deal of good in those parts where they have laboured; neither doe there want other Corners in the Raelm, that for a time would require the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary helps.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>My very good Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THough it be true, that who so considereth the wind and Rain, shall neither sow nor reap; yet there is a season fit for every action, &amp; so there is a time to speak, and a time to be silent: there is a time when the words of a poor simple man may profit and that poor man in the Proverbs, which delivered the City by his wisdom, found it without this opportunity, the power both of wisdom and eloquence lose but their labour, and charm the deaf Adder. God therefore before his Son that brings mercy, sent his Servants (the Trumpets of repentance) to levell every high hill to prepare the way before him, making it smooth and straight, and as it is in spirituall things, where Christ never comes before his Way-maker hath laid even the heart with sorrow &amp; repentance, since self-conceited, and proud persons think themselvs too good, and too wise to learn of their inferiours, and therefore need not the Physician: So in the acquiring of Earthly wisdom, it is not possible for nature to attain any mediocrity of perfection before she be humbled by knowing her self and her own ignorance; and not only knowledge, but also every other gift (which we call the gifts of Fortune) have power to puff up earth, Afflictions onely levell those Molehils of Pride, plowes the heart, and makes fit for wisdom to sow her seed, and for grace to bring forth her encrease: happy is that man therefore, both in regard of heavenly wisdom, and of Earthly, that is thus wounded to be cured; thus broken to be made straight; thus made acquainted with his own imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions that he may be perfected, <hi>utilius est frangi lanquoribus ad salutem, quam remanere in columen ad damnatione,</hi> supposing this to be the time of your affliction, that which I have propounded to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51161:14"/>
my self, is by taking this seasonable advantage: like a true friend, though far unworthy to be accounted so, to shew you your true face in a glasse, and that not in a false one to flatter you, nor in one that is oblique and angular to make you seem worse then you are, and so offend you, but in one made by the reflections of your own words and actions; from whose light proceeds that voice of the People, which is often, not unjustly called the voyce of God.</p>
               <p>But herein since I purpose a truth, I must intreat liberty to be plain a liberty which I know not whether at this time, or no, I may use safely, I am sure at othertimes I could not: yet of this resolve your self, <hi>it proceeds from love, and from a true desire to do you good, that you knowing the generall opinion, may not altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or contemn it, but mend what you find amisse in your self, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn what your judgment shall approve.</hi> For to this end, shall truth be delivered as nakedly, as if your self were to be anatomized by the hand of opinion.</p>
               <p>All men can see their own perfections, that part of the Wallet hangs before; A true friend, whose worthy office I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form (since I fear both your self and all other great men want such being themselves true friends to few or none) is first to shew the other end, which is hid from your eyes.</p>
               <p>First, therefore behold your errours in discourse, you delight to speak too much, but not to hear other men; this (some say) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Pleader, no Judge for by this means sometimes your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is intangled with a liking of your own arguments, though they be the weaker and rejecting of those, which when your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were setled, your own judgments would allow for stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Thus while you speak in your own element, no man ordinarily equals you: but when you wander (as often you delight to do) you then wander indeed, and never give such satisfaction as this curious time requireth.</p>
               <p>This is not caused by any naturall defect, but first for want of election, when you having a large and fruitfull mind, should not so much labour what to speak, as to find what to leave unspoken, Rich Soils are often to be weeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:51161:15"/>
Secondly, you cloy the Auditory when that you would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, speech must either be sweet or short.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you converse with books, not with men, and of books especially humane, and have not excellent choice with them who are best books, with a man of action and employment. You seldom converse, and then with your underlings; not freely, but as a Schoolmaster with his Schollars, even to teach, and never to learn.</p>
               <p>But if sometimes you would in your familiar discourses hear others, and make election of such as know what they speak, you should know that many of these tales which ordinarily you tell, to be but ordinary, and many other things which you delight to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, and serve in for novelties to be but <hi>Crambebis cocta,</hi> as in your pleadings you were wont to insult over misery, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh liberally against the person which then bred you many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whose poyson yet swels, and the effect now appeareth: So were you still wont to be a little too carelesse in this point, to praise and dispraise upon sleight grounds, and that some times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly; so that your reproofs or commendations were for the most part neglected and contemned, when the censure of a Judge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slowly, but surely, should be a brand to the guilty, and a crown to the vertuous.</p>
               <p>You will jest at any man in publick, without respect of the persons dignity, or your own; this disgraceth your gravity, more then it can advance the opinion of your wit, and so do all other acts which we see you do indirectly with any touch of vain glory, having not respect to the true end.</p>
               <p>You make the Law to lean a little too much to your opinion; whereby you shew your self a legall Tyrant, striking with that weapon whom you please, since that you are able to turn the edge any way; For this, the wise Masters of the Law give warning to young Students, that they should be wary, least while they hope to be instructed by your integrity and knowledge, they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with your subtilty, armed with authority.</p>
               <p>Your too much love of this world is seen, when having the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

compassion, as if you thought all too little for your self, or that God had given you all that you have (if you think wealth to be his gift I mean that we get well, for I am sure the rest is not) only to that end, that you should still gather more, and never be satisfied but try how much you can gather, to account for at the great and generall day; we desire you to amend this, and let your poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents in <hi>Norfolk</hi> find some comfort, where nothing of your estate is spent towards their relief, but all brought up hither, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishing of the County.</p>
               <p>In the last, which might have been your best of service to the State, affecting to follow that old rule, <hi>to give Iustice leadon beeles, and iron hands,</hi> you used too many delayes, till the Delinquents hands were loose, and yours bound; in that work you seemed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fabius,</hi> but there the humour of <hi>Marcellus</hi> would have done better; What need you have sought more evidence then enough, whilest you pretended the finding out of more? missing your aym, you discredited what you had sound.</p>
               <p>Thus best judgments think, though you never used, such speeches are fathered upon you: yet, you might well have done it, and done it but right, for this crime was second to none but the Powder-Plot, that would have blown up all at one blow, a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cruelty, this would have done the same by degrees, a lingering but as sure a way, one by one might have been called out, till all Opposers had been removed.</p>

no more; you stopt the accusations and confessions of some, who perhaps had they been suffered, would have spoken enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move some stumbling blocks out of your way: And that you did not this in the true form of any one, but out of I know not what present unadvised humour, supposing enough behind to discover all, which fell not out so; for there is <hi>sigillum confessionis non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteri,</hi> howsoever as the Apostle saith in another case, <hi>you went not right to the truth;</hi> and though you are to be commended for what you did, yet you are to be reprehended for many circumstances in the doing; and doubtlesse in this crosse God hath an eye to your negligence, and these Bryers are left to be pricks in your sides, and thorns in your eyes.</p>
               <p>That which we commend you for, are those many excellent parts of nature, and knowledge of the Laws, you are endued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; but these are only good in their good use, wherfore we shank you for standing stoutly on the behalf of the Common-wealth, hoping it proceeds not from a disposition to oppose great Ones, as your enemies say, but to do justly, and deliver truth indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You cannot but have much of your estate (pardon my plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) ill gotten. Think how much you never spoke for, how much by speaking either unjustly, or in unjust causes; account it then a blessing of God, if thus it may be laid out for your good, and not left for your heir to hasten the worst of much of the rest, perhaps of all: For so we see God oftentimes proceeds in judgment with many hasty gatherers you have enough to spare, being well laid, to turn the Tide, and fetch all things again.</p>
               <p>But if you escape J suppose it worthy of an <hi>if,</hi> since you know the old use, <hi>that none called in question must go away uncensured.</hi> Yet consider, that accusations make wounds, and leave skars.

And if at length by the means of our good Masters and Governours, you recover the favour you have lost: give God the glory in actions, not in words only, and remember us with some of your past misfortune whose estate and undoings, hath, doth, and may hereafterly in the power of your breath.</p>
               <p>There is great mercy in dispatch, delayes are tortures, where-with by degrees we are rent out of our estates: Do not you, if you be restored, as some others do, fly from the service of vertue to serve the time, as if they repented their goodnesse, or meant not to make a second hazard in Gods house. But rather let this crosse make you more zealons in Gods cause, sensible in ours, and more sensible in all that expresse thus.</p>

               <p>I have great wrong, and the greater, because the manner of my Speech did most evidently shew that I spake simply, and only to satisfie my conscience, and not with any advantage or policie to sway the cause.

But to attend her busines, only hoping that a whole man meanly able may do as well in half a man betterable.</p>
               <p>And if her Majesty think either, that she shall make an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in using me, that is rather a man of study, then of practise and experience. Surely, I may remember to have heard that my Father (an example I confesse rather ready then like) was made Sollicitour of the Augmentation (a Court of much business) when he had never practised, and was but 27. years old.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Brograve</hi> was now in my time called Attorney of the Dutchie when he had practised little or nothing, and yet hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his place with great sufficiencie.</p>
               <p>But these things, and the like, as her Majestie shall be made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of them, Wherein, knowing what authority your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships commendation hath with her Majesty, I conclude with my self, that the substance of strength which I may receive will be from your Lordship.</p>
               <p>It is true, my life hath been so private, as I have had no means to do your Lordship service.</p>
               <p>But as your Lordship knoweth I have made offer of such as I could yeeld; For as God hath given me a mind to love the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: So incidently I have ever had your Lordship in singular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, whose happy ability her Majesty hath so long used to her great honour and yours. Besides, that amendment of State or countenance which I have received, hath been from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And therefore, if your Lordship shall stand a good friend to your poor Alge, you shall but <hi>Tuere opus,</hi> which you have begun. And your Lordship shal bestow your Benefice upon one that hath more sense of Obligation, thenof self-love. Thus humbly desiring pardon of so long a Letter, I wish your Lordship all happinesse,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Do write, because I have not yet had time fully to expresse my conceit; nor now to attend you touching Irish Matters; considering them, as they may concern the State, that it is one of the aptest particulars that hath come, or can come upon the Stage to purchase your Lordship honour upon. I am moved to think for three Reasons, Because it is ingenerate in your house, in respect of my Lord your Fathers noble attempts; because of all the accidents of State of this time, the labour resteth most upon that.</p>
               <p>And because the world will make a kind of comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those that set it out of <hi>France,</hi> and those that shall bring it unto <hi>France,</hi> which kind of honour, giveth the quickest kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; the transferring this honour upon your self consisteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two points: the one, if the principall persons employed come in by you, and depend upon you: the other, if your Lordship de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your self to undertake a care of that matter. For the persons it falleth out well, that your Lordship hath had no interest in the persons of imputation.</p>
               <p>For neither Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams,</hi> nor Sir <hi>Iohn Norrice</hi> was yours, Sir <hi>William Russel</hi> was conceived yours, but was curbed, Sir <hi>Connyers Clifford</hi> (as I conceive it) dependeth upon you, who is said to do well.</p>
               <p>And if my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> in this interim shall accommodate well, I take it he hath alwayes had good understanding with your Lordship: So as all things are not only whole and intire, but of favourable aspect towards your Lordship.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51161:20"/>
If you now chuse well, wherein, in your wisdom you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member there is a great difference in choice of the persons, as you shall think the affairs to incline to composition or to war. For your care taking, generall and popular conceit hath been, that Irish causes have been much neglected, whereby the very reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of better care will be a strength.</p>
               <p>And I am sure, her Majesty, and my Lords of the Councell, do not think their care dissolved, when they have chosen whom to employ.</p>
               <p>But that they will proceed in a Spirit of State, and not leave the main point to discretion.</p>
               <p>Then if a resolution be taken, a consultation must be governed upon information, to be had from such as know the place and matters in Fact.</p>
               <p>And in the taking of information, I have alwayes noted, there is a skill, and a wisdom. For I cannot tell what an account or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry hath been taken of Sir <hi>William Russel,</hi> and of Sir <hi>R. Bingham</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Thomond,</hi> of Mr. <hi>Wilbraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But J am of opinion, much more would be had of them, if your Lordship shall be pleased severally to confer not. <hi>Obliter,</hi> but expresly, and upon Caveat given them to think of it before. For, <hi>bene docet qui prudenter interrogat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the points of opposing them, J am too much a stranger to the businesse to deduce them: but in a Topique, me thinks the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent interrogatories, must be either of the possibilities and means of accord, or of the nature of the War, or of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the particular abuses, or of the joyning of practise with force, in the division of the Rebels.</p>
               <p>If your Lordship doubt to put your sickle in others Harvest; First, time being fit to you in Mr. Secretaries absence.</p>
               <p>Next, <hi>Vnita fortior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, being mixt with matter of War, it is fittest for you.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I know your Lordship will carry it with that modesty, and respect towards aged Dignity, and that good correspondence towards my dear Ally, and your good friend now abroad, as no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience may grow that way.</p>

               <p>THese Advertisements which your Lordship imparted to me, and the like, J hold to be no more certain to make judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon, then a Patients water to a Physitian: Therefore for me upon one water, to make a judgment, were indeed like a foolish bold Mountebank, or Doctor <hi>Birket:</hi> yet for willing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties sake, I will set down to your Lordship what opinion sprung in my mind upon that I read.</p>
               <p>The Letter from the Councell there leaning to mistrust, J do not much rely upon, for three Causes.</p>
               <p>First, because it is always both the grace and the safety from blame of such a Councell to erre in causion: whereunto add that it may be they or some of them are not without envy towards the person who is used in treating the Accord.</p>
               <p>Next, because the time of this treaty hath no shew of diffimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. For, that <hi>Tyron</hi> is now in no straight. But he is not now like a Gamester, that will give over because he is a Winner, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath no more money in his purse.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I do not see but those Articles, whereupon they ground their Supposition may as well proceed out of fear, as out of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>J see no deep cause of distrusting the cause, if it be good. And for the question, her Majesty seemeth to me a Winner three ways.</p>
               <p>First, her purse shall have some rest.</p>
               <p>Next, it will divert the forrain designs upon that place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though her Majesty is like for a time but to govern <hi>Precario</hi> on the North, and be not in true command in better state there then before: yet, besides the two respects of ease of charge, and advantage of opinion abroad before mentioned, she shal have a time to use her Princely Policy in two points to weaken them, the one by division and disunion of the heads; the other by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering and winning the people from them by justice, which of all other causes is the best.</p>

               <p>And because he may aswell waver upon his own inconstancy as upon occasion. (And wanton variablenesse is never restrained but with fear.)</p>
               <p>I hold it necessary he be menaced with a strong war, not by words, but by musters, and preparation of Forces here, in case the Accord proceed not but none to be sent over, least it disturb the Treaty, and make him look to be over-run as soon as he hath laid Way Arms.</p>

And (but that your Lordship is too easie to passe in such cases from diffimulation to verity) J think if your Lordship lent your reputation in this case, it is to pretend, that if a defensive War as in times past, but a wofull reconquest of those parts in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, you would accept the charge, J think it would help to settle him, and win you a great deal of honour <hi>gratis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that which most properly concerneth this action, if it prove a peace, J think her Majesty shall do well to cure the Root of the Disease, and to professe by a Commission of peaceable men, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of respect and countenance, and reformation of abuses, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and injustices there, and to plant a stronger and surer Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment then heretofore, for the ease and protection of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for removing of the Sword or Government in Arms from the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> or the sending of a Deputy which will eclipse it, if peace follow, J think unseasonable.</p>

                  </gap> or of the affection from which it proceedeth, your Lordship is designed to a service of great merit, and great perill; and as the greatnesse of the perill must needs include a like proportion; So the greatnesse of the merit may include no small consequence of perill, if it be not temperately governed: For all immoderate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse extinguisheth merit, and seareth up distast and envy, the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Fore-runners of whole changes of perils. But I am at the last point: First, some good spirit leading my pen to presage to your Lordship successes; wherein it is true, I am not without my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Divinations, none of them suppositions. And yet not all naturall.</p>
               <p>For first, looking into the course of Gods providence in things now depending, and calling to consideration, how great things God hath done by her Majesty, and for Her, I collect he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of this great defection in <hi>Ireland,</hi> thereby to give an urgent occasion to the reduction of that whole Kingdom, as upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>Desmond,</hi> there ensued the whole reduction of that whole Province.</p>
               <p>Next, your Lordship goeth against three of the unlucky Vices of all others, <hi>Disloyalty, Ingratitude,</hi> and <hi>Inconstancie,</hi> which three offences, in all examples, have seldom their doom adjourned to the world to come. Lastly, he that shall have had the honour to know your Lordship inwardly as I have had, shall find <hi>Bona extra,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may better ground a divination of good, then upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a Sacrifice. But that part I leave: for it is fit for others to be confiden upon the Cause The goodnesse and justice wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is such, as can hardly be matched in any example.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:51161:23"/>
It being no ambitious War of Forraigners, but a recovery of Subjects. And that after lennity of conditions often tryed and a recovery of them not only to obedience, but to humanity and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy from more then <hi>Indian Barbarism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another kind of Divination familiar to matters of State, being that which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> so often relyeth upon in his time, when he saith, That which for the time past is worst of all, is for the time to come the best; which is, that things go ill not by accident, but by errour: wherein your Lordship have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore an awaking <hi>Censor,</hi> but look for no other now, but <hi>Medicae cura,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And although your Lordship shall not be the blessed Physitian that cometh in the declination of the Disease, yet you embrace that condition which many noble Spirits have accepted for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; which is, that you go upon the greater perill of your fortune, and the lesse of your reputation, and so the honour countervai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the adventure: of which honour your Lordship is in no smal possession, when that her Majesty known to be one of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Princes, in discerning of Spirits that ever governed, hath made choise of you meerly out of her Royall judgment (her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction rather including to continue your attendance) into whose hand and trust to put the commandment and conduct of so great Forces, the gathering in the fruit of so great charge, the execution of so many councels, the redeeming of the defaults of so many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer governours, and the clearing of the glory of so many and happy yeers Raign, only in this part excepted.</p>
               <p>Nay further, how far forth the perill of that State is interlaced with the perill of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, how great the honour is to keep and defend the approaches of this Kingdom, I hear many discourse. And indeed, there is a great difference whether the <hi>Tortoys</hi> gather her self into her shell hurt or unhurt. And if any may be of opinion, that the nature of the enemy doth extinuate the honour of the service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Rebell and a Savage, I differ from him: for I see the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stest tryumphs that the Romans in their greatnesse did obtain, and that whereof the Emperours in their Stiles, took additions and denominations, were of such an Enemy; that is, people barbarous
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51161:23"/>
and not reduced to civility, magnifying a kind of Lawless Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, prodigall in life, hardened in body, fortifyed in Woods and Bogs, placing both justice and felicity in the sharpness of their swords.</p>
               <p>Such were the Germains and ancient Brittains, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; upon which kind of people, whether the victory were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, or a reconquest, upon a Rebellion or Revolt, it made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that I could ever find in honour.</p>
               <p>And therefore, it is not the enriching predatory War that hath the preheminence in honour, else should it be more honour to bring in a Carrack of rich burthens, then one of the twelve Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Apostles.</p>
               <p>But then this nature of people doth yeeld a higher kind of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, considered in truth and substance, then any War can yeeld, which should be atchieved against a civill enemy, if the end may be <hi>pacique impovere morem,</hi> to replant and refound the honour and policy of that Nation, to which nothing is wanting but a just and civill Government, which design as it doth descend to you from your noble Father, who lost his life in that action, though he paid tribute to nature, and not to fortune.</p>
               <p>So I hope your Lordship shall be as fatall a Captain to this war as <hi>Affricanus</hi> was to the War of <hi>Carthage,</hi> after that both his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and his Father had lost their lives in <hi>Spain</hi> in the same War. Now although it be true, that these things which I have writ (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but Representations unto your Lordship of the honour and appearance of successe of the enterprize) be not much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of my direction; yet it is that which is best to me, being no man of War and ignorance in the particulars of Estate. For a man may by the eye, set up the white right in the middest of the Butt, though he be no Archer,</p>
               <p>Therefore, I will only add this wish, according to the English phrase, which termeth a well-willing advise; I wish, that your Lordship in this whole action looking forward, set down this position.

For designing to Fame and Glory, may make your Lordship in the adventure of your person, to be valiant as a private Souldier, rather then as a Generall.</p>
               <p>It may make you in your commandements, rather to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, then disciplinary.</p>
               <p>It may make you presse Action, in respect of the great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation conceived, rather hastily, then seasonably and safely.</p>
               <p>It may make you seek rather to atchieve the War by force, then by intermixture of practise.</p>
               <p>It may make you (if God shall send you prosperous beginning) rather seek the fruition of that honour, then the perfection of the work in hand.</p>
               <p>And for your proceeding like a good Protestant upon warrant, and not upon good intention, your Lordship knoweth in your wisdom, that as it is most fit for you to desire convenient liberty of instruction.</p>
               <p>So is it no lesse fit for you to observe the due limits of them, remembring that the exceeding of them, may not only procure, in case of adverse accidents, a dangerous disadvow. But also in case of prosperous successe to be subject to interpretation, as if all were not referred to the right end.</p>
               <p>Thus I have presumed to write these few lines unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>in methodo ignorantiae,</hi> which is, when a man speaketh of a Subject not according to the parts of the matter; but according to the modell of his own knowledge. And most humbly desire your Lordship, that the weaknesse thereof may be supplyed in your Lordship, by a benigne acceptation, as it is in me by my best wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing.</p>

               <p>THis standing at a stay, doth make me in my love towards your Lordship zealous, least you do somewhat, or omit some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that amounteth to a new errour: For I suppose, of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer matters, there is a full expectation; wherein, for any thing that your Lordship doth, I for my part, who am remote, cannot cast nor devise, wherein any errour should be, except in one point, which I dare not censure, nor disswade; which is that as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith, in this affliction you look up, <hi>ad manum percutientem,</hi> and so make your peace with God.</p>
               <p>And yet I have heard it noted, that my Lord of <hi>Liecester,</hi> who could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ver get to be taken for a Saint, yet in the Queens dis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, waxed seeming Religious, which may be thought by some, and used by others as a case of resembling yours, if men do not see, or will not see the differences between your two dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>But to be plain with your Lordship, my fear rather is, because I hear some of your good and wise friends, not unpractised in the Court and supposing themselvs not to be unseen in that deep and unscrutable Center of the Court, which is her Majesties mind, do not only tole the Bell, but even ring out peales, as if your fortune were dead and buried, and as if there were no possibility of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her Majesties favour; and as if the best of your condition were to live a private and retyred life, out of want, out of perill,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51161:25"/>
and out of manifest disgrace: and so in this perswasion of theirs, include a perswasion to your Lordship wards, to frame and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate your actions and mind to that end, I fear I say, that this untimely dispair, may in time bring forth a just dispair, by causing your Lordship to slack and break off your wise, loyall, and seasonable endeavour and industry, for reintegration into her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties favour: in comparison whereof, all other circumstances are but as <hi>Attomi,</hi> or rather as <hi>vacuum,</hi> without any substance at all.</p>
               <p>Against this opinion, it may please your Lordship to consider of these reasons which I have collected, and to make judgment of them; neither out of the melancholly of your patient fortune; nor out of the insusion of that which cometh to you by others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which is subject to much tincture.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>ex rebus opis.</hi> but of the nature of the persons and actions themselves, as the truest and lesse deceiving, grounded of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>For though I am so unfortunate, as to be a stranger to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties eye, much more to her nature and manners: yet by that which is extant, I do manifestly discern, that she hath that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the divine nature and goodnesse, as <hi>quos amavit, amavit us<expan>
                        <am>

                     </expan> ad finem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where she hath a creature, she doth not deface it, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat it: insomuch, as if I observe rightly in these persons, whom she hath heretofore honoured with her speciall favour she hath covered and remitted, not only defections, and ingratitudes in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but errour in State and service.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if I can Scholar-like, spell and put together the parts of her Majesties proceedings now towards your Lordship, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but make this construction, that her Majesty in her Royall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, never purposed to call your Lordships doings into publick question: but only to have used a Cloud without a showr, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them by some restraint of liberty, and debarring from her presence. For both the handling the cause in the Star-Chamber was inforced by the violence of libelling and Rumours, wherein the Queen thought to have satisfied the World, and yet spared your appearance.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:51161:26"/>
               <p>And then after, when that means which was intended to quench Malicious Bruites turned to kindle them, Because it was said your Lordship was condemned unheard, and your Lordships sister wrote that private Letter: Then her Majestie plainly saw that these winds of rumours could not be commanded downe, without a handling of the cause by making your party, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting your defence; and to this purpose I do assure your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that my brother <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> who is to wise to be abused, though he be both reserved more then is needfull: yet in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he hath ever constantly, and with Asseveration assirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: that both those dayes, that at the Star-chamber, and that at my Lord keepers were won from the Queene meerly upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and point of honour against her own inclination. Thirdly, in the last proceedings I note three points which are directly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, that her Majestie did expresly forbear any point which was errecuperable or might make your Lordship many degree uncapable of the returne of her favour or might fixe any character indeleble of disgrace upon you, for she spared the publick places, which spared ignomine; she limited the charge precisely not to touch disloyalty, &amp; no record remaineth to memory of the charge or sentence. Fourthly, the very distinction that was made of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration from the places of service in State, and leaving your Lordship the place of the Mr. of the Horse, do they in my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing point at this, that her Majestie meant to use your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships attendence in Court while the exercise of other places stood suspended. Fifthly, I have heard &amp; your Lordship knoweth better, that now since you were in your own custody: her Maiesty in <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boregio,</hi> and by his mouth to whom she counte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h her royall grants and decrees, hath assured your Lordship she wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> forbid, and not suffer your ruine. Sixtly, as I have heard her Majestie to be a Prince of that <hi>mainanimity</hi> that she will spare the service of a meaner then your Lordship, where it shall depend meerly upon her Choice and will.</p>
               <p>Seventhly I hold it for a principle that those diseases are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest to cure, whereof the cause is obscure and these rafiest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the cause is manifest: whereupon I conclude, that sine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath beene your errour in your lownesse towards her Majestie which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51161:26"/>
have preiudiced you; that your reforming, and conformity may restore you; may be <hi>faber fortunae propriae.</hi> Lastly considering your Lordship is removed from dealing in causes of State, and left on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a place of attendance: Me thinks the ambition of any which can endure no Partners in State-matters may be so quenched, as they should not laboriously oppose themselves to your being in Court.</p>
               <p>So as upon the whole matter I cannot find neither in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Person nor in your own Person, nor in any third Person, neither in former Presidents, nor in your own case, any cause of peremptory dispair.</p>
               <p>Neither do I speak this but that if her Majesty out of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution should design you to a private life, you should vpon the appointment be as willing to go in the Wildernesse, as into the Land of Promise.</p>
               <p>Only I wish, that your Lordship will not preoccupate dispaire, but put trust, next to God, in her Majesties grace, and not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to your self.</p>
               <p>I know your Lordship may justly interpret, that this which I perswade may have some reference to my particular: because I may truly say, <hi>testante non virebo,</hi> for I am withered in my self. But <hi>manebo,</hi> or <hi>terebo,</hi> I shall in some sort be, or hold out. But though your Lordships years and health, may expect return of grace and fortune, yet your eclipse for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> while is an <hi>ultimum vale,</hi> to my fortune; and were it not that I desired hope to see my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther established by her Majesty, as I think him well worthy for that he hath done and suffered, it were time J did take that course, from which J disswa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Thank you for your kind and carefull <hi>Letter,</hi> it perswadeth that which I wish strongly, and hope for weakly, that is, possibility of restitution to her Majesties favour; your Arguments that would cherish hope turn into despair. You say the Queen never meant to call me to publick Censure, which sheweth her goodness, But you see I passed it, which sheweth others power. I believe most stedfastly, her Majesty never intended to bring my cause to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sentence, and I believe as verily, that since the Sentence, She meant to restore me to attend upon her Majesties Person. But they that could use occasions, which it was not in me to let and amplifie occasions, and practise occasions, to represent to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty a necessity to bring me to the one, can and will do the like to stop me from the other.</p>
               <p>You say my errours were my prejudice, and therefore I can mend my self.</p>
               <p>It is true: But they that know I can mend my self and that if I ever recover the Queen, that I will never lose her again, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer to obtain interest in her favour, And you say the Queen never forsook utterly, where she inwardly favoured. But I know not whether the Hour glass of Time hath altered her. But sure <hi>I</hi> am the false Glass of others information must alter her, when I want access to plead mine own cause. I know I ought double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly to be her Majesties both <hi>jure creationis,</hi> for I am her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>jure redemptionis,</hi> for I know she hath saved me from overthrow.</p>
               <p>But for her first love, and for her last protection, and all her great benefits, I can but pray for her Majesty: and my endeavours is now to make my prayers for her, and for my self, better heard. For, thanks be to God; they that can make her Majesty believe I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51161:27"/>
with her, cannot make God believe <hi>I</hi> counterfeit with him.</p>
               <p>And they which can let me from coming neer unto her, cannot let me from drawing neer to him, as <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> do daily. For your Brother, <hi>I</hi> hold him an honest Gentleman, and wish him all good, much rather for your sake: your self I know hath suffered more for me, and with me, then any friend <hi>I</hi> have.</p>
               <p>But I can but lament freely, as you see I do, and advise you not to do, as I do, that is dispair: you know Letters what hurt they have done me, and therefore make sure of this. And yet I could not, as having no other pledge of my love, but communicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to you, the ease of my heart, and yours.</p>

               <p>IT may please your Lordship, as one that wisheth you all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of honour, and as one that cannot leave to love the State, what interest soever I have, or may come to have in it; and as one, that now (this dead vacation time) have some leisure, <hi>ad aliud agendum.</hi> I wil presume to propound unto you that which though you cannot but see, yet <hi>I</hi> know not whether you apprehend and esteem it in so high a degree, that is, for the best action of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation to your self, of sound honour and merit of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.</p>
               <p>And this Crown without ventosity or popularity that the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of any occasion, or the tyde of any opportunity, can possible mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

or offer, and that is the causes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if they be taken by the right handle. For if the wound be not ripped up again, &amp;c. I think no Physitian will go on with much letting of bloud, <hi>in declanatione morbi,</hi> but will intend to purge and corroborate: to which purpose I send you mine opinion (without labour of words) in the inclosed.</p>
               <p>And sure I am, that if you shall enter into the matter, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the verosity of your own spirit; nothing can make unto you a more gainfull return. For you shall make the Queens selici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty compleat, which now as it is, is incomparable.</p>
               <p>And for your self, you shall make your self as good a Patient as you are thought politique.</p>
               <p>And to have no lesse generous ends, then dexterrous delivery of your self towards your ends; and aswell to have true Arts and Grounds of Government, as the facility and felicity of Practise and Negotiation; and to be aswell seen in the periods, and tydes of estates, as in your own circle and way: then the which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, nothing can be a better addition and accumulation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto you.</p>
               <p>This, I hope I may in privatnesse write, either as a Kinsman that may be bold, or as a Scholar that hath liberty of discourse, without commiting any absurdity: if not, I pray your honour to believe, I ever loved her Majesty and the State, and now love our self.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>1. The extinguishing of the Reliques of War.</item>
                  <item>2. The recovery of the hearts of the People.</item>

3. The removing of the rootes and occasions of new troubles.</item>
                  <item>4, Plantations and Buildings.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the first, concerning the places, times and perticularities of further prosecution in Fact, I leave it to the opinion of men of War, onely the difficulty is to distinguish and discern, the prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions which shall bee according to the ends of the state here: that is small, and summary towards the extirpation of the troubles from these, which though they pretend the publique end, yet may refer indeed to the more private, and compendious ends of the Councell there; or other perticuler Governours or Captaines; but still as I touch in my Letter, I do think much letting Blood <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatione morbi,</hi> is against Method of Cure, and that it will but exasperate necessity and dispair, and percase discover the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that which is done already, which now blazeth to the best shew. For <hi>Taglaes,</hi> and proscriptions of two or three principall Rebells, they are no doubt <hi>Iure jentium</hi> lawfull in <hi>Italie,</hi> usually practised upon the Bandelty, best in season when a side goeth down, and may do good into kinds, the one, if they take effect, the other in the distrust, which followeth amongst the Rebels themselves; but of all other points to my understanding, the most effectuall is the expressing or impressing of the designe of this state; upon that miserable, &amp; desolate Kingdom, Containing the same betweene these two Lists or Boundaries, the one that the Queen seeketh not an extirpation of the people but reduction, &amp; that now she hath established them, by her royall power, &amp; arms, according to the necessity of the occasion, her Majestie taketh no pleasure in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of Blood, or displanting of ancient generations; the other that her Majesties princely care is principally, and intentionably bent upon that action of Ireland, &amp; that she seeketh not so much the ease of charge, as the royall performance of her office of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and reclaim of these her subjects, &amp; in a word, that the case is altered as far as may stand with the honour of the time past, which it is easie to reconcile, as in my last note I shewed, &amp; again, I do repeat that if her Majesties designs be to reduce wild &amp; barborous people to civility, &amp; justice, as well as to rebells to obedience; it maketh weakness true christianity, &amp; conditions turn graces, &amp; so hath a fineness in turning civility upon point of honour which is agreable to the honour of these time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:51161:29"/>
And besides if her Majesty shall sodainly abate the Lists of her forces, and shall do nothing to Countervaile it in point of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a publique proceeding, I doubt things may too soon fall back into the state they were in. Next to this, adding reputation to the cause by imprinting an opinion, of her Majesties care, and intention upon this action, is the taking away of reputation from the contrary side, by cutting off the opinion and expectation of forraign Succours, to which purpose this enterprise of Algiers if it hold according to the advertisement. And if it be not wrapped up in the period of this Sommer seemeth to be an opportunity <hi>Caelitus Demissa.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Lastly, for this point that the Ancients called <hi>Potestas factum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diundi ad Sanctatem.</hi> And which is but a mockery when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is strong or proud, but effectual in his declination, that is, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall proclamation of grace, and pardon to such as shall submit, and come within a time prefixed of, of some further reward to such as shall bring others in. That our sword may be sharpned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst others, is a matter of good experience, and now I thinke, will come in time, And percase, though I wish the exclusions of such a pardon exceeding few, yet it will not be safe to continue some of them in their strengths, But to translate them and their generation into England, and give them recompence, and satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, for their possessions there; As the King of Spaine did by divers families of Portugall, to the effecting of all the points aforesaid, And likewise these which fall within the divisions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, nothing can be in priority, either of time or matter prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; to the sending of some Commission of the continuance. <hi>Ad res inspiciendas et componendas,</hi> for it must be a very significant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of her Majesties care of that Kingdome.</p>

               <p>For Religion, to speak first of piety, and then of policy, All Divines do agree, that if Conscience be to be enforced at all (where they differ) yet two things must proceed out of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, the one means of justification, and the other of oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Neither of which they have yet had. Besides, till they be more like reasonable men, then they yet are, their society were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scandalous to true Religion then otherwise, as Pearles cast before Swine; For till they be cleansed from their Blood, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, and theft, &amp;c. which are now not the lapses of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons: but the very Laws of the Nation, They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competible with religion, ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Therefore a tolleration of religion for a time not definite, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in some principall townes, and precincts, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of some French edicts seemeth to me to be a matter warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by religion, and in policy of absolute necessity, and the hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this point I feare hath been a greater casting back of the affairs there, Neither if any English papist, or Recusant, shall for liberty of his Concience transfer his person familie, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes thither, do J hold it a matter of Danger, but expedient to draw an undertaking, and to further population Neither if Rome will cosen it self by conceiving it may be some degree to the like tolleration in England, do I hold it a matter of any moment but rather a good mean to take off the sciences and eagernesse of the humour of Rome, and to stay further excommunications and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interdictions

of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but there would go hand in hand with this same course of advantage Religion. Indeed, where the people is capable thereof, is the sending over of some good Preachers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of that sort which are vehement and zealous perswaders, and not Scholasticall, to be resident in the principall Towns, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them some stipend out of her Majesties Revenues, as her Majesty hath most religiously and graciously done in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and the great recontinuing and replenishing the Colledge begun at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the placing of good men to be Bishops, the taking care of the versions of Bibles, Catechisms, and other books of instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into the Irish language and the like Religious courses, both for the honour of God, and for the avoiding of scandall, and in satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction here, by a toleration of Religion there. For instance, the Barbarism and desolation of the Country considered it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should find any sweetnesse at all of it (which hath been the errour of times past formal and fetched far off from the State, because it will require running up and down for proces of polling and exactions by fees, and many o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her delayes and charges: and therefore, there must be an intrim, in which the justice must be only summary; the rather, because it is fit and safe for a time, the Country do participate of a Marshal Government: and therefore I could wish in every principall town or place of habitation, there were a Captain or Governour, and a Judge, such as Recorders and learned Stewards are here in Corporations, who may have a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Commission to hear and determine, <hi>Secundum saenam dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretione,</hi> and as near as may be to the Customs and Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that by Bill or Plaint, without originall Writ, reserving from their sentence matter of Free-hold and inheritance to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined before a superiour Judge itener<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>For obligation and reward, it is true no doubt, which was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently said that a State is contained in two words, <hi>Praemium</hi> and <hi>paena,</hi> and I am perswaded if a peny in the pound which hath been spent in <hi>paena.</hi> For this kind of War is but <hi>paena,</hi> a chastisement of Rebels without other fruit or emolument of this State, had beene
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51161:30"/>
spent in <hi>praemio,</hi> that is, in rewarding, things had never grown to this extremity. But to speak forwards, the keeping of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Irish persons in tearms of contentment, and without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular complaint; and generally the carrying of an even course be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the English and the Irish, whether it be in competition, or whether it be controversie, as if they were one Nation, without the same partiall course that hath been held by the Governours and Councellours that some have savoured the Irish, and some contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is one of the best Medicines of that State.</p>
               <p>And as for the points of governing their Nobility aswell in this Court, as there of Knighthood, if education of their Children there, and the like points of comfort and allurement, they are things which fall into every mans consideration. For the extirpating of the seeds of trouble, I suppose the main roots are but three.</p>
               <p>The first, the ambition and absolutenesse of the chief of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Sects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the licentious id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enesse of their Kerns and Souldiers thatly upon the Country by Sesses and such oppressions.</p>
               <p>And the third, the barbarous customs in habit of apparel in these Poets or Heraulds, that inchant them in savage manners and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other such dregs of Barbarism &amp; Rebellion, which by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of politick Statutes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> meet to be put in execution, are already forbidden unto which such addition: may be made, as the present time requireth. But the deducing of this Barbarism requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a more particular notice of the state and manners there, ther. fals within my compas. For Plantations and Buildings I do find it strange, that in the last Plot for the population of <hi>Munster,</hi> there were limitations how much in Demeasnes, and how much in Farm and Tenantry, how many Buildings should be erected, how many Irish in mixture should be admitted; but no restraint that they might not build parsim at their pleasure, much lesse any condition, that they should make places fortified and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>The which was too much securenesse to my understanding: so as for this last point, of Plantations, and Buildings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wo considerations which I hold most materiall, the one of quickning; the other for assuring.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:51161:31"/>
The first is, that choice be made of such persons for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Towns and Places, and such Undertakers be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as be men gracious and well-beloved, and are like to be well fellowed; wherein for <hi>Munster,</hi> it may well be, because it is not <hi>res intigra;</hi> but that the former Undertakers stand interessed, there will be some difficulty.</p>
               <p>But surely, in mine opinion, either by agreeing with them, or by over-ruling them by a Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which in this course of a politick proceeding, infinite occasions will require speedily to be held: it will be fit to supply fit qualified Persons for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers.</p>
               <p>The other, that it be not best, as heretofore, to the pleasure of the undertakers and adventurers, where, and how to build and plant, but that they do according to a prescript, or formilary.</p>
               <p>For first, the places both Maritine, and in Land, which are fittest for Collonies and Garisons, aswell for doubt of Forraigners, as for keeping the Country in Bridell, would be found surveyed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon; and then, that the Pattenties be tyed, to build on those places only, and to fortifie, as shall be thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>And lastly, it followeth of course, in Countries of new Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to invite, and provoke inhabitants, by ample Liberties and Charter.</p>

else J hope the modesty of my suit deserveth somewhat; For J know well the Sollicitours place is not as your Lordship lest it, time working alteration somewhat in the profession, much more in that speciall place, and were it not to satisfie my wives friends, and to get my self out of being a Common gaze, and a speech, J protest before God I would never speak word for it. But to conclude as my honourable Lady was a mean to make me to change the name of another, So if it please you to help me as you said to change my owne name, I cannot be but more, and more bounden to you, and <hi>I</hi> am much deceived if your Lordship find not the King well inclined, as for my Lord of Salisbury for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and affectionate.</p>

               <p>For it goeth for currant amongst all men of learning, that those kind of Arts which Clerks in times past did term <hi>Quadra vi nliis,</hi> confirm their Propositions by infallible demonstrations.</p>

               <p>Assuredly, as soon as the new are brought, with their additions by the inventors and their followers, by an interchangable course of natural things they wilfal by degrees to be buried in oblivion, &amp; so on continuance to perish out right, &amp; that perchanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I remember here a Note which <hi>Paterculus</hi> made of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable wits of the Gretians and Romans in their flourishing state, that there might be this reason of their notable downfall in their issue that came after; because by nature, <hi>Quod summo studio petitum esse ascendit in summum difficis<expan>

               <p>So it fared in particular with the eloquence of that Age, that when their Successours found that hardly they could equall, or by no means excell the Predecessours they began to neglect the study thereof, and both to write and speak for many hundred years in a rustic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For I do not hold it an erroneous conceit to think of every Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce, that as now they are professed, so they have been before in all preced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ONe kind of boldnesse doth draw on another, insomuch, as me thinks I should offend not to signifie, that before the transcript of your Book be fitted for the Presse, it will be requisite for you to cast your eye upon the stile, which in the framing of some periods, and in divers words and phrases, will hardly go current, if the Copy brought to me, be just the same that you would publish.</p>

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Clouds of misery darkens so much such as are not in the Sun-shine of prosperity, as they prevaile with many good Natures, furnished with commendable judgment, to give wrong Censures of them. I am one of those that cannot justifie my self so far, as not to be liable to reproof; yet I am of that rank that cannot stoop to the stroke of every malicious tongue. But in you I have found such abundance of favour, who never knew me, but in my tyde of Ebbe, that I must needs leave this with you, as &amp; Record to witnesse my shame and reproach, if I be ingratefull for it, so far as either abilities of body, or goods of fortune may extend to perform. And hereunto he sets his hand, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to live and dye,</p>

               </gap> he can never obtain, yet in the issue, his beliefe appeares not to be false, his hope makes him not ashamed, his labour is not in vain.</p>
            <p n="2">II. He believes three to be one, and one to be three, a Father not to be elder then his Son, a Son to be equall with his Father, and one proceeding from both to be equall with both; he believes three ersons in one nature, and two Natures in one Person.</p>

               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:51161:48"/>
III. He beleeves a Virgin to be a Mother of a Sonne, and that very Sonne of hers to be her maker. He beleeves him to have been shut up in a narrow room, whom Heaven and Earth could never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. He beleeves kim to have been born in time, who was and is from Everlasting. He beleeves him to have been a weak Child carried in Arms, who is the Almighty, and him once to have dyed, who onely hath life, and immortality in himself.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. He beleeves the God of all Grace to have been angry with one that have never offended him, and that God that hates sinne to be reconciled to himself, though sinning continually, and never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or being able to make him satisfaction. He beleeves the just God to have punished a most just person, and to have justified himself though a most ungodly sinner, He beleeves him freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and yet a sufficient satisfaction was made for him.</p>
            <p n="5">V. He beleeves himself to be precious in Gods sight, and yet loathes himself in his own. He dares not justifie himself even in those things wherein he can find no fault with himself, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves God accepts him in those services wherein he is able to find many faults.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. He praises God for his justice, and feares him for his mercy. He is so ashamed as that he dares not open his mouth before God and yet he comes with boldnesse to God, and askes him any thing he needs. He is so humble as to acknowledge himselfe to deserve nothing; but evill, and yet beleeves that God meanes him all good. He is one that fears alwayes, yet is as bold as a Lyon. He is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sorrowfull, yet alwaies rejoycing, many times complaining, yet alwaies giving of thanks, He is the most lowly minded, yet the greatest inspirer, most contented, yet ever craving.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. He beares a lofty, spirit in a mean condition, when he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest he thinks meanest of himself. He is rich in youth, and poore in the midst of riches. He beleeves all the world to be his, yet he dares take nothing without speciall leave from God, He Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51161:49"/>
with God for nothing, yet lookes for a great reward, He looseth his life and gaines by it, and whilst he looseth it, he saveth it.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. He lives not to himselfe, yet of all others, he is most wise for himselfe, He denieth himselfe often, yet no man loveth himselfe so well as he. He is most reproached, yet most honoured. He hath most afflictions, and most comforts.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The more Injury his Enemies do him, the more advantage he gaines by them. The more he forsakes worldly things, the more he enjoies them.</p>
            <p n="10">X. He is the most temperate of all men, yet fares most delicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he lends, and gives most freely, yet he is the greatest usurer, he is meek towards all men, yet inexorable by men, He is the best Child, Husband, Brother, Friend, yet hates Father, and Mother, Brother, and Sister. He loves all men as himselfe, yet hates some men with a perfect hatred.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. He desires to have more grace then any man hath in the world, yet is truly sorrowfull when he seeth any man have lesse then himselfe, he knoweth no man after the flesh yet gives all men their due respects, he knoweth if he please man he cannot be the servant of Christ, yet for Christ his sake he pleaseth all men in all things. He is a Peace maker, yet is continually fighting, and an irreconcilable Enemy.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. He beleeves him to be worse then an Infidell that provides not for his family, yet himself lives, and dles without Care. He accounts all his inferiours, yet stand; stifly upon authority. He is severe to his Children, because he loveth them, and by being favourable unto his Enemy, he revengeth himself upon him.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. He beleeves the Angells to be more excellent Creatures then himselfe, and yet counts them his servants. He beleeves that he receives many good turns by their meanes, and yet he neither
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51161:49"/>
praies for their assistance, nor offers them thanks, which he doth not disdain to do to the meanest Christian.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. He beleeves himselfe to be a King how mean soever he be. How great soever he be, he thinkes himself not to good to be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the poorest Saint.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. He is often in prison yet allwaies at liberty. A Freeman though a servant. He loves not honour amongst men, yet highly priseth a good name.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. He beleeves that God hath bidden every man that doth him good, to do, so he yet of any man is the most thankfull to them that do ought for him, He would lay down his life to save the soule of his Enemy, yet will not adventure upon one sinne to save the life of him who saved his.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. He swears to his own hinderance, and changeth not, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that his Oath cannot tie him to sinne.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. He beleeves Christ to have no need of any thing hee doth, yet maketh account he doth relieve Christ in all his acts of Charity. He knoweth he can do nothing of himself, yet labours to work out his own salvation, he confesseth hee can do nothing, yet as truly prosesseth he can do all things, he knoweth that flesh, and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God, yet beeleeveth he shall go to Heaven both body, ond soule.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. He trembles ar Gods word, yet counts it sweeter to him then hony, and the hony-Gombe and dearer then thousands of Gold, and silver.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. He beleeves that God will never dame him, and yet fears God for being able to cast him into Hell. He knoweth he shall not be saved by nor for his good workes, yet he doth all the good workes he can.</p>
            <p n="21">
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:51161:50"/>
XXI. He knoweth Gods providence is one all things, yet is so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his calling, and businesse, as if he were to cut out the threed of his fortunes. He beleeves before hand that God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed what he shall be, and nothing can make him to alter his purpose, yet praies and endeavours, as if he would force God to save him for ever.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. Hee praies and labours for that which he is confident God meanes to give, and the more assured he is, the more earnest he praies, for that he knows he shall never obtain, and yet gives not over. He praies, and labours for that which he knowes he shall be no lesse happie, without he praies with all his heart not to be lead into temptation, yet rejoiceth when he is fallen into it, he beleevs his praiers are heard even when they are denied, &amp; gives thanks for that which he praies against.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. He hath within him both flesh, and spirit, yet he is not a double minded man, he is often ledd Captive by the law of sinne, yet it never gets domminion over him, he cannot sinne, yet can do nothing without sinne. Hee can do nothing against his will, yet maintains he doth what he would not. He wavers and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yet obtains.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. He is some times so troubled, that he thinks nothing to be true in Religion; yet if he did think so, he could not at all be troubled, He thinks sometimes that God hath no mercy for him, yet resolves to dye in the pursuit of it. He believes like <hi>Abraham</hi> against hope, and though he cannot answer Gods Logick, yet with the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> hee hopes to prevail with the Rhetorick of importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:51161:50"/>
XXV. He wrastles and yet prevailes, and though yeelding himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the least blessing he enjoyes, yet <hi>Jacob</hi> like, he will not let him go without a new blessing. He some times thinks himselfe to have no grace at all, and yet how poor and afflicted soever he be besides, he would not change conditions with the most prosperous man under Heaven, that is a manifest Worldling.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. He thinkes sometimes that the Ordinance of God doe him no good, yet he would rather part with his life, then be deprived of them.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. He was born dead, yet so that it had been Murther in any to have taken his life away. After he began to live, he was ever dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. And though hee hath an eternall life begun in him, yet hee makes account he hath a death to passe through.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. He counts self murther a hainour sinne, yet is ever busied in crucifying the flesh and in putting to death his earthly Members, not doubting, but there will come a time of glory where he shall be esteemed precious in the sight of the great God of Heaven and Earth, appearing with boldnesse at his Throne, and asking any thing he needs, being endued with humility, by acknowledging his great crimes and offences, and that he deserveth nothing but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere punishment.</p>
            <p n="30">
               <hi>XXX.</hi> He believes his soul and body shall be as full of glory, as them that have more, and no more full, then theirs that have lesse.</p>
            <p n="31">
               <hi>XXXI.</hi> He lives invisible to those that see him, and those that know him best do but guesse at him; yet those many times judge more truly of hm then he doth of himself.</p>
            <p n="32">
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:51161:51"/>
XXXII. The world will sometimes account him a Saint, when GOD accounted him a hypocrite, and afterwards when the World bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for an Hypocrite, then God owned him for a Saint.</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. His death makes not an end of him. His soule which was put into his body, is not to be perfected without his body; yet his soul is more happy, when it is separated from his body, then when it was joyned unto it. And his body though torn in pieces, burnt in ashes, ground to powder, turned to rottennesse, shall be no loser.</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. His Advocate, his Surety shall be his Judge; his mortall part shall become immortall, and what was sowne in cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <head>A <hi>Confession of the Faith,</hi> Written by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> Knight, Viscount of St. Alban, about the time he was Sollicitour Generall to our late Soverign Lord King <hi>James.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Believe, That nothing is without beginning, but GOD, nor Nature no Matter, no Spirit, but one only, and the same GOD,</p>
               <p>That GOD as he is Eternall, Almighty, only wise, only God in his Nature: so he is eternally Father, Sonne, and holy Spirit in Persons.</p>
               <p>I believe, That God is so holy, pure, realous, that it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to be pleased in any Creature (though the work of his own hand) so that neither Angel, Man nor World, could stand, or can stand one moment in his eyes, without beholding the same in the face of a Mediator.</p>
               <p>And therefore, that before him, with whom all things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

The Lambe of God was slain before all Worlds, without which Eternal Councel of his, it was impossible for him to have descended to any work of Creation, but should have enjoyed the blessed and individuall Society of three Persons in God, head only for ever; but that out of his eternall and infinite goodnesse and love (purposing to become a Creator, and to communicate with his Creatures he ordained in his Eternall Councell, That one Person of the God head should in time be united to one Nature, and to one particular of his Creatures, That so in the person of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; the true sadder might be fixed, whereby God might des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to his Creatures; and the Creatures might ascend to God: So that by the reconciliation of the Mediatour, turning his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance towards his Creatures (though not in the same degree) made way unto the disposition of his most holy, and sacred will whereby some of his Creatures might stand and keep their State, others might fall, and be restored into their state, but yet remaine in Being, though under wrath and corruption, all in the vertue of the Mediator, which is the great Mystery and perfect Centry of all Gods ways with his Creatures, &amp; unto which all his other works and wonders, do but serve and refer. That he chose (according to his good pleasure) Man to be that Creature, to whose Nature the Eternal Son of God should be united, and among the Generations of men elected a small flock, to whom the participation of himself, he purposed to expresse the riches of his glory. All the ministration of Angels, damnation of Divels and Reprobats, and universall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of all Creatures, and dispensation of all times have no other end; but as the wayes and Ambages of God, to be furthet glorified of his Saints, who are one with the Mediator, who is one with God.</p>
               <p>That by vertue of his Eternall Councel (touching a Mediator) he descendeth at his own good pleasure, and according to times &amp; seasons to himself known, to become a Creator) and by his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Word created all things, and by his Eternall Spirit doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and preserve them.</p>
               <p>That he made all things in their first estate good, and removed from himself the begining of all evill and vanity, unto the liberty of the Creature; but reserved in himself the begining of all resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51161:52"/>
and the liberty of his grace using (neverthelesse) and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the falling and desention of the Creature, which to his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciens</hi> was eternally known to make way to his Eternall Councell, touching a Mediator and the Work, he purposed to accomplish in him.</p>
               <p>That God created Spirits, whereof some kept their standing, and others fell. He created Heaven and Earth, and all their Armies and Generations, and gave unto them constant and everlasting Laws, which we call <hi>Nature,</hi> which is nothing else but the Laws of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; which Laws (neverthelesse) have had three changes or times, and are to have a fourth and last.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The first,</hi> When the matter of Heaven and Earth was created without formes.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The second,</hi> The interim of every dayes work.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The third,</hi> By the Curse, which notwithstanding was no new <hi>Creation,</hi> but a <hi>Privation</hi> of part of the first Creature.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And the last end of the world, the manner where of is not yet revealed. So as the lawes of Nature which now remaine and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Inviolably till the end of the world begin to be in force when God first rested from his works, and ceased to create. But received a revocation (in part) by the curse, since which timey the changed not.</p>
               <p>That, notwithstanding God hath rested, and ceased from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting since the first Sabboth, yet neverthelesse he doth accomplish and fullfill his divine will in all things great, and small, singular, and generall, as fully and exactly by providence, as he would by miracle, &amp; new creation, though his worke be not immediate, &amp; direct, but by compasse, not violating Nature which is his owne law upon his Creatures.</p>
               <p>That as at the first the Soule of Man was not produced by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth but was breathed immediatly from God: So that the wayes and proceedings from God with Spirits are not concluded in Nature, that is in the lawes of Heaven and Earth, but are reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the law of his secret will, and grace wherein God worketh still, and resteth not from the work of Creation, but continnueth working till the end of the world, what time that worke also shall be accomplished, and an eternall Sabboth shall ensue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:51161:52"/>
Likewise that whensoever God doth break the law of Nature by miracles (which are ever new Creatures) he never cometh to that point or passe, but in regard of the worke of Redemption which is the greater, and whereunto all Gods Saints and <hi>Martirs</hi> do referre.</p>
               <p>That God created man in his owne likenesse or Image in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Soule, in innocency, in free-will, in Soveraignty That he gave him a law and commandement which was in his power to keep, but he kept it not.</p>

               <p>That (neverthelesse) this great sinne was not originally moved by the malice of man, but was intimated by the suggestion and instigation of the Divell who was the first defected Creature, who did fall of malice and not by temptation</p>
               <p>That upon the fall of man death and vanity upon the Justice of God, and the Image of God was defaced, and Heaven, and Earth which was made for mans use were subdued and corrupted by his fall. But then that instant and without intermission of time after the words of Gods law became through the fall of man frustrate, as to obedience there succeeded the greater word of the promise, the righteousnesse of God might be wrought by faith.</p>
               <p>That aswell the law of <hi>God</hi> as the word of his promise enduce the same for ever, but that they have been revealed in severall manners according to the dispensation of times for the law was first imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that remnant of light of nature which was left after the fall being sufficient to accuse, then it was more manifestly expressed in the written law, &amp; was yet more opened to the Prophets, &amp; lastly expounded in the true perfection of the Sonne of <hi>God</hi> the great Prophet, and interpreter of the law.</p>
               <p>That likewise the word of the promise was manifested &amp; revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. First by the immediate revelation &amp; inspiration after the figures which were of two Natures.</p>

And lastly, by the holy Ghost which illuminateth the Church to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>That in the fulnesse of Time, according to the promise and oath of God, of a chosen Image descended the blessed Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God, and Savior of the Word, who was conceived by the holy Ghost, and took flesh of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>

Apostles, and was crucified at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and after a true and natural death, and his body laid in the Sepulchre, the third day he raised himself from the bonds of death, and arose, and shewed himself to many chosen witnesses by the space of many days. And at the end of those days, in the sight of many ascended into Heaven, where he continueth his intercession, and shal from thence at a day appointed, come in great glory to judge the World.</p>
               <p>That the sufferings and merit of <hi>Christ,</hi> as they are sufficient to do away the sins of the whole World, so they are only effectuall to such as are regenerate by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who breaketh where he will of free grace (which grace as a seed incorruptible) quickneth the Spirit of Man, and conceiveth him a new the Son of <hi>God,</hi> and a Member of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Christ having Mans flesh, and Man having Christs spirit there is an open passage and mutual imputation whereby sinne &amp; wrath is conveyed to Christ from man, and merit and life is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to Man from Christ, which Seed of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> first fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gureth in us the Image of Christ, slain or crucified in a lively faith, and then reigneth in us the Image of <hi>God,</hi> in holinesse and charity, though both imperfectly and in degrees far differing, even in <hi>Gods</hi> elect, aswel in regard of the fire of the spirit, as of the illumination, which is more or lesse in a large proportion; as namely in the Church before Christ, which yet neverthelesse was partakers of one and the same salvation, and one and the same means of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with us.</p>
               <p>That the work of the Spirit, though it be not tyed to any means in Heaven or Earth, yet it is ordinarily dispensed by the preaching of the Word, the administration of the Sacraments, the covenants of the Fathers upon the children, prayer, reading, the censures of the Church, the society of the godly, the crosses and afflictions, <hi>Gods</hi> benefits, his judgments upon others, Miracles, the contemplation of his Creatures. All which things, some be more principall. <hi>God</hi> usethas the meanes of Vocation or conversion of his elect not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51161:54"/>
derogating power to call immediately by his grace, &amp; at all hours &amp; moments of the day (that is) of mans life according to his good pleasure.</p>
               <p>That the word of <hi>God</hi> whereby this will is revealed continued in revelation &amp; tradition untill <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; that the Scriptures were from <hi>Moses</hi> time, to the times of the <hi>Apostles</hi> &amp; <hi>Evangelicts</hi> in whose ages after the comming of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> the <hi>Teacher</hi> of all <hi>truth</hi> the booke of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> is shut and closed up, to receive any new addition, and that the Church hath no power over the Scriptures to teach or command any thing contrary to the written word, But is as the Ark, wherein the <hi>tables</hi> of the first Testament were kept and preferred (that is to say) the Church hath onely the Custody, and delivery of the Scriptures committed unto the same together with the interpretation of them.</p>
               <p>That there is an Vniversall or Catholique Church of <hi>God</hi> disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over the face of the Earth, which Christs <hi>Spouse</hi> and <hi>Christs</hi> Body being gathered of the Fathers of the old world of the Church of the Jewes, of the Spirits, of the faithfull, dissolved of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the faithfull militant, and of the names yet to be born, which are already written in the Book of life.</p>
               <p>That there is a visible Church distinguished by the outward works of <hi>God</hi> Servant, and the receiving of the holy doctrine, with the use of the misteries of <hi>God,</hi> and the invocation and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Holy Name.</p>
               <p>That there is also a Holy succession of the 'Prophets of the new. Testamen, and Fathers of the Church from the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Disciples which saw our Saviour in the flesh unto the consumation of the work of the Ministery, which persons are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of <hi>God,</hi> by guift or inward annointing and the vocation of <hi>God</hi> followed by an outward calling or ordination of the Church.</p>
               <p>I Believe that the Soules of those that dy in the Lord are blessed and rest from their labour and enjoy the sight of <hi>God,</hi> yet so as they are in expectation of the further revelation of their glory in the last day. At which time, all flesh of man shall arise and be changed and shall appeare and receive from Iesus Christ his eternall Judgement, and the glory of the Saints shall then be full and the Kingdome shall be give, to God the Father from which time all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51161:54"/>
things shall continue for ever in that being and estate which then they shall receive: So as there are three times (if times they may be called) or parts of Eternity.</p>
               <p>The first, <hi>The time before beginning, when the God-head was only without the being of any Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second, <hi>The time of Mystery, which continueth from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the dissolution of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third, <hi>The time of the Revelation of the Sons of God, which time is the last, and is without change.</hi>
