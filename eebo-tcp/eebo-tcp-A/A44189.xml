            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Long Parliament Dissolved.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ISDOM saith, <hi>There is as vvell a time to
Speak, as a time to be Silent;</hi> And though
Wise Men are often hardly put to it, to
know the Proper seasons of the one or
the other: Yet where Necessity hath left
no Choice, but absolutely imposeth One
upon us, there can be no Srait upon the Judgment. And
would to God it could not be made most demonstrable that
such a Necessity we are under at this time. For no less
than the <hi>Lavvs,</hi> and with them the <hi>Lives, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
of every <hi>English-Man</hi> is at Stake; and we, with all
other our Fellow <hi>English-Men,</hi> are under the highest Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to break our guilty Silence, or with our Tongues in
our Mouthes, see all our <hi>Antient Rights</hi> Raped from Us and
our Posterity for ever; and our <hi>Living Child</hi> of <hi>Liberty</hi> and
<hi>Property,</hi> slily stolen from our sides, and a <hi>Dead One</hi> of <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salage</hi>
and <hi>Misery</hi> laid in its room.</p>
            <p>Wherefore on our own behalf, and the behalfes of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the People of <hi>England,</hi> we crave leave to speak.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Reason</hi> differenceth Men from Bruits, so <hi>Lavvs</hi> (which
are but the results of <hi>Reason</hi>) doth difference <hi>Free-men</hi> from
<hi>Slaves:</hi> For it is <hi>Lavv</hi> only which makes and secures our
<hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> that neither they nor we, are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
as <hi>Beasts</hi> by <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleasure;</hi> but lays such a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant</hi>
upon the <hi>Government,</hi> as that it cannot do to us, or
any thing that is ours, <hi>ad Libitum,</hi> but must <hi>Govern</hi> as the
<hi>Lavv</hi> directs.</p>
            <p>Hence was it that the wisdom of our Ancestors laid out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101532:3"/>
itself more, to Legally secure our <hi>Lives, Liberties</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi>
from all <hi>Wrongs</hi> from the <hi>Government,</hi> than from the
<hi>Private Injuries</hi> of <hi>one</hi> Man to <hi>another:</hi> For they knew that
occasional and temporary <hi>Lavvs</hi> would easily be made to
restrain these, if they did; But to secure the other, make
sure provision of <hi>frequent Parliaments:</hi> For they had so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a Value of, and kindness for our <hi>English Liberty,</hi> that
they would not trust the <hi>Guardianship</hi> thereof to any under
Heaven, but to the <hi>People themselves.</hi> And therefore that
they might have a continued Assurance and a perpetual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
that their <hi>Liberties</hi> should continue in <hi>statu quo,</hi> It
was Ordained, <hi>That for the maintenance of the said Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Remedy of Mischiefs and Grievances that daily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
A Parliament should be held once every year,</hi> 36. Edw.
3. Cap. 10</p>
            <p>'Tis true, some of our Kings have omitted the holding of
<hi>Parliaments</hi> for a longer time than a year, and the People
have silently waited, and born that Omission. And in like
manner so have we, notwithstanding his <hi>Majesties Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation
Oath,</hi> and his many most solemn and oft repeated
Promises for the <hi>Keeping of the Lavvs;</hi> and yet continuing
a Parliament of the prodigious length of 15 or 16 years,
till they were not the <hi>Representatives</hi> of the one half of the
People of <hi>England:</hi> Yet, we say, we held our Peace. And
though we know, that all the People of <hi>England</hi> have equal
Right to be <hi>Represented,</hi> and could make it demonstrable,
that a Parliament of that length can never be the <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi>
of half the People; for all from 21 years of age to 37,
which are the Major part of the People of <hi>England,</hi> both
in number and vigor, and the Flower and Strength of the
Kingdom, and that are only able to Defend it from any Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
or Invasions, were never <hi>Represented</hi> in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that the major part of those that were <hi>Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
never so much as thought or intended that the <hi>Trust</hi> they
gave, should be continued to such a monstrous duration
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101532:3"/>
for the Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> who think themselves born to
have their share in <hi>Ruling</hi> as well as being <hi>Ruled,</hi> judge it a
very hard thing upon them, That they should be secluded
from their hopes of having the honour to serve their King
and Country in Parliament (the greatest <hi>Schole of Knovvledge</hi>
and improvement in the Kingdom) be bound to walk in the
Hall, or like Laquies, wait in the Lobby all their lives long,
and see 500 persons hold the Seats, as if they had each of
them a Pattent for his Place; whereas if we had annual Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
according to Law, there might 8000 Gentlemen
have served in Parliament since the Kings restoration, which
had been a great accomplishment to the Kingdom; And
that there being at least 20000 Gentlemen in the Kingdom,
and many of them of as good Brains, Families and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
as any in the House, should be debarr'd from that
highest Trust and Honour, and should be forced to dance
attendance all their dayes on 500 only, would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
any Nation in the World to have spoke but we.
And yet for all this we were silent and resolved to wait with
patience: For we considered, though we had not what we
ought to have, yet it was but still a sin of Omission, and did
think with our selves, that some Circumstances of Affairs
abroad, and the Poverty and Discontent of the People at
home, would at last reduce things into their old and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Order, and that we should at length see Parliaments in
their Antient Legal Channel again, and both <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>People</hi> reaping the Fruits and Blessings, that would flow
from thence.</p>
            <p>But in stead thereof, to our great amazement, all on the
suddain, we found our selves plunged into a far greater
extremity than ever; for whereas before Parliaments were
only omitted or continued longer than the Law intended,
but now by the last <hi>Prorogation,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> hath positively
Ordered that a Parliament shall not be held within the time
appointed by Law: So that the matter is come to this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101532:4"/>
narrow Issue, <hi>That either this Prorogation is Null, and the
Parliament as an End, or, All our LAWS are of no Effect.</hi>
And therefore we Appeal to Mankind in general, and more
particularly to every Member of the late Parliament, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are not reduced to an unavoidable necessity of
Breaking our Silence.</p>
            <p>For, our Law <hi>(Viz.) 4. Edvv. 3. Cap. 10. 36. Ed. 3. Cap. 14.
5. Edvv. 3. No. 141. 5. Ed. 2. No.—1. Rich. 2. No.</hi> 95. Do
positively appoint <hi>The Meeting of a Parliament once vvithin a
year.</hi> But directly contrary to all these Statutes, this last
Prorogation doth Order the <hi>Parliament</hi> not to Meet within
a Year, but some Months after. And therefore either this
<hi>Prorogation</hi> is Null and Void in Law, and consequently the
Sitting and Acting as a <hi>Parliament</hi> is at an End, or else by
your Sitting and Acting, you will Admit and Justify, That
a particular Order of the King is to be obeyed, tho contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> of what importance soever; and
thereby at once subvert the whole Government of <hi>England</hi>
by Law. The dreadful Consequences whereof would
fill any true <hi>English-man</hi> with Indignation to consider.</p>
            <p>For if a particular Order of the King is to be obeyed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all those Laws, made for holding <hi>Parliaments</hi> for
the Maintenance of all the Laws of the Kingdom, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of Mischiefs and Grievances which daily happen, then
another particular Order of the Kings, contrary to <hi>Magna
Charta;</hi> and another Order of the Kings, contrary to the
<hi>Petition of Right;</hi> and another particular Order of the Kings,
contrary to the Statute <hi>De Tallagio non concedendo,</hi> must also
be obeyed. So that then the King may by his particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
take away any mans Life, Liberty or Estate, when ever
he pleaseth: And our condition is changed from that of
<hi>Freemen,</hi> to be worse than that of <hi>Villaines:</hi> For tho the
Lord had the power over his <hi>Villaines</hi> Goods and Liberty,
yet he had not a power over the Life of his <hi>Villaine,</hi> that the
Law secured to him. But of the Kings particular Order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101532:4"/>
to Law, must be obeyed, we have nothing to secure
our very Lives unto us.</p>
            <p>For if our Lives, Liberties and Estates have their Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from the <hi>Lavvs</hi> only, and the <hi>Lavvs</hi> have their Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from <hi>Parliaments,</hi> then if a particular Order of the
Kings, concerning the Sitting of <hi>Parliaments</hi> must be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
contrary to all these Acts, made for holding of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
the king when ever he pleaseth may take away both
the laws which should Secure us, and <hi>Parliaments</hi> which
should secure our Laws, and then in what a condition we
shall be left, (we conceive) both you and we may easily
judge; For now if any threatens to take away our lives ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily,
and without the legal Judgement of our Peers, or
our liberties without shewing cause in law, we can answer
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> will not suffer you. If any threaten to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
our Properties, we can now answer the <hi>Petition of Right</hi>
will not suffer you. If any attempt to raise money without
consent in <hi>Parliament,</hi> we can yet say no, the law <hi>De Tallagio
non concedendo</hi> will not permit you. But if the kings particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Order contrary to these laws must give <hi>supercedias</hi> to
them, and be obeyed by us, What have we to answer then?
For you throw the whole People of <hi>England</hi> on their knees
to beg for their lives, and for what part of their liberties and
propeties Will and Pleasure will please to spare them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lavvs</hi> are the Banks and Fence of our <hi>Lives,</hi> and all
that we can call Ours, so that no man can wrong us, neither
in our Persons nor our Properties, but we can strait run to
them for Right, But if contrary to <hi>lavv,</hi> an Order of the
kings, that breaks down these Banks and Bounds, and like
an Inundation overflows all our Freedom, must be obeyed,
What end will there be of our Miseries? Where will it stop?
or who, or what can stop it? Now tis injustice in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whilest our <hi>lavvs</hi> govern us, to take any thing that is ours
illegally from us, but if the kings Order against our <hi>lavvs</hi>
must be obeyed, 'twill be Mercy that any thing of ours is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101532:5"/>
left us. Nay to say truth, then all is his, and we have nothing
that we can call ours, for 'tis <hi>lavv</hi> alone that makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
            <p>Nor are our written <hi>lavvs</hi> and <hi>statutes</hi> only subverted,
but the Common <hi>lavv</hi> may also by the same Rule: For
if an Order of the King must be obeyed, against <hi>Acts</hi> of
<hi>Parliament</hi> of the highest Importance, and most Universal
concern, then also may his Order be obeyed against the
<hi>Common lavv;</hi> and then whereas by the <hi>Common lavv</hi>
every Member of <hi>Parliament</hi> is to have 40 days Summons
before the Meeting of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that he may have time
sufficient to prepare himself to come up and attend the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of his duty, that there may be a full Assembly, and
nothing done upon the catch, nor by a Party; the kings
Order contrary to this <hi>law</hi> may restrain the 40 dayes to 20,
10, 5, 4 days, nay 24 hours if he please; and it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
supposed, he cannot want a <hi>Quorum</hi> of each House of
his own Servants and Officers who may dispatch what <hi>lavvs</hi>
soever he pleaseth, though to the total alteration of the
Government, before any from the Country can come up
to hinder it.</p>
            <p>And not only the <hi>Statute</hi> and <hi>Common lavv,</hi> but <hi>lex &amp;
consuetudo Parliamenti,</hi> the laws and customs of Parliament,
is likewise subverted. For whereas by that law and custom
of Parliament 40 Members and a Speaker makes a House,
this or any succeeding kings, may be the same Power, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that 24, nay 14, or any less number shall make a House,
and then a Parliament may be packt with ease at pleasure.
And the law and custom of Parliament allowes freedom of
debate, and indemnisies every Member that speaks his mind,
from any other Judgement but that of their own Bar (from
which freedom it hath the denomination of <hi>Parliament</hi>) But
if a private Order of the king or his Successors must be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
the Members of either House may be brought to
answer for their freedom of speech at the <hi>kings-bench-bar</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101532:5"/>
and from thence at a worse place, and they have no law left
nor custom of Parliament to relieve them.</p>
            <p>We might instance in many other Laws and Customs of
Parliament, by which extraordinary Priviledges are given
to the whole Parliament, and to every Member thereof in
particular, but that would rather be sit a Volumn than such a
Discourse: Wherefore we will shut up this Point with this
Conclusion: <hi>That if you do admit that the Kings Order, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to lavv, must be obeyed, you do admit, that the king and
his successors, may hold Parliaments only vvhen they please, and
when they do hold them, may make them do vvhat they please<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Nay, that they may vvith or vvithout Parliaments make lavvs,
or make their particular Orders and Proclamations go for lavvs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
raise Money, and do to Parliaments, and all the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
to their lives, to their liberties, in to their estates, vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
either the kings themselves, their ministers, or the vvorst
of evil Counsellors can desire.</hi> An admission so Impudent
that the <hi>French Tyranny</hi> came in more modestly than this.
For the <hi>French king</hi> introduced his Absolute Rule by Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<hi>He pray'd a lavv to order him to raise Money but till their
next Meeting, and that neither but if there vvere occasion.</hi>
which the Parliament by Inadvertency granted and have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Met since. But he did not issue out an Order contrary
to the Laws, and bare-fac'd impose his Will upon them: For
tho they were <hi>French-men</hi> they could never endure that:
And shall <hi>English-men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> not by <hi>Inadvertency,</hi> but upon <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation</hi> patiently suffer the self same Yoak to be put upon
them, on worser Tearms?</p>
            <p>This we say not, Gentlemen, by way of acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that you are in a legal Capacity now, to do us either
good or hurt, for your Day is done, and your Power-expired,
but that you may not like a Snuffe, smell ill after you are out.
For the only reason why we more particularly direct our
selves to you, is, because of the Character you have born,
that therefore you should not so much as seem to give Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
the upper hand of the Law, That however you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101532:6"/>
lived, yet all may say and witness for you, that you dyec. well
and made a worthy End. For, it is now no time to flatter
you, and therefore we deal truly with you; Things are at
their Issue, and either you are dead or our laws are so: But
our laws, we are sure are living, and we trust will live to all
Generations, though there are some Gentlemen of your
Assembly, so desirous of longer life, that they labour migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to perswade the world, That the laws we mention for
<hi>Annual Parliaments,</hi> are Repealed: But if they are, 'tis this
Prorogation hath Repealed them: Forthey were declared
to be in force when the <hi>Triennal Act</hi> was made, in 16 <hi>Caroli
primi;</hi> and so they are in the Statute for Repealing that
<hi>Triennal Act,</hi> in 16 <hi>Caroli secundi,</hi> in these notable words.
<hi>And because by the ancient Lavvs and Statutes of this Reals
made in the Reign of king</hi> Edw. 3. <hi>Parliaments are to be held
very often,</hi> &amp;c. And how this Act should title the<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the
<hi>Antient Lavvs and Statues of this Realm,</hi> and say, <hi>that by
them Parliaments are to be held very often,</hi> if they were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
and were no laws and statutes of the Realm, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
strange. For if they were no laws and statutes, then
certainly Parliaments are not to be held very often, nor at
all by them; but that law affirms, <hi>They are the Antient
Laws and Statutes of the Realm,</hi> and such Laws and Statutes
that Parliaments are to be held by them: So that you see
these laws were declared in force, even by your se<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ves in
the sixteenth year of his Majesties Reign, and we are sure
there hath been no new Parliament since to Repeal them,
however we hope the whole Nation will strictly observe
every man among you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that to sit a little longer yet, would
sacrifice to this Prorogation, the very best laws (and in there
all the laws and liberties) of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore let not any delude you with such little pittiful
Objections, that you your selves are ashamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for your own; and urge them only as other mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
for these sorry doses will never do, no nor the highest
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101532:6"/>
cordial they can propose, your voting your selves alive:
for Miracles are ceased, and if they were not, raising a dead
Parliament to life again, is beyond the power of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and one of those works that ceaseth for ever.</p>
            <p>'Tis very strange to see how these Gentlemen wriggle
about, and like drowning persons catch at every straw to save
them.</p>
            <p>Yesterday they urged these laws were Repealed, and now
they see they can do no good there, to day they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that they are in force, and apply all their wit to prove
that the laws may stand, and this Prorogation too: For say
they, Those laws do appoint, we shall have a Parliament
once a year, and so we shall have for all this Prorogation;
for we had a Parliament in 75, and we shall have a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in 76; This is a very fine account: But according to
this computation there may be 14, 16, or 23 months as well
as 12 in a year: But he is a very novice in our law, that
knows not, that whereever a <hi>year, every year, vvithin a year,
yearly, or once a year,</hi> is mentioned in any Statute, it is to be
understood <hi>tvvelve Months</hi> only, and not one day more
or less: As may be seen in the Statutes of <hi>Usury, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusancy,
Conformity, Appeals for Murder,</hi> and all other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
wherein a <hi>year</hi> is expressed.</p>
            <p>And it is more repugnant to reason to understand by a
<hi>year</hi> in these Statutes more than <hi>tvvelve months,</hi> than in any
of the former; for the following words, <hi>And more
often, if need be.</hi> And the urging the Reason of their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency;
<hi>For the maintenance of the Lavvs, and the remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Grievances and Mischiefs vvhich daily happen,</hi> do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew, that the Laws do not intend that Parliaments should
alwayes be intermitted for so long as <hi>tvvelve months,</hi> but
never longer. But these Gentlemen would rather alter out
very Language, and the Common acceptation of words,
than cease to be a <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore this last <hi>Prorogations</hi> is Null in Law, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101532:7"/>
a <hi>Parliaments</hi> shall not be held till <hi>fifteen months,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Laws that order, a <hi>Parliament</hi> shall be held once
every year, and if the prorogation be Null, you are Null'd
therewith.</p>
            <p>Now do not think to salve your Authority by your own
Vote, for we and all men must tell you, That no <hi>Parliament</hi>
that is not an<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocedently so, can make it self a <hi>Parliament</hi> by
Vote, and nothing can be the Cause of it self.</p>
            <p>VVell But now since neither the Laws are Recealed
to make room for this prorogation, nor the prorogation and
the Laws are able to stand both together, these Gentlemen
hunt to find out a third expedient, and say, That if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
be null, because of its illegal length of time, yet they
are not thereby dissolved but only dismissed <hi>sine die,</hi> and to
be recalled by the kings proclamation; a subterfuge as vain
as either of the former, and altogether as unable to answer
the ends of those that urge it; for if the kings prorogation
was Null in Law, because it ordered the meeting of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at a day of such an undue length as was contrary to
the Law, then how can a proclamation, ordering their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the same day, make it good in Law? For the only
thing illegal in the prorogation was the length of time (for
its not to be doubted but his Majesty may prorogue parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
so it be not contrary to Law) and to think that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
for meeting at the same time (or indeed at any
time) can cure the illegality of the prorogation, is but an
absurd opinion, <hi>Et uno absurd dato, mille sequuntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore we affirm, That a prorogation or dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<hi>sine die,</hi> was one of the antient Forms of dissolving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
for a parliament so dismissed, never sat again, nor
was it ever done in any other case. And good reason, for
otherwise all our Laws would be utterly eluded: For if the
Laws appoint a Parliament shall be holden once even year,
and a prorogation comes and sayes no; a Parliament shall
not be held till a year and a quarter, and after you see this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101532:7"/>
prorogation Null and Void in Law, you can slide your
selves from under the Proroga<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion (and are content
that there should be a Nullity) and shelter your selves
under a <hi>sine die,</hi> and urge that on your behalf: we
say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could you do this. Our Laws were of no avail
but meer Cyphers only.</p>
            <p>And therefore we say first, That it is not really so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for you were prorogued to a certain day, and not <hi>sine
die;</hi> and if the Law make that day (to which you
are prorogued) as impossible ever to come, as the
<hi>thirtieth of February,</hi> we cannot help that; but it is the
only day upon which your being stands, and if by the
Law that day can never come, then by the same Law
you can never come.</p>
            <p>But were it so, yet still it were but as broad as long, for
a prorogation <hi>sine die,</hi> is nothing but a dissolution neither,
for there is no other <hi>sine die</hi> in Nature but that: so that
look which way you will, whether on the Prorogation of
the <hi>fifteenth of February,</hi> or a <hi>Dismission sine die,</hi> the Law
shews you nothing but Death; and you love to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament a great deal better than we, if you will
adventure your Lives and Fortunes, to sit after the <hi>Lavv</hi>
hath put a <hi>Dissolution</hi> on you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edvvard</hi> the Fourth held a Parliament the eighth day of
<hi>April,</hi> in the thirteenth year of his Reign, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued
to the sixth of <hi>October</hi> following, but being desirous
to call them sooner, if the urgency of his affaires should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it, no other expedient could be found to enable the
King to do it, but by a special Act of Parliament to adjorn
them to that time, and yet if occasion did require to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

unto the sixth day of <hi>October</hi> next
coming, then, there to be holden. It is Ordained by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of this present Parliament, that all-be-it any such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
and adjournment be had, yet if for any urgent
cause moving his highness, it shall be thought to the same
behoveful, to reasume, reassemble, and have appearance of
this his said <hi>Parliament,</hi> at any time or place, within this his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101532:8"/>
Kingdom, asore the said fixth day of <hi>October,</hi> that then at his
pleasure he may direct his several Writs to the Sheriffe or
Sheriffes of every shire of this his Realm to make open
Proclamation in every Shire-Town, That all Lords spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and temporal, being Lords of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and all Knights
of shires, Citizens of Cities, and Burgesses of Broughs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
in this present <hi>Parliament,</hi> Personally appear at such
day and place, as in the same Writs of Proclamation shall be
specified: so alwayes that every of the said writs be made out
twenty days or more before the said day of appearance limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the same: And that such appearance at that day and
place, to be limited by the said Writs, be taken and had of
like force and effect, as if the same king had prorogued and
adjourned this his said Parliament unto the same day and
place. And that then the said prorogation and adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be had to the said Palace of <hi>Westminister</hi> unto the said
sixth day of <hi>October</hi> to be void and of none effect.</p>
            <p>And in this Instance, there are these two things observable.
<hi>First,</hi> How careful our Ancestors were in all their concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to their king; that they did no: damage their Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
thereby hurt the people, who had entrusted them. And
next. That that was a very learned Age and had the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>Littleton</hi> and <hi>Hussey</hi> two as great Lawyers as any
one time hath produced. And certainly all this trouble,
care and pains, both to King and Parliament might have
been saved, if either that Age or those learned men could
have found out the expedient of a <hi>Parliament prorogued</hi> or
<hi>adjourned, sine die,</hi> but there was none.</p>
            <p>And tis well that there is not; for if the king by proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>sine die,</hi> may hold a parliament but in <hi>fifteen months,</hi>
then by a prorogation <hi>sine die,</hi> he may not hold them if he
please but in <hi>fifteen year,</hi> nay not hold them (if he
please) but in <hi>fifteen year,</hi> nay but in twice or thrice <hi>fifteen if</hi>
he will.</p>
            <p>And on the other hand. If the king by a prorogation <hi>sine
die,</hi> may hold a parliament, then he may call them in together
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101532:9"/>
again in 7 or 8 dayes, when all the Country members are
returned to their homes, and none can attend by reason of
the suddennesse thereof, but such as the King may hope
for any thing from (as we have already intimated): so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
are the mischiefs that would attend a <hi>sine die</hi> proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
that, God be thanked, our <hi>Laws</hi> and Ancestors
would never abide it (in any other sencethan we have said)
And therefore do not think the People of <hi>England</hi> will ever
do that indignity to their <hi>Lavvs!</hi> That dishonour to the
<hi>Finger of God,</hi> which by so stupendious and over-ruling a
Providence hath dissolved you! Or that dis-service to their
own Interest, as ever to acknowledge you any more for
their <hi>Representative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sine die,</hi> being thus unable to help in this matter, these
Gentlemen are forced to return again to the Prorogation, as
seeing a uecessity to stand or fall by it, and either to make
that good, or to be totally routed, and therefore their last
labour spends it self in tumbling the Records, to find out
Presidents, as if Presidents could prevail against <hi>Law,</hi> and
'tis boasted by them (with mighty joy) that they have at
Last found out one President in <hi>Q. Eliz Reign,</hi> wherein a
Parliament was Prorogued for three dayes more than a
Year.</p>
            <p>But we say, this is no President at all, but only one illegal
Fact, and that there is but one in nigh 400 Years: And 300
Prorogations make very little for the honour of those that
urge it. But if this were a President, what would it avail,
since it is directly contrary to so many known <hi>Lavvs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For
if a President can make an illegal thing lawful, there is no
wickedness under the Sun, but may bring a President to
warrant it. And therefore the greatest Sages of the <hi>Law</hi>
have alwayes asserted, <hi>That the Lavv is the Met-vvand and
Standard of Presidents; And that all Presidents against
the Lavv, vvere to be rejected as vvicked and unvvarantable, or
else you give Presidents the Mastery over the Lavv; Nay null
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101532:9"/>
the Lavv, and set up a new Rule of our practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have presidents, and very an<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ient presidents to that
that this kingdom was of the <hi>Romish</hi> profession; what is it
therefore warrantable for us to follow those Presidents
contrary to law and turn Papists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have a president that
king <hi>John,</hi> contrary to law, resign'd the realm of <hi>England</hi>
to the Pope, Is it therefore lawful for any other king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to do the same? VVe have also a president that Queen
<hi>Eliz.</hi> (from whence your president is fetch'd) contrary to
law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Imprisoned some Members of the House of Commons
for speaking their mind in parliament, Is it therefore ever
the more lawful for the king and his successors to violate
your priviledges? VVherefore unless the presidents be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it is not lawful to follow your presidents, unless you
your selves would be made presidents to future Ages. And
therefore it was well said by the Lord chief Justice <hi>Bramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,
We are not to stand upon presidents, but upon the lavvs,
and the presidents look either the one vvay or the other, they
are to be brought back unto she Lavv.</hi> And the Lord Justice
<hi>Vaughan</hi> tells you thus; <hi>Though Presidents have been so often
that they may be called by the Name of Usuage, yet that,
if usuage hath been against the obvious meaning of an Act of
Parliament, in the vulgar and common acceptation of the Word,
then is it rather an Oppression of those concerned, than an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVherefore unless you will stand upon record as the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors
of all the people of <hi>England</hi> (for no less than all
the people of <hi>England</hi> are concerned herein) you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
admit of any president against the obvious meaning of
not one Act alone, but so many Acts of parliament, and
that not in a wrested sence, but in the plain vulgar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

            <p>Your duty lying thus manifestly before you, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worthy a man that can obstruct you. For it is only the
single fear, that the people will not choose you again, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101532:10"/>
canmake you deny it, and to deceive any, in thetrusts they
have given you, because you doubt they will credit you no
more, is but an odd kind of honesty, neither does the policy
thereof look over strong, for to be sure your betraying
your trusts, in opposing the Laws and the Interest of
the People, is never the way to be chosen again.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, your stout and faithful standing for,
and defending them, is an infallible way to have your trusts
renewed. And to think to keep it against the peoples will,
is a weakness too great for any man, that would be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more than once removed.—</p>
            <p>Pray remember your Elder Brother, the former long
Parliament, they would sit against the peoples desire, and
yet, though they had a special Act of Parliament for their
sitting, and an Army to back that Act, yet you see when the
peoples minds were turned against them, do they and their
Army what they could, the people never left till they had
unroosted them; they took such vengeance on them, as cost
many of them their Lives, their, Liberties, and the Fortunes
of almost all of them: All which it is possible might have
been saved, had they observed their season, and instead of
imposing themselves, let the People have had their yearly
Representatives; for lack of which, the dissatisfaction and
revenge of the People was engaged against them, so that it
was engaged against them, so that it was themselves that first
pull'd dowin ruine upon their own heads. For by their long
sitting, they wearied the <hi>Roundhead,</hi> as you have done the
<hi>Cavalire,</hi> And the worst Omen that befa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls a Government,
is, when its friend falls from it, And look what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that turned the Gentlemen that were on the Parliament
side against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you will find the self-fame reason
turneth your old Friend against you; for as they stomack'd
it then, to see a few of themselves, perpetuating their own
Rule to the exclusion of all others so do we now.</p>

And if the Nation would not endure that parliament
(though they had a Law for their sitting, because of their
strange and unwonted length, can you think the same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
will abide your longer sitting in express and utter defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of all the laws of the kingdom? And shall it be told to
future generations, That <hi>England</hi> chose a Parliament in sixty
one, who after they had sate fifteen years, and were by an
illegal Prorogation, legally dissolved, yet out of a wretched
unconscionable desire to sit yet longer; <hi>Betrayed the People
that chose them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sate upon a Prerogative account, contrary
to the knovvn Laws of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let any man think it strange that we account it Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for you to sit and Act contrary to our Laws: For if in
the first parliament of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, <hi>Grimes</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
for lack of Courage only, were adjudged guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for suarendring the places committed to their Trust;
How much more you? if you turn <hi>Renegadoes</hi> to the People
that entrusted you? and as much as in you lies surrender,
not a little pittifull Castle or two, but all the legal defence
the People of <hi>England</hi> have for their lives, liberties and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
at once.</p>
            <p>Ne<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ther let the vain perswasion delude you that no presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
can be found that one <hi>English</hi> Parliament hath hang'd
up another, (though peradventure even that may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a mistake) for an unpresidented crime calls for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presidented
punishment, and if you shall be so wicked to do
the one (or rather endeavour to do, for now you are no
longer a parliament) What ground of confidence you can
have that none will be found so worthy to do the other,
we cannot understand, and do faithfully promise (if your
unworthyness do provoke us to it) that we will use our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and uttermost endeavours whenever a New
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101532:11"/>
parliament shall be called) to choose such as may
convince you of your mistake. The old and infallible Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
That parliaments are the pulse of the people, shall
loose its esteem, or you will find that this your presumption
was overfond, however it argues but a bad mind to <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it believes it shall not be punished.</p>
            <p>But all grand offenders against the Law ever were of that
belief, but it hath faild them very oft, For <hi>Andrevv Horn</hi>
in his <hi>Mirror of Justice,</hi> tell us, That <hi>Alfred</hi> hanged <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Segnor, Cadvvine, Cole</hi> and 40 Judges more for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to Law: And yet all those false judgements
were but in particular and private cases and concernments,
not upon the Laws themselves. And our Histories of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times say, That Sir <hi>W. Thorp,</hi> Chief Justice of the <hi>Kings
Bench,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Edvv.</hi> 3. for receiving but one poor
hundred pounds in Bribes, was for that alone, adjudged to
be hang'd, and all his Lands and Goods forfeited, and this
reason rendred for his condemnation, <hi>Becruse thereby, as
much as in him lay, he had broken the Kings Oath made unto
the people, vvhich the king had entrusted him vvithall.</hi> And
in the 11th year of <hi>Richard the second,</hi> The Lord chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>Trisilian</hi> was hanged drawn end quartered, for giving
his judgement that the king might act contrary to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Statute. And <hi>Black</hi> the kings Council, and <hi>Uske</hi> the
Unde-sheriff of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> with 5 more persons of quality
were also hagng'd for but assisting in that Case.</p>
            <p>And in the first year of Hen. 8. <hi>Empson and Dadley</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they were two of the kings privy council) were
hang'd for procuring and executing an Act of parliament,
contrary to the Fundamental Laws of the kingdom, and to
the great vexation of the people. And in the of Hen. 8.
Cardinal <hi>Woolsey</hi> was accounted guilty of High Treasor. for
endeavouring to sublert the Common Laws of the land and
to introduce the Civil <hi>Law</hi> in its stead. Divers later instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
might be given, but that it is not prudence to follow
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101532:11"/>
Truth too close at the heels, neither will it be necessary to
name more, if these are well considered; For if the Lord
Chief Justice <hi>Thorp,</hi> for receiving the Bribery of a hundred
pounds was adjudged to be hanged, as one that had made
the king break his oath to the people, how much more guilty
are they of making the king break his Coronation Oath, that
perswad him to actagainst al the laws for holding parliaments
which he is sworn to maintain? And if the Lord chief Justice
<hi>Tresilian</hi> was hanged, drawn and quartered, for advising the
king to act contrary to one Statute only, What do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that advise the king to act not only against one
statute, but against all thess antient laws and statutes of the
Realm! And if <hi>Blake</hi> the kings Council, but for assisting in
the matter, and drawing up Inditements by the kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
contrary to law, though it is likely he pleaded the
kings Order for it, his duty to do it, and that it was but <hi>pro 
forma,</hi> what he did, yet if he was hang'd, drawn and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd
for that, what Justice is due to them that assist in the
total destruction of all the Laws of the Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if
<hi>Uske</hi> (the Under-Sheriffe, whose Office tis to execute the
laws) for but in deavouring to aid <hi>Tresilian, Blake</hi> and their
accomplices, against one single Statute, was also with 5 more
hang'd drawn and quartered, what punishment do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that ayd and endeavour the subversion of no less than
all the laws of the kingdom? Nay, if <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi>
tho they had an Act of Parliament on their side, yet that act
being against the known laws of the land, were hang'd as
Traitors for putting that statute in execution, and if <hi>Woolsey</hi>
was accounted guilty of high Treason for endeavouring to
exchange the laws of <hi>England</hi> for the Civil laws? How great
must be your condemnation, and of how much sorer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must you be judged worthy if you shall but endeavour
to sit and act as a Parliament upon this prorogation? For
you have not only no law to plead, as <hi>Dudley</hi> and <hi>Empson</hi>
had, but are directly contrary to all our laws, of every kind:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101532:12"/>
And you will thereby not onely atempt to exchange our
lawes, as <hi>Woolsey</hi> did, but to put us into a state of no law
at all.</p>
            <p>Having thus faithfully discharged our duty, and layd
yours before you, that through no inadvertency you may
be surprised we have done. Not at all doubting the issue
thereof; for, if it be his Majesties honour and true intrest to
keep the lawes, he hath so solemnly sworn and protested to
do, as assuredly it is; we have no Reason to doubt him,
And if those worthy patriots in the lords house whose names
can never be mentioned, with that Honor, they deserve
from the people did desire to addrese to his Majesty fifteen
months agoe for the Parliaments dissolution, and since, all
the resons that moved them thereto at that time, do still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
and that this main reason is now also added That this
parliament can sit and Act no more as a parliament without
the total subversion of the laws, and the very constitution of
the Government of <hi>England</hi> we have no reason to doubt the
lords.</p>
            <p>And if the Commons shall but consider from whence and
for what end they received their trust we have no cause at
all to doubt them neither, for certainely among them as well
as among the lords, are a greater number of persons of honor
wisdom and fortune, then of those that are Indigent of all,
and that will think with themselves, that if not above halfe
the people of <hi>England</hi> are represented by them, and that
two thirds of that halfe that are represented are weary of
their siting and desirous of their dissolution, and that 5. Parts
of 6 do believe they can never more legaly sit as a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that sixth seem doubtful; And since that worthy
part of the Commons, can get nothing to themselves in
particular by sitting, and that if 5, 10, or 20 years hence,
they should by another parliament be found to have usurped
the legislative power of <hi>England,</hi> to the Ruine of our lawes,
and the destructon of the people, they would be sure to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101532:12"/>
it, with no less then their Lives and Fortunes; and since
if they should presume to fit so many person of quality, are
resolved not to pay any taxes, or obey any other of their acts
without first trying their validity by due process of Law. And
what pleasure or aduantage his Majesty can take, or they
themselvs can have, in their sitting as a perliament, when their
very Jurisdiction is like to be questioned in all the Courts of
<hi>England?</hi> And whether it be likely that <hi>English Juries</hi> should
find against their neighbours and therin against themselves,
to uphold a parliament that hath so many yeares imposed
it self upon them, contrary to their desire, And that <hi>novv is
Legally dissovled,</hi> we leave to themselves to Judge.</p>
